Reconciling Physics and Cosmology\nThe combined principles of quantum theory and special relativity,\ni\n\ni\n\ntwo cornerstones of modern physics, imply that the creation of matter must\noccur simultaneously with the creation of antimatter, This is true in the\nsame way that the construction of a closed curve divides a simply connected\nsurface into an inside and an outside. As is the case generally in\nastrophysics, it is both natural and logical to extend this princir\'e of\ntheoretical and laboratory physics by extrapolating its validity to all\nother parts of the Universe in order to construct a coherent and rational\n\n44\npicture of the Universe and its development. This motivation, among others,\nleads to the consideration of the matter-antimatter symmetric (or baryon\nsymmetric) cosmologies which we will discuss here.\nOn the other hand, there is\nantimatter on a cosmic scale\t\n\nno direct\n\nevidence for the existence of\n\n( possible indirect evidence exists which\n\nwe will discuss later,) Except for the possible detection of one candidate\nantinucleus in the cosmic radiation 1 , only upper limits exist from experiments to detect the existence of antimatter in the cosmic radiation.\nThese upper limits appear to rule out the existence of large-scale\ni\n\namounts of antimatter at least within about 10 3 to i.0 4 light-years of the\nsun\'s position in the Galaxy, given the evidence that the overwhelming\nbulk of the cosmic-radiation is galactic in origin \t\n\n2-4\n\nThey are also\n\ni\n\nconsistent with a possible small extragalactic flux of cosmic-rays5\nwhich may have a substantial antimatter component. Observations of the\namount of cosmic galactic and background Y-radiation 4,6 as compared with\nexpected fluxes from the annihilation of mater and antimatter indicate\n\nit\n\nthat matter and antimatter, if they exist in equal amounts on a universal\n\nI\t\n\na\n\n3\nscale, are most probably separated into domains of the scale of\nclusters of galaxies. The generation and evolution of such a domain\n\n.\nstructure thus becomes an important aspect of a baryon-symmetric\ncosmology7\'9,10,\nWe thus come to one of the key questions of cosmology, i.e., how\ndo we reconcile the symmetry of the matter-antimatter creation process\nwith the apparent lack of evidence for antimatter on a large scale, at\nleast in our corner of the Universe? Possible indirect evidence for\nthe existence of antimatter on a cosmic scale must also be considered\n11,12\nin this context as well as other aspects of baryon symmetric cosmology.\n20 Universal Versus Local Matter-Antimatter Asymmetry:\n\nDomain Structure\nThere are basically three scenariosfor reconciling the physics of\nsymmetric particle production processes with the lack of matter-antimatter\nsymmetry on a local astronomical scale.\nI. One may postulate that there was initially, at the\nbeginning of the big bang, a global or universal matter antimatter asymmetry.\nThis imbalance amounted initially to a excess of matter over antimatter\nby a very small, but nonvanishing amount of roughly one part in 109.\nThen, in the early, dense stages of the big-bang, all the matter and\nantimatter annihilated with the exception of the matter excess which\nbecame the present matter content of the universe. The radiation resulting\nfrom the annihilation was cooled as the universe expanded and is now\nobserved as the 3K microwave blackbody radiation. This scenario, which\nI will refer to as the partially symmetric bid-bang (PSBB) is the view\nmost widely held at present. It relegates all symmetry problems to a\n\n1\n\ni\n\n-4\t\n\n-\'\t\n\n^-\t\n\nv\n\n4\npostulated Initial condition outside the context of everyday physics.\n(This may be analogous, in the metaphor of a curve dividing a surface,\nto a curve on the surface of a torus which can be constructed so that\nthere is no inside and outside, this because of the global properties of the\nsystem.)\nII.\n\nThere existed, as an initial condition, localized regions or\n\nI\n\ndomains in which there was an initial excess of matter over antimatter\nand other domains in which there was an excess of antimatter over matter.9\n1\t\n\n^\n\nThese domains would have to have been too large to have been produced\nH\n\nby statistical fluctuations or else total annihilation would have\nsubsequently occurred as the universe evolved, 13,14\nIII.\n\nThe universe started out in an extremely dense, very high\n\ntemperature state in a homogeneous condition with zero net baryon\n\nd\n\nnumber (matter-antimatter symmetry). Such a state would be naturally\narrived at, e.g., in theoretical models where matter is created in\nparticle-antiparticle pairs from fluctuations in the space-time metric\nof the universe when it was in this compact state (See, e.g., refs. 15\nand 16 and refs. therein). One then examines and attempts to describe\nprocesses in which the universe evolves in a way which is consistent\n\ni\n\nwith and indeed dictated by the laws of physics at extreme energies\n(i.e. temperatures) and den3it les fol lowed by further evolution at lower\ntemperatures and densities until a global or domain structure is arrived\nat which is in accord with observational cosmology.\nThe construction of Scenario III is a prodigious task, indeed one\nwhich would probably of necessity require many small steps by many workers.\nI\n\ni\n\nHowever, this is the most philosophically satisfactory scenario to follow\n\n\t\n\n5\n\nf\n\nsince it is the only one which offers the potential for new cosmological\ndiscoveries employing recent advances in particle physics. It offers\nthe hope of maximizing our understanding of the evolution of the universe\nas a consequence of natural processes, recognizing that such an evolution\nis a complex process as indicated by the large amount of structure existing\nin the universe (galaxies, clusters of galaxies, etc.). It is within\nthe spirit and faith of Einstein regarding natural laws, that Nature is\nsubtle but not malicously capricious or esoteric, "Raffiniert ist der\nHerrgott,aber boshaft ist er nicht".\nAlso, in the context of this scenario other important cosmological\n,\nproblems may be resolved. Given a universe with postulated or arbitrary\nboundary conditions, it is difficult to understand why the 3K microwave\nbackground appears to be so uniform over a large scale. As we look\nout over the sky in different directions with our radio telescopes, we\nare looking at parts of the universe which were not in causal contact\nwith each other when the interactions which thermali ed this radiation\nceased. Indeed, they were not in contact up to that time since they\nwere separated by distances such that the light travel time between them\nwas greater than the age of the universe during tl.ose epochs. The isotropy\nof the background radiation then becomes enigmatic unless that background\nwas generated by natural physical processes which follow the same\nevolutionary track starting from an initially simple state without\narbitrary initial conditions,as in Scenario III.\nMother important problem concerns the evolution of structure in the\nuniverse. Such evolution can be more easily understood in the context\nof a matter-antimatter domain structure evolving out of a phase transition\n7,10,17\nfrom a homogeneous state in the early universe.\n\ni\n\n3. Other Suggestions for Baryon-Symmetric Cosmologies\n\nThe types of cosmological evolutionary models which conform to\nthe program outlined in Scenario ITI we will refer to as baryon\nsymmetric big-bang (BSBB) cosmologies as opposed to the standard PSBB\ncosmology. Other types of initially baryon symmetric cosmologies have\nbeen suggested, those being unsatisfactory in one way or another. We\nmention them here briefly before going on to a more extensive discussion\n\nBSBB cosmologies.\nf\t\n\nThe first suggestion was made by Coldhaber 18 . lie suggested that initially\nthe universe consisted of a single particle, the "universon" which\nthen split into a "cosmos" and an "anticosmon". Aside from not accounting\nfor the 3K radiation (which was unknown at the time) and the lack of a basis\nfor such a process in particle theory, this suggestion is really tantamount\nto assuming an initial condition of all haryons in the universe, since\nthe "anticosmon" universe has no observable consequences.\nVariants of the steady state cosmology 1 which have the general\ndrawbacks of steady state cosmology (e.g., cannot account for the 3K\nbackground), also have other unsatisfactory aspects. Either onl y matter\nis created or mutter and antimatter are created separately in widely\nseparated regions (violation of conservation of haryon number, i.e.,\ni\n\n\t\n\nasymmetry in the creation process) or matter and antimatter are created\ntogether in regions of high density such as galaxy nuclei. in the later\ncase, the amount of annihilation y-radiation expected would far exceed that\nobserved unless the regions where creation occurs are opaque to )-radiation20.\nIn this case, however, it is difficult to see how matter and antimatter\never underwent a large-scale separation in thr [first place in order to\nform the galactic nuclei in w\'.,ich continuous creation is postulated\nto he occurring.\nI\n\n=f\n\nWe\t next come\t to the\t cosmology of Alfven and Klein\n\n21.\t\n\nIn the Alfven-\n\nKlein cosmology, the observable universe began as a diffuse "metagalaxy"\nconsisting\t\n\nof equal amounts of matter and antimatter in an "ambiplasma"\n\nwhose ingredients are then separated by the combined effects\n\nof gravitation\n\nand gradients in electromagnetic fields. There are many problems with this\ngnneral picture. The picture requires that the metagal.axy gravitationally\ncollapses until it reaches a c r itical density where the radiation pressure\n{\nfrom annihilation causes it to bounce and expand in accord with the Hubble\nlaw. However, detailed jynamical calculations showed that for the estimated\n\nii\ntotal observable mat--s in the univer?e, gravitational forces will overwhelm annihilation pressure and this "bounce" will never occur. 22 Other\nproblems with Alfven-Klein cosmology are, again, the lack of explanation\nfor the 3K background and also insufficient separation of matter and\nantimatter at present. In the Alfven-Klein scenario, half of our Galaxy\nwould be antimatter and a much higher than observed -y-ray background\nwould be produced by annihilation.\nWithin the context of big-bang cosmology, various asym,ietric\nprocesses of particle production and decay or destruction have been\nsuggested as a way of producing a present global baryon asymmetry. It has\nbeen argued 15 that asymmetries in possible production processes\n\n23,24\n\nwill\n\nnot necessarily lead to a global bar y on as y mmetry since, in therm:,l equilibrium\nin a dense high temperature initial state, the inverse processes having\nthe opposite asymetry will occur with equal \t\n\nfrequency. It has been\n\nspeculated that CP-violatIng weak decays of certain types of particles, if\nsuch postulated particles played a prominent role in the initial stage\nof the big-bang, might produce an asymmetry of the order of maf;nitude\n\nr\t\n\nI\ntis 4\t\n\n4\n\n40.\n\nI\n\n8\n\n1\n\n(10-9) needed in the PSBB cosmology 24.\n!\t\n\nVarious people have suggested that since baryon number is not\nnecessarily conserved when matter falls down a black hole, such\nprocesses could account for a universal baryon asymmetry. Hoiever,\n\n1\n\nblack holes are not selective and they will ingest matter and antimatter\n\xe2\x80\xa2. \'.th equal voracity in a universe which is initially baryon symmetric!\nParticle Physics, Phase Transitions and Domain Structure in\n^ \tBSBB\nI\nI\t\n\nCosmology\n\'Me evolutionary program which the Universe should follow according\n\nfto Scenario III, in order to arrive at a permanent matter - antimatter domain\ni\n\nstructure consistent with observational data, was first outlined by Omnes\n(Rol 10 and references lherein). According to this scheme, when the Universe\n\nwas above a critical c.emperature and when its density wa:: above a critical\nvalue, a phase trans `ion occurred, creating a structure in which there are\ni\t\n\ndomains containing; mostly matter (positive baryon number) and domains\nhaving negative net baryon number (motitl y antimatter). Subsequent,\nannihilation pressuretended to coalesce regions of like baryon number\nby pushing; apart regions of unlike bar y on number. \'M is process Is similar\nto the Leidenfrost effect as first discussed in the conLuxt of the Alfven-\n\nI\n\nKlein cosmology.\n\n21\n\nOne of the important questions in BSBB cosmology can\n\nthen be stated as follows: \'Aiat kind of phase transition can occur at the\nHighest temperatures and densities as implied b y present (and future) high\nenergy physics?\nOmnes\' approach has been to use theoretical and experimental information\nabout nucleon-antinucleon scattering; properties to derive a relation giving\nthe free energy for a :-ystem of nucleons and antinucleons \t interacting, with\neach other\t in\t thermal eq uilibrium at a given temperature and density.\n\nThe\n\nI!\n\ni\ni\n\n1\n\nf -\t\n\ni\n\n9\n\nrelation for the free energy as a function of net baryon number is obtained\nusing a formula derived by Dashen, Ma and Bernstein\n\n25\n\nwho generalized\n\nthe formalism originally given by Beth and Uhlenbeck 26 to express the free\nenergy of a system of strongly interacting particles in terms of observed\nscattering phase shifts, The treatment of Omnes then indicated that the\nfree energy of a gas of strongly interacting nucleons and anti-nucleons\nis minimized above a certain critical density when a phase separation occurs.\nThese calculations were also supported in other independent work. 27,28\nA key concept of the Omnes model is that the bound states of the ,aucleonantinucleon system behave like mesons with the appropriate quantum numbers.\nIn this "lattice gas" type model, a nucleon and an antinucleon at high\nenough densities such that they are both placed within a cell of size\n..,1 fermi, look like a meson. However, the number density of mesons is\n1\t\n\ndetermined by statistical equilihrium at temperature T so that there is\na statistical exclusion principle acting to keep nucleons and\nantinucleons from occupying the same cell. No such principle applies to\nlike species of baryons. The result is an effective repulsion for nucleons\nand antinucleons. In that situation, it has been shown that a phase separation\nshould occur.\n\n29,30\n\nFurthermore, the free energy of the system per unit volume\n\nis proportional to the ratio of surface area to volume of the domains so\nthat the domains tend to grow to minimize this ratio. The effect is similar\nto the coalescence of soap bubbles. 31 The most extensive work to date on\nthe "Leidenfrost" coalescence process is that of Aldrovandi et al. and 32\nAly et al.\ni\t\n\n33\n\nElectrg magnetic and gravitational coalescence processes- 1,\n\nnay, of course, combine with the Leidenfrust process to provide a suhstantiall y more efficient coalescence its the universe evol ,, t \xe2\x80\xa2 -\n\n1\n\nCris ma y be partic-\n\n\t\n\n{\t\n\n10\nularly important in reconciling some aspects of BSBB with observa-\n\nt\n\ntional\n\n3at.a,as\n\nwill be discussed, in the Omnes mode1 10 , the observed\n\nratio is derived from the physical processes involved\nOther types of baryon-antibaryon phase transitions in the early\nbig-bang have \'een suggested 35,16 . In particular, Etim et a1,36\nhave applied the methods used by Omnes to show that a phase t-ansition\ncan exist in the early universe using the "statistical boot-tr-ip model"\nof Hagedorn 37-39 where the number of hadrons increases exponentially\nwith mass and there exists a maximum temperature. In the work of Etim\ni\n\net al., this maximum temperature coincides with the critical temperature.\nThe development of a phase transition stemming from physical\nprocesses at high temperatures and densities, i.e., the spontaneous breaking\nof charge conjugation symmetry in the early universe, is an area which\nmay be a fertile one for future theoretical investigation using such\nnewly developed concepts as unified gauge theories, "instantons",\n\nP\n\n"supergravity" art, quantum cliromodynamics. Certainly, the full range\n!\t\n\nof modern particle physics will come into ploy in the early :universe.\n5.\n\nGalaxy Formation in\n\nB SBB Cosmo logy\n\nVarious workers have tried to trace the growth of the domains of\nmatter and antimatter from the era of Phase separation to the era marking\nthe decoupling of the matter and antimatter from the blackbody radiation\nfield.\n\n7,10,17,31-34 This takes us to a time of the order of 10 6-10 7 years\n\nafter the big-bang when the cosmic plasma was almost cool enough to combine\ninto neutral atoms. Starting at this point in the evolution of the BSBB,\nthe queation of structure and galaxy forrkation arises. Models of galaxy\ni\n\nformation from "primordial turbulence . " leave always been attractive as a\nway of accounting for galaxy formation as .ell as for observed parameters\n\nAL\nAr-\n\n11\nsuch as the angular momenta and spatial distribution of galaxies40-49\nHowever, in this work, turbulence was introduced in an ad hoc manner\nand, furthermore, such turbulence is strongly damped out in the cosmic\nplasma because of the very high viscosity of the blackbody radiation\nfield which remains coupled ^.o the cosmic plasma until the neutralization\n("recombination") epoch. Severr.l years ago, Stecker and Puget ? proposed\na model for galaxy formation within the context of BSBB cosmology. In\n4\n\n.\nt:\'. r model, dissipation is constantly fought by continuing radiation\n-,r,-,sure from annihilations on the boundaries of domains which regenerates\nthe turbulence, Radiation pressure from the annihilation, being\ndirected generally away `rom the boundary regions, can drive mass fluid\nmotions of cne domains as well as causing further coalescence until the\ndo .dins reach the size of galaxy clusters.\nAt the recombination epoch, two important changes were caused\nin the cosmic fluid mLcions. The viscosity dropped drastically an:!\nthe turbulent fluid motions became supersonic. Th.\'s occurred because\nthe sound speed dropped sharply from its value in the cosmic plasma of\n3 1/2 c (because the momentum was transferred by radiation) to the\nthermal velocity of the neutral gas. Thus, whereas the cosmic plasma\nbehaved as a viscous inc mpressible fluid, both "small-scale" turbulence\nand density fluctuatt)ns could start to build up in the decoupled\n\natomic fluid , nd later contract to form galax y !s. Ilie Stecker-Puget model\nthus resemble- proposals on galaxy formation dating back to von WeiszUcker40\nand Camow 41 with the significant difference that in the BSBB scenario\nannihilation pressure can provide a continuous source of generating\nturbulence. nie basic results and concepts of the Stecker-Puget model\n\n-- -\n\n- -^-_t_\t\n\n12\nhave found support in later work by Dallaporta et al. 17\n6. Observational Consequences of BSBB Cosmolo\nOne of the most significant consequences of BSBB cosmology lies\nin the production of an observable cosmic background of\n\ny- radiation\n\nfrom the decay of n\xc2\xb0-mesons produced in nucleon-antinucleon annihilations\nthroughout the history of the universe. \t\n\nThis is also perhaps at present\n\nthe most encouraging aspect of BSBB cosmology since it satisfactorily\nexplains the observed energy spectrum of the cosmic background\n\ny- radiation\n\nas no other proposed mechanism does 12,50-55\nFigure 1 shows the observational data on the y-ray background spectrum\nas compiled in Refs. 11 and 52 as well as that recently given by Fichtel\net al.\n\n54\n\nand Trombka et al.\n\n56\n\nData of Makino 57 are not shown but are in\n\nagreement with other data. The dashed line marked X is an extrapolation\nof the data from the x-ray range\n\n56;58\n\n_ The theoretical curve marked\n\n"annihilation" is the annihilation spectrum calculated using the method\nof Stecker et al., but adopting a mean present universal gas density of\n3x10 7 cm 3 (Ref. 53) and a Hubble constant H o = 50km/s/Mpc. This corresponds\nto a value of\n\nQ\t\n\n0.1 where Q is the ratio of the mass of the universe\n\nto that needed to gravitationally close the universe. The density adopted\nhere fits the more recent revised Apollo data\nof 10-5 cm- 3 originally used by Stecker et al. \t\n\n56\n\nbetter than the value\nIt is interesting to note\n\nthat the values of H o and 0 used in Ref. 53 are more in line with present\nobservational evidence regarding thesa parameters.

The neutrino background spectrum in the energy range 1-50MeV should be similar in shape\nand intensity to that of the background y-radiation. However, because\nof the small interaction cross section of these neutrinos, their detection\nat present is not feasible.\nS{milar detection problems face the proposal of Cramer and Braithwaite 63\nwho pe .ted out that radiation from antimatter supernovae may show some\ncircular polarization opposite to that of matter supernovae.\nIf the detection of an antinucleus in the cosmic radiation, as has\nbeen suggested l , could be confirmed in the future, it would probably\nestablish BSBB cosmology.\nAnuther observational consequence of BSBB cosmology is the expected\ndistortion of the 3K microwave blackbody radiation (e.g., Ref. 64 and\nreferences therein). An analysis of the observations of the 3K background\nby Field and Perrenod 65 indicates that there is a distortion at the 90%\nconfidence level. This will. be discussed further in the next section.\n7. Problems Concerning BSBB Cosmology\nTwo areas of particular concern have been discussed concerning BSBB\ncosmology, viz , distortion of the 3K background radiation and nucleosynthesis of helium. Two types of distortion of the 3K background are\nexpected to occur: 1I) Distortion owing to bremsstrahlun;; radiation of\nsuprathermal electrons which affects the Rayleigtr.leans part of the 3K\nspectrum and (2) distortion from Thomson scattering after the decoupling\n\n_\t\n\nwy\t\n\n1\n\n4\n\ni. I\n\nM, 1\n\n14\n\t\ne\n\nepoch which affects the Wien part of the spectrum. The Rayleigh-Jeans\npart of the spectrum is affected by annihilation taking place when most\nof the energy dansity in the universe was in the form of radiation, long\nbefore neutralization of the cosmic plasma and galaxy formation,and it is\ndifficult to determine the precise amount of annihilation to expect at this\nremote epoch; it depends on the details of the coalescence process.\nExtrapolation of the r ray background data would indicate that possibly\nas much as 99.999% of the annihilation may have taken place before the\nRayleig}rJeans distortion epoch whereas calculations 66 would put a lower\nlimit of 96.5-99% on this value. Thus, there is no critical conflict\nbetween model and observation on this point, although Ramani and Puget 67\nhave concluded that for the specific coalescence model of Aldrovandi et al. 32\ntaken alone, there may be a conflict unless SdE;0.01.\nThe Wien (or high frequency) distortion from electron-photon scattering,\nsometimes referred to as comptonization, has been treated in various papers 67-70\nRefs. 68 and 69 conclude that the high frequency distortion predicted by\nthe Stecker-Puget model is not in conflict with the observations. The\ncalculations of Ramani and Puget 6 , when cumbined with the analysis of\nField and Perrenod 65,imply consistency only for QC,0.22 (Ref. 12), consistent\nwith the value of 0.1 used t., "it the -y-ray background observations. The\n\nwork of Jones and Steigm.-.in 70 Indicates that there is no conflict. between \t\n\ni\n\nthe coalescence model of Aldrovan di et a1. ` and the analysis of Field\n1\t\n\nand Perrenod 65 , however, these authors conclude that the Stecker-Puget\nI\n\n\t\n\t\n\n1\n\nturbulence model leads to distortions in conflict with observation. Further\n\t\nanalysis of subtleties not taken account of in the original work of Stecker\nand Puget may help resolve some of the difficulties. For one thing, in the\n\nj^\n\nV\ni\n\n15\nannihilation process, photons are created and not Just scattered so\n4\n\nthat at least partial thermalization may result. Phis is not taken\naccount of in the work of .tones and Steigm:an. \'There is also the\nquestion of what percentage of annihilation energy is "fossilized" in mass\nmotion versus that dissipated. On the other hand, the ariginal SteckerPuget model may have overestimated the role of ,annihilation generated\nturbulence in the galaxy formation process. Although the mechanism may\n\nprovide a key trigger, mass perturbat ions and the effects of subsequent\ngravitational and magnetic fields, not fully considered in the original\nd\n\nmodel, may well play a priminent role. However, the overall scale of\nstructure: as given by the Stecker-Paget model, seems to be supported b y a\n1\t\n\nrecent analysis of the spatial distribution of galaxies. 71\nWe next come to the nucleosynthesis problem. It has been concluded\nthat within the context of the Omnes coalescence model, IlUcleosylathesis\ncannot take place in the BSBB.72,73 This is because at the time nucleo-\n\nsynthesis would occur, the mean size of coalesced domains would be smal Irr\nthan the neutron diffusion length for escape from the domains. Thu::,\nthe neutrons would be annihilated before they can participate in tlar\nnucleosynthesis process. There are two ways around this :apparent\ndifficulty: (1) If the coalescence process is more efficient than the\ninitial work indicated (see section 4), the size of the resulting domains\ncould be l:)rger than the neutron diffusion length.

In this short conceptual review, it has only\n\nf\n\nbeen possible to touch briefly and qualitatively on these areas. However,\nit is hoped that the reader will now have some better feeling for this\npresently unorthodox but exciting and potentially vastly rewarding field\nof modern astrophysical cosmology.\n\ni\n\n1\n\n-jig\n\nIl\n17\n\n1.\n\nHagstrom, R.

Abstract\nThe framework of baryon-symmetric big-bang (BSBB) cosmology offers\nour greatest potential for deducing the evolution of the universe as a\nconsequence of physical laws and processes with the minimum number of\narbitrary assumptions as to initial conditions in the big-bang. \t\nIn\naddition,\t it offers the possibilit y of explaining the photon-baryon\nratio in the universe and how galaxies and galaxy clusters are formed.\nBSBB cosmology also provides the only acceptable explanation at present\nfor the origin of the cosmic y-ray background radiation.\n\n17.
