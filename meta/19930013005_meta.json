This was accomplished by modifying a conventional scanning tunneling microscope. The fine-wire probe that is used to image surface topography was replaced with a flexible magnetic probe. Images obtained with these probes reveal both the surface topography and the magnetic structure. We have made a thorough theoretical analysis of the interaction between the probe and the magnetic fields emanating from a typical recorded surface. Quantitative data about the constituent magnetic fields can then be obtained. We have employed these techniques in studies of two of the most important issues of magnetic record: data overwrite and maximizing data-density. These studies have shown: (1) overwritten data can be retrieved under certain conditions; and (2) improvements in data-density will require new magnetic materials. In the course of these studies we have developed new techniques to analyze magnetic fields of recorded media. These studies are both theoretical and experimental and combined with the use of our magnetic force scanning tunneling microscope should lead to further breakthroughs in the field of magnetic recording.", "title": "Tunneling magnetic force microscopy", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T17:58:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19930013005, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Burke, Edward R."}, "organization": {"name": "Laboratory for Physical Sciences", "location": "College Park, MD, United States"}}, "id": "7240b9687d654a12849d38df9876d10a"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19930013005, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Gomez, Romel D."}, "organization": {"name": "Maryland Univ.", "location": "College Park., United States"}}, "id": "45dfdf05b71244b58b69dd8df865ab66"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19930013005, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Adly, Amr A."}, "organization": {"name": "Maryland Univ.", "location": "College Park., United States"}}, "id": "d9b793e74ee94b229f873e983495c097"}, {"sequence": 3, "submissionId": 19930013005, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Mayergoyz, Isaak D."}, "organization": {"name": "Maryland Univ.", "location": "College Park., United States"}}, "id": "66a6947492364fa9aa2d38c3d336ad84"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19930013005, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19930013005, "id": "1d5ce591d39641fe83fca72feeb47ccf", "publicationName": "NASA, Washington, Technology 2002: The Third National Technology Transfer Conference and Exposition, Volume 2", "publicationDate": "1993-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19930012960, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Technology 2002: The Third National Technology Transfer Conference and Exposition, volume 2", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19930013005.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19930013005/downloads/19930013005.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19930013005/downloads/19930013005.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19930013005/downloads/19930013005.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
