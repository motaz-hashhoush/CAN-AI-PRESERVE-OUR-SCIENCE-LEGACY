All the major\nsatellites in orbit and those being developed have, o r will have, the capability of responding to instructions sent from the earth. They can be instructed to change their rotational axis, to alter\npower distribution, to turn on and turn off experiments on board the satellite, and to transmit data\nto earth. Satellites as early as the Vanguard series had basic command reception capabilities.\nCurrent satellites, by virtue of their increased payload and the complex experiments they are\nequipped to perform, require elaborate command systems; these must distinguish between the\nsatellites orbiting the earth, command them to perform various sequences, or call for corrections\nof different spacecraft subsystems when critical situations arise. The ability to control satellites\nby transmitted commands adds to their versatility and enables them to have a longer, and more\nproductive data-collection lifetime. Experimental results can be examined over a longer time;\nscientists can call for specific experiments at prearranged intervals. The power sources servicing\nthe satellite can be regulated to conserve energy when the transmission of experimental data is\nnot required.\nCommand Centers have been established at Goddard Space Flight Center for the different\nsatellite projects. These centers schedule and control the commands issued from ground stations.\nUnder their control, a satellite may be referenced several times a day, or, in the event of system\nemergencies, referenced rapidly during short intervals.\nThe switching of experiments in a satellite affects the continuity of the telemetry data. Since\nprocessing these data is based upon knowledge of how they are structured, i.e., commutated during\ntransmission, it is necessary to account for all times at which experiments have been activated by\ncommands sent to the satellite. In order to identify such times, a standard format is generated by\ntime encoders, and recorded along with telemetry data and commands whenever a field station\ntracks the satellite.\nWhen data processing is performed, the recorded commands a r e correlated with the time and\nsatellite data, in order to identify different experiments and satellite conditions. A s a result,\ntelemetry data can be edited and decommutated, and changes can be ascertained.\n\n1\n\nSatellite command decoding for data processing is a relatively new field of endeavor at Goddard\nSpace Flight Center. The implementation of the decoding devices and subsequent data processing\nof all command information for the GSFC scientific satellites is handled by the Information Processing Division of the Center.\nThis paper is a discussion of the equipment that is used to perform this command\nprocessing.\n\nThree command decoders have been designed and developed by the Data Processing Branch of\nthe Information Processing Division of Goddard Space Flight Center. These systems process commands used to control the OGO, POGO, 0 0 AE-B, and BIOS satellites, as well as commands for\n9,\nother satellites that use command structures specified by Goddard Space Flight Center standards.\nEach system is built differently. The varying design criteria of the systems w e r e based on the\ncommand formats used and on data-processing requirements. At present, three standard formats\na r e in use: the Tone Command Standard, the Tone-Digital Command Standard, and the Pulse Code\nModulation (PCM) Command Standard. They a r e briefly reviewed below.\nTone commands consist of discrete frequency bursts that first address a satellite and\nthen command it to execute an operation. Address tones a r e unique for any individual satellite;\nexecute tones a r e the same for all satellites employing the standard tone command format.\nTone-digital commands a r e pulse-duration-modulated signals that represent binary-coded\nwords. A command is composed of from two to five words; a satellite must recognize, out of\nthis command, one valid combination of address and execute words in order to respond. PCM\ncommands are the most elaborate of the three types. They consist of two frequencies that a r e\nkeyed on and off to construct a binary configuration. Another, modulating frequency is used\nfor data synchronization. The PCM command word structure is composed of synchronization,\naddress, and command data.\nThe first command processor w a s built to process PCM and tone commands for OGO satellites.\nIt can decode commands while satellite data a r e being processed on an associated telemetry datareduction system. The output of the command processor consists of printouts of commands and\nNASA standard time. A second system w a s constructed to process tone commands for the AE-B\nsatellite and tone-digital commands for the 0 0 satellite. A future processing requirement of the\n9\nsystem will be to decode tone-digital commands for the BIOS series of satellites. The system\noutput consists of command, time, and identification data written on magnetic tape for use by COMputers for command and data comparison. The third system w a s developed to process PCM commands for OGO satellites, and tone commands f o r any satellite using the standard tone-command\nformat. The system can be adapted for simultaneous processing with a telemetry data reduction\nsystem and can also be used for real-time processing. Its output is from a card punch o r a printer\nand consists of commands, NASA standard time, and necessary identification data.\n2\n\n111. GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CENTER COMMAND FORMATS\nCommand standards have been established by Goddard Space Flight Center for three types of\ncommand formats, They are the Tone Command Standard, the Tone-Digital Command Standard,\nand the Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) Command Standard. The command processing systems to be\ndiscussed in this article have been developed to process commands adhering to these standards.\nThe three types of commands a r e being used o r will be used for ground control on nearly 80 satellites from 18 different projects.\n\nTone Commands\nThe predominant command format used is that of the tone command. It is the primary command source for most satellites and is also used in a secondary backup capacity and for emergency commanding with other satellites. The tone commands are used for situations where only\na few commands a r e required. A command encoder at a field station generates a series of discrete tone bursts (Figure 1) which are detected by a decoder in a satellite. Once the command is\ndecoded, a specified function is performed in the spacecraft.\nA tone command consists of an address tone (which is always the same for a given satellite)\nand one, two, o r three execute tones in sequence with it. An address tone signals the satellite decoder to arm itself; then the execute tones initiate the required function. Tone bursts can be from\n0.5 seconds in duration, in increments of 0.5 second, up to 3.5 seconds. The duration is constant\nfor each command sequence. The interval between the tone bursts in a command sequence is 0.5\nseconds. At the present time, 22 discrete frequencies have been assigned, 14 a address tones and\ns\n8 as execute tones. The execute tones may be used in any order of permutation. The audio frequency range from which the tones have been designated is from 1 to 7 kHz.\n\nk\n\n0\n\n.\n\n5 S\n\nE\n\nC\n\nt\n\nO\n\n.\n\n5 S E C A\n\nFigure\n\n1-Tone command format.\n\nPCM Instruction Command System\nThe Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) Instruction, because of its large command repertoire, is\nused when control over many spacecraft activities is needed. The PCM command signal (Figure 2)\nis frequency-shift-keyed to change the bit-weight coding. It is frequency-modulated by switching\nbetween two specified frequencies in a 7- to 9-kHzband. A bit-synchronization signal, used for\nbit-rate timing, is 50-percent amplitude-modulated onto the subcarrier frequencies which represent\na binary one o r a binary zero.\n3\n\n64 BITS\n\n-\n\n1\n\n- 500 MS\n-\n\n128 Hz\n\n-\n\n0\n\n1\n\nFigure\n\n2-PCM\n\ncommand format.\n\nThe word length of a PCM command is 64 bits, with a maximum of 46 command-data bits and\na minimum of 18 synchronization bits. When less than 46 bits a r e used for command data, the\nunused bits are considered as synchronization bits. The bit rate of current commands is 128 bits\nper second. A minimum of 13 zero bits precede a command word to initiate bit synchronization,\nfollowed by a single one bit to indicate that a command word field is commencing. Inside the word\nlength of 64 bits is the command word field, which is variable in length and can be located from\nthe 15th to the 60th bit positions. The remaining positions contain the synchronization bits. An\nexample of this is the O W command format. It uses bits 15 through 30 as the command word\nfield, with the upper eight bits used as an address and the remaining eight bits used for the command function. The commands can be assigned from an octal numbering range of 000 to 377,\nwhich gives the PCM command system 256 different commands.\n\nTone-Digital Commands\nThe Tone-Digital Command System is used by satellites with approximately 70 functions to be\nperformed. It was developed primarily for simple, real-time, turn-on, and turn-off commands\nfor satellites.\nTone-digital commands are pulse-duration-modulated (PDM) signals (Figure 3). The commands consist of a series of five words, each one composed of a synchronization period followed\nPULSE\n\n54\n\n18\n\n36\n\nWORD = 10 PULSE PERIODS = 7204cT\n1\n\nE -F\nN\nO\n\nTC = PERIOD OF ENCODER CLOCK\n\nFigure 3 - T o n e - d i g i t a l\n\n4\n\ncommand format.\n\nby eight bits of binary information and a blank period. The series contains a unique address word,\ntransmitted twice, and an execute word, transmitted three times. The redundancy feature decreases the possibility of losing the commands through noise interference during transmission. A\nsatellite will respond to any combination of one valid address word and one valid execute word in\na series.\nA pulse period, from which all timing is referenced, is made up of 72 cycles of a designated\nsubcarrier frequency. The frequency can be one of eight standard tones between 7 and 11.024 Wz.\nEach satellite utilizing the tone-digital command system is assigned a permanent frequency. The\ndurations of the pulse states a r e 100-percent off for a blank, 75-percent on for a synchronization\nperiod, 50-percent on for a binary one, and 25-percent on for a binary zero. These percentages\na r e with respect to the pulse period defined as 72 cycles of the subcarrier frequency. The eightbit, constant-ratio, digital-command code is in the hexadecimal radix of numbers 0 through 15. An\naddress word consists of either six one bits and two zero bits, o r two one bits and six zero bits.\nThe execute word is comprised of four one bits and four zero bits.\n\nIn order to avoid unanticipated signals and spurious commands, a synchronization pulse must\nbe detected, to enable the satellite to decode address words and execute words; a word must be\nread within a specified time frame o r the satellite will not respond.\n\nIV. NASA STANDARD TIME CODES AND DECODING\nTwo types of time codes a r e used by NASA to establish the time (both in calendar units and in\nthe time of day) at which information is received from a satellite o r when commands are sent to it.\nThis time information is recorded on a magnetic tape, along with telemetry data and commands\nwhich a r e recorded at the same time on other tape tracks. The NASA standard time codes a r e\nnamed the Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) time code and the Serial Decimal (SD) time code.\n\nBCD Time Code\nThe BCD time format is a 12-character word which covers time increments from hundreds of\ndays down to units of milliseconds and includes four bits of station data for identification purposes.\nThe BCD time, generated by time encoders at the NASA field tracking stations, actually consists\nof nine characters from hundreds of days and descends to units of seconds. A millisecond count\nis generated and added to the time word by the time-decoding equipment when the magnetic tapes\nare processed. Resolution of the BCD time code is to units of milliseconds. The time-code\nsignal has the following structure: each bit of a four-bit binary-coded decimal character is determined by the number of cycles of a 1-kHz carrier frequency and the occurrence of an increase in\ncarrier signal strength. A binary one is represented by six cycles of the carrier with a three-toone amplitude increase of the signal. A binary zero is represented by two cycles of the carrier\nfrequency with a corresponding increase in amplitude. The encoded BCD time-code signal is\nshown in the lower portion of Figure 4.\n5\n\n2\nT N OF\nES\nHOURS\n\n0\nHOURS\n\nTWO P L E F R\nUSS O\nSTART OF W R\nOD\n\n,----\n\n"A"\n\nn n\n\n2\nTENS OF\nMINUTES\n\n8\nMINUTES\n\n5\nTENS OF\nSECONDS\n\n-\n\nNEXT WORD M A R K\n\nn\n\nnnn\n\nn\n\nn\n\nn\n\nTH-2\nSYNC P L E\nUS\n\nSYNC P L E\nUS\n\nIO SECONDS\nTIME AT POINT " A " = 20 HOURS, 28 MINUTES, 50 SECONDS\n\nNASA SERIAL DECIMAL TIME CODE\n3\nTENS OF MIN\n\nTENS OF DAYS\n\nNASA BCD TIME CODE\n\nFigure 4-BCD and SD time codes.\n\nSerial Decimal Time Code\nThe SD time code (upper portion of Figure 4) encoded and recorded at the field stations consists of five time characters. They a r e tens of hours, units of hours, tens of minutes, units of\nminutes, and tens of seconds. Serial Decimal time has a resolution to one second, but this can be\nimproved to one millisecond by using a linearizing frequency that is recorded at the same time.\nThe linearizing is derived from the oscillator that develops the time-code frequency pulses.\n\nTime Decoding\nThe time decoders incorporated in the command processor systems have various methods of\ndecoding and processing the time codes. They all place a stored time word in an output register\nfrom which it can be extracted when requestkd. Readouts of time are made after any millisecond\npreceding the time. This requirement is placed upon the system because command data is processed randomly and a time word must be ready for extraction at all times. A time reading is requested from the time decoders and is read into the time-storage area of the command processors\nevery time a command is processed. Time decoding is further discussed under "OGO Command\nDecoder System" below.\n\nV. 060 COMMAND DECODER SYSTEM\nThe OGO Command Decoder System consists of an analog magnetic tape reproducer to insert\ncommands and NASA standard time, the OGO command decoder (Figure 5) and a STARS time\n6\n\nFigure 6-STARS\n\ntime decoder.\n\ndecoder (Figure 6) to process the input signals, and two data-logging\nprinters to produce an output of six BCD command characters and\nnine BCD time characters. The time decoder is shared with a\nSTARS, Phase I processor, so that telemetry data processing and\ncommand processing can be performed simultaneously.\n\nFigure 5-OGO\n\ncommand decoder.\n\nThe first command decoder w a s developed to process the two\ncommand formats assigned to the OGO satellites; it thereby derives its name, the "OGO Command Decoder." The PCM and tonecommand formats are used to instruct the satellite, and the decoder\ncircuits handle specific types of commands within these formats.\n\nSince the OGO Command Decoder System was developed specifically for the OGO satellite command format, its circuits detect and process PCM commands with binary-number states represented\nby an 8.0-kHz frequency for a logical zero and an 8.6-kHz frequency for a logical one. These\nbinary representations a r e frequency-shift-keyed at a 128-Hz rate to obtain bit synchronization.\nSixty-four bits sent for each PCM command contain 16 relevant bits that a r e extracted during OGO\ncommand decoding operations. Eight of these bits represent an address of a particular satellite;\n7\n\nthe other eight bits represent the specific command to be executed. The number range for both\nsegments of the word is between 000 and 377 in octal notation. The command decoder recognizes\nthe PCM command sequence, isolates the 16 bits of pertinent information, and stores the sequence\nin an output holding register.\nThe tone commands consist of three discrete frequency bursts of one-half-second duration,\nwith one-half-second blanked intervals separating them. The tone frequency bursts employed to\ninstruct the satellite a r e 1097 Hz for an address tone, and two frequencies selected from 2270,\n2650, 3305, and 3850 Hz, for two execute tones. The frequencies a r e isolated during decoding by\nusing a character-selection matrix which produces octal numbers corresponding to the five different\ntone bursts. Three translated characters are stored together in a holding register and then presented for output in an octal number representation.\nThe PCM command format w a s designated by Goddard Space Flight Center as the primary\ncommand source for the O W satellites; and the tone commands were designated for emergency\nbackup, or secondary commanding. Since either type of command can be recorded on the same\ntape, the decoder system was designed to recognize either type of format and to process it. The\ndecoding circuits share a common input, and depend on narrow-bandpass filters to detect and\nseparate the different frequencies of the two command formats. Once filtering takes plac ; the\n,\nselected signal is conditioned and converted from an analog to a digital voltage representadon by\nappropriate circuits. The converter circuits were designed and developed with operational amplifiers having the advantages of versatility and high-gain characteristics. These amplifiers a r e used\nin the analog conversion circuits for active filtering, amplification, signal inversion, pulse shaping,\nenvelope development, and threshold detection.\n\n42 - BIT\n\nTIME\nDECODER\n\nSTORAGE\nREG1STER\n\nTIME OUTPUT\n9 BCD CHARACTERS\n\nLOGGING\nPRINTER\n\nNASA TIME\nANALOG\nMAGNETIC\nREPRODUCER\nPCM / TON E\nCOMMANDS\n\nt r ,\n\nTONE -TO DIGITAL\nCONVERTER\n\nTONE\nCOMMAND\nPROCESSOR\n\n&\nCOMMAND\nDATA\nREGISTER\n\n--b\n\nPCM-TODIGITAL\nCONVERTER\n\nFigure\n\n8\n\nPCM\n\n+COMMAND\n\n.\n\n~\n\nCOMMAND OUTPUT\nDATA\n6 OCTAL CHARACTERS\nb LOGGING\nPRINTER\n\nPROCESSOR\n\n7-OGO command decoder system simplified flow diagram.\n\n.\n,\n\nThe basic configuration for the OGO Command Decoder System is shown in Figure 7. When the\nPCM o r tone commands a r e reproduced on the analog magnetic tape drives, a previously recorded\nNASA standard time word is played back. At the instant that a command has been processed and\nis ready to be sent to the output printer, a signal is sent to the time-storage circuits to bring forth\na time word for output to another printer. The command and time words are then printed out\ntogether.\n\nFunctional Description of PCM Command Decoding\nA block diagram of the circuit subsystems of the OGO command decoder is shown in Figure 8 .\nThe functional logic of the PCM command decoder is shown in the bottom portion.\n\nBCD TIME FROM\n\nOGO COMMAND PROCESSOR\n\nSTARS TIME DECODER\n\nI\n\nQ\n\nl k H z FROM\nSTARS TIME DECODER\n\nI\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nT STAR\nO\nI\nTIME DECODER\n\nL\n\nI\n\nt i\n\nI /\n\nTONE PULSE\n\nb\n\nr\n\nI\nI\n\nSTORAGE\nREGISTER\n\n1\n\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\nOUTPUT\nSTROBE\n\nTONE\nPULSE\nCOUNTER\n\nI\n\nI\n\nANALOG\nTAPE\nREPRODUCTIOI\'\n\nPCM\nI\n3 TONE I\nR\n:OMMAND;\n\nI\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\n\nI\n\nTONE\nTONE\nCOMMAND\nENVELOPE\nDIGITAL "\n4\nCONVERTER\n\n\'\n\nOUTPUT\nDATA\nCHARACTERS\nLOGGING\n\n-\n\nTONE\n-b CHARACTER\nCOUNTER\n\nCT.3\n\n41\n\nTONE\nERR\nRO\n4\nCONTROL\n\nI\n\nCLOCK\n\nI\n\nI\n\nPATTERN\nCOUNTER\n\nI\n\nI\n\nL\n\nI\n\nLOGICAL\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\nPRINTER\n\nREADY\n(C.P. 31\'\n\nI\nI\n\nCOMMAND\nOUTPUT\n\nw\nCOMMAND\nDATA REGISTER\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\n8\n\n4\n\n--_______-_---\n\nCOMPLETE\n(C.P. 64)\n\n- - - ------------ J\n\nFigure 8-OGO command decoder block diagram.\n\n9\n\nThe reproduced command from the analog tape drive goes to a PCM command converter and\nto a tone command converter. The input stage of the converters are selective bandpass filters.\nThe filter in the PCM converter passes frequencies assigned to the PCM format for the 0 0\nsatellite, and attenuates frequencies outside of the band. The same is true of the filter in the tone\nconverter. This ensures that PCM commands will activate only those circuits used for decoding\nPCM commands. (Likewise, the tone-command circuits ignore PCM commands and a r e activated\nonly when a tone command frequency is received.)\nThe PCM decoder circuits consist of the PCM command digital converter, the logical bit\ndetector, synchronization pattern recognition, and a PCM bit counter. The output command data\nregister is shared with the tone command processing circuits for output storage.\nThe PCM command digital converter performs analog-to-digital voltage conversion, and demodulates the 128-Hz modulating signal to produce a clock pulse for the digital logic circuits. Filtering is\nperformed to eliminate noise and tone frequencies, and the remaining signal is fed to an operational\namplifier for amplitude restoration. The 8.0-kHz frequency is detected when a binary zero is sent\nand a voltage level representing a logical zero is produced. The 8.6-kHz frequency is detected when\na binary one is sent and a voltage level representing a logical one is produced. The 128-Hz modulating envelope is extracted and shaped so that it can be used for a clock pulse.\nThe logical bit detector determines the reference level of the incoming data and establishes\nthe bit polarity, i.e., voltage level, that is placed at the initial stage of the command data register\nso that it can be shifted in for data storage. Bits a r e detected and stored serially, bit by bit, as\nthey are converted and sent to the digital logic circuits.\nThe sync pattern recognition circuits determine a synchronization pattern which, in turn, is\nused to identify a valid command word. This enables control functions to be performed that allow\na count to be taken for the required bits in a command word.\nThe PCM bit counter is used to count the bits in a command word. After the desired count is\nreached, this logic locks out further pulses sent to the command storage register; this is in order\nto retain the 16 relevant bits extracted for the command word. At the conclusion of a decoding\nsequence, the counter circuitry issues a signal for an output cycle to commence.\nThe command data register is a common output storage for both PCM and tone commands.\nWhen it is used in conjunction with the PCM command decoder circuits, it functions as a shift register; the binary data is serially loaded into it by the 128-Hz clock pulse. When the command is\nunloaded, a l the bits are read into the printer circuits in parallel.\nl\n\nFunctional Description of lone Command Decoding\nThe functional logic of the tone command decoder is shown in the top portion of Figure 8. The\nlogic is composed of the tone command digital converter, the tone character counter, the tone pulse\ncounter, the tone translator matrix, and the tone e r r o r control.\n10\n\nThe tone command digital converter performs three Eunctions: (1)it filters out frequencies\nand noise outside of the tone command frequency band, (2) it amplifies and shapes the tone frequency pulses to a voltage level compatible with the digital logic circuits, and (3) it develops an\nenvelope at the desired logic level used to validate the duration of a tone burst. The tone pulse\ncounter consists of a 12-stage counter with a maximum count of 2048. It accumulates a count of\nthe frequency pulses in each tone burst that occurs during a tone command sequence. The tone\ncharacter counter records the number of tone bursts in a command sequence. It determines where\na translated character, representing a particular tone frequency, is located in the command storage\nsequence. It also sends the control pulse to initiate an output cycle. The tone translator matrix\ndistinguishes between the address-, execute-, and erroneous-tone frequency counts. It assigns a\ndiscrete integer to each tone burst. Each time a burst occurs, the character selected by the tone\ntranslator matrix is transferred to a designated location in the output command data register. Upon\nsignal dropout, o r the failure of special filtering networks (designed to eliminate a discrete lowfrequency tone burst sent to indicate command completion*), the tone e r r o r control clears the system\nstorage elements and resets all binary control elements to their initial conditions.\nThe command data register, as stated previously, is shared as a common parallel output medium\nby the PCM and tone command decoder networks. The translated tone command characters a r e\nplaced in it by a parallel data deposit when each frequency burst has been terminated. After the\nfinal character has been stored, an output cycle is initiated.\n\nSTARS Time Decoder\nThe Satellite Telemetry Automatic Reduction System time decoder processes and presents\nNASA standard time to the command decoder in BCD format. The decoder sets up a time word\nat millisecond intervals and notifies the command decoder that information is being held for a\nreadout\n\n.\n\nThe time storage register accepts nine BCD characters from the STARS time decoder, after a\ncommand has been processed. The register momentarily holds the time word, consisting of days\nof the year down to units of seconds and, when strobed for an output, presents the characters in\nparallel to an output printer.\n\nOutput Control\nWhen a command sequence has been terminated, the output control circuits are alerted by a\nsignal from either the PCM o r tone command decoder circuits.

TONE AND TONE-DIGITAL\nCOMMAND PROCESSOR SYSTEM\nThe Tone and Tone-Digital Command Processor System\n(Figure 9) w a s designed and developed to decode and process\nthe commands for the AE-B, OSO, and BIO satellites. It is\nconstructed with variable electronic filters which enable it to\nprocess tone commands of any frequency specified within the\nNASA command standards. With minor signal level and timing adjustments, it can process any tone-digital command format that conforms to the command standards. The processor\nis part of a system (Figure 10) which consists of an analog\ntape reproducer, the tone and tone-digital command decoder,\nNASA standard-time decoder, a format control buffer, and a\ndigital magnetic-tape recorder unit.\nThe processing circuitsfor thetwo types of command a r e\nswitched on separately. The satellites for which the system\nwas developed use only one format. That is, AE-B uses the\ntone command format, and the O N * and BIOS satellites use\nthe tone-digital commands. Separate input stages a r e selected, because the different command formats are never\nmixed together during command transmission as is the possibility for the OGO satellites. A simplified block diagram\nof the system is shown in Figure 11.\nCommand data is played back from the analog magnetictape reproducer to the selected command decoder. At the\nsame time, NASA standard time is played back from another\nchannel of the reproducer and is sent to the time decoder.\nThe commands are decoded and temporarily held while control circuits communicate with the output circuits; then the\ntime and command information is sent through multiplexing\n\nFigure 9-Tone and tone-digital\ncommand processor.\n\n\'The OSO-A satellite is an exception and uses the tone command format instead of the tone-digital command format.\n\n12\n\nFigure IO-Command processing system.\n\nand buffering elements to the digital tape\ndrive, where the data a r e placed on magnetic tape as BCD characters.\n\nCOMMAND\nREPRODUCER\n\nTONE C O M M A N D\nPROCESSOR\n\nEECO\nFORMAT\nCONTROL\nBUFFER\n8 DIGITAL\nMAGNETIC\nTAPE\nRECORDER\n\nCommand data are played from an\nTONE-DIGITAL\nanalog tape reproducer to whichever comCOMMAND\nI PROCESSOR\nmand processor is selected. Simultaneously, NASA BCD time is played back\nFigure 1 1 -Tone and tone-digital\nfrom another track of the reproducer dicommand processor system flow diagram.\nrectly to a time decoder. A command is\ndecoded, temporarily held while an output signal is sent to a format control buffer, and then forwarded along with a time word to the buffer where it is multiplexed, character by character, and\nrecorded on digital magnetic tape.\n\nFunctional Description of Tone Command Processing\nThe tone command processor will decode incoming commands at normal and at 4 times the\nrecorded speed. The processor, whose subcircuits a r e shown diagramatically in Figure 12, is\ndivided into the functional parts described on the next page.\n13\n\nr\n0-\n\n1\n\nINPUT\nBANDPASS\nFILTER\n\n-\n\nSIGNAL\nSHAPER\n\n7\n\nTONE COUNT\nSTORAGE REGISTER\n\nENVELOPE\nDETECTION\nI\n\n,\n\n0\n4\n\nTO EECO CONTROL\nFORMAT B F E\nUFR\n\nI\n1\nRESET\nCONTROL\n\n~\n\n,LE\nVERIFY\nCONTROLS\n\nFigure 12-Tone\n\nDATA READY\n\nI\n\nPULSE\nGENERATOR\n\nI\n\nCONTROL\nFORMAT\nB FE\nUFR\n\ncommand processor subsystem block diagram.\n\nSignals reproduced by the analog magnetic tape drive are sent to the input bandpass filter,\nwhich rejects all frequencies below 1 kHz and above 4 kHz. The filtering thereby eliminates all\nfrequencies outside of the range for the appropriate command frequencies. The lower and upper\nband edges previously quoted a r e multiplied by 4 when a quadrupled processing speed is selected.\nThe signal shaper circuit is composed of an operational amplifier and a schmitt trigger. These\ntwo elements provide low-level signal amplification, noise immunity, wave shaping, and the required voltage levels for the digital logic of the decoder.\nThe method of data recovery for the tone commands in this system is to count the pulses within\na frequency burst, allowing for a percentage deviation from the exact count. In order to do this, an\nintegrate and count technique is used. The tone envelope detector develops an integrated envelope\nover the duration of a frequency burst by following the peak signal level of the incoming tone burst.\nThe envelope produced is used to activate a counter and to maintain control circuits for the duration\nof the burst. It also contributes a "flywheel" effect to prevent signal dropout and amplitude falloff.\nThe tone count storage register is an eleven-stage counter which accumulates a number\ncorresponding\'to the total frequency pulses in a tone burst. The quantity accumulated will be the\nbinary equivalent of the pulse count occurring over the one-half-second interval of the tone command frequency burst. When the burst is completed, the counter will contain a maximum octal\ncount of 3777. This is equal to 2047 in decimal notation. Since the frequencies range from 1447 Hz\n14\n\nto 3850 Hz for the OS0 command format, the highest decimal count will be 1925, which is the\nhighest correct recorded count for a tone burst of 0.5-second duration.\nThe output storage gating serves as a protective stage between the output of the tone command\nprocessor and the format control buffer. The gates isolate the system from electrical failures in\nthe externally connected buffer. The gates a r e single-output inverters connected to the tone count\nstorage register; they provide the drive current for the data transfer lines to the format control\nbuffer inputs.\nThe tone-verify controls check the validity of a frequency burst by a duration check. Signal\nintegration is performed on the tone envelope for 80 percent of the burst time; after this, a tone\nburst is considered legitimate. When a frequency burst is ascertained, the tone-verify controls\ninitiate the sequence that sends a data-ready pulse to the control buffer and initiates a systemreset pulse after the command data have been transferred to the format control buffer.\nThe output of the data-ready pulse generator is a data-ready signal which initiates a loading\ncycle in the format control buffer. When the signal is developed, the digital command data stored\nin the output storage register is read into the format control buffer for character multiplexing, to\nbe recorded on digital magnetic tape.\nThe reset control clears the tone-count storage register when a tone frequency burst is completed, and whenever a false o r short command burst is detected. Error detection circuits in the\nreset control protect the system from any reset whenever the tone-verify controls establish that\nthe criterion for a valid frequency burst of 80 percent has been met.\n\nFunctional Description of Tone-Digital Command Processing\nThe tone-digital command processor (Figure 13) will decode commands at normal speed and\nat 4 times the speed of the original recorded information. It is constructed to process tone-digital\ncommands, with a basic carrier cycle of 7 kHz for the OS0 satellite commands, and can be adjusted o r expanded to handle any frequency within the 7- to 11.024-kHz band specified by Goddard\nSpace Flight Center for tone-digital commands. There a r e ten general subsections to the processor.\nThe design concept is one calling for pulse-duration sampling and validity testing with the subsequent digital functions of clocking, shifting, e r r o r checking, and data transfer. The subsection\nparts a r e presented in the following discussion.\nThe input (bandpass) filter is variable and is adjustable for normal and 4 times playback speed\nof the analog tape. Sideband frequencies are normally placed at plus or minus 500 Hz. This is an\nempirical value and can be tightened if so desired. The filter attenuates all unwanted frequencies,\nand peaks, graphically speaking, for the specific frequency used to produce the tone-digital\ncommand-pulse timing period.\nThe signal from the bandpass filter goes to a pulse shaper which provides noise immunity and\nsquares the pulses before sending them to an envelope detector, which develops an envelope over\n\n15\n\nSHIFT\nCONTROL\n\nDETECTOR\n\n0\n\n--\n\nr\n\nPARALLEL\nDATA\n\nw\n\n-\n\nRESET\nCONTROL\n\nA\n\nENVELOPE\nDETECTOR\n\n-4\n\nCOMMAND\nSTORAGE\n+ REGISTER\n\n-\n\nWORD\n\nb\n\n4\n\nTO EECO CONTROL\nFORMAT B F E\nUFR\n\nCLOCK\nWORD\nENVELOPE\nGENERATOR\n\nFigure 13-Tone-digital\n\nDATA\nPULSE\nCONTROL\n\n+ DATA PRESENT\n\ncommand processor subsystem block diagram.\n\nthe period of time when a frequency burst is present. The output is used for command synchronization, for developing a data clock at the bit rate of the incoming signal, for binary data determination, and for reset control.\nThe data clock is generated from the subcarrier frequency sent from the envelope detector.\nThe clock delays the leading edge of the bit pulse for a time duration of 27 Tc, where Tc is defined\nas the period of one pulse of the carrier frequency, e.g., 0.143 milliseconds for the OS0 and BIO\nsatellites. The clock pulse is sent to the command storage register to shift in command data.\nSince the period of 27 Tc is midway between the 36 frequency pulses used to signify a binary one\n(36 Tc) and 18 frequency pulses used to signify a binary zero (18 Tc), the clock pulse probes for a\ndifference \'in logical voltage levels and shifts the data bit accordingly.\nThe sync detector circuit consists of an integrator and a threshold detector arrangement which\ncharges up and turns on when the sync burst preceding a tone-digital command data bit configuration appears. The sync burst lasts for 75 percent of the defined pulse period for the command\nformat, that is, for 54 Tc. When the sync detector circuit acknowledges the receipt of a sync pulse,\na command processing cycle commences. The output from the sync detector is used by the shift\ncontrol circuits, for reset control in conjunction with the bit envelope developed in the envelope\ndetector circuits and used for initiating the generation of a word-length envelope.\nThe shift control provides the control to the input of the command storage register. When the\nshift control is alerted to the presence of a command word, it provides an enable signal, allowing\nthe data clock pulses to shift the binary bits into the storage register. The shift control also returns the output level of the data-ready signal generator to its initial logical voltage state.\n\n16\n\nThe command storage register is the memory unit of the command processor. Binary data are\nserially shifted, bit by bit, into the register; this consists of eight flip-flop stages (the amount necessary to receive and retain a tone-digital command word). Its output is eight bits in parallel.\nThe output storage gates a r e used for single-ended outputs to provide amplification and isolation to the circuits connecting the processor interface to the control format buffer subsystem.\nThe word envelope generator develops a "window" that lasts for the lengths of a tone-digital\ncommand word. The trailing edge of the pulse is significant in that it represents the delayed response to the signal sent from the sync detector to the word envelope generator when a valid command sync pulse is recognized. The output is sent to the data pulse control and to the reset control\ncircuits.\nThe data pulse control is a gated power amplifier that develops the "data ready\'\' pulse to the\nformat control buffer to notify it to record a time and command word.\nThe reset control circuits reset the shift control at the end of a command word output. They\nalso reset the shift control plus all other binary elements of the command storage register when\na command dropout occurs and when a command sequence (which will be from two to five command\nwords) has been completed.\nThe command output circuits from the command processors a r e connected by a selection\nswitch to the format control buffer. Eleven bits, representing four octal characters, a r e read out\nfor each frequency burst of a tone command sequence, and eight bits, representing two hexadecimal\ncounts, a r e read out for the tone-digital commands. The command characters are multiplexed into\nthe buffer\'s storage area along with 12 time characters and an identification word preset into the\nformat control buffer. The output is extracted when the last character in a command processing\ncycle has been stored and written onto digital magnetic tape.\n\nFormat Control Buffer\nThe format control buffer is a self-contained special-purpose processing device that contains\na NASA standard time decoder, a patchable multiplexer unit, a sequentially interlaced magnetic\ncore memory, and a digital magnetic-tape recorder. Its purpose as a functional part of the Tone\nand Tone-Digital Command Processor System is to decode the incoming time, accept digitized data,\nand write the data on magnetic tape. The recorded information is later used for command correlation which is performed by high-speed digital computers.\n\nVII. PCM AND TONE COMMAND PROCESSOR SYSTEM\nThe third command processor, the PCM and Tone Command Processor (Figure 14), although\ndeveloped for a particular series of satellites, was built for adaptability. It contains the best\nfeatures of the previous systems as well as improved circuits brought about through experience.\nThe system processes PCM commands for the OGO satellites and can be modified to process any\n17\n\nFigure 15-PCM and tone command processor system.\n\nPCM command formats by adding supplementary filters when\nnew subcarrier frequencies a r e used. The format for tone commands can be processed at any standard frequency by the tone\ncommand decoder.\n\nFigure 14-KM and tone\ncommand processor.\n\nThe PCM and tone command processor system (Figure 15)\nhas a magnetic analog tape input. A real-time command link can\nalso be connected to it. A time decoder built to handle any NASA\nstandard time codes provides the time conversion for the system. Decoded and processed commands are stored along with\ntime and identification data in a magnetic core memory of 1024\neight-bit words. When a command processing run is terminated,\nthe contents of the core storage can be read by calling for an\noutput. A flow diagram for the main subsystems is shown in\nFigure 16.\n\nThe system processes the same formats as the OGO Command Processor System. The analog-to-digital conversion circuits employ similar operational-amplifier centered networks to condition the incoming command\nsignals. The circuits perform at lower signal-to-noise ratios, supply greater noise rejection, and\nrespond more rapidly to frequencies in the desired PCM and tone command ranges.\n18\n\nIDENTIFICATION\n\nPROCESSOR\n\nCOMMAND\nSTORAGE\n\n- DATA\nMULTIPLEXER\n\nMAGNETIC\nCORE\nMEMORY\n\nCHARACTER\n\ntw,TRANSLATOR\n\xe2\x80\x99\n\nCARD\nPUNCH\n\nFigure 16-PCM and tone command processor system flow diagram.\n\nThe digital logic is far more extensive than in the previous system in that error-checking and\nsignal-dropout-detection circuits, as well as appropriate control and flagging-logic circuits, are\nprovided; thus, more significant analysis of the output data can be made.\nThe system operates with separate input and output cycles. The commands a r e processed and\nstored during a loading cycle. Retention of information is permanent, with the data held in nondestructive magnetic core memory units until new characters a r e legitimately written to replace\nthose stored. An output cycle commences by manually starting an unload sequence. The data in\nmemory is read out and punched and printed on tabulating cards, o r printed serially, character by\ncharacter, by a data-logging printer.\n\nInput Cycle logic Elements\nThe PCM and Tone Command Processor\xe2\x80\x99s main logical elements a r e shown in Figure 17. The\nlogic used during an input cycle consists of the following major functional components (see upper\nportion of figure):\n1. A command decoder portion; this, in its turn, consists of: (a) a digital converter which\ndistinguishes between incoming signal levels and performs analog-to-digital conversion\nof PCM and tone command formats, (b) the tone command and PCM command digital logic\ncircuits, and ( c ) a commonly shared data register which holds 6 command characters.\n2. A time hold register which contains circuits to accept and temporarily store 12 characters\n\nof time and to control functions carried on prior to transfer of a time word in the external\ntime decoder.\n3. An identification (ID) hold register, which contains 18 characters of identifying data connected with the information recorded on magnetic tape (the characters can be manually\npreset o r sent from a satellite telemetry reduction system).\n19\n\nTONE O PCM\nR\nCOMMANDS\n\n\xe2\x80\x98OMAND\nLOGIC\n\nCOMMAND\nLOGIC\n\nCLOCK\n\nCONTROL\n\nLOCKOUT\n\nI\n\n\xe2\x80\x99\n\nCOMMAND\nACKNOWLEDGE\n\nDATA\nREGISTER\n\nMEMORY OVERFLOW\nLOCKOUT\n\n?\n\n4\n\nMEMORY\nCOMPARATOR 4\n8 OUTPUT\nCONTROL\n\n-\n\nTO ASTRODATA\nTIME DECODER\n\nPUNCH/PRINT\n\nFigure\n\nI.D.HOLD\nREGISTER\n\nMAGNETIC\nCORE\nMEMORY\n\nHOLLERITH\nTRANSLATOR\n\nPRINT COMPLETE.\n\nLoy!fNG\nPRINTER\n\n17-PCM and tone command processor system block diagram.\n\n4.

Output gates which pass $-bit BCD characters from the command processing circuits to\ncore storage.\n\nOutput Cycle logic Elements\nAn output cycle is started by depressing a manual engaging button which sends a signal to output control circuits. Once an output cycle commences, the following system elements become\nactive, as described below (see lower portion of Figure 17):\n1. Output gates which generate timing and control pulses and initiate unload cycles for each\ncharacter read back out from the magnetic core memory.\n2. The magnetic core memory holds 1024 characters. The unit contains control and clocking\nlogic, to load and unload data, and circuits to provide sequential and random-access addressing capability. The unit can accept o r retrieve information in 5 microseconds.\nI\n\n3. A memory comparator accumulates a count of the number of characters stored during\ncommand processing. This quantity is used during the output, and represents the terminal\naddress for the block of stored information. When the last address in which data has been\nstored is reached by the memory unit, the comparator and the memory address register\nwill contain the same address, that is, have a coincident count. Comparison logic recognizes the coincidence and terminates an output cycle. This circuitry ensures that only\nthose characters loaded into storage will be punched o r printed during an output.\n\n4. A Hollerith Translator converts the BCD bit configuration of a character extracted from\nmemory into the Hollerith code used by the card punch circuits to produce an appropriate\ncharacter output. The translator reduces the 4-bit coding down to a single level to select\na numeric character, o r to two levels to punch an alphabetic character.\n\n-\n\n5. Summary (IBM526) Card Punch\nThis peripheral device punches out the data held in\nmemory onto 80-column tabulating cards. When a character is punched it is also printed\nabove the punched column. The card punch can punch characters at a rate of 18 per second.\nAt this rate the entire magnetic core memory is unloaded in approximately one minute.\n\n-\n\nThe printer is used as a secondary output device. It accepts the\n6. Data Logging Printer\n4-bit BCD configuration from the magnetic core memory and prints the characters serially\nonto strip printing paper. The printer is utilized for testing the output circuits and for\nemergency purposes when the summary and punch cannot be used.\n21\n\nPCM and Tone Command logic\nThe PCM and tone commands may be transmitted intermittently with both recorded on the\nsame magnetic tape track. The decoder must be able to recognize both types of commands at its\ninput and separate them for processing. The two different processors a r e therefore connected\ntogether at the system input and isolated by bandpass filters. After filtering, the selected commands a r e passed through signal detection and shaping circuits, transformed into voltage levels\nand pulses suitable for digital logic, decoded, arranged in BCD character configurations for each\ncommand, and finally sent through output gates. Then the command is stored in an output register\nthat is shared jointly by both the PCM and tone command processing circuits. The data from the\noutput register is sent to multiplexing logic which stores the command word, along with time and\nidentification words, in the magnetic core memory. Figure 18 shows the processor logic from the\ncommon input and traces it through the command processor logic up to the output register and to\nthe output gates feeding the multiplexer. The bottom part of the figure shows the PCM command\nlogic; the top part shows the tone command logic. These a r e described below, in this order.\nINPUT FROM\nANALOG\nTAPE DECK\n\nPULSE\nSHAPER\n\nTONE\n\nFILTER\n\nI\nENVELOPE\nDETECT\nCIRCUITS\n\nTO CLOCK\n\nI\n\n:\n\nTONE\nFREQUENCY 4\nCOUNTER\n\nTONE\nDURATION\nCOUNTER\n\nFROM CLOCK\n\nFALSE TONE\n&\nTONE COMPLETE\nRST\nEE\n\nTO DATA READY\nGENERATOR\n\nTO MULTIPLEXER\n\nPCM\nB.P.\nFLAG\n\nCOMPARATOR\nF O TONE\nR M\n\nI\n\nDURATION COUNTER\n\nFigure 18-PCM\n\n22\n\n.\n\n64th COUNT\nRESET\n\nand tone command processor logic block diagram.\n\nFunctional Description of the PCM Command logic\nAnalog- to-m*gital Converter\n\nThe PCM command analog-to-digital signal converter circuits include subcircuits for the\nPCM bandpass filter, data rate generator, and binary "1-0" detector. (See Figure 18, bottom\nportion.) The design of these circuits is basically that of the analog-to-digital converter circuits\nof the OGO command decoder. Operational amplifiers were used for active elements in the filter\nportions, and incorporated in peak-following, baseline-resolution, pulse-shaping, and sawtoothwaveform-generating circuits. The improvements from the original system consisted of the introduction of network elements to provide greater noise immunity, better stability for voltage-level\nreference, and improved clock pulse generation. The task of the PCM digital converter is to detect 8.0-kHz and 8.6-kHz frequencies used for the OGO PCM commands. These frequencies represent binary one and binary zero, respectively. The converter also strips off the 128-Hz carrier,\nlater used to produce the clock pulses to the digital logic circuits.\nThe PCM bandpass filter passes the 8.0- and 8.6-kHz frequencies, and rejects those outside\nof a narrow band encompassing them. The active filter is constructed with pi and T networks that\napply strong attenuation to unwanted signals. The "1-0" detector separates the 8.0- and 8.6-kHz\nsignals and directs them through noise-rejection and amplification circuits that eliminate any\nresidue of the opposite frequency state. The output signal is presented to the digital logic circuits.\nThe data rate generator extracts the 128-Hz carrier frequency from the command signal, refines\nand amplifies its peaks, and then develops a sawtooth waveform that is forwarded to the digital\nlogic circuits for control functions.\nPCM Digital Logic\n\nThe digital logic includes all the circuits used to decode and format the command data converted from analog representation, and consists of two subcircuits: the data rate detector and the\nPCM bit counter. The data rate detector receives the sawtooth waveform from the data rate\ngenerator. It examines the voltage threshold of the incoming signal and produces pulses at a 128-Hz\nrate. The detector will not produce a pulse if serious signal deterioration o r dropout has occurred.\nThe output of the detector is then fed into the PCM bit counter. The PCM bit counter increases\neach time a pulse is sent from the data rate detector. It normally counts up to 64 (the number of\ncycles of the 128 carrier frequency during a 1/2-second interval). The output of the counter is fed\ninto a comparator gate to test for bit dropouts.\nPCM Logic Auxilimy Circuits\n\nThe clock pulses for the system a r e produced by an oscillator that is turned on when the onezero detector recognizes the first legitimate logical one bit in the incoming bit stream. The clock\npulses a r e generated synchronous to the pulses from the data rate generator. The normal clock\nrate is 128 Hz, but the oscillator speeds up as required for 2 and 4 times playback reproduction\nspeed. The clock is turned on when either PCM or tone commands are processed. Its purpose is\nto establish an incoming pulse that can be counted over the duration of the command signal. This\n23\n\noffsets any dropout during a burst time and gives the system a phased flywheel to ensure that\nmeasurements will remain significant with respect to time. The clock also supplies the shift pulses\nto the storage register that accepts the serial bit stream of command data.\nThe duration counter is used to recognize and control the extraction and storage of the correct\n16 bits from the 64-bit serial pulse train. It starts counting after the synchronized clock is turned\non, and counts over the 16 bits that represent the address and execute portions of a command word.\nAt the required bit time, the counter locks out clock pulses to the output storage register so that no\nmore data bits can be shifted into it. When the final bit time (64th bit) of a PCM command is completed, the duration counter sends a reference strobe to another leg of a comparison network to\ntest for bit rate dropout o r distortion.\nThe duration counter lockout is needed since the clock output is used jointly by both PCM and\ntone command processors. Its function is to keep the duration counter from counting when tone\ncommands are processed. This prevents an indicator, used to designate questionable P C M commands, from being turned on when no PCM commands are being processed.\nThe comparator is used to evaluate the counts held in the PCM bit counter and the duration\ncounter at the end of a PCM command burst. It tests to see that all bit envelopes of an incoming\nf\ncommand have been detected and properly developed. I signal fading o r dropout has occurred, the\nPCM bit counter will not total up to 64 counts and will not match the duration counter. The comparator will place a flag bit in one preselected stage of the output storage register to signify that\nthe command signal was distorted and that bit e r r o r s may be present.\nThe data-ready generator sends out a pulse called the "data ready" pulse after a command has\nbeen processed. This pulse occurs after the 64th (and last) pulse of the PCM command, and starts\nthe loading cycle which places identification, time, and command data in the core memory.\nThe digital PCM command bits a r e sent to the output register and serially shifted in by the\nclock pulse. A flag bit is stored in one stage of the register if erroneous data a r e present. Shifting of the input bits terminates when the duration-counter decision circuits notify the system that\nthe desired data have been shifted into the output register. One stage of this register is shared by\nthe tone command processor when it decodes a command. This stage is used for an e r r o r flag\nwhen discrepancies appear during tone command processing.\nThe output gates a r e used jointly by both processor units, and pass the command data out to\nthe multiplexer circuits of the system for separation and storage in the magnetic core memory unit.\nThe data configurations a r e different for the two types of command. The PCM command contains six octal characters of 18 bits (17 data bits, 1 flag bit), whereas the tone command contains\nfour octal characters of 12 bits. Because of this, the upper two tone characters a r e multiplexed\nas zeroes. If an e r r o r has occurred, then one of the upper bits is used for a flag.\nAll control circuits of the PCM command processor a r e reset when a command processing\ncycle ends. The 64th count reset will reset all binary elements that perform a decision function.\n\n24\n\nThe output storage register elements are reset separately, after data multiplexing has occurred,\nrather than by the 64th count reset. This is in order to prevent the data from being erased before\nstorage takes place.\n\nFunctional Description of the Tone Command logic\nThe tone signal conversion circuits consist of the tone filter, the amplifier, and part of the\nenvelope detection logic blocks shown in Figure 18 (top portion). The tone filter eliminates frequencies outside of the 1025- to 6177-Hz band assigned for tone commands. Two pi filters attenuate\nthe undesired frequencies and forward the remaining signal to an active low-pass filter stage designed to reject a 800-Hz turnoff signal sent at the end of a tone command sequence. The output\nfrom this stage is a smoothed-out frequency burst; it is sent to pulse-shaping circuits in the digital\nlogic. The signal also goes to a voltage amplifier, to increase the signal strength, and then to the\ninitial stage of the envelope detect circuits, which follow the peaks of the frequency and develop a\nrough envelope during the incoming burst. T h i s envelope goes to logic circuits in the envelope\ndetect circuits, where squaring and signal refinement take place.\nThe tone digital logic blocks shown in Figure 18 consist of the envelope detection circuit, pulse\nshaper, tone frequency counter, tone duration counter, dropout detect circuits, resets, and the\ncommon output gates.\nThe pulse shaper takes the incoming 0.5-second frequency burst from the tone filter, squares\nthe pulses within it, and adjusts the level of the signal to the voltage levels of the digital logic\nfollowing it.\nThe envelope detection circuits, previously mentioned, include stages of both the analogconversion and logical elements. The analog circuit is a peak-follower network that developed an\nunrefined envelope over the duration of the tone frequency burst. The digital portion shapes the\nenvelope and level-shifts it so that it will be a voltage usable by other digital logic elements. The\nleading edge of the squared envelope is used to turn on the oscillator, which produces a 128-Hz\nclock pulse for both command processors. This clock is speeded up when the processing is run at\n2 o r 4 times normal speed. The envelope is used for turn-on and turn-off control of the tone command processor and is routed to the tone duration counter, the tone frequency counter, the dropout\ndetector, and the reset circuits.\nThe pulses developed by the pulse shaper are fed to a gated input of the tone frequency counter.\nThe output of the envelope detection circuits activates the gating circuit for the duration of a tone\nburst and allows the counter to assimilate a value equal to the number of pulses in the tone burst.\nThe incoming 128-Hz clock pulse advances the tone duration counter and accumulates a count\nof 64 over the 500-millisecond interval. The counter increases only while a tone-burst envelope\nis present. The output of the counter, signified by a s e t logic level, is used to verify that the tone\nburst lasts for its specified period.\n\n25\n\nThe dropout detector accepts the output of the tone duration counter and tests it against the\ntone envelope voltage. If a comparison of agreement is made, nothing occurs, but if a count less\nthan the required 64 is in the counter, the dropout detector will produce an e r r o r flag bit to indicate\nsignal dropout o r fading.\nThe false-tone and tone-complete reset circuit generates a reset pulse that clears all bistable\ncomponents of the tone command processor. It is triggered at the end of a tone burst; so, if the\nburst ends prematurely and does not reestablish itself within certain correction tolerances, the\nsystem will be reset. At the end of a normal 500-millisecond tone burst, the system will be reset\nas expected.\nThe output gates as stated previously, are shared with the output stages of the PCM command\nprocessor output register. The flag bit placed in one bit of that register is passed out directly to\nthe multiplexer along with the other bits sent through the output gates.\n\nVIII. ADVANCED COMMAND PROCESSOR CONSIDERATIONS\nA highly flexible command processing system is being developed by the Information Processing\nDivision of the Goddard Space Flight Center. The system is to be connected to a STARS, PHASE II\nsystem for automatic processing. The command processor will handle either PCM and tone, o r\ntone and tone-digital command formats at processing speeds of 1/8th to 32 times speedup. The\nsystem will be computer-program-controlled and automatically adjusted to handle any command\nformats consistent with the prescribed GSFC command standards. It will read a decoded time\nword with every command, will provide the computer with command identification bits, and will\nflag signal dropouts and bit losses.\nThis system is elaborate in scope. It utilizes the best features of the\xe2\x80\x99previous systems where\nthey a r e appropriate. It includes advanced techniques in both the analog and digital circuits needed\nto process at greater varying playback speeds. Design considerations have been directed toward\nthe solution of the problems of resolving and decoding command data troubled by foreign analog\nsignals on the same tape track and having amplitude and frequency distortion.\n\nIX. FUTURE COMMAND DECODING SYSTEMS\nIn order to handle the variety of command structures that can be arranged within the broad\nrequirements of the GSFC command standards, a command processor that is universal in character\nmust be developed.\nAll of the satellites that have been launched, and future proposed satellites, use either the\ntone, tone-digital, o r PCM command formats by themselves o r a combination of tone and tonedigital commands o r of tone and PCM commands. The desired command processor should be able\nto receive and process all the command formats in any random sequence, provided that the command structure has been designated. This necessitates stringent design criteria in order to\n26\n\ndifferentiate between common frequencies or timing conditions, particularly those of the PCM and\ntone-digital commands. Since there is no forseeable use for all three command formats with one\nsatellite, a compromise can be made in design; an input can be made using either one of two selected formats.\nThis eliminates a good many of the special filters and digital logic circuits that would be needed\nto distinguish between the command formats if all three were used. Analog signal recording presents a major problem. Experience has shown that the command signal may be recorded at a\nvoltage 4 2 db o r greater from the desired level. This necessitates a strong gain-control circuit\nwith a rapid response. Adjustment can take care of much of this ,condition, but in a universal\nsystem automatic correction is necessary.\n\nX. CONCLUSIONS\nA significant amount of knowledge has been gained in the area of command decoding since the\nprogram for producing the three command processors was initiated. Experience gained from use\nof the first and second systems either justified initial circuit design o r led to improvements in\nthem. A number of design techniques, based on assumptions of little known signal conditions, were\nreevaluated during the course of phasing the three systems into operation.\nClose attention was paid to signal dropout; error-checking circuits were placed in the systems to indicate the presence of such occurrences. This condition would have been particularly\nharmful to the first PCM processor, which depended on a reconstructed bit-rate envelope to produce its clock pulses for control and data shifting. A s noted, the PCM processor in the third command processing system had an internally triggered clock to provide insurance against data dropout.\nThe processing of many commands has indicated that complete signal droput due to encoding and\nrecording the commands should not happen. This is not to say that such an event never occurs,\nbut it has not been found to occur often enough to require elaborate compensating check circuits.\nThis has been true of tone and tone-digital commands as well as PCM commands.\nThe major problems have been presented in the recovery of analog signals. The recorded\ncommands in a great many instances have suffered from wide amplitude variations at the input to\nthe system. The processing problems expected to occur with a complete dropout a r e also present\nwith extreme fading o r flareups. When signals cannot be recovered, the check and flagging circuits\nare needed to indicate that there is a question as to the quality of the command signals. Amplitude\nvariation is by far the most serious processing problem. A weak signal at the input may not be\nrecovered, because it cannot be pulled out of the noise that accompanies it. On the other hand, a\nsignal recorded at an amplitude higher than the specified upper limit of the analog-to-digital converter will often saturate the circuits and cause internal timing problems as well as incorrect data.\nSignal distortion has appeared on many recorded commands. The PCM and tone commands\nhave been processed for active satellites so that, for these, a substantial knowledge of signal conditions has been observed. These conditions had been largely anticipated, and circuits designed to\ncompensate for them.\n27\n\nThe commands were observed to vary at low-frequency oscillations about the center reference\nvoltage; also, level changes of the baseline voltage occasionally appeared on recorded tapes. The\nconditions did not affect the processor response unless the shifts were too extreme.\n\nIn any cornmaqd decoding scheme it is necessary to develop circuits that can both respond and\naccurately assess the command signals when they a r e transmitted. The infrequent and random\npattern of command encoding for transmission of instructions to a satellite produces signals that\ndeviate markedly from one command to another. Overshoot o r slow response may occur. The\nanalog detection circuits in the processor were developed to distinguish between correct command\nfrequencies and noise bursts; the digital logic identified noise bursts of the frequencies used in the\ncommand format and controlled system response to them.\nThe techniques used at the interface of the analog-to-digital circuits were durational counting\nfor the tone commands, frequency separation, and envelope generation for the PCM commands, and\npulse integration and level detection for the tone-digital commands. All depended on selective\nfilters at the input for correct frequency isolation, and decision-making circuits that observed the\ncommands with respect to their programmed lengths, in order to guarantee accurate data. The\nduration of each command burst is not as critical a factor as was initially supposed. Sampling\ntechniques to determine the frequencies can just as easily be used as the types of circuits described\nand are more desirable for systems reproducing the data at higher playback speeds.\nIn retrospect, it can be said that the systems amply satisfy the purpose for which they were\ndesigned. They accurately process commands with wide variations in amplitude and low signal-tonoise ratios.\nGoddard S p a c e Flight Center\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\nGreenbelt, Maryland\n841-1 1-78-01-51\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\nDemmerle, A.
