Introduction\nMany organizations are leveraging the Information Age (Hey and\nTrefethen, 2005) to move online to \xef\xac\x81nd new avenues of reaching\ntheir consumers. The past few years have witnessed unparalleled\nefforts (Dalton, 2007) to make scienti\xef\xac\x81c data web accessible\nespecially in the physical sciences. The Semantic Web (Berners-Lee\net al., 2001) has proven invaluable in this effort.

Speci\xef\xac\x81cally, within the \xef\xac\x81eld of heliophysics three\nSemantic Web enabled search and integration systems are available\n(McGuinness et al., 2007a; Narock et al., in press).\nHowever, much of the literature is devoted to system design,\nontology creation, and trials and tribulations of current technologies\n(e.g. Madin et al., 2007; McGuinness et al., 2007a; Narock et al., in\npress). Moreover, Semantic e-Science is emerging as its own\ndiscipline (Fox and Hendler, 2009a; McGuinness et al., 2009) in\nwhich intelligent applications automate scienti\xef\xac\x81c research tasks.\nThe aforementioned implementation and deployment studies serve\n\n0098-3004/$ - see front matter & 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We need to investigate the socio-technical implications of\nsemantic search and the effects on end users. Technology research\nand user behavior are not dichotomous, they are inseparable (Lee,\n2000). In order to fully develop Semantic e-Science we must take a\ndesign-science approach (Hevner et al., 2004) in which we investigate not only how a system works, but also why it works. Evaluation\nof systems in real-world settings is invaluable to this process.\nA recent National Science Foundation report (Cummings et al.,\n2008) concluded that \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98few studies integrate the distinct social,\norganizational, and infrastructure dimensions of dynamic distributed collaborations\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99. The Cummings report (2008) also touches\non the physical sciences as a key application area for this type of\nstudy. In regards to semantic technologies, the physical sciences\nare amongst the early adopters of semantic technologies (Finin\nand Sachs, 2004) and serve to bene\xef\xac\x81t greatly from it.\nIn this work we describe a case study within the \xef\xac\x81eld of\nHeliophysics and provide a comparison of the evolutionary stages\nof scienti\xef\xac\x81c research. Speci\xef\xac\x81cally, we start with a recent Heliophysics study conducted under traditional means\xe2\x80\x94manual\ninspection of large quantities of data and personal interaction\nwith data producers and other domain experts. We label this\neffort science as it describes the norm in heliophysics over the\npast few decades. The data discovery portion of this Heliophysics\nstudy is then reproduced using multiple online search and\nretrieval systems. This effort is termed e-Science and describes\nthe recent trend to automate data discovery using web services,\ndatabases, and other Internet technologies. Finally, we reproduce\nthe data discovery a second time using a new semantic search and\nretrieval system. We label this scenario Semantic e-Science.\nThe science scenario is used as a baseline. It provides us with\nan estimate of the status quo. It tells us the processes by which\nthe heliophysicists conducted their research and the results that\nthey achieved. Comparing the Semantic e-Science results with\nscience and e-Science allows us to see how well semantic search\nenhances the scienti\xef\xac\x81c process. In other words, we are primarily\nfocused on how well semantic search enhances traditional scienti\xef\xac\x81c data discovery. We are interested in the socio-technical\nimplications of moving toward automated intelligent discovery\nand we seek to understand how well this process enhances what\nis currently being done manually in various scienti\xef\xac\x81c disciplines.\nThe novelty of this research is that we begin to understand the\nbroader impacts of moving Semantic e-Science mainstream and in\ndoing so we are able to come full-circle and report on the\nrelationship between semantic technologies and their ef\xef\xac\x81cacy in\nscienti\xef\xac\x81c research. We also provide empirical evidence in support\nof several founding propositions of Semantic e-Science.\nSpeci\xef\xac\x81cally we aim to address the following questions: How\nef\xef\xac\x81ciently and effectively does semantic search allow us to\nfacilitate ingrained data discovery techniques in one physical\nscience area? Does semantic search arrive at the same (or better)\nconclusions as researchers using manual data discovery means? Is\nsemantic search by itself suf\xef\xac\x81cient for data discovery in scienti\xef\xac\x81c\nresearch? What affect does semantic search have on the research\nprocess? What general statements of applicability can be made to\nother science areas?\n2. Setting: NASA Heliophysics data environment\n\ndiscovery methods. Following the recent trend of online data\ndiscovery, and wanting to retain the uniqueness of each of these\nsub-disciplines, NASA, in 2007, commissioned several federated\ninformation systems. Five information systems were funded serving\nthe solar, heliospheric,3 magnetospheric,4 Earth\xe2\x80\x99s radiation belts, and\nEarth\xe2\x80\x99s upper atmosphere communities. Each of these systems is\nresponsible for providing uniform access to their respective underlying sources of heterogeneous and distributed data. These systems\nare broadly known as Virtual Observatories, a paradigm (Szalay and\nGray, 2001) that began in astronomy and quickly spread to heliophysics, oceanography, volcanology, and other diverse scienti\xef\xac\x81c\ncommunities. Speci\xef\xac\x81cally, the Virtual Observatory paradigm unites\nlarge quantities of disparate and heterogeneous data usually under\none web-based portal. The underlying data remain heterogeneous\nand distributed, yet common metadata, access protocols, and\nterminology provide transparent access to users. Within the NASA\nHeliophysics domain the \xef\xac\x81ve Virtual Observatories are supported\nby numerous data analysis and visualization capabilities,5,6 that\nenable the provision of a diverse Heliophysics data environment.\nThe systems within NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Heliophysics Data Environment\nimplement search capabilities relevant to their domain. For\nexample, the Virtual Solar Observatory,7 dealing primarily with\nsolar images, focuses on optical search parameters such as\nwavelength and intensity. The Virtual Heliospheric Observatory,8\nby contrast, deals primarily with in situ time series data. In a\nsimilar manner the remaining NASA Virtual Observatories implement search capabilities analogous to the types of data they\ncontain.\nThe diversity of scienti\xef\xac\x81c data and numerous methods by\nwhich to relate it makes for a challenging search problem.\nPrevious research (Merka et al., 2008a; King et al., 2008) into\nthe applicability of traditional information retrieval techniques\nimplemented in contemporary internet search engines (e.g.\nGoogle, Yahoo, etc.) has shown that relevance scoring, such as\nPageRank (Brin and Page, 1998), while successful in web search,\nfails in scienti\xef\xac\x81c search scenarios as there are few prede\xef\xac\x81ned\nconnections between data. Any connections, if they exist, are\ndetermined during the research process by domain experts.\nThe recently emerged microformats9 are also impractical for\nscienti\xef\xac\x81c search. Speci\xef\xac\x81cally, microformats offer a means to\naugment XHTML with well-de\xef\xac\x81ned semantics. Microformats have\nseen extensive usage lately as the number of web sites using them\nhas been estimated to be in the hundreds of millions.10 However,\nthe use of microformats implies search over web pages, which is\nnot how search is conducted within the sciences (Merka et al.,\n2008a, King et al., 2008). The aforementioned lack of prede\xef\xac\x81ned\nconnections between data and the fact that scienti\xef\xac\x81c data, and\nassociated metadata, are often not stored as web pages precludes\nthe use of microformats. In a similar manner, popular techniques\nsuch social tagging and collaborative \xef\xac\x81lters are also not relevant\nfor many scienti\xef\xac\x81c search and retrieval systems. Tags and recommendations can be useful in scienti\xef\xac\x81c collaborations; however,\nthey are primarily useful for initial discovery and latter evaluation\nof \xef\xac\x81tness for use, and not the primary means of data retrieval.\nRather, users are supplying a set of constraints on the data and\nthe system is identifying time periods and data sets in which\nthose constraints are met. Thus, solutions involving domain\n\n3\n\nThe region of the solar system affected by the Sun.\nThe region of space encompassed by the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld.\nhttp://hpde.gsfc.nasa.gov/hpde_data_access.html.\n6\nhttp://spdf.gsfc.nasa.gov/.\n7\nhttp://virtualsolar.org.\n8\nhttp://vho.nasa.gov.\n9\nhttp://microformats.org.\n10\nhttp://microformats.org/blog/2007/06/21/microformatsorg-turns-2/.\n4\n\nThe NASA Heliophysics data environment1,2 is broken into several\nsub-disciplines each with their specialized instrumentation and data\n1\n2\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2009EO470001.\nhttp://hpde.gsfc.nasa.gov/.\n\n5\n\nPlease cite this article as: Narock, T., Fox, P., From science to e-Science to Semantic e-Science: A Heliophysics case study.

Semantic technologies, such as\nthe Web Ontology Language (OWL) (McGuinness and van\nHarmelen, 2004b) utilize the meaning of the data as well as\nrelationships between constituent data. The ability of semantic\nsearch to enable subsumption, inheritance, and inferencing capabilities helps overcome data heterogeneity and terminology\ndifferences and allows encoding of previously unconnected concepts. The lack of these capabilities in syntactic search makes its\nutilization in scienti\xef\xac\x81c data discovery limited.\nIn particular, two of the NASA systems (the Virtual Heliospheric\nObservatory (VHO) and the Virtual Magnetospheric Observatory\n(VMO)) now use formal ontologies to discover and integrate data\n(Narock et al., in press). Moreover, these two systems were speci\xef\xac\x81cally designed to share technology and infrastructure (Merka et al.,\n2008a) in order to reduce costs and shorten development time. As a\nresult, operations of each of these systems are completely driven by\nthe ontologies. In other words, there is one underlying software\ninfrastructure with the two domain semantics completely captured\nin independent formal ontologies. Simply pointing the software\nto one of the ontologies changes the domain that is searched.\nMcGuinness et al. previously developed (2007a) a similar framework,\nwhich may hint at a convergence of semantic deployment methodologies. However, the questions posed in Section 1 regarding the\nef\xef\xac\x81cacy of these systems still remain largely unanswered.\n\n3. Case study\n3.1. Science\nThe Slavin et al. (2002) study that is the basis of our case study\nrepresents research questions that are common within the \xef\xac\x81eld of\nHeliophysics. Moreover, the Slavin (2002) study requires multiple\ntypes of data to be available during a stringent set of spatio-temporal\nconditions. Speci\xef\xac\x81cally, the Slavin study speci\xef\xac\x81es a spatial con\xef\xac\x81guration of four spacecraft while speci\xef\xac\x81c instruments onboard these\nspacecraft are operating and collecting data. Any four spacecraft are\nacceptable as long as they meet the spatio-temporal restrictions\nlisted in Table 1. All restrictions must occur simultaneously. The\nspatial restrictions are listed using the Geocentric Solar Magnetospheric (GSM) coordinate system\xe2\x80\x94an Earth-centered system common in Heliophysics. Such a con\xef\xac\x81guration of spacecraft is rare and\nheliophysicists do not know its occurrence intervals a priori.\nAs a result, Slavin and colleagues (2002) selected the most\nlikely subset of spacecraft that might \xef\xac\x81t their needs. While this\nselection was based upon extensive experience within the\ndomain it nevertheless highlights the gap between data sources\ndomain experts are familiar with and data sources that are\nregularly emerging and appearing online. In recent years this\ngap has been widening (Gray et al., 2005) to the point of being\nacknowledged in the popular media (Hotz, 2009). With more, and\nincreasingly voluminous, data constantly coming online, knowing\nwhat to search is becoming intractable. This is increasing the need\nfor search in general and semantic search in particular.\nSlavin\xe2\x80\x99s team manually investigated 16 months of an initial\ndata source to undercover 43 possible events. Gradually, these\nevents were whittled away as the remaining spatio-temporal\nrestraints were added.

To examine this in a controlled setting we \xef\xac\x81rst replicated\n(Merka et al., 2008b) the Slavin (2002) study using the initial\nversions of VHO and VMO. The initial systems used purely\nrelational database technology converting web form input into\nStructured Query Language (SQL) queries. While these systems\nhad many advantages, reducing the search time to $2 h, they also\nhighlighted several socio-technical limitations.\nThe VHO and VMO integrate data within two distinct heliophysics sub-domains. However, heliophysics research questions\ndo not always fall into one sub-domain or the other. Rather, in\ntoday\xe2\x80\x99s world of cross-disciplinary and system science, research\nquestions often encompass resources from multiple domains.\nThus, researchers think in terms of complex interrelated systems\nwhile managers are often forced to deploy multiple componentbased IT systems that are more manageable. Moreover, despite\nbest efforts, users are often unaware of such divisions. In our\nparticular case, our spatio-temporal requirements span the subdomains covered by VHO and VMO. A standardized messaging\nframework (Narock and King, 2008) allows results from one\nsystem to be saved and used as a query in the other system.\nHowever, users must \xef\xac\x81rst be aware of the existence and capabilities of both systems. Subsequently, the researcher must arti\xef\xac\x81cially decompose their query into multiple questions of the\nrespective systems\xe2\x80\x94a process that is foreign to most researchers.\nOther limitations come behind the scenes of the information\nsystems. In a relational search system all relationships must be\nstated explicitly. This simple fact has two far-reaching consequences. First, it limits the discovery of new knowledge. Users\nmay \xef\xac\x81nd relationships unbeknownst to them; however, they will\nnot \xef\xac\x81nd a relationship that was not pre-de\xef\xac\x81ned by system\nmaintainers. Semantic search alleviates this limitation and offers\nthe potential for knowledge discovery\xe2\x80\x94a capability essential to\nscienti\xef\xac\x81c research. Second, the system maintainer who de\xef\xac\x81nes,\napproves, and commits these pre-de\xef\xac\x81ned relationships serves as a\nbottleneck to the system. This person slows down the addition of\nnew data, which in turn slows down the scienti\xef\xac\x81c process.\n3.3. Semantic e-Science\nThe data search portion of the Slavin (2002) study was\nonce again reproduced. By replacing the e-Science structured\nSQL queries with inferences over domain ontologies we sought\nto identify which areas of the scienti\xef\xac\x81c research process\nare adequately addressed by semantic search and which parts\nmay still be lacking. For this process, we utilized the SPASE\n\nPlease cite this article as: Narock, T., Fox, P., From science to e-Science to Semantic e-Science: A Heliophysics case study.

These\nontologies are OWL encodings (Narock et al., in press) of the\nXML-based schema developed by the Space Physics Archive\nSearch and Extract (SPASE) consortium (Harvey et al., 2008).\nSpeci\xef\xac\x81cally, these ontologies have Description Logic (Baader\net al., 2003) expressivity ALCOIN(D), 35 classes, 20 object properties, 45 datatype properties, and on the order of 20,000 instances.\nThe aforementioned SPASE consortium, which consists of\nheliophysics researchers, software developers and data providers,\nwas founded to aid in the integration of heliophysics data. The\nintent of SPASE is to create a metadata schema that would lead to\nstandardized descriptions of NASA Heliophysics data resources.\nWithin this case study the On-To-Knowledge methodology (Staab\net al., 2001) was used (Narock et al., in press) to continuously\nconvert releases of the SPASE metadata model into OWL. It should\nbe noted that knowledge acquisition and knowledge representation have historically been challenging and time consuming\nefforts. However, On-To-Knowledge (Staab et al., 2001) and other\nemerging methodologies (e.g. Benedict et al., 2007; Fox and\nMcGuinness, submitted for publication) are beginning to lead to\nquick deployment, rapid community buy-in, and reduced effort\non the end-users part.\nWe utilized the \xef\xac\x81nal versions of the VHO and VMO search\nsystems that now utilize formal ontologies (Narock et al., in\npress). Fig. 1 illustrates the how the VHO and VMO search\nsystems were augmented by the addition of semantics.\nEvident from Fig. 1 is that minimal changes were made to the\nsystem architecture. Speci\xef\xac\x81cally, the system now consults the\naforementioned ontologies prior to constructing SQL queries.\nDomain logic is captured within the ontologies and can be easily\nmanipulated and inferenced with using Semantic Web tools. This\nis opposite of the initial system design in which this information\nhad to be hard-coded into the query algorithms. Previous research\nhas shown (Narock et al., in press) that such a scenario reduces\ncomplexity, query execution time, and system maintenance. In\naddition, we can pose our complete query to the system, have it\nanswer the portions it is capable of answering, and infer to which\nother system to send the remaining portions of the query.\nIn what has become a catch phrase of the Semantic Web,\nHendler (2007) mused, \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98A little Semantics Goes a Long Way\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99.\n\n12\n13\n14\n\nhttp://vho.nasa.gov/ontology/spase.owl.\nhttp://vho.nasa.gov/ontology/vho.owl.\nhttp://vho.nasa.gov/ontology/vmo.owl.\n\nSuch is certainly the case in semantic eScience. The addition of\nbasic Semantic Web technologies \xe2\x80\x93 ontologies, reasoner, and\nsoftware toolkit (Jena15) \xe2\x80\x93 reduces the data discovery process in\nour applications from $2 h to $ 15 min. Such a reduction occurs\nbecause we no longer need to manually visit 2 sites and more\nimportantly we no longer need to arti\xef\xac\x81cially break our query into\nsub-domain speci\xef\xac\x81c questions. In the Semantic e-Science implementation incoming queries are converted from a standard\nXML representation (Narock and King, 2008) into SPARQL\n(Prud\xe2\x80\x99hommeaux and Seaborne, 2008), a semantic query language\napproved as a W3C16 Recommendation. It is at this stage that the\nbene\xef\xac\x81ts of Semantic e-Science become apparent. Using our\ndomain ontology, which spans all of Heliophysics, we can infer\nto which sub-domain each component of the query refers. Further\ninferences can then be made as to which information system\nwithin the NASA data environment addresses this sub-domain. At\npresent, this capability is limited to the VHO and VMO as they are\nthe only systems utilizing semantics. Nevertheless, this limited\ncapability illustrates an advantage over e-Science\xe2\x80\x94namely the\narti\xef\xac\x81cial decomposition of queries.\n\n4. Current Semantic e-Science limitations and infrastructural\nchallenges\nWhile basic Semantic Web technologies reduced the search\ntime by orders of magnitude they are not suf\xef\xac\x81cient to offer a\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98complete\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 answer. That is, the Semantic e-Science approach did\nnot retrieve all of the results found within the science approach.\nWhile the Semantic e-Science approach offered previously\nunknown events to ponder, the semantic search only returned\none of the two original Slavin events.\nMore importantly the results lacked provenance information\nregarding certain aspects of the query.\nWhile the semantic search correctly identi\xef\xac\x81ed data sets of\ninterest, calls to services that search the underlying numerical\nvalues failed to turn up one of the two original events. This was\ndue to the resolution of data that the service searched over and\nwas not a fault of any semantic inferencing. However, this highlights the importance of coupling semantic search to related\nresearch in web services and Semantic Web services. In order to\nbe completely successful these technologies need to be components in frameworks rather than independent streams of\nresearch. This observation is consistent with previous research\n(Lim et al., 2010), which noted that e-Science lacks \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98a single\nbackbone that can support the entire spectrum of requirements\nthat are essential to undertake cross-disciplinary scienti\xef\xac\x81c collaborations.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 Additionally, Abbott (2009) and (Goodman and Wong,\n2009) have commented that current and future scienti\xef\xac\x81c challenges can only be addressed with a focus on systems thinking\nand generalized frameworks, respectively. Such groundwork has\nbeen laid (Fox et al., 2009b) and is being advanced by many\ngroups in the Earth and Space Sciences communities.\n4.1. Provenance\nAlso missing from the semantic search results is provenance\ninformation. One de\xef\xac\x81nition of provenance is \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98the description of\nthe origins of a piece of data and the process by which it arrived in\na database\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 (Buneman et al., 2001, p. 316). Metadata does exist\nfor all data sets returned by the systems, and this information is\nreadily available to the user. However, subtleties in the execution\n15\n16\n\nhttp://jena.sourceforge.net/.\nhttp://w3c.org/.\n\nPlease cite this article as: Narock, T., Fox, P., From science to e-Science to Semantic e-Science: A Heliophysics case study. Computers &\nGeosciences (2011), doi:10.1016/j.cageo.2011.11.018\n\nT. Narock, P. Fox / Computers & Geosciences ] (]]]]) ]]]\xe2\x80\x93]]]\n\nof queries can extrapolate to the point that results are ambiguous\nor even unusable. For example, our query required a spatial\nrestriction that was expressed by a keyword\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98Near-Earth Heliosphere\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99. Within the domain semantics this term has speci\xef\xac\x81c\nmeaning and one can utilize various services to determine if a\nspacecraft is inside or outside of this spatial region. However, how\nthe data in the service was generated is absent from the result, as\nis almost always true for current web-based search engines; only\nlimited provenance on the search result itself is often available.\nThe lack of formal identi\xef\xac\x81cation that provenance metadata is\nindeed related to, and must be returned with, a search result is a\nserious omission in the search for relevant scienti\xef\xac\x81c data. Absence\nof this information further leads to questions of accuracy as the\ncomputational models (e.g. Peredo et al., 1995; Merka and Szabo,\n2004) that predict the spatial region have inherent biases,\nassumptions, and errors known to the scientists who are most\nlikely to have initiated the search. This particular case is easily\nremedied by supplying more information to the results, however,\nas queries become more complex these subtle pieces of information increase and the user\xe2\x80\x99s complete understanding of the results\ndiminishes.\nProvenance is an actively researched topic (Pinheiro da Silva\net al., 2004) that is now \xef\xac\x81nding its place on the Semantic Web\n(McGuinness et al., 2007b), and speci\xef\xac\x81cally within semantic\neScience\xe2\x80\x94known as knowledge provenance (Fox et al., 2008a,\n2008b; Zednik et al., 2009; Zednik et al., in press), and we see this\nas a key component to providing users with a \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98complete\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 answer\nto their queries. Complete in the sense that essential explanations, veri\xef\xac\x81cations and justi\xef\xac\x81cations are given to satisfy a scientist\xe2\x80\x99s questions about any returned result.\nIn the area of knowledge provenance, the encoding of provenance interlinguas such as the Proof Markup Language (PML;\nPinheiro da Silva et al., 2004; McGuinness et al., 2007b) and the\nOpen Provenance Model (Moreau et al., 2011) as ontologies\n(Michaelis and McGuinness, 2010) brings new expressive power\nto the important but previously disconnected provenance metadata. However, languages for encoding are really only a foundation\nfor provenance. What really address a scientist\xe2\x80\x99s curiosity are\napplication tools that work with the encoded provenance. At\npresent these tools include provenance speci\xef\xac\x81c search browse\nand visualization (McGuinness and Pinheiro da Silva, 2004a) as\nwell as integrated applications such as provenance-aware smart\nfaceted search (Fox et al., in preparation). These tools work\nprimarily with PML but similar tools are geared to work with\nOPM (e.g. the KARMA system; Cao et al., 2009). Many of these tools\nhowever are still clumsy for users to use and much work to\nimprove them remains. Of particular signi\xef\xac\x81cance for convergence\nin this area of web-based provenance is the formation and activity\nof a W3C incubator group for provenance.17\nThis progress not-withstanding, \xe2\x80\x98complete\xe2\x80\x99 answers to user\nqueries require a multi-domain knowledge base that is an intersection and super-set of domain knowledge, provenance, and\noften other data product related information (Zednik et al., 2009;\nFox et al., in preparation).\n4.2. Ontology mapping and ontology integration\nThe VHO and VMO share a common base ontology (Narock\net al., in press) and as a result queries passed amongst the two\nsystems are easily interchangeable and executable. However, we\nfound this not to be the case within the broader community. Our\ncase study query could have bene\xef\xac\x81tted from other data sources,\nspeci\xef\xac\x81cally ones available via the Virtual Solar\xe2\x80\x93Terrestrial\n17\n\nhttp://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/prov/charter.\n\n5\n\nObservatory (VSTO) (McGuinness et al., 2007a, Fox et al.,\n2009b). Speci\xef\xac\x81cally, Slavin (2002) utilized an auxiliary data\nsource in order to con\xef\xac\x81rm initial assumptions. Such an effort\ncould have been replicated via VSTO data; yet, that system\noperates with its own independent ontology and associated web\nservices (Fox et al., 2007). At present there is no formal mapping\nbetween VSTO and VHO/VMO ontologies. This is not a criticism of\neither system. Rather, it is an empirical con\xef\xac\x81rmation of the broad\ntendency (Cummings et al., 2008) to create one-off systems\nwithout taking time or effort for harmonization and as a result\nthe lack of interoperability (in this case, semantic interoperability) can hinder system-level science.\nSemantic e-Science needs to have a concerted effort to standardize, align, and map ontologies. Such needs have recently been\nrecognized with several National Science Foundation projects\ndevoted to semantic interoperability, such as the SONET (Madin\net al., 2007) project. Also the Semantic eScience Framework (SESF;\nFox et al., 2009b; McGuinness et al., 2010) project mentioned\nearlier has among its goals to enable con\xef\xac\x81gurable semantic data\nframeworks using modular approaches to ontologies and the\nbridging of disciplines as well as application level integration,\nalso using ontologies to encode meaning and relations for such\napplications (Rozell et al., 2010). Further, SESF advances the key\nnotion of semantically aware application-level tools as an essential part of the semantic ecosystem, integrating not only data and\ninformation sources but provenance as well.\n\n5. Summary and conclusions\nAdmittedly, one case study can only begin to address the\nquestions surrounding the emergence of Semantic e-Science. Yet,\nour case study has shed light on emerging issues and provides\nempirical evidence in support of some of the founding tenets (Fox\nand Hendler, 2009a) of Semantic e-Science. We now return to\nconsider our initial research questions.\n\n\x15 How ef\xef\xac\x81ciently and effectively does semantic search allow us\nto facilitate ingrained data discovery techniques?\n\n\x15 Does semantic search arrive at the same (or better) conclusions as researchers using manual data discovery means?\nSemantic search and basic semantic technologies (i.e. RDF/OWL,\nreasoners, and toolkits) are providing great bene\xef\xac\x81t to the scienti\xef\xac\x81c\nresearch process. As evidenced by this case study these basic\ntechnologies allow one to replicated previous studies in fractions\nof the time. While this is but one of many possible metrics\n(McGuinness et al., 2007c) it is one that busy scientists often care\nabout most. Moreover, these technologies do not require the\narti\xef\xac\x81cial decomposition of complex questions. Reasoning and\ninferencing capabilities are providing great bene\xef\xac\x81t to both the\nuser and the system maintainer. This study, as well as previous\nwork (Narock et al., in press), has shown evidence of easier system\nmaintenance and easier query execution when transitioning from\ne-Science to Semantic e-Science although further quantitative\nstudies are required to substantiate this claim.\nWhile semantic search is a vital component of Semantic\ne-Science it is not the only component. Interspersed with ontologies are non-semantic technologies such as Web Services and\nrelational databases. How and when these technologies interact is\njust beginning to be understood. For example, provenance information is often thought of as the lineage of the data and something to present at the end of execution. Yet the bene\xef\xac\x81ts of using\nprovenance to enhance the search process can be seen in previous\nresearch (Fox et al., in preparation) as well as in evidence\n\nPlease cite this article as: Narock, T., Fox, P., From science to e-Science to Semantic e-Science: A Heliophysics case study. Computers &\nGeosciences (2011), doi:10.1016/j.cageo.2011.11.018\n\n6\n\nT. Narock, P. Fox / Computers & Geosciences ] (]]]]) ]]]\xe2\x80\x93]]]\n\npresented earlier in this paper. Similar scenarios should be sought\nin future research.\nSemantic search returned mixed results within our case study.\nWhile it pointed us toward previously unconsidered data it also\nfailed to \xef\xac\x81nd one of the events from the science approach. Again,\nthis was not the result of the search processes itself, but rather\nthe ongoing challenges of connecting semantic search to other\ncyberinfrastructure capabilities.\n\n\x15 Is semantic search by itself suf\xef\xac\x81cient for data discovery in\nscienti\xef\xac\x81c research?\nThis case study indicates that semantic search as implemented\nin our case study is insuf\xef\xac\x81cient for \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98complete\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 data discovery.\nThis conclusion is reached for a number of reasons. First, the\nmassive quantities of scienti\xef\xac\x81c data (Gray et al., 2005) that apply\nto Heliophysics, make it unlikely that all, possibly not even most,\ndata values will reside as ontology instances; let alone as Linked\nData (Bizer et al., 2009). Thus, semantic search is only as good as\nthe cyberinfrastructure services to which it connects. This was\nevidenced in our study where the ontology returned the correct\ndata set, however, data services were unable to retrieve all\nrelevant time periods. Second, provenance plays an important\nrole in semantic search. Without the complete Semantic Web\nstack (Berners-Lee, 2006, i.e. Provenance, Rules, and Trust) the\ncapabilities of semantic search appear to be arti\xef\xac\x81cially limited.\n\n\x15 What affect does semantic search have on the research\nprocess?\nOur case study has shown quantitative bene\xef\xac\x81ts in query\nexecution time. Similar results were found in a previous study\n(Szabo et al., 2009) with researchers conducting studies in a\nfraction of the time previously required. We believe that this will\nslowly, but steadily, accelerate the pace of heliophysics research.\nTime, money, and resources saved on one research problem can\nbe devoted to other problems. The cumulative effect is acceleration in the creation of new knowledge.\n\n\x15 What general statements of applicability can be made to other\nscience areas?\nThe bene\xef\xac\x81ts of using provenance to enhance the search\nprocess have been evidenced within this study as well as in other\ndomains (Fox et al., in preparation). This tenet extends the\ntraditional data lineage view of provenance and appears to have\ngeneral applicability. Moreover, Semantic e-Science is more than\njust semantic search. The integration of search with web services,\nrelational databases, and other cyberinfrastructure, has applicability as a generalized research area within Semantic e-Science.\nMassive data volumes (Gray et al., 2005) prohibit, or at least deem\nit very unlikely, that all information will reside as ontology\ninstances or Linked Data. Thus, speci\xef\xac\x81c and targeted research\ninto component and framework-based systems is vitally needed.\nThe future of Semantic e-Science is very promising. However,\nthere are numerous challenges that still need to be overcome.\nSemantic search is presently one of the main drivers, however, it\ncannot exist in isolation. We need to move beyond closed systems\nto broader semantic access. Data access, integration, provenance,\nand processing services all need semantic representation (Fox and\nHendler, 2009a). This case study has shown the bene\xef\xac\x81ts, and\nlimitations, of semantically replicating data discovery in one case\nstudy in the physical sciences. It has attempted to provide a much\nneeded extension to the current technological discussion.\nNamely, we have investigated the socio-technical implications\nof deploying semantic technologies in real-world applications. As\n\nwe have shown, one can closely replicate manual discovery\nmethods, yet a \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98complete\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 answer will require the entire Semantic Web stack and the full emergence of Semantic e-Science.\n\nReferences\nAbbott, M.R., 2009.
