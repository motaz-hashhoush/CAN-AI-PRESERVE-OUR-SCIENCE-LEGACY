It was found that movement time was best described as a function of a size prediction made at the end, rather than the start, of the reaction time phase. Subjective workload ratings primarily reflected the total amount of time needed to acquire the targets rather than the time pressure imposed by the diminishing size of these targets.", "title": "Step tracking shrinking targets", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-13T15:32:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19880048187, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Johnson, Walter W."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Ames Research Center", "location": "Moffett Field, CA, United States"}}, "id": "3fee877a46c74a18b80ea1eddac23c86"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19880048187, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Hart, Sandra G."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Ames Research Center", "location": "Moffett Field, CA, United States"}}, "id": "0b1ad11025ab4ecfb2173f42a6f0e4e5"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 19880048187, "endDate": "1987-10-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "AHS"}}, "meetingId": "1aa57bb9f0e742dca32d4fc8eef18e11", "id": "eb18bf116ec54d129450b63c0b29824c"}], "name": "Human Factors Society, Annual Meeting", "location": "New York, NY", "id": "1aa57bb9f0e742dca32d4fc8eef18e11", "startDate": "1987-10-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "id": 19880048187, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19880048187, "id": "91478a03d59f43fcbdb7bfc550809089", "publicationDate": "1987-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
