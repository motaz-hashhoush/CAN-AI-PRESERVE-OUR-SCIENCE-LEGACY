INTRODUCTION AND PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS\nMost space missions require data storage equipment onboard for spacecraft control and\nto retain data for delayed telemetry. It has been recognized that implementation of bubble\ndomain technology as a data recorder offers advantages in versatility, potential reliability, and\ncost.\n\'\nFuture spacecraft missions and Shuttle-transported experiments impose considerable\nvariability in high reliability data recorder needs. Capacity requirements vary from less than 10\nM bits upward. Data format may be either serial, as primarily used in tape recording, or parallel\nfor interfacing to microprocessor and computer controllers. Controls may vary from simple\non/off lines to multiple commands with various command word formats. Desired memory\nperformance includes single and multiple channel configurations, command reconfiguration,\nability to record specific events, simultaneous read and write, asynchronous data rates, access\nto large memory blocks containing data or computer programs, and graceful failure via\nomission of failed memory cells. To simultaneously satisfy these needs in a manner which does\nnot impose one user\'s requirements on another, a Bubble Memory Module (BMM) concept has\nbeen developed which separates bubble related technology from application oriented\ntechnology, thus permitting the user to tailor the memory module\'s organization to suit a\nspecific experiment.\nA two board prototype of a BMM which utilizes unique characteristics of bubble domain\nmemory was designed, built, and tested on this program. The prototype development managed\nby NASA-Langley Research Center and jointly funded by NASA-OAST and the Air Force\nSpace Division, is aimed at maturation of bubble domain technology for space applications.\n[Ref 1, 2, 3]\nAccomplishments of the program not only include design and testing of a prototype but\nalso development of processes and verification of design innovations. Perhaps the most\nimportant accomplishment from the viewpoint of future mass memory using bubble domain is\ndemonstration of a sense multiplexer which greatly reduces \'power and circuitry dedicated to\nbubble detection. A second is the development of a small rugged multichip hermetic memory\ncell which is driven with an expandable coil matrix. This approach reduces power and circuitry\nand allows memory expansion without correspondinglY,increasing circuitry. A few problems\noccurred during the program. Several hermetic sealing methods which were costly in terms of\ndevelopment effort were attempted before a suitable method was found. The manufacturing\nyield run had to be aborted in order to conserve program funds after processing problems\noccurred. Performance of the timing PROM circuit, although adequate for the prototype, is\ndeficient for full scale development. But overall the program has demonstrated a\nmanufacturable Bubble Memory Module which can be put into production with a minimum of\neffort.\nUse of commercial products or names of manufacturers in this report does not constitute\nofficial endorsement of such products or manufacturers, either expressed or implied, by the\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration.

MEMORY MODULE REQUIREMENTS AND GOALS\n2.1 GENERAL\nThis section summarizes requirements for the Bubble Memory Module given in the\nStatement of Work. Design approaches developed in subsequent sections are based on these\ndesign requirements.\nRequirements are for a memory system (Figure 2-1) which is nonvolatile, versatile,\nadaptable to both serial and parallel data applications, highly reliable and cost effective. The\nmemory affords reasonable radiation hardness to meet the bulk of potential applications. The\ndesign employs a module concept to maximize utility in a broad range of applications.\n\nPOWER SUPPLY\nMODULE\n\nPOWER SUPPLY\nMODULE\n\nBUBBLE MEMORY\nMODULE\n\n..-\n\n-..\n~\n\nTO\nCOMPUTER\n\n,\nBUBBLE MEMORY\nMODULE\n\nBUBBLE MEMORY\nMODULE\n\n14---I~~TO\n\n~\n\nCOMPUTER\n\n~\n\n,\nTO DATA\nSYSTEM\n\n-\n\n.\n.\n\nDATA CONTROL\nUNIT\nSERIAL DATA MEMORY\n(3 MODULES)\n\nPOWER SUPPLY\nMODULE\nDUAL PARALLEL DATA MEMORY\n(4 MODULES)\n\nFigure 2-1. Two applications of the BMM.\n\n3\n\n2.2 DATA INTERFACE\nThe memory module has two independent control and data buses each with the signals\nlisted below. Interface is TIL compatible with the ability of operating reliably with cable lengths\nof six feet in length.\nPower Strobe - This signal powers up and initializes the module in preparation for the\nreceipt of the user clock (UCLK).\nCell Address. - This is a parallel binary coded signal of three bits used to select the cell for\nthe next operation. Block size is 51,200 words of 16-bits each. Retrieval time for the block is\n0.61 seconds with a first bit access time of 10 microseconds.\nBoard Address. - This is a set of 3-bits used to select one of potentially eight boards for the\nnext operation.\nAddress Ready. - This signal is an output signal to the user which acknowledges that the\nmodule is busy. Input address is latched in the memory module just prior to "address ready"\nhigh to low transition.\nData Ready. - This is another output signal to the user which acknowledges receipt of data\non write or which provides an indication of valid data on read.\nMode. - This is a single line which indicates whether a read or write operation is required\nfor the next operation.\nUser Clock. - This signal begins execution of the next data cycle. Cell address and mode\ncontrol must have been previously set up.\nData input and output (I/O) interface is 16-bits wide parallel. The interface is a bidirectional\nbus used either for read or write. Data interface is isolated from the bus when the memory\nmodule is unpowered. Data rate of the memory module depends on the type of access, burst or\nincremental. In incremental access, average data rate is user dependent and can vary from 0 to\n55K 16-bit words per second. A start and stop cycle is associated with each word accessed. In\nburst access; a block of sequential words is a fixed instantaneous rate of 83.3K 16-bit words\nper second. Average data rate is user dependent up to the instantaneous rate. In burst access,\na start and stop cycle is associated with each block, thus burst access provides for a lower\npower mode of operation for a given number of accesses.\n\n2.3 ENVIRONMENTAL REQUIREMENTS\nEnvironmental requirements of the memory module covered in this section were verified\nto some extent by subassembly testing and by testing of the prototype. Qualification of the\nmemory module prototype under these requirements was not part of this contract.\nThe weight of a fully populated 107 bit memory module is 3.3 kilograms (7.32 Ibs). This\nweight doesn\'t include cover plates or other mounting hardware which would be required in a\nstand-alone application nor does it include a power supply.\n\n4\n\nPower required of the memory module is a function of frequency as shown in Figure 7-2S.\nTest results of the module indicate 2S.S watts maximum power dissipation compared to the\nrequired 30 watts. Projections during the program ranged from 18 to 24 watts. Minor\nmodifications to the design will reduce power dissipation to about 23 watts.\n\nThe memory module must operate over a range of -1 OC to SOC and retain data over a nonoperating range of -40C to 85C. These limits also apply to the module in a vacuum\nenvironment. Cells were tested from -1 OC to + 75C while the module was tested from -10C to\nSOC.\nTo ensure that the memory module withstands shock and vibration during spacecraft\nlaunch, separation, and deployment, it is designed to pass a number of mechanical tests during\nqualification. Sinusoidal vibration levels for qualification and flight acceptance testing are given.\nin Tables 2-1 and 2-2 respectively. Gaussian random vibration levels for qualification and flight\nacceptance correspond to the spectrum analyses of Tables 2-3 and 2-4, respectively.\n\nTABLE 2-1.

SYSTEM CONFIGURATION AND ORGANIZATION\n3.1 BUBBLE MEMORY MODULE CONCEPT\n\nThe BMM concept employs a basic building block defined as a "bubble memory module"\nfor generation of a variety of memory systems. A bubble memory module exemplified in Figure\n3-1 contains a bank of bubble memory cells (a cell is a group of chips simultaneously accessed\nin parallel to attain desired operational data rates) and appropriate circuitry for equal access to\neach cell, but provides no functional organization of the cells. Functional organization and\nhousekeeping tasks are left to a user-designed controller. Ultimate system characteristics and\nlimitations are determined by bubble chip architecture and the number of chips per cell.\nFigure 3-2 depicts memory system organizations available with a parallel-data memory\nmodule. Capacity expansion is provided by adding BMMs to a user interface bus, by adding\nstorage boards to BMMs or by combinations of the two. Maximum system data rates are\ndetermined by the size of the user-designed power supply and the number of memory modules\noperated simultaneously. The simplest memory system is the parallel data system shown in\nFigure 3-2(B), where the user controller or computer can directly access each cell.\n\nELECTRONIC\nBOARD\n\nSTORAGE----...\nBOARDS\n\nCELL\n\nMEMORY\nINTERCONNECT BOARD (MIB)\n\n..........-\n\nFigure 3-1.

Memory system concepts.\nThe memory system shown in Figure 3-2(A) contains a user-designated Data Control Unit\n(OCU) which determines the organization of the memory system. The DCU can be so simple as\nto route data to and from the appropriate memory modules by a predetermined schedule, or it\ncan provide a high degree of in-flight commandable configuration control with complete\nhousekeeping of memory status. Soth serial and parallel data may be accommodated in this\nscheme with the OCU providing the serial/parallel conversion.\nMechanical design is based on requirements for modularitY wherein the bubble memory\nmodule may be combined with other modules to form a serial data memory (SDM), dual parallel\ndata memory (DPDM), and other system configurations. Modularity is achieved by having\nstandardized mechanical and electrical interfaces for the SMM and all other modules which are\nto be packaged along with the SM~. These modules are mechanically fixed and electrically\ninterconnected to a chassis/MIS assembly which is unique to the particular system\nconfiguration required. Physical characteristics of several memory configurations shown in\nFigure 3-3 are given in Table 3-1. A basic stand-alone 107 recorder including a power supply is\nshown in Figure 3-4. When the system contains a few boards as in these configurations,\nmechanical and thermal considerations dictate a housing arrangement where the master\ninterconnect board is perpendicular to the cold plate. Interface connectors from the MIS would\nbe placed on the rear wall of the housing.\nAnother case style shown in Figure 3-5 is required for a large number of modules in order\nto minimize thermal path length and center of gravity. The concept shown is an example of\npackaging bubble memory modules in a high reliabilty configuration. A single failure will\ndegrade capacity by no more than 14 percent.\n10\n\nTABLE 3-1.

For example, the concept in Figure 3-5 is configured to eliminate single\npoint failures by using redundant 107 BMMs, each with its dedicated electronics board. Figure\n3-6 is the reliability model of such a system. Based on analysis of the parts list for the prototype\nBMM, an MTBF of 120,000 hrs (14 yrs) is projected for the basic 107 module with power\nsupply. A breakdown of failure rates and assumptions are given in Table 3-2.\nFor applications where reliability is secondary to cost considerations such as those where\nmaintenance is possible the BMM can be expanded in capacity by adding up to eight storage\nboards per electronics board. Support electronics doesn\'t increase linearly with storage thereby\nreducing cost per bit but at the same time decreasing MTBF to 40,000 hours under Table 3-2\nassumptions.\n3.2 BUBBLE MEMORY MODULE DESCRIPTION\nA memory module has been designed and a Prototype fabricated consistent with the BMM\nconcept. To minimize component count, weight, and volume, the field coils are arranged in a\nmatrix, and the bubble chip operators and detectors are multiplexed. This memory module is\nprimarily aimed toward memory module applications in the 7 to 52 megabit range with minimum\noperational power at data rates from zero up to 1.33 Mbits/sec. These goals have led to the\nchoice of a 1OOK bit serial bubble chip (actually 102,400 bits) and a cell containing eight chips in\na common bias and field coil assembly. In addition to a detector designed for multiplexing, the\n100K bit serial chip has first-bit-detection capability and is physically a relatively small chip.\nFirst-bit-detection enables access to a single data word, thus permitting very low data rates\nwithout additional data buffering. The small physical size of the chip offers low power by\nminimizing field coil volume. Table 3-3 is a summary of overall features of the memory module.\nTABLE 3-3.

Reliability model of mass memory system.\n\nThe memory module consists of one electronics board and from one to eight storage\nboards, as shown in Figure 3-7. With the eight-chip cell (819,200-bits/cell), the memory module\ncapacity is expandable in 6.55 M bit increments. Detector noise is minimized by locating sense\ncircuits, cell select switches, and memory cells on the same board. Thus, only high level data\nsignals are transmitted between the two boards. The division of other functional blocks on the\nelectronic and storage boards is less critical but results in two equal-area circuit boards and\nnearly equal power distribution. Bubble chip operator current sources are located on the\nelectronics board. Eight generator current sources (GEN) provide the signals to write\nindependent data simultaneously into the eight chips of a cell. For erasing, each of two transferout (TRO) sources simultaneously drive the transfer-out loops for eight chips in the selected\ncell. Similarly, each of the two replicator sources (REPL) simultaneously drives the replicator\nswitches on all chips in the cell. The TRO sources are de-energized in Read for nondestructive\nreadout. REPL sources are energized in both Read and Write mode so that data are always\navailable in the detector.\nBubble memory module building blocks partitioned analogous to major design tasks are\ngiven in Figure 3-8. Interface (data, command, and address) to the BMM is through either of\ntwo buses. Signals are active low logic. Power switching is used to ensure zero standby power\nand low operating power. The four voltages required and the status lines shown are single line\nfunctions. Over temperature and coil driver over current are the status indicators provided. The\nerase function allows erasing of all cells of a selected board.\n\n16\n\n..\n\n....\n\nELECTRONICS BOARD\nDUAL BUS\nINTERFACE\n\nBBUS\n\nMODE R/W\n\n~\n\nUSER CLOCK\n\n~\n\n[\xc2\xa7;] ~\nSWITCH\n\nPOWER\nSWITCHING\n\n~\n\nADDRESS READY\n\nA BUS\n\n1\n\n~\n\nMODA\n\nCELL\n1\n\nSEL\n\nSENSE CHANNEL\n(B)\n\nI- USCKA\n~ADDRA\n\nDATA READY\n\nCOLUMN COIL\nSWITCHES 2x, 2y\n\n~\n\nPOWER STROBE\n\nOSCILLATOR\nAND TIMING\n\n~\n\n~\n\n~PSA\n~\n\nI-\n\n.

Electrical block diagram.\n\n1\n\nSENSE\n\nMULTIPLEXERm\n\n[3\n\nDET2\n\nMemory timing is derived from a crystal oscillator which is divided down and counted to\nprovide PROM address. The PROM controls 28 functions with 187 nanosecond minimum\nresolution and pulse width. The sense multiplexer (lower right) is the most critical design task\nbecause of the detector\'s low input signal and its susceptibility to digital noise. Detector current\nfrom the circuit generates a voltage at the detector which is discriminated as either a "1" or "0"\nby the circuit. Bubble control (generation, replicator and transfer out) is provided by the\noperator multiplexer. The Coil Drive matrix applies digital ~iming to the selected memory cell.\nFigure 3-9 shows allocation of power, weight, and components of each block. Allocation of\ncomponents and power is heavily weighted to the coil driver function. In reviewing the SSDR\ndesign at the beginning of this program the same conclusion was reached about the SSDR\ndriver matrix. Alternate deSigns such as a sine wave resonant driver were found to be less\nacceptable from a components viewpoint. Despite considerable improvements in the basic\ndesign the trapezoidal driver still requires a considerable number of baluns and steering\ndiodes. Reconfiguring the coil for higher voltage and lower current wiU reduce driver power and\nrelax requirements on diodes. Generally the lower the current, the smaller the devices can\nbecome.\n--\n\n3.2.1 Interface Modes\nTwo types of data access are provided by variation in the User Clock timing - incremental\nand burst. The operation of the memory module is best described by considering each access\ntype separately, assuming only one data bus is energized. Incremental access, with timing\ndepicted in Figure 3-10, causes the selected cell to make two 6-j.Lsec field rotations and shut\ndown, transferring one word on the 16 parallel data lines. When the Power Strobe logic line is\nlogic low, interface is energized. Two microseconds time lapse is required after the Power\nStrobe goes low to allow interface logic circuitry to stabilize. The Power Strobe line must be\nmaintained low by the user for the duration of the cycle, as indicated by the Address Ready line\ngoing low and then returning to its original high state. At the user\'s option, the Power Strobe\nmay either be returned to its high state at the conclusion of the cycle (power strobing) to save\nstandby power, or it may be held low continuously. The User Clock pulse must occur when the\nAddress Ready line is in the high state and must be at least one microsecond wide (glitch\nprotection) to cause any response. The width of the negative pulse of the User Clock\ndetermines whether the memory module operates in burst or incremental access. For\nincremental access this pulse width must be greater than 7.5 j.Lsec. After the Address Ready\nreturns to its high state, a second User Clock pulse of at least 7.5 j.Lsec duration will provide\naccess to the next 16 bit parallel data word. This arrangement not only allows user access to\nsingle 16-bit words but also accommodates simple square wave clocking. The purpose of the\nAddress Ready line is to indicate by a low state that the memory module has received the User\nClock pulse, has latched the Mode (Read or Write) and Address (cell select), and is in the\nprocess of execution. During this low state the memory module does not recognize any signals\nfor the User Clock, Mode, and Address lines. The Data Valid line is to provide clocking for data\nsetup and to indicate by a high state when data are valid on the data bus interface. Data validity\nis ensured by the user in the Write mode and by the memory module in the Read mode. In the\nWrite mode the user must actually maintain data validity only throughout the Data Ready transition from high to low, since data are latched at that time. A positive-going transition on the Data\nReady line indicates the next word may be established on the data bus lines.

Incremental access timing.\n\nBurst access is accomplished by accessing blocks of data through the application \'of an\ninitial pulse and a stop pulse on the User Clock line. As shown in Figure 3-11, burst access is\ninitiated when the initial User Clock pulse is less than 7.5 JJ.sec wide. Thereafter, the times\nduring which the Data Ready line is low represent windows for stopping memory module\noperation. The user may count the negative going transitions of the Data Ready line until the\ndesired number of words are accessed and apply the stop pulse during the appropriate\nwindow. The stop pulse must be at least 1.0 JJ.sec wide. In burst access the instantaneous data\nrate is 1.33 Mbits/JJ.sec as determined by the memory module\'s internal drive field rate of 166.6\nkHz. Thus, asynchronous average data rates vary from zero to greater than 1 Mbitlsec by the\nuser\'s choice of a burst repetition rate. Since internal timing controls the instantaneous data\nrate during a burst, the user must synchronize to the Data Ready line not only for proper data\ntiming but also for stopping the burst at the desired data count. Mode, Address, Power Strobe,\nand Address Ready serve the same functions as for incremental access.\n\n21\n\n~\n21JS\n\n~\n\nPOWERl\nSTROBE\n\nl+-\n\nj.-- 1\n\n4 DUAL FIELD ROTATIONS AT 121JS EACH\n\n-\n\n.1"\n\n2\n\n.,..\n\n3\n\n~\n\n.1"- -+I\n4\n\nI ______________________________________________________\n\n~~I\n\nI\n\nUSER\nCLOCK\n\n----1LJI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\n\nI+-\n\n~\n1L-_____________\n7.5jJ.s\n\nADDRESS\n\nI......-\n\n,.....\n\nDATA\nREADY\n\nI\n\nI\nI\n.""\'"\n...\n6.fil.ts t-....-I\nI\n+1_-----j1f--______\nI\n\n1\n\niJ.s\n\n--I.~I\n\nWr-----\n\nSTOP WINDOW FOR --I"\'~I\nP\nWRITE, 4 WORDS\n\nREADY\n\nWRITE\n\n5.51JS\n\n1""\'--_---\',\n\nI\n\n~ DATA LOAD (TYPICAL)\n1\n1\n1\n-,---il\n\n:\n\n1\n\n,. . .--+-1\n.\nI\n\nREAD\n\n1 .....__---"\n----.j\n\nI..\n\n&..-1----,\n\n5.5iJ.s\n\nI+-- DATA VALID (TYPICAL)\n4-WORD BURST\n\nFigure 3-11.

The approach is useful in large fault\ntolerant systems of which the memory module or modules may be a part. An example of an\napplication facilitated by the dual bus structure is the use of one bus by spacecraft experiments\nor a data source and the other bus by telemetry. The experiment package controls filling of\nmemory cells with data while the telemetry package controls dumping at an optimum time.\nIn operation a request on either bus gains dedicated control of the module if it is not busy.\nA later request on the free bus must wait for availability as indicated by Address Ready. The\nnew user has 7.5 microseconds of priority, after which time the priority reverts to equality. If the\ndual bus feature is not required it can be unpopulated, saving approximately 8 ICS since it is an\nindependent function.\n\n22\n\nr\n\n~\n\nI\n\n4. D1106 CHIP DESIGN AND TEST\n4.1 INTRODUCTION\nThe 01106 chip design shown in Figure 4-1 is a serial loop FIFO register with 102,400 bits\nof storage. Data are written into the loop with the "generator" which is the Jeftmost operator and\nare removed from the loop with the "transfer out" which is the second operator. Bubbles thus\ngenerated are transported along a periodic arrangement of permalloy elements having a period\nof 16 J,Lm. They are driven by a uniform in-plane magnetic rotating field at a rate on the order of\n150 kHz. A static bias field normal to memory element is required to stabilize the magnetic\ndomains into cylindrical domains or bubbles.\nBubbles on the main track are "replicated" into the detector using the six element\nreplicator which is the third operator. Conductors for operators are AL-CU and are placed close\nto the garnet under the permalloy. Bubbles in the replicator tracks are stretched along the\ndetector chevrons in six strips of 50 elements each or about 0.3 mm in length. The domain\nstrips are detected in a back-to-back full shorted detector configuration where the first detector\nbar is monocyclic with the generator and transfer out components. A dual detector arrangement\nis used so that adjacent bits can be alternated between the two thereby reducing adjacent bit\noverlap. Each detector is split into three sections reducing the amount of stretch which is\nespecially important for the first bit detection. Conductors for detectors are permalloy.\n\' - - - - - - - - - 250 MILS\n\n----------.-1\n\n102,400 BIT\nSERIAL CHIP\n01106\n\xe2\x80\xa2 ACTIVE REPLICATOR\n\xe2\x80\xa2 TRANSFER OUT\n\xe2\x80\xa2 GENERATOR\n\xe2\x80\xa2 2 DETECTORS IN PING PONG\n\xe2\x80\xa2 SPLIT DETECTORS FOR 1ST BIT\n\n250 MILS\nR1\n\nTOUT GEN R\n\nR2\n\nDET 1\n\nDET2\n\nFigure 4-1. Bubble chip layout.\n\n23\n\nThe D11 06 chip design is a considerable improvement over the D1067 design used on\nthe previous SSDR program [Ref 2]. The new design which has gap tolerant permalloy\nelements and a CaGe garnet material provides a wide bias margin over temperature and\nrequires lower drive field. A comparison in bias margin and temperature performance for typical\nchips is shown in Figure 4-2. Operator phase and amplitude margin are more than sufficient for\nsystem applications. Evaluation of detector performance verified that detector redesign\nprovides greater sense margin than its predecessor. Bubble signal has about the same\namplitude but adjacent bubble overlap and zero signal balance have improved significantly.\n\n4.2 CHIP DESCRIPTION\nFabrication of the D11 06 is done using a two level process on garnet wafers. The\nfabrication sequence involves LPE growth of magnetic garnet film, deposition of an Si02\nspacer which is then covered with a AI-Cu conductor layer. This conductor layer is etched to\nform generator and annihilator components of the memory element. After these conductor\npaths have been formed, another spacer layer is deposited followed by a layer of permalloy.\nThe permalloy is masked and etched to form the propagation pattern and detector of the\nmemory element. As a final step, the chip is masked to allow the second Si0 2 layer to be\nIremoved from the conductor layer at the bonding pad sites. Table 4-1 summarizes these\nvarious process steps used to form the memory element.\nMemory elements used to generate, propagate, replicate, and transfer bubbles are shown\nin Figure 4-3. Asymmetrical chevrons are the main elements used to propagate bubbles\nthrough the register. Asymmetrical chevrons allow considerable gap tolerance which enhances\nyield and performance compared to the "H/I" pattern used previously. Furthermore, only one\ngap is required per bit of memory capacity whereas the "H/I" pattern requires two.\nGeneration of a bubble is done by nucleating with a pulse of current a magnetic domain\nwhich expands to a full sized bubble within a fraction of a cycle. Replication is accomplished by\nstretching a bubble into a strip around the curved element shown and then "cutting" it into two\nbubbles with a pulse of current. Cut pulse phasing is fairly critical because the strip must be\naligned geometrically with the conductor at cut time. Otherwise bubbles fail to replicate, they\nmay retard into the next bit time, or they may leave the path and enter the register somewhere\nelse. Annihilation is done by transferring bubbles to an auxiliary path which leads to the guard\nrail where it merges with the edge domain structure. A low current of approximately 30\nmilliamps is enough to produce a field sufficient to attract bubbles to the auxiliary track.\nField directions and approximate operator and detection phasings are shown in Figure\n4-4. Field rotates in the clockwise direction when looking into the chip\'s surface. Element\ndesign is optimized for best operation with the current fields directed as shown in the figure.\n\n4.2.1 Fast Access Ping Pong Detector Design\nIncremental read and write capability with fast access is desirable in systems designed for\nlow power data logging or sequential control applications. An objective of this program was to\nachieve bubble detection during the first field cycle of a read operation whereas most bubble\nmemory devices require several cycles of operation prior to detection.

This reduces overlap\nfrom about 20% to less than 10% of peak bubble signal.\n\n4.3 TEST RESULTS\nDevelopment of the D11 06 design evolved from the D1067 design used on the SSDR. A\npartially populated chip (D11 00) with gap tolerant elements was first designed and processed\nfor evaluation. This chip has several small capacity tracks each with a different "handgun"\ncorner and two versions of detector. Evaluation of this design uncovered a mask defect, a first\nbit detection problem, and established the back-back full shorted detector as the more\ndesirable configuration. The D11 06, incorporating design improvements, was processed by the\nElectronic Research Division in enough quantity for evaluation, to establish yield performance,\nand to populate four cells. A manufacturing yield run then followed. This section primarily\ncovers evaluation results on the D11 06 chip with pertinent results on the D11 00 test chip.\n\n26\n\n~i~~\'r=))\n\nC~~\n\n1~\xc2\xbb\n\n<I r\n0\n\n[]~\n===:=:J\'\n\n-------C-----t::::=\'\n\nI\n\nGENERATOR\n\n-~:-- CC=J\n---::J\n\n,r---r---\n\n,\n\n~8\nU\n\nUPPER\nRIGHT\n\nr--\n\n----\n\n\\J . ,~, \\\\ t\n\n<~=:~;t-k---l\n-----j\n\n\xc2\xbb\nrf-- ~u\nJ\n\n\\GJ) ~\n\nREPLICATO\'\n\n~~-~ i C\xc2\xb7-) ~ __\n1\n\nOUT\n\n~ ~m:R ~\n~~\nMERGE\n\n\xc2\xab~\n\nLOWER\n\nCORNER\n\nL\n\n~t\n\n~~",:~R)\n~~\n\n~\nFigure 4-3.

Fast access ping pong detection.\n\n4.3.1 Propagation Test Results\nPropagation margin is given in Figure 4-7. It was obtained under start-stop gated\nconditions where the full register was written with a data pattern and then read continuously in\n15 or 16 bit words. The margin was found under these conditions by raising or lowering the Z\nbias from no error condition until hard errors occurred. The margins thus obtained are\nrepresentative of the storage register and a few connecting elements but exclude detection,\ngeneration, and transfer out.\nSeveral features are significant. Curl up of lower margin at high drive and decrease of\nupper margin at low temperature and low drive bracket the drive field margin for system\napplication. The optimum drive appears to be between 40 and 50 oersteds or a nominal of 45\nOe \xc2\xb1 10 percent for system design. For extended temperature applications \xc2\xab-1 OC),\ntemperature compensated drive amplitudes or tighter drive tolerance will be of value. These\nmargins were obtained using a trapezoidial drive waveform and a SSDR cell. Results are\nsensitive to the locus of the rotating field which depends both on coil characteristics (UR ratio)\nand on applied waveform. Tracking of margin with cell bias is satsfactory with both having a\nvariance of -0.19 \xc2\xb1 0.01 percent per DC.\nLower margin can be characterized a number of ways as shown in Figure 4-8. Stripout of\nan empty register gives slightly lower values than for gated margin of mixed "ones" and\n"zeros." A more conservative margin limit is where erasure of a register of striped out bubbles\ndepends solely on the transfer out operator (upper curve). This presupposes that stripout\noccurs during abnormal operation of the memory and that the event must be anticipated either\nby incorporating Z axis erase hardware or by maintaining Z bias above the operator erase\nmargin.\n\n30\n\nCHIP\n\n30 LOT 557\nM.s.\nPING PONG 16 BIT\n\n7\xc2\xb7 1()\'77R\n\n12\xc2\xb7~7B\n\n150 ,\n\n150 I\n\nI\n\n150\n\nPAITERN0111010111111101\n\n140\n\nQ--Y\nc\n\n/\n\n-\'\n\n/\n\n140\n\nw\n...\nN\n\n\'~~\n\n130\n\n~\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\nlJ\n\n30\n\n60\n\n~.\n\neo"C\n\n40\n\n30\n\n60\n\n50\n\n160\n\nw\nQ\n\nul 140\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n160\n\n150\n\nc\n\n~\n\n120t:\xc2\xb7\n\n140\n\nIi:\n\n,.,\n\n---\'\n\nI\n\n""\'\n\n_/\n\nN\n\n130\n\n130\n\n130\n\n\xc2\xb710"<:\n120L\'----~--------\n\n30\n\n40\n\n2fPc\n\n5"c\n\n_______________________\n50\n\nXN DRIVE (DEI\n\neo\n\n120 ,L-__________________________________\n120~!------------------------------------\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\neo\n\nXIV DRIVE (DEI\n\nFigure 4-7.

Lower margins.\n\n4.3.2 Operator Margins\nBubble generation (Figure 4-9) has excellent margin in amplitude and in phase. Results\nindicate that compensation of amplitude is not required because 280 rna of current was applied\nwithout nucleation of spurious bubbles at 75C and only 195 rna is required at -10C, giving a\ncomfortable margin for system operation. Statistical data obtained at the field runs (Section 6)\nshow considerable variation in device generator amplitude requirements, which suggests\ncompensation would be beneficial. Based on characterization results and the yield study,\ngenerator amplitude of 220 milliamp \xc2\xb1 10 percent with a temperature coefficient (tempco) of\n-0.4 percentrC should be specified for system operation.\nTransfer out operation is not critical in amplitude or in phase (\xc2\xb1 10 deg) for a 180 deg\npulsewidth. A wider pulsewidth (270 deg) provides improved phase margin.\nReplicator amplitude and phase as given in the lower curves of Figure 4-9 are both\nsatisfactory but need compensation for wider temperature operation and device to device\nvariability. Cut pulse amplitude at high temperatures causes spurious bubble nucleation above\n200 milliamp. A 25C value of 120 rna \xc2\xb1 10 percent with a tempco of -0.4 percent \xc2\xb0c should be\nspecified.\n\n32\n\n.\n\n160\n\n"\'~:~~XI\n~~\'\n\n150\n\nG(MAX)\nG(MIN)\n\n>280\n\n>280\n\n=\n\nG(MAX)\nG(MIN)\n\n165\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 I \xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\\:\n\n140\n\n130\n\n25C\n\n116\n\n\\.\n\nGENERATOR\n-1OC\n\n>280\n\n=\n\n75C\n\n120\n160\n\nI\n\n150\n\nTOIMIN) = 12\n\nTOIMIN) = 12\n\n./\'\n\nj\n\niii\n0\n\nw\n\nt; 140.-a:\nw\n\n0\n\n~ 130\niii\n\nTRANSFER OUT\n\n-lOC\n\nN\n\n120\n160.\n\n1501-- I\n\nI\n\n140\n\nRIMAX)\nRIMIN)\n\nI\n\nK\n\nI\n\n"\'.\nREPLICATOR CUT\n-1OC\n\n00\n\n25C\n200\n\n2500\n\n50\nLEADING EDGE PHASE IDEG) FROM PEAK X\n\nt.)\nt.)\n\n7.e\n\nRIMAX) = 200\nRIMIN) = 90\n\nRIMAX) >240 rnA\nRIMIN) = 100 rnA\n\n>260\n130\n\n130\n\n120\n\nII\nt-:\n\n~\n\nI\nI\n\n25C\n\nTOIMIN) = 13\n\nFigure 4-9.

Table 4-2 summarizes current density, pulsewidth and\nduty cycle for the D11 06 deSign. A simple lifetime test of 4 months was conducted on the\nreplicators of nonoperating die at 25C to determine if a hazard exists. Eight chips were tested\nwith a range of current from 80 rnA to 195 rnA at 100 kHz. No failures or changes in resistance\noccurred for the 10 12 pulses even for the chips with 195 rnA of current (107A/cm2). Published\ndata [Ref 4] on electromigration effects in bubble memory devices indicate generate and\nreplicate cut operators should have lifetime greater than 10 15 operations or 107 hours.\n\n4.4 DETECTOR CHARACTERIZATION\nDetection for the D11 06 design uses a full shorted back-to-back chevron detector chosen\nfor its stability and convenient signal phasing. As shown in Figure 4-10, two detectors are used\nfor alternate bit detection which reduces overlap signal. Each detector has three sections to\nimprove first bit detection. Figure 4-11 is the signal signature of the detector. The bubble strip\nand its signal influence can be traced through the detector as follows. On the left, the bubble is\nat the chevrons in the start/stop direction at 0 deg just prior to entering the active detector.\nThere is no change in strip position until about 135 deg into the cycle when it moves to the first\ndetector. At 180 deg magneto resistance change for a bubble strip is greatest because the strip\nis directly under a shorting bar where bubble field and detector current is mostly orthogonal. As\nthe bubble strip moves across the detector, output decreases partly because bubble field and\ndetector current are more aligned with each other and partly because of retardation of local\nfields by the bubble strip. Another peak occurs when the bubble strip is at the output shorting\nbar. Exactly the same process occurs in the dummy detector except that signal polarity is\nreversed because of differential sensing.\nMagnetoresistance signal pickup of the bubble strip after leaving the dummy detector\n(overlap) still occurs but with less impact than the previous 1067 design. Cycle three has a\nsignal at 180 deg which will subtract from an adjacent bubble strip signal. This can be avoided\nin redesign by choosing the second detector as the active detector. Figure 4-11 was obtained\nusing sine wave drive at 50 Oe at room temperature.\nSignal stabilty versus drive field for a trapezoidal drive waveform is shown in Figure 4-12.\nNoise is excluded as a variable by plotting the difference between a baseline without bubbles\nand a baseline with bubbles to obtain only bubble influence.

A peak detector is desirable in system application.

Above this value which corresponds to approximately 30 milliwatts of\ndissipation, detector sensitivity begins to drop significantly.

MEMORY CELL DESIGN AND TEST\n5.1 CELL DESCRIPTION\nBasic bubble memory storage is provided by the memory cell shown in Figure 5-1. The\nmemory cell contains eight 1OaK bit bubble memory chips and the magnetic circuits elements\nrequired to operate them.\nThe eight chips are mounted on two ceramic hermetically sealed chip carriers, stacked\nand inserted into the cell. The memory cell contains two orthogonal coils to generate the\nrotating field and a permanent magnet assembly to generate the bias field. The photographs,\nFigures 5-2 and 5-3 illustrate the principal components of the carrier and cell assemblies.\nThe cell is operated such that all chips are accessed in parallel. With a rotating field rate of\n166 kHz, the cell can be read or written at 1.33 Mb/s.\nPrincipal components of this cell include eight bubble chips, hermetic chip carriers, X-Y\ncoils, ferrite field spreader plates, ceramic bias magnets, and a permalloy shield keeper. The\noverall physical and electrical characteristics of the cell are summarized in Table 5-1.\nThe 8 x 105 bit cell magnetics assembly as shown in Figure 5-4 utilizes a double openended X coil which is unique in that it is a wound assembly and has rectangular magnet wire to\nminimize dc resistance. Details of this coil assembly are shown in the photograph, of Figure\n5-5.\nThe carrier assembly provides total environmental protection for the chips as they are\nenclosed in a ceramic hermetic cavity which is sealed by glass and indium interfaces. Details of\nthe various seal interfaces are shown in Figure 5-6. Interconnect to the carriers is from both\nends to facilitate minimum noise circuit geometry at the memory module level.\nThe two carriers are precisely located and locked into the cell by end cap hardware which\nis part of the magnetics assembly, as shown in Figure 5-1.\n\nFigure 5-1. 8 x 105 bit cell assembly.\n\n41\n\nFigure 5-2.

Hermetic carrier section.\n\n44\n\nt CERAMIC\n\n5.2 CARRIER DESIGN\nAn exploded view of the dual carrier assembly is shown in Figure 5-7. Four 100 kilobit\nserial chips are mounted face down on each carrier as illustrated. Principal components of each\ncarrier include the aluminum oxide thick film metallized, printed wiring board (PWB), front and\nrear epoxy glass spacers, 22 beam leaded selection diodes, aluminum oxide seal ring, solder\npreform and an aluminum oxide cover. Chips are adhesively bonded active surface down on\nthe ceramic PWB. Interconnect from the chip to the PWB is through 0.7 x 3 mil beam bonds.\nThis. interconnect geometry is highly planar minimizing inductive pickup of rotating field noise\ninto sensitive detector circuits.\nThe aluminum oxide PWB has two layers of gold thick film metallized circuit conductors on\nthe front side and a gold thick film metallized ground plane on the back side. Interconnect to the\nPWB is from both ends to implement physical isolation of the detector and operator functions at\nthe carrier and system level.\nDetector conductors are 5 mils wide on 10 mil centers and are routed under the chips, to\nbeam lead diodes which connect to terminations on one end of the PWB. These conductors are\nlaid out as differential pairs and are flanked by 5 mil wide guard lines along most of their length.\nAll detector lines are on the first metallization layer and are shielded by the back side ground\nplane.\nDetector line paths from the edge of the chip field to the PWB terminations have additional\nshielding implemented by a second ground plane which is part of the second level front side\nmetallization. The operator circuit conductors are laid out along the outside perimeter of the\nchip field and are terminated to pads on the opposite end of the PWB away from the detectors.\n\n45\n\nCOVER\n\n~BUBBLE\n\n~_I\nBEAM LEAD DIODE\n\n--~~oo\n\nCHIP\n\n"""J\n\n\'BEAMS\nREAR SPACER\n\nSEAL RING - - - - - + U . . /\n~t--_--CARRIER\n\nNO.1\n\n>?"--------CARRIER NO.2\n/\n\nCERAMIC PWB\nGROUND------__-4~\nCABLES .........",=:::==7/~\n\nFigure 5-7. NASA 8 x 105 bit dual carrier assembly.\nThis conductor/ground plane layout geometry effectively separates the detector circuits\nfrom the operator circuits and minimizes reception of cross coupled noise.\nThe two PWB\'s required have identical layouts in the chip field area; however the\ntermination pads are offset to the right of center on the top and the left of center on the bottom\nPWB. This offset is implemented to eliminate interconnect cable crossover and simplify fan out\ngeometry to the multi-layer board.\nAn aluminum oxide ring is glass sealed to the ring dielectric on the PWB. Once chips have\nbeen mounted and have passed acceptance testing, a metallized cover is solder reflowed to\nthe seal ring as shown in Figure 5-6 to provide a hermetic chamber for the bubble chips.\nMajor considerations in the design of the carrier include a hermeticity requirement\n(described in Section 5.6), Power dissipation, and noise. As far as carrier design is concerned,\npower dissipation in minimized (also the volt amp product) by minimizing volume of active chip\narea by reducing space between chips and space for covers and PWBs.\nInductive and capacitively coupled noise is a major concern in bubble chip packaging.\nSources of inductive coupling (d<!>/dt) are the chip bond leads, PWB surface sense conductors\ninside the coil, and the conductors as they egress from the coil. Area between differential\nconductors exposed to the rotating field vector produce a sense line voltage proportional to\nfrequency and to field magnitude. Face down bonding of beam leaded bubble chips ensure low\nand consistent pickup while minimum area between sense conductors inside the coil virtually\neliminates d<!>/dt pickup except from the leads as they egress from the coil. At the coil egress a\nZ component of the rotating field creates d<!>/dt pickup of one polarity above center plane and of\nopposite polarity below center plane. The two carriers in the cell are well balanced so that d<!>/dt\npickup is on the order of 0.2 millivolts during signal time but opposite in polarity between\ncarriers.\n\n46\n\nCapacitively coupled noise (cross coupling) is a rate of voltage change pickup from the\ncoil to the sense leads. Very small currents flow into detectors to produce unbalanced or\ndifferential voltage at the sense amplifier input. Control of the currents involves electrostatically\nguarding the differential sense conductors. Since the noise is proportional to the second\nderivative of the coil current, the noise becomes a severe aggravation as coil operating\nfrequency is increased and for trapezoidal or triangle wave forms which have high frequency\ncomponents. Placement of the electrostatic guard relative to the coil and conductors and\nimpedance control to system ground are important factors in the design.\nEstablishing the number of carriers for eight chips is relatively straightforward. A single\nchip carrier has minimum total parts and associated assembly costs\' but requires a chip\nmounting area which is large enough for eight chips. This requires a drive coil and bias\nstructure large enough to provide a uniform field over the eight chip area. Driven area can be\nreduced by 50% when the chips are packaged on two carriers, each having four chips. Four or\nmore carriers could also be used but, the combined carrier thickness and increased\ninterconnect difficulty would offset the efficiency gained by using two carriers. Based on this a\ntwo carrier design was adopted for the cell.\nTo reduce the number of carrier interconnects, the two detectors of each chip are\nmultiplexed at the carrier level with an array of diodes. As these diodes are in the rotating field it\nis necessary that noise pick up be minimized and thus planar beam lead diodes are used as in\nthe earlier SSDRdesign.\nIn terms of the total package, hermetic sealing is required to assure reliable operation after\nexposure to high humidity with condensation. Such condensation may result in damage to both\nlead bonds and the memory chip if the cell interior is not protected. Options available include\nsealing the entire cell in a hermetic enclosure or sealing at the bias shell level. Sealing at the\ncarrier level was ultimately adopted in order to complement the final interconnect design and\nminimize polymeric material constraints.\nAn epoxy glass laminate plate having a central rectangular aperture is adhesively bonded\nto the PWB and serves to space the two carriers apart and increase the strength of each\nindividual carrier. A small hole in one end of the plate (and PWB) is provided for pin alignment\n(Y axis) of the carrier to the cell magnetics.\nPolyimide insulated etched and gold plate copper flexible cables are solder-terminated to\neach end of the carrier PWB.\n\n47\n\n5.3 CELL MECHANICAL CHARACTERIZATION\nExperience with the earlier solid state data recorder (SSDR) 1.64 x 106 bit cell pointed to\nthe necessity for improvement of operating m(!rgin, reduction of coil power, volt amp product,\nparts count and complexity. The number of memory elements to be packaged in a memory cell\nis a function of a number of considerations. Included in these are weight, volume, power, data\nrate and device yield. At a minimum, a cell must contain sufficient memory elements to allow\ndelivery of the required data rate. Although two or more cells may be operated in parallel to ,\nobtain a given data rate, it would require additional coil drive components and is undesirable\nfrom that standpoint. The system requirement on data rate is 1.33 Mb/s (instantaneous). The\nminimum allowable number of chips per cell is established by this requirement in combination\nwith the drive field frequency at which the cell runs. A drive field of 166.6 kHz was selected as\nbeing consistent with good bubble chip operating margins, efficient drive circuit operation, and\nlow thermal gradients. With this field rate, the data rate requirements are met with eight or more\nchips per cell.\nThe greater the number of chips in a cell, the more difficult it is to obtain well matched bias\nmargins from a given chip population. Increased chips per cell will result in reduced composite\ncell bias margin as compared to the individual die.\nTo illustrate this trade off, wafer level test data taken on 128 memory elements was used\nto establish how composite cell bias margin varies with number of chips/cell. Measured bias\nmargin of the die was used as a sorting criteria to divide the 128 memory element into groups\nrepresenting cell populations ranging in size from one to 16. This sorting was done in a manner\nto obtain best possible overlapping bias margin for each of the groups. Average overlapping\nbias margin of all the groups for each cell population was calculated and is illustrated by the\ngraph of Figure 5-8. In addition, the weight and volumetric efficiency (normalized to a sixteen\nchip cell) was calculated for each cell chip population. This data is also presented in Figure 5-8.\nObviously, to obtain best possible bias margins, a single chip cell would be used. However, this\nwould result in a cell weight and volume more than three times that obtained with a 16 chip cell.\nConversely a sixteen chip cell while very efficient in packaging terms has overlapping bias\nmargins 44% less than a single chip cell. Clearly some compromise between these extremes is\nrequired. An eight chip cell was selected as this compromise, providing a 60% reduction in cell\nweight and volume at the expense of a 27 percent reduction in bias margin when compared to a\nsingle chip cell. Based on an analysis of the required overlapping cell bias margin, this was\nselected as an acceptable compromise between bias margin and packaging efficiency.\nAn additional reason for maintaining the number of chips per cell at close to the minimum\nrequired for the 1.33 Mb/s data rate has to do with cell volt-amp product, cell power dissipation\nand power supply weight and volume. In terms of driving the cell, the coil volt-amp product is\napproximately proportional to coil volume at a given frequency and drive field. As the number of\nchips in a cell is increased, the volume and thus volt-amp product is also increased which in\nturn increases the energy required to be supplied from the coil drive transistors. As shown in\nFigure 5-9, the volt-amp product for an eight chip cell is 30% less than that for a 16 chip cell and\nis within a region of capability for readily available single power transistors.\n\n48\n\nt\n\nt\n\n12\n11\n\n>c.J\n\nw 10\n\n.\n\n0\n\nz\n\na\na:\n\nZ\n\nw\n\n9\n\nC3\n\nu::\n\n8\n\nu.\n\n<\n\nw\n\n:E 7\n\nC)\n\nz\n\n~ 6\n\nC)\n\niii\n\n-l\n-l\nW\n\nc.J\n\nw\n\nt-\n\n<\n~\n\nVOLUME EFFICIENCY\n\n5\n\nc.J\n\n4\n\nen\n\n>\n\n2\n\n0\n\n:E\n\n<\n\n0-\n\nw\n\n3\n\n0-\n\n-1\n\n.5\n\n~\n\nw\n\n0\n\na:\n\nc.J\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17\nCHIPS/CELL ___\n\nFigure 5-8.

As shown in Figure 5-9, this power also increases with number of chips per cell\nbut the power per chip decreases significantly. From a cell standpoint, maximizing the number\nof chips per cell produces the greatest power efficiency but from a system power basis this\nefficiency is maximized at the minimum number of chips in a cell necessary to provide the\nrequired data rate. This arises because the typical switching power supply has a small energy\nstorage capacity and thus must be designed for peak load which increases with the number of\nchips and results in an increase in power supply standby dissipation, weight and volume.\nRequired holding field is obtained by tilting the drive coils within the bias structure rather\nthan tilting the chips. Such an approach- has two potential advantages. First it minimizes coil\nvolume and results in a corresponding decrease in coil drive power. This is particularly\nimportant since the tilt direction is normal to the pad edge of the chips, resulting in an increased\ncoil dimension in the tilt direction which would greatly increase cell volume if the chips were\ntilted in the coil. Secondly, it reduces any components of the drive field normal to this memory\nelement surface caused by tilting the memory elements within the coil. The only concern with\nthis approach is the asymmetry of the coil with respect to the ferrite bias plates which could\ncause some distortion of the drive field.\nThe cell magnetics assembly as shown in Figure 5-4 utilizes a tilted X-V drive coil\nassembly having a unique X coil which is open at both ends. The open ended feature allows the\nX coil to be adhesively bonded to the Y coil for maximum heat transfer and because the open\nends allow ready removal of the chip carriers when required. Referring to Figure 5-5 the X coil\nis fabricated by winding two edge wound rectangular spirals which are subsequently formed\ninto a channel shape around which the Y coil is wound and adhesively bonded. The penalty\npaid for the open end feature is 20% increase in total coil surface area and power dissipation.\nThe coils are wound with a single layer of solid copper rectangular wire 1.55 skin depths thick\n(0.25 mm) which is calculated as the optimum thickness for minimum ac resistance of a solid\nconductor single layer coil at the 167 kHz rotating field frequency. The particular coil fabrication\nprocesses developed were not compatible with litz conductors which would have reduced the\nac resistance.\nBias field for memory element operation is generated by the two permanent magnets in a\nseries circuit consisting of the permalloy shield/keeper, ferrite bias plates and the airgap which\ncontains the drive coils. Permanent magnets have a temperature coefficient that tracks the\nvariation of memory element center bias value with temperature. A Magnet Materials\nProducers Association (MMPA) ceramic type 1 magnet was used which has a temperature\nThe ferrite plates serve the dual purpose of ensuring bias\ncoefficient (tempco) of -0.18% per\nfield uniformity and acting as a keeper for the rotating magnetic field generated by the drive\ncoils. Permalloy shield/keepers also serve a dual function of providing a return path for the bias\nfield and shielding the memory cell from external magnetic fields. The thickness (30 mils) and\nlength of the permalloy shield is sufficient to attenuate a 20 Oe. external field to operationally\nacceptable levels in the cell interior. -The shield also operates inversely in that it keeps the fields\ninterior to the cell from fringing outside the coil.\n.\n\nce.\n\n50\n\n5.3.1 Cell Thermal Analysis\nA prime consideration in this cell design is to minimize the cell temperature rise above\nambient in order to maximize the upper memory operating temperature limit. It is also very\nimportant to minimize the temperature differential between the chips and magnets in order to\nnot limit the operating bias margin by an offset between the field supplied by the magnets and\nthe field required by the chips. Conduction heat transfer is the principal mode for distribution\nand removal of thermal energy dissipations in the cell. The principal significant heat to be\nconducted is the 4.3 watts being dissipated by the X and Y coils when they are running at the\nrequired data rate.\nHeat transfer to the carriers is by conduction through air and radiation when the cell is\noperated in a ground based environment and by radiation only when operated in space\n(vacuum) environment. Both of these conditions are analyzed. The analysis is based on the cell\nbeing adhesively bonded to a heat rail as in the BMM configuration thus the principal\nconduction heat flow path is through the bottom of the cell. The various internal paths are as\nfollows and listed in order of magnitude.\n1. From the bottom of the coils through the bottom magnetics, shield keeper wall and\nadhesive interface to the heat rail. Referring to Figure 5-10, these paths are between\nnodes 3, 4, 8, 9, and S.\n2. From the top of the coils, through the top magnetics, around the shield keeper and\nthrough the adhesive interface to the heat rail. As shown in Figure 5-10 these paths are\nbetween nodes, 1, 2, 6, 9, and S.\n3. From the top of the coils to the bottom of the coils by the Y coil windings. This is the\nnode 2, 4 path shown in Figure 5-10.\n4. From the top and bottom of the coils to the chip carriers as represented by paths\nthrough nodes 2, 1, 5 and 4, 3, 5 in Figure 5-10.\n5. From the carrier covers through the carrier and flex cables to the MLB surface as\nrepresented by the path through nodes 5, S shown in Figure 5-10.\nA critical path for balance of magnet temperatures is around the permalloy shell as\ndescribed above. A high efficiency path is also analyzed wherein a 10 mil thick copper liner is\nadhesively bonded to the 30 mil thick shield keeper.\nThe results of these analyses are summarized in Table 5-5.\nThe method of analysis was to develop an electrical analog model of the cell and calculate\nthermal resistances (and conductance) of the paths between the selected nodes. Conduction\nwas assumed as the only mode of heat transfer except in the case of the carrier/coil interface\npreviously described. The heat flow from the cell is assumed to be symmetrical about a vertical\ncenterline, thus the analog circuit and dissipations are for 1/2 of the cell. Two dimensional heat\nflow with line sources was assumed for most paths. The node equations were set up in matrix\nform (8 x 8) and processed on a T159 calculator using software programs ML02 and ML03.\n\n51\n\n.358-"-- CONDUCTANCE (1/R)\nWATTS/oC\nr--------{\n\nq:\n\nJ~Q\n\n-HEAT INPUT\n\n.554\n\n.033 1.00071-RADIATION ONLY\n\nb\n\n.016(.077)\n\nqT\n\n~\n.033\n\n2"\n\n1.00071\nqX\n\n4\n~HEATSINK\n\n.554\n\n\xc2\xae\n\n.358\n\nNode identification is\ngiven in tables 5\xc2\xb72 through 5-4 .\n\n.892(1.161)\n\n4.464\n\n\xc2\xae\nFigure 5-10. NASA 8 x 105 bit cell conduction heat flow schematic.\n\n52\n\nReferring to Figures 5-10 through 5-13 and Tables 5-2 through 5-5, it is shown that the\ncopper liner significantly reduces the top magnet temperature and is particularly effective at the\n6 watt 100 percent duty cycle power level. A weight penalty of .025 Ib cell is effected if the\ncopper is used. Copper plating was not implemented in the design because it was felt that the\ncell power would be close to 4 watts and because of added cost of the process step.\nBased on these calculations, which generally are considered conservative compared to\nactual measurements, the chips must be tested at more than 12C above specified mounting\nsurface temperature in order to validate operation for worst case temperature excursions. Cell\nevaluation conducted at the yield run (Sec. 6) was done at 75C to validate a 60C cell\ntemperature maximum. Another consequence of the analysis is that the upper magnet\ntemperature rises above chip temperature while the lower magnet remains below chip\ntemperature.

A rotating field is produced by the XlY\northogonal coils. Main electrical factors in their design include field uniformity, impedance, and\ninductance. Coil configuration and size are dictated by mechanical tolerance requirements and\nby electrical requirements. Bias field as produced by the magnetic circuit of the shell is required\nto be set for each cell\'s specific chip bias range requirements. The field is expected to be\naccurate over the chip\'s surface and to track the chip\'s thermal coefficient. Holding field which\nis provided for by tilting the coil in the bias assembly, is required for maintaining a strong\nattraction between permalloy elements and bubbles when rotating field is turned off. Table 5-6\nsummarizes characterization results given in more detail in the following sections.\n\n5.4.1 Coil Field Uniformity\nField uniformity is a factor in cell design and operation. The lowest value of field in the chip\narea determines minimum drive requirements while the highest field in the area determines\nnoise and conversion in worst case. An AC probe was used to determine field shape and\nconversion into other directions. It is a three axis movable probe with micrometer adjustment\nwhich is capabable of profiling individual coils, completed cells or partial assemblies. Figure\n5-14 defines directions of the probe relative to the coil assembly and chips.\nSensitivity measurements were made by exciting the Y or X coil with a sinewave current at\n160 kHz and measuring the coil field with calibrated probe. The probe which is a miniature wire\ncoil was calibrated using a standard helmholtz coil. Geometric referencing of the probe was\ndone from the coil center. For Figure 5-15 and Figure 5-16 the probe was centered vertically in\nthe coil which is worst case as far as edge uniformity because of fringing at the open ends of the\ncoils. Actual chip active surface is 15 mils above center for the upper chips and 30 mils below\ncenter for the lower chips. Curves of Figures 5-15 through 5-17 were obtained by moving the\nprobe mounted on a micrometer controlled platform through the coil opening in parallel with the\ncoil\'s center line (Figure 5-14). Results are expressed as Oesteds of field produced per ampere\nof current in the coil.\nA major concern during cell development was higher than anticipated power dissipation of\nthe coil due to carrier covers of tantalum and due to X coil conductor loss in the Y field. Some\nimprovements were obtained by reducing cover thickness and by using a lower power drive\nwaveform. During hermetic sealing development it was found that seam sealing of tantalum\ncovers resulted in poor packaging yield compared to the indium seal. As these results show, an\nadded benefit of the indium seal is a 25 percent reduction of cell power.\n\n,\n\n58\n\n/\n\nREFERENCE CENTER\n\n~_-n--\n\nX COl L\n\n\'-...CENTER LINE\nCELL ASSEMBLY\n\nY\n\nz\n\nSUBSTRATE\n\n3AXIS\nPROBE\nx,h\n\nco\nSTART STOP\nDIRECTION\n\ny\n\nFigure 5-14. Field direction definitions.\nFigure 5-15 gives the field uniformity of the Y coil with and without tantalum covers.\nCovers require about 4 percent higher field at the edge of the chip area and they produce some\nasymm~try due to plating variability. Variability can be overcome by stamping from plated\ntantalum sheets. An extra tantalum cover was placed below the lower,carrier in order to\nmaintain field symmetry around center plane of the coil assembly. Field uniformity for the X coil\nis shown in Figure 5-16. In this case, covers reduce field by about 8 percent while making the\nfield more uniform. The center line of the coil (curve 1 and 2) is less uniform than the chip area\nedge field because the joint between the two halves of the coil spreads at the open ends.\nConversion of rotating field from Y into Z as shown in Figure 5-17 affects Z margin and\nnoise pickup. At vertical center, conversion is zero but at 30 mils below or above the center\nplane at the chip edge, pickup is about 0.7 Oe/A as shown in Figure 5-17.\n\n5.4.2 Cell Bias Field Evaluation\nTwo bias magnet configurations were evaluated over a temperature range from -20 to\n+ 60C. Magnet 1 consisted of a single magnet the same size as the cell_ ferrite. Magnet 2\nconsisted of 4 separate magnets with a total size slightly smaller than that of the cell ferrite.\nBoth magnets 1 and 2 were of the same MMPA ceramic type 1 material.\nTest procedure for determining cell coefficient involved measuring the gauss level of the\ncell as a function of temperature using a gauss probe inserted in the cell. Zero field drift and\nprobe gain were measured vs temperature and used to correct probe data. Figures 5-18 and\n5-19 are graphs of corrected cell measurements normalized to 25\xc2\xb0C. This procedure gives a\ncell coefficient value of -\'0.178%fOC for the large magnet and -0.174%fOC for the 4 small\nmagnets.\n59\n\n1-\n\n40\n\nCHIP FIELD\n\n-I\n\n35\n\nQ:\'\n~\n\n<:\n\n"CI)\n\n30\n\n2\nc\n\n..J\n\nw\nu..\n\n25\n\n>Curve 1 without tantalum\nCurve 2 with 3 Tantalum plates (8 mil)\nCoil 004\n\n0.5\n\nFigure 5-15.

To\nidentify component losses, individual coils were tested first alone and then again at stages in\nassembly. Design equations used at the beginning of the program predicted lower than\nmeasured Y coil losses for the case of metallics inside such as the X coil or metal covers.\nConsequently power dissipation will tend to be higher than predicted at the preliminary design\nreview except that other design strategies were used to reduce power. Overall, cell power\ndissipation will remain in the 5 watt range with tantalum covers and in the 4 watt range without\ntantalum covers.\nFigure 5-20 is a plot of coil resistance for a completed cell including carriers with 3\ntantalum covers. Slightly lower resistance is obtained (Figure 5-21) without tantalum covers.\nInductance was given in Table 5-6. Resistances listed in the table are averages of three final\ncell configurations.\n\n5.5 CELL ENVIRONMENTAL TESTS\nOne memory cell identified as the engineering cell was subjected to a series of\nenvironmental tests (figure 5-22) to demonstrate that the design is suitable for qualification\nprograms to NASA Specifications.\n\n62\n\n10.0\n\nw\nU\n\nZ\n\ng\nen\nw\nex:\n\n1.0\n\nFREQ (K HERTZ)\n\nFigure 5-20.

Environmental test sequence.\n\nTHERMAL\nCYCLE\n-40-.85C\n\nPerformance tests consisted of measurements at 25C which are most sensitive and\neffective in identifying electrically defective devices. The tests include, but were not limited to,\nsense window, Z bias margin, coil drive, operator drive, data pattern, start/stop, variable data\nrate operation and data retention. These tests, as applicable, were conducted prior to and after\neach environment exposure. Environmental tests were conducted as SSD\'s environmental test\nlab.\nPrior to mechanical testing, cell hardware was secured according to assembly procedures\nand the cell tested for baseline results. Cell bias was set close to the top of the margin for two\nchips as shown in Figure 5-23 in order to uncover vibration related data loss. Then the test\nsequence of Section 5.5.1 was started.\n\n5.5.1 Order of Environmental Test and Test Results\n1. Sinusoidal Vibration\nTest was in accordance with MIL-STD-883, Method 2007, Condition A, (20G peak 3\naxis).\nPost test results indicate no loss of data or margin shift.\n\n2. Random Vibration\nTest was in accordance with MIL-STD-810, Method 514, curve AM\nPost test results indicate no loss of data or margin shift.\n\n3. Shock\nTest was in accordance with NASA spec, exhibit 5, Para 4.2.2, Figure 4 (500G 3 axis).\nPost test results indicate no loss of data or margin shift.\n\n4. Sinusoidal Vibration\nTest was in accordance with MIL-STD-883, Method 2007, Condition B (50G 3 axis).\nPost test results indicate no loss of data or no margin shift.\n\n5. Random Vibration\nTest was in accordance with MIL-STD-810, Method 514, curve AN.\nPost Test results indicate no loss of data, no margin shift.\n\n6. Thermal Cycle\nTest was in accordance with MIL-STD-883, Method 1010, Condition B Temperature\nfrom -55 to + 125C\nPost test results disclosed several anomalies.\na.\nb.\nc.\n\nUnable to operate chip U3 top substrate.\nUnable to operate lower substrate chips.\nStored data scrambled in a tested chip. The cell was not expected to retain stored\ndata at the temperature limits of this test.\n\n65\n\nFailure analysis indicated that the cable conductors cracked at the carrier interface\nprobably because of extreme handling and the taped back position they were in during\nthe series of tests. It is probable that vibration and handling for testing deformed the\nconductors at the bond interface so that work hardening caused conductors to crack.\nIn addition a bond failure of a beam leaded diode occurred. Analysis of the failure\nindicated a probable cause of failure due to adhesive which was inadvertently\npermitted to flow under the diode. Repeated expansion and contraction of the\nadhesive stressed the bond to the point where it opened. Normally polymetric coating\nis avoided since the problem is well known. After repair of the cell the test was\nrepeated without incident.\n\n7. Humidity Test\nMagnetics assembly only was tested in accordance with MIL-STD-202, Method 103,\n.\nCondition B.\nAfter each environmental test Z bias margin was measured for the seven operating die\nof the cell. Except for one measurement point which was probably an error (chip 02 at\nbaseline), Z bias margin was repeatable within experimental error as shown by the\ntight clustering of the cell profile curves of Figure 5-23 for post tests, one through five.\nFollowing cell repair after thermal cycling and after humidity testing of the magnetics\nassembly, the cell was assembled and retested. All chips exhibited higher lower bias\nthreshold than previous tests by about 1 oe (Figure 5-23). Because of rework it is\ndifficult to precisely identify the cause of the shift without another series of tests.\n\n8.\n\nData Retention\nThe cell was subjected to thermal cycling according to Method 1010 except that the\ntemperature range was reduced to -40 to 85C. Data loss occurred on chips 02,03, and\n05. These were shifting errors and are typical of upper margin failure (see Figure 5-23).\nLowering cell bias to 146 oe (by 3 oe guard band) is required to provide data retention\nover the specification range.\n\nConclusions\nThis series of tests provide considerable confidence that the memory cell design is\nadequate for space qualified programs which require wider scoped qualification testing.\nQualification testing should include vibration, shock, thermal cycling, data retention as above\nbut also thermal vacuum and humidity of completed cells.\n\n5.6 CARRIER HERMETIC SEALING STUDY\nPrincipal features of the developed carrier include a thick film metallized ceramic substrate\nwhich is glass sealed to a refractory metallized seal ring which forms a hermetic cavity into\nwhich the chips are secured. Figure 5-6 illustrates the build-up of the chip cavity. A thin film\nmetallized ceramic cover is indium reflow soldered to the metallized seal ring forming the final\nhermetic package seal.\nThe basic substrate is fabricated from 96% aluminum oxide plate stock which is ground to\na .015 in (.38 mm) thickness. This ground substrate is metallized and insulated with standard\nthick film materials and processes. Hermetic testing at the thick film level shows that some\ndielectric materials are porous and were avoided for implementation in the final design.\n66\n\n157.6\n\n154.2\n\nCELL\n-\'SETTING\n\n149.0\n\nw\n\nQ\n0\n\n-I\n\nw\n\n143.8\n\n11.\n\nN\n\n140.4\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 .--.(!} ...........\n\n\xc2\xae-\n\n137.9\n\n-~\n\n..\n\n,\n\nPOST TEMP\n\n""""\xc2\xae- - --\n\n..\n\n~\n\n136.1\nCHIP LOCATION\n\no\n\n01\n\n02\n\n03\n\n04\n\n05\n\n06\n\n07\n\nCHIP LOCATION IN CELL\n\nFigure 5-23. Z bias margin for engr. cell at X/Y......, 40 Oe~250C.\n\n67\n\nThe 96 percent aluminum oxide seal ring is formed by stamping from un-fired green\nceramic and subsequently tungsten metallized on one side and fired at high temperature. The\nresultant ring is flattened by a vendor proprietary process and plated with nickel which is fused\ninto the tungsten for improved adhesion. The nickel is overplated with high purity gold which\nforms the final seal solder interface. A crystallizing glass was selected to provide the hermetic\nseal between the un metallized seal ring surface and the thick film metallized substrate. This\nglass material is screened onto both parts which are then subjected to two drying and one\nprefuse furnace cycles in an air environment. The two parts are subsequently aligned, clamped\nand fused together at 41 DC in an air atmosphere. Processing yield of test and design parts was\nnearly 100 percent upon completion of the process development. Gross leak testing was\nperformed on all parts by pressurizing the seal cavity which was closed off with a gasketed\nmetal plate. Helium tracer gas fine leak testing was also performed at this assembly level.\nBoth tantalum and metallized ceramic covers were evaluated during the seal\ndevelopment. Tantalum was initially selected as it is nonmagnetic, has a coefficient of\nexpansion matching the ceramic carrier and is compatible with progressive resistance heating\nseam reflow soldering. The covers were fabricated from .008 in.(.20mm) thick sheet which was\nnickel plated, vacuum baked and over plated with gold by a proprietary high adhesion process.\nSealing process development and coil loss testing ultimately resulted in the use of a .010\nin.(.25 mm) thick 99.5 percent aluminum oxide cover having thin film metallization on one side\nwhich was overplated with .0005 in.(.013 mm) of copper. The 99.5 percent aluminum oxide was\nselected because of its high elastic modulus (very stiff), strength, compat i bility with thin film\nmetallization, and flatness after processing. The thin copper plating provides the necessary\nelectrostatic shielding for the bubble chip interconnect and reduces eddy current loss for\nminimum coil power dissipation. The copper is also compatible with the sealing material\nultimately used.\nThree cover sealing processes were investigated during carrier development and are as\nfollows.\n1. Progressive resistance heating seam reflow soldering (seam sealing) of gold-tin alloy\npreform\n2. Progressive electron beam ref low soldering of a gold-tin alloy preform\n3. Mass reflow soldering using pure indium\nDevelopment started with the progressive flexure reflow of gold gold-tin solder as this\nprocess was currently in use for the seam sealing of all metal hybrid packages. The majority of\nthe development sealing was conducted using ceramic hybrid package bases and the tantalum\ncovers discussed. After extensive development efforts on sealing schedule the initial sealing\nyield on fifty packages was 50 percent and rework proved to be difficult. The very high adhesion\nof the gold-tin alloy to the metallized ceramic resulted in loss of metallization and ceramic\nchipping on most attempted rework. The low initial sealing yield was attributed to lack of\nflatness of the thin tantalum covers.\nA limited investigation into the use of electron beam technology for reflow of the gold tin\nwas initiated and it was found that the progressive localized heating caused cracking in the\nglass seal interface of the design carriers.\n68\n\nThe third and most promising fluxless process investigated involved mass reflow sealing\nof the metallized ceramic cover to the metallized seal ring surface using pure indium.\nNumerous packages were sealed successfully by a belt furnace bulk reflow of indium tinned\ninterfaces in an inert atmosphere at a peak temperature of 180C. The process as developed\nhas an initial seal yield in excess of 75 percent and multiple seals of reprocessed covers and\nrings were very successful. Leak rates (helium bomb) meeting the requirements of MIL-883A\nare typical. Some seal degradation from stress induced cracking was observed after\nthermocyCie (-55 to + 125C) and may be eliminated by copper plating the seal ring surface to\nminimize brittle gold-indium intermetallics.\n\n5.7 POLYIMIDE CHIP PASSIVATION\nDuring the SSDR program it was discovered that magnetic particles from dicing would\ndegrade or inhibit chip performance if the particle fell on the chip\'s active surface. A\ndemonstration showed that vibration would cause loose particles to move within the cell\nthereby randomly changing chip operation. A mylar spacer of about 1 mil glued to the chip\'s\nsurface was found to eliminate sensitivity to vibration and to eliminate the effect of further\nparticle contamination. The mylar spacer which was applied to chips individually after cleaning\nwas found to be cumbersome for large quantities of chips and of inconsistent quality because of\nthe difficult handling operation.\nA wafer coating of polyimide was therefore introduced as a combination passivation and\nspacer layer. Basically it is a thick coating of about .7 mils which is spun on and then pattern\netched to expose bonding pads. Two wafers of the first yield run and four wafers of the\nmanufacturing yield run were coated, etched, and evaluated for mechanical integrity. No\nsignificant mechanical degradation was observed after the humidity exposure for the test of\nFigure 5-24.\n\n+65\n\nI\n\n\\\n\nI\n\n,\n\n,\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nr\n\n1\n\n1\n\nI\nI\n\nu\ns:..\n\nREPEAT\n\n------\n\nw\n\na:\n\n-\n\n,\n\n::::>\n\nI-\n\n\xc2\xab\n\n~+25 r-\n\n\\\n\nI\n\n\\\n\na..\n\n:E\n~\n\n-+\n\n-\n\nAT 98% RELATIVE HUMIDITY\n\n\xc2\xb710\n\nI\n\no\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n1\n\n12\n\n24\n\n36\n\n48\n\n60\n\n72\n\n84\n\n144\n\nHOURS\n\nFigure 5\xc2\xb724.

CHIP YIELD RUN\nTwo yield runs were planned for the program, the first in a research environment followed\nby a yield run in manufacturing. Most of the data collected covers chips of the first run and a\nsubsequent evaluation of preliminary cells. Because of process and equipment difficulties and\nbecause of funding limitations, the second yield run was concluded without obtaining sufficient\ndie for further cell assembly and with little additional information.\n6.1 FIRST YIELD RUN DESCRIPTION\nEighteen 2-inch CaGe garnet wafers were chosen for the first yield run and processed in\nlots of four wafers each at the Electronics Research Center. Wafers were chosen with a\ncollapse field range of from 160 to 164 oersteds. Figure 6-1 is a process flow diagram which\ndescribes sequential steps in the process and probe testing. Table 6-1 shows vacuum\ndepositions, layer thickness, and tolerances which were targeted for device fabrication.\nResisitivity and circuitry measurements were made on monitor samples included with each run.\nTable 6-2 shows the various lithography steps in the process-Permalloy and conductor layers\nare high resolution steps requiring critical alignment while the oxide layer is noncritical because\nit blankets the register area.\n6.1.l Yield Summary\nYield can be calculated a number of ways. Table 6-3 gives the assumptions on the chosen\nmethod which was based on the number of wafers which were diced or which were consumed\nin process. Remaining wafers can be reprocessed so they were omitted although effort is\nexpended in partial processing and in preparation for reprocessing.\nWafer probe testing was done in two phases. The first phase was a screen to identify die\nacceptable for further testing while the second phase was the characterization of die at two\ntemperatures and two drive fields.\nDuring the yield run extra mechanical, magnetic, and electrical tests were conducted than\nnormal production practice in order to obtain statistical data for design and as background data\nfor anticipated production runs. Good die were found to be distributed on the wafers as shown\nin Figure 6-2. Except for the edge die only one location is void of good die which probably is\ncaused by a mask defect.\n6.1.2 Wafer Probe and Cell Test Results\nPropagation margins were measured at wafer probe and with the cell tester. Comparisons\nare given in Figures 6-3 and 6-6 as profiles according to the installed location within a cell.\nProbe data was obtained at 60 and 25C for conditions of 50 Oe of sinewave drive at 60C, and\n40, and 50 Oe at 30C. Probe Resistance data was measured at 60C but was extrapolated at\n25C for comparison purposes. Prober conditions were start/stop propagation with\nasynchronous data shift applied between write and read and complemented data for a second\npass. Cell propagatkm data was obtained from -1 OC to 60C for conditions of trapezoidal drive\nroughly analogous to 40 and 50 Oe of sinewave drive and for start/stop conditions. Testing\ninvolved writing once and reading continuously while Z field was varied until errors occurred.\n\n71\n\n"-J\n\nI\\J\n\nSUBSTRATE\nCLEANING\n\nION MILL\nPERMALLOY\nr---I HEAT SINK\nREMOVE RESIST\nINSPECT\n\nDEFINE\n~ BONDING PADS\nEXPOSE PADS\n\nH\n\nEVAPORATE\nSI0 2 BARRIER\nMONITOR:\nTHICKNESS\n\nH\n\nDEFINE PROPAGATION\nPATTERN\nSPIN RESIST\nPRE-BAKE\nEXPOSE\nDEVELOP\nINSPECT\n\n1---+\n\n(100 KHz)\n\nDETECTOR RESISTANCE\nBIAS RANGE\n60\xc2\xb0C & 30\xc2\xb0C\nGOOD DIE LOCATION\n\nI----I~~I PATTE RN\n\nSPIN RESIST\nPRE-BAKE\nEXPOSE\nDEVELOP\nETCH\nREMOVE RESIST\nINSPECT\n\nMONITOR:\nTHICKNESS RESISTIVITY\n\nH\n\nWAFER PBOBE\n\nDEFINE CONDUCTOR\n\nEVAPORATE AL (96%) CU\nCONDUCTOR\n\nSPUTTER PERMALLOY\nFILM\nMONITOR:\nTHICKNESS\nRESISTIVITY\nCOERCIVITY\nMAGNETO RESISTANCE\n\nH\n.\n\nDICE WAFER\nSORT & CLEAN I\nDIE\n\n~I\n\nH\n\nSPUTTER 51\xc2\xb02\nSPACER\nMONITOR:\n\n~\n\nTHICKNESS\n\nMOlJNT\nCHIPS\nON\nCARRIER\n\n)\n\nFigure 6-1.

Upper margin averages about the\nsame or both but differs for individual die. Lower margin averages consistently lower for cell test\nthan for probe test by about 3 Oe, which provides a greater margin than would be indicated by\nthe probe station. Data scatter is apparent in prober results because of the discrete Z step size\nof the prober and because of testing error of about \xc2\xb1 1 Oe. The reason for the consistent 3 Oe\nlower margin was not identified.\nMost of the yield decline (from 20 to 16 percent) in going from wafer probing to carrier\ninstallation was because of propagation failure (Table 6-4). About 10 die which failed\npropagation at cell test were not identified by the wafer prober, suggesting that a 15 percent\nfallout occurs due to dicing or due to handling. Previous testing indicates that garnet flecks (as\nobtained from dicing)\'affect propagation when they fall on critical locations, as discussed in\nsection 5.7.\n\n73\n\nCompilation of detector resistance statistics provides insight into process uniformity and\ninformation for matching bubble chips. A large factor in the sense budget for multiplexed\nsystems has been variability in bubble output signal which is correlatable to detector\nresistance. Some of the variability is removable without yield impact by selective placement of\ndie in a cell based on detector resistance matching. A histogram otdetector resistance for chips\nfrom the 1st yield run which were incorporated in preliminary cells is given in Figure 6-7.\nTABLE 6-3. CALCULATION OF YIELD\n.

Number 27 also failed all the time suggesting\na mask failure.\n\nA 20 percent spread in resistance is indicated. The next four figures (6-8 to 6-11) show\ncomparison between detector resistance as measured with a digital volt meter and cell tester\nsensitivity. A reasonable but not perfect correlation exists between detector resistance and\ndetector sensitivity. Correlation is less perfect between resistance and matrix breadboard\noutput measurements. Imprecise clamp release setting, amplitude measurement, and variable\n\n74\n\nzero noise are attributed as the cause of differences. Results suggest that detector outputs\nwhich are difficult to measure at wafer probe can be best matched using detector resistance\nwhich is easy to measure and fairly accurate.\nThe main factor in detector resistance variation is permalloy thickness variation due to\nsputtering process control and to analomies within the sputtering chamber. Figure 6-12 shows\nTABLE 6\xc2\xb74.

There\nappears to be a slight inverse relationship between reported permalloy thickness and detector\nresistance. Measurements are single point measurements and tend to ignore wafer and lot\ngradients.\n\n6.1.3 Operator Amplitude Statistics\nGenerator current amplitude and replicator current amplitude margins were measured at\nthe cell tester to determine best set values for the module and to determine optimum amplitude\ncompensation. Temperature compensation reduces the potential hazards at high temperature\n. of spurious bubble nucleation and the potential for reduced lifetime due to localized heating of\nelectromigration. Figuresl6\xc2\xb713 and 6-14 are the minimum amplitudes required for replication and\ngeneration. Each dot is a measurement.\nA lifetime test on replicators was started in October of 1979 to determine if a hazard exists\ndue to high amplitude and continuous operation such as could exist in some applications. No\nfailures or shifts in resistance were observed in the 1500 hours (5 x 10 12 pulses) of continuous\ntesting for the eight chips tested. Current ranged from 80 milliamps on several chips to 195\nmilliamps (107 amps per cm 2 ) on 2 chips.\n\n6.1.4 Detector Performance (Sense Budget)\nFigure 6-15 shows critical chip and cell sense factors as a sense budget. Primary budget\nfactor is the average of 32 bubble signals from the four cells, each measured as the\ninstantaneous difference between baseline and a single isolated bubble signal at strobe time.\nAs the memory module design developed, the module was changed to include peak\ndetection which provides about 10 percent more signal than shown in this budget.\nConsiderable variations (about \xc2\xb1 10 percent) as shown in Figures 6-8 to 6-11 occurred in\nsignal amplitude on the production run because of detector resistance variation due to\npermalloy thickness or linewidth variations.\n75\n\n-.,J\n\nm\n\n8\n\nsoc SCREEN\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\nO~I-4--r-~-r~--r-~-r~--r-.--r-\'--r-.--r~--r-~-r~--~~-r~--r-~-.-.--.--.-.-.--~~-+-.\n\n2\n\n314\n\nw\nU\nZ\n\n121314 15116 17 181920 2122123 242526 27 28 29130 3132333413536 37\nOPERATING DIE >1Oe\n\nw.\n\na:: 6\na::\n::>\n\n~\n\no\nu..\no\n\n4\n\n>-\n\n~ 2\n\nw\n::>\no\nw\n\na::\n\nu..\n\nO~I~-r~-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-.-r-.-r-+-+~~~~~~-.-.-.-.~~-;-\'\n~\n\n2\n\n3 I4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8 I 9 10 11\nCHIP LOCATION\n\n6\n\n6 OE AT 6OC/50 OE;>6 OE AT Joe/40 OE; &>8 OE AT Joe/50 OE\n\n4\n\n2\n\nO~I~~~~~-r-.~~-r-.-r-r-r-+~-\'-r-\'-r-,-t-t~-r-t-t~-t-\'~~-\'-1~~-\'\nFigure 6-2.

Generator min amplitude.\n\n85\n\nFactors listed to the right of the nominal signal of Figure 6-15 are factors which shift signal\namplitude and baseline thereby reducing composite 1-0 window in worst case. Detector\nmismatch is a statistical variation in detector sensitivity between active and dummy detectors.\nThe back-to-back configuration of the 01106 chip provides significantly reduced mismatch over\nthe 1067 chip used on the SSDR program. Rotating field sensitivity is a change in bubble\ninfluence on the detector from a preceding or a trailing bubble. D<l>/DT is voltage induced in the\ncell by coil current.\nA guard band for random detector noise is included in the budget for the 10-8 soft bit\nerror requirement of the contract. In evaluating the error rate of a number of individual chips on\nthe multiplexer of the prototype memory module it was found that the sense budget will shrink\napproximately 20 percent of nominal signal for a 10-8 error rate guarantee.\nThe 1.5 millivolts remaining on the budget times amplifier gain provides 60 millivolts of\nsignal to cover system noise, threshold set uncertainty and gain variability. Because chip and\ncell measurements indicate a potentially marginal situation relative to contract goals, an\noptional threshold per chip circuit was designed into the memory module.\nMeasurements of the module sense performance indicate that the circuit is not required\nfor most applications. The circuit can be used in those applications requiring temperature\nextremes or low error rates.\n\n6.1.5 Statistical Summary\nWafer probe data were fed into Rockwell\'s time share computer for compilation. Summary\nresults are given in Table 6-5. Data is for chips which passed a 6 Oe window criteria as\nopposed to data given in para 6.1.2 which is for installed die. Notice that bias deviation is excellent for the run, which made bias matching a simple process during cell assembly. The\ntight matching of the cells is attributable to a wafer selection criteria on collapse field of from\n160 to 164 Oersteds.\nDetector resistance measurements made on the probe station at the beginning of the run\nwere found to be inaccurate as confirmed by DVM measurements (See para 6.1.2) which\nexaggerated variation.\n\n6.2 MANUFACTURING YIELD RUN\nTwo8-wafer lots were started by manufacturing in mid-September of 1979. Seven wafers\nof the first lot were completed and found to have excessive miSSing permalloy elements caused\nby poor adhesion of the permalloy. No electrical tests were perfomed. Six wafers of the second\nlot were completed in November. A major problem occurred during ion milling when the wafer\ntemperature rose excessively which burned the photoresist. These wafers were probed to\nobtain 33 die (2 cells) for further cell tests. Table 6-6 gives results of the tests in terms of yield.\nCost considerations forced discontinuation of further processing and testing as part of this\ncontract.\n\n86\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\nSIGNAL\nMEASURED\nHERE\n\n<{\n\n::;E\n\n..r\n\nr\n<{\n\n>\n~\n\n4\n\n...J\n\n,.&=.~\n\n<{\n\nz\n\n1112 MV\n\n~\n\nCi)\n\nw\n\n...J\nOJ\nOJ\n\n2\n\n::::>\nOJ\n\n0\n\n110"\n\n-2\nNOMINAL\nSIGNAL\n\nen\n\'-J\n\nDETECTOR\nMISMATCH\n\n\xc2\xb15%\nX/V FIELD\nVARIATION\n\nADJACENT\nBUBBLES\n\nFigure 6-15.

The completed module is\nshown in Figure 7-1. An electronics board containing interface, power switching, timing,\noperator current sources, and part of the coil drive matrix is a wire wrap board with plug-in\nintegrated circuits. A wire wrap board was chosen over a multilayer board because of program\nfund availability. This was a fortuitous choice because a number of circuits required\nmodifications which were easily implemented during evaluation. A few circuits which will be\nidentified in the following sections require more development in order to improve dependability\nand manufacturability of the basic module.\nA single storage board was built and populated with five memory cells. Four circuit layers\nwere required in the board plus a voltage and ground layer. Few problems were found during\ncheckout of the board as compared to the electronic board. Isolated improvements to the basic\nlayout would be beneficial in order to eliminate jumpers from the board.\n7.1 ELECTRICAL BLOCK DIAGRAM\nA block diagram of the prototype for the minimum system is shown in Figure 7-2. A fully\npopulated system of eight boards requires expansion of the coil driver to a 4 by 16 matrix,\nseven additional sense multiplexers, and additional selection circuitry.\nBasic function control is provided by a 20 MHz clock which sequences a PROM to provide\na 28 function by 256 step sequence. Sixteen data bits, board address, cell address, and\nmemory control are provided by two interface sections which can be operated independent of\none another. Power switching and status monitors are provided by the power control section.\nA separate sense multiplexer is used on each storage board in order to provide detection\nof the low level signals. Outputs are high level TTL open collector logic at the board interface.\nOperator current sources are on the electronics board with the current flowing to the selected\nboard via the cell selection switches. Four coil drive hybrids are provided on the electronics\nboard with two on each storage board. In this way additional capacity can be added without\nadding a commensurate amount of electronics.\n7.2 SENSE MULTIPLEXER DESIGN\nAlthough multiplexed sensing involves careful engineering of chip magnetic assembly and\nprinted circuit board, the approach results in at least an order of magnitude reduction in power\nconsumption and components devoted to detection. Multiplexing permits a complex circuit to\nbe shared by using a simple switch per cell.\nOne of eight chips in each of eight cells is connected on a sense bus as shown in Figure\n7 -3. Each chip has two detector pairs for alternate bit detection which are connected through\nsteering diodes during alternate cycles. Two cell select switches (half an Ie) energize an\naddressed cell for both operator and sensing functions. A common cell select switch is used to\neconomize circuitry since little noise is added to the sense bus because the switch is a small\nimpedance to coupled noise relative to detector impedance.\n\n89\n\nco\no\nSTIFFENER FRAME~\n\nSTORAGE BOARD\n(4 LAYER PCB)\n\nWIRE WRAPPED\nELECTRONICS BOARD\n\n~\n\nMEMORY CELL\n\n..\nSTORAGE\nBOARD\nINTERFACE\n\nTEMPERATURE\nCOMPENSATION\nSENSORS\n\nFigure 7-1.

Cells are placed on\nthe storage board so that sense cables connect onto the sense bus to an isolated, completely\nguarded center section of the multilayer board as shown in Figure 7-4. Minimum practical line to\nline spacing and line width (both 7 mils) are used so that line capacitance for a fully populated\nboard is less than 160 picofarads and differential unbalance is less than 7.5 picofarads. Results\nof breadboard demonstration of the simulated multiplexer indicate that cells can be\ninterchanged and that bus loading can be varied with barely perceptible changes in signal\nshape or threshold. Breadboard tests demonstrated the feasibility of removable cells. Table 7-1\ngives the measured values of capacitance for both the storage board and the carrier\nconductors. Unbalance of approximately seven picofarads on two of the differential sense lines\ncan be reduced to less than two pf by slightly modifying the artwork. Bridge current pulse\nrecovery is affected by both unbalanced bus capacitance and unbalanced detector resistance.\nThe difference between recovery exponentials of the detectors using measured circuit\nelements as shown in Figure 7-5 can be minimized best by tight control of bus and carrier\ncapacitance.\n\n7.2.1 Sense Circuit Design\nAn operational amplifier based approach was chosen as a detection circuit (Figure 7-6)\nbecause of its lower power and for its ability to handle higher input voltages than most\ndifferential amplifiers. Common mode voltage at the amplifier\'s input range from seven to ten\nvolts due to the bridge current in the detector and semiconductor volta~le drop. Input offset can\nbe as high as 100 millivolts due to detector resistance unbalance and accumulated\nsemicond uctor tolerances.\nControl of offset is accomplished by amplifying the bubble Signal of about 8 millivolts to the\nmaximum safe amplifier limit and by AC coupling the single ended amplifier output to a\ncomparator. AC coupling the amplifier output instead of the input eliminates criticality of\nrestoring dual capacitors having low level signals and eliminates some parts.\nPerformance of the amplifier circuit with a pulsed input in the presence of offset is shown\nin Figure 7-7. Offset at (A) of Figure 7-6 is plotted against the "one" and "zero" signal at\ncomparator input (B). Offset rejection is about 200 to 1 with an amplifier input offset range of \xc2\xb1\n200 millivolts.\nDriving detectors with pulsed current rather than direct current increases signal amplitude\nwhile minimizing detector power dissipation. Detector current of 10 to 14 milliamps is pulsed on\nfor 2.5 microseconds in every other cycle (12 microseconds) for each detector in order to\nminimize detector temperature.

Bridge\nreference, threshold level and timing signals are generated external to the hybrid. Four\nchannels per ceramic substrate are hermetically sealed in a single package. A single conductor\nlevel substrate, noncritical parts alignment, and low power components are features of the\ndesign which permit conventional hybrid manufacture. An LSI version of the design could\naccommodate techniques such as matched resistor pairs and compensation to achieve\nimproved performance. General description and pin identification of the part is given in Figure\n7-8.\n\n7.2.3 Programmable Sense Threshold Circuit\nA circuit which provides a unique threshold for each chip was designed into the storage\nboard as a precaution in the event sense channel noise exceeded expectations. It is a simple\nlow power circuit (Figure 7-9) requiring two Ie\'s, eight diode packages, and a resistor per chip\n(64). An address line energizes a threshold rail with the reference voltage which supplies the\neight sense channels with threshold voltages. During checkout, module sensing of detection\nwas found to be adequate without the full use of the circuit. Instead the reference voltage was\nconnected at point A which provides a separate threshold per channel. Retaintng the circuit as\npart of the design provides capability to improve margin for applications with stringent\nrequirements.\n\nPACKAGE SIZE\nPINS\nCHANNELS\nLINEAR GAIN\nPWR REG:\n+12V\n-12V\n+5V\nPOWER ON\nSETTLING\nTIME\n\n1" xl. 1 " x 1/8"\n32\n4\n40\n920 MILLIWATTS\n40MA\n30MA\nl6MA\n15J.Ls\n\nUNSWITCH 12V\nPWR SWITCH\nSWITCH 12V\nBRIDGE PULSES\nE1-\n\nEH\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n5\n6\n\nCHASSIS GND\n7\nBRIDGE PULSE 2 8\nE2- 9\n\nGENERAL CHARACTERISTICS\n\nE4+\n\n16\n\nPIN IDENTIFICATION\n\nFigure 7-8.

At about 60 deg into the cycle when the desired peak field is reached, X1 is\nturned off which forces coil current through D1 from ground through X4. This provides the\ncharacteristic shallow decay or flat top of the trapezoidal wave. After about 120 deg into the\ncycle, X4 is turned off which causes current\'to exponentially decay to a negative value (-VIR)\nuntil energy is dumped at about 1800 into the cycle. The above process repeats for the negative\nhalf (180 - 360 deg) of the cycle using switches X2 and X3.\nBy using four timing signals per coil (8 total) a trapezoidal, triangle, or any general\nwaveform combination can be provided which allows optimization of bubble chip operation for a\nparticular cell design. Triangle waveforms require only two digital timing signals per coil but\nimplementation of the triangle waveform is restrictive as related to amplitude and phasing\ncombinations.\n\nX2\n\nX1\n\nV+\n\nV+\n\nV+\nX3\n\n--MHI-t\n\n03\n\nCOIL\n\n04\n\nFigure 7-10.

Four drivers are on\nthe electronics board and two drivers are on each storage board. A full system of eight boards\nrequires 40 drivers (20 X; 20Y) whereas a nonmatrixed configuration would require 256 drivers.\nThe driver hybrid circuit is shown in Figure 7-12. The top switch is a floating switch which\npermits large voltage swings on the emitter while the bottom switch is direct coupled. A\ncapacitor, diode, and resistor network is used on the clamp node of each switch to supply\nenergy during switch transistors in order to reduce the potential of secondary breakdown.\nPhysical characteristics of the hybrid and its pin out identification are given in Figure 7-13.\n103\n\nV C.....,30VOLTS\n\n~\n\nI\nI\n116\n1\n\nr-.J\nI\n\nI\n\nDRIVER\n\nT\nI\nVC t--11---...-......,\n4\nI\n\nI\n\n1/2 HYBRID\nCAPABLE OF "\'- i\nTRAPEZOI DAL \'f\nOR TRIANGLE\nDRIVE\n\nI\n-:- I\nI\nI\n\nBALUN\n\nT\n\nI\n\nVel\n\ni:\n\nCOIL\n\nI\n\n3\n\n-=--I_~~>----I"\nI\n\nI\n\nI\nL __ "\'::_\'-:\'J\nFigure 7-12.

A sinewave driver had been used on the small coils of the\nfeasibility model [Ref 1] but circuits such as in Figure 7-14 had not been evaluated for larger\ncapacity cells or for a matrix of cells. A trapezoidal drive matrix had been used successfully on\nthe SSDR [Ref 2]. As is summarized in Table 7-3 the sinewave driver represented a riskier,\nmore complex design approach but with potentially lower power than the trapezoidal matrixed\ndrive. As a result of a design review of the tradeoffs, a trapezoidal driver with selected\nimprovements became the chosen approach for the memory module. This choice has\nsimplified implementation, precluded tuning, and allowed concentration on more critical\naspects of module design.\n\nVee\n\nR2\n\nR7\n\nI\n\nC3\n\n05\n\nTO STOP ..................- .....\nCIRCUIT\n\nC1 ,"\n\n+55\n\nR8\nR9\n\nSELECTE~\n\nC2\n\nSTART\n\nRUN\n\nFigure 7-14.

Two effects, holding field and intra cycle field uniformity, were found to affect signal for\ndesired low drive field operation. The top two curves of Figure 7-15 show how reducing drive\nfield from 50 to 40 oersteds affects bubble detector influence in a cell which has a five oersted\nholding field. A sinewave was used in the measurement because of its constant field amplitude\nlocus which excludes drive variables from consideration. This holding field effect was not\nobserved at chip characterization because characterization was done with a SSDR cell (3 Oe\ntilt) using a trapezoidal drive. The bottom curves show the result of reducing holding field to\nzero. Both signal peaks are affected similarly when drive field is reduced.\nIn order to retain necessary holding field and to minimize drive, a locus balanced\ntrapezoidal drive waveform was adopted. Applied digital timing waveforms are unbalanced so\nthat X coil current plus the equivalent holding field current provides a nearly constant field\namplitide locus, especially prior to and during bubble strip detection.\nIntra field uniformity which was the other aspect of the observed problem, is affected by\ncell inductance and resistance (L/R) as well as digital timing. Time constant (L/R) of the new\ncell increased 50 percent for X and decreased 250 percent for Y from the SSDR cell. Digital\ndrive therefore had to be modified to provide a more uniform locus (X2 + y2) as well as to\nprovide a tilt corrected locus.\n\n5\nHOLDING\nFIELD\nPEAK\n\n1\n1800\n\nPEAK 1\n1800 +\n\no\n\nDETECTOR\n\nHOLDING\nFIELD\n\nBUBBLE INFLUENCE\n\nFIELD LOCUS\n\nCHEVRON STACK\n\nFigure 7-15.

The plots are\ncalculated values based on the digital switch timing and the (UR) time constant of the coils,\nwhile the photo is actual coil current measured at the module for a single cycle with system\nvoltage at 28 volts. Field Amplitude locus (A = X 2 + y2) is shown in Figure 7-17. Orthogonality\nbetween X and Y fields is excellent but absolute amplitude digresses about \xc2\xb1 15 percent from\naverage. High points at A are desirable from a detection view-point but low points such as at B\nmay limit performance at low drive field, particularly for replicator operation. Further evaluation\nis desirable. In any case the generalized trapezoidal waveform offers more flexibility in\nmatching coil characteristics to system drive than does a triangle drive. This is because the flat\ntop duration of the trapezoidal wave can be varied to compensate for unequal rise and fall time\nslopes of the two coils.\n\nX CURRENT\n\nI/DIV\n\n>\nCl\n\n"-\n\n\xc2\xab\n.....\n\nIZ\nw\n\na::\na::\n::::>\nu\n...J\n\no\nU\n\n1800\n\n00\n\n1800\n\nPhase (degrees)\nFigure 7-16.

During read, current from the\nreplicator current sources and from the sense channel current sources flows to the energized\ncell through saturated switches to ground. Diodes of all unenergized cells are back biased by\nthe pull up resistors (5K) in the selection switch IC. A common coil select switch for read and\nwrite is used to economize circuitry since little noise is added to the sense bus because the\nswitch is a small impedance to coupled noise relative to detector impedance. During write,\ncurrent from the transfer \'out current source and the generators flows to ground through the\nselection transistors. In order to keep peak current well within the 600 milliamp rating of the\n55326 quad selection switch, only two generators\' current sources are turned on at a time.\n108\n\n60\n\n.-\n\nen\n0\n\n50\n\nw\nI(J)\n\nn::\nQ\nw\n\n~\n\xc2\xab\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n....\n\nZ\n~\n\n(J)\n\n:::::>\n\nu\n\n0\n\n-I\n\n10\n\n1800\nPh ase\nFigure 7-17.

Demonstration of the\nmultiplex concept for bubble operation was one of the major accomplishments of the program.\n7.5 TIMING AND CONTROL CIRCUITRY\n\nTiming for the module is generated from a 21.33 MHz crystal oscillator (Figure 7-19). The\noscillator operates an 8-bit binary counter and a four phase clock generator. After user clock\n(USCK) initiates an operation, the counter steps the 512 by 8-bit PROM through its addresses\nuntil a recycle command or an End of Count (EOC) is encountered. The PROM addresses are\ndivided into four phases so that the control signals can be expanded into four sets of latches.\nThis arrangement is more power conservative than a multiple PROM arrangement. Address\nzero is the wait state while address 66 is zero degrees. There are 128 states per rotating field\ncycle operating at 166.6 kHz, which gives theoretical resolution of 46.9 nanoseconds on pulse\nedge placement. Because of the 4 phase operation, minimum pulse width is 187.5\nnanoseconds adjustable in increments of 187.5 nanoseconds.\nTwo problems were uncovered during evaluation of the design. The first is that the 21.33\nMHz clock doesn\'t stabilize after power turn-on for at least 20 microseconds dependent on\nsupply voltages. The problem appears to be basic to crystal oscillators. For zero standby\noperation a new approach such as a delay line circuit used typically on other magnetic\nmemories should be evaluated. An example is a delay line square wave generator produced by\nEngineering Components Company for 0 to 70C. operation. The other problem is that of\nswitching time variations of the PROM. Outputs of the PROM do not switch constituently with\neach other.

The signals were rerouted with surface\nbonded wires. Major problems on the electronics board were with the timing PROM and the\noscillator turn on as discussed in Section 7.5.\nDuring checkout, three chips were lost by an inadvertent short between generator and coil\ndrive voltage. The three were replaced with marginal chips in order to provide operative cells.\nFive additional chips were found to be marginal for the reasons identified jn Table 7-4. In a\nconventional production program only three of the eight would have been allowed to reach\nmodule assembly.\nSense Signals at the module are given in Figure 7-25. Most of the variations shown in\noutputs are due to chip detector variations as described in section 6. Line 3/1 shows a small\ncross coupled noise which doesn\'t affect margin but could be eliminated. Line 6/14 has a\n116\n\nTABLE 7-4.

Some\nimprovement in sense margin can be obtained by reducing module and cell noise but more\nimprovement can be realized by reducing signal variations by gradin~~ chips.\n\n7.8.1 Memory Module Power Dissipation\nPower dissipation versus data rate of the memory module is sh()wn in Figure 7-26.\nMaximum dissipation is higher by about five watts compared to early program predictions while\noverhead or idle power is higher by about two watts but lower than the program goal. Part of the\ndifference occurred because of the preliminary nature of an early estimate of coil driver power.\nFigure 7-27 gives aspects of an improved estimate that agrees with data. The coil circuit in the\nupper left is modeled on the right using manufacturer\'s Vee and Vforward curves to obtain\nequivalent source generators. Dissipation was calculated for the waveform of Figure 7-16 and\nf()r measured AC coil resistance.\nResults are summarized at the bottom of Figure 7-27 and are plotted in Figure 7-28.\nPower in the coil and in the hybrids is consiste\'lt with early estimate while driver dissipation is\nhigher. This includes dissipation in the diodes and balun. Several minor modifications can\nreduce dissipation by from 2 to 3 watts. The cell winding can be configured for higher voltage\'\nand lower current which potentially saves 30 percent or 2 watts. Another potential savings is in\noptimizing or eliminating the second breakdown circuit which is presently responsible for two\nwatts.\nAnother potential area for reducing power dissipation is by reducing logic voltage to 5.0\nvolts which saves 1.6 watts. Logic voltage was increased during checkout to 5.4 volts in order\nto ensure operation of the timing PROM over a 10 percent voltage range. Modification of the\ncircuit is recommended ,(Section 7.7), in order to improve model performance and margin.\nOverall, minor changes in design should reduce power of the memory module to below 24\nwatts at maximum data rate.\n117\n\n...-\n\nLINE 0/8\n\nLINE 1/9\n\nLINE 2/10\n\nLINE 3/11\n\nLINE 4/12\n\nLINE 5/13\n\nLINE 6/14\n\nco\n\nFigure 7-25.

Instead, bit error rate was\nmeasured on a few bits at room temperature to obtain a percentage guard band to apply to the\nthreshold setting of each sense channel. An estimate of the expected cell soft error rate can\nthen be made for later comparison to data collected at NASA Langley with automatic\nequipment. Figure 7-29 shows measured error rate versus percentage of full output. If a single\nisolated bubble signal is 10 millivolts above baseline noise, then a 10-8 error rate or the number\nof errors per bits tested is expected at 8.2 milivolts for that bit. For an isolated no bubble signal a\n10-8 error rate is expected at 1.3 millivolts above baseline noise. Each bit in a mixed pattern\nmay have a different signal level where 10-8 error rate is expected. In considering a guarantee\nfor 10-8 operation a guard band of 13 percent of full signal should be added to the maximum\nzero and a guard band of 16 percent subtracted from the lowest one. Based on threshold\nmeasurements described at the beginning of this section, an error rate of 10-8 can be\nguaranteed providing the eight marginal chips were replaced.\n\no\n\nw\nIen\nw\nI-\n\n~\n\nm\n\nen\na:\no\na:\n\n/\n\nex:\n\nw\n\nen\nw\n\n!;(\n\nex:\nex:\no\na:\na:\n\nALL ONES\nCURVE\n\n10-6\n\nw\n\nIu.\n\n10-7\n\no\nen\n\n10-8~~--~--~--~--~--~~\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nPERCENTAGE OF FULL OUTPUT\n\nFigure 7-29.

A cell tester (Figure 8-1)\nwas built so that performance of the cell could be verified and so that chip faults could be\nanalyzed. A digital controller supplied signals sequentially to operate the driver operators and\nsensing functions. These were under PROM control. Macro timing was controlled by either\nfront panel switch, by six sets of PROMs, or by computer input. Cells were mounted on a cold\nplate which is cooled by refrigerant-cooled dry nitrogen and heated with cartridge heaters.\nFigure 8-2 is a photo of the module tester operating the Bubble Memory Module prototype.\nThe module tester is a simple digital tester capable of testing a single channel at a time. It uses\nmost i of the hardware, including the front panel and cabinet used earlier to test SSDR module\n(Ref 2).\n\n123\n\nf\'Y\n\n~\n\nDISPLAY\nAND\nCONTROL\nPANEL\n\nI\n\nXIY\n\nCOMPUTER\nPORT\n\nZ\nPWR\nSUPPLY\n\nDRIVER\n\ni\n\nl\n\nCONTROLLER\n\n1\nCELL UNDER TEST\nJil..AA.A.A.A.\nvv ...

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS\nA memory module using bubble domain technology has been developed to meet a wide\nvariety of spacecraft mission needs. This memory module is in a high state of design and\nevaluation and is believed suitable for flight qualification.\nObjectives of the program have been achieved. The chip, cell and storage board have\nbeen optimized for multiplexed sensing with satisfactory results demonstrated at breadboard\ntest and at module level test. A building block approach was adopted for the module providin\xc2\xa3l\nflexibility in recorder and memory design for many applications. Finally power dissipation has\nbeen reduced from the SSDR module power of approximately 40 watts to 27 watts at 1.33 MHz.\nThe Bubble Memory Module program has validated a number of chip, circuit, and systems\nconcepts suitable for spacecraft recorder design. However, selected areas of design should be\nimproved before proceeding into a qualification or production mode.\nAt the memory element level, a detector resistance test should be used to allow grading\nand sorting of detector outputs. Longer term improvements in process uniformity especially of\nthe detectors should be sought. Polyimide wafer coating for passificaton which was evaluated\nduring the program should be adopted because the technique appears to be faster and more\nrepeatable than the present technique of applying mylar performs to individual die. Although\nhigher density bubble chips are obviously desirable to increase capacity, the parallel-chip\nmethod for attaining higher data rates suffers additional power losses when physically large\narea chips (corresponding to large capacities) are used. Implementing the 2 micron or smaller\nbubble technology as discussed in Section 9.1 can significantly increase capacity without\nincreasing chip size.\nAt the cell level, the winding configuration should be re-explored to take advantage of\nrecent developments which have the potential of reducing coil driver power and increasing data\nrate slightly without impacting other aspects of the design. Carrier hermeticity studies should be\ncontinued to involve a larger number of sample runs than was possible on the present program\nand to verify the design.\nAt the system level, the oscillator circuit must be redesigned and replaced with a\nrecirculating delay line so that the timing can be turned on within 5 microseconds. The present\nmethod of timing generation cannot be worst-cased for device variation and should be\nredesigned. Additional minor improvements might be made to the coil driver and sense hybrids\nand to the storage board layout to improve performance and manufacturability.\n\nIn the long run, attention should be directed to increasing capacity within the basic module\ndesign and to developing a production capability for a general-purpose recorder module.\n\n127\n\nCHIP\nThe ultimate yield limit of a serial chip design is the probability that all propagation\nelements are within geometric spacing limits. This implies that larger capacity serial chips using\ntwo micron or smaller bubbles becomes increasingly uneconomical unless a form of selective\nredundancy is used.\nRockwell\'s Electronics Research Center has explored a method of obtaining redundancy\nin serial chips [Ref 5]. The approach shown in Figure 9-1 uses a shorted transfer-in gate as a\nbasic element. Except for the addition of the transfer-in gate, the chip is designed to perform\nidentically with the present design. A 1/2-cm chip by 1/2-cm which is of the same physical size\nas the D11 06 chip but using two-micron technology can contain approximately 400 kilobits.\nTo test specific serial sections for the first time, a pattern is generated which is timed to\ntransfer into the selected sections using high current in the transfer loops. Once good sections\nare identified, each good section\'s transfer-in shunt is laser cut. To operate the device, a\ntransfer-in pulse of low amplitude (25 milliamp) is applied every cycle. Data flows in a\ncontinuous stream, bypassjl\'ng bad loops.\n\n128\n\nSERIAL SECTIONS\n\nTRA NSFERIN\nSEC TIONS~X\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\n-\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nI\n\nG\n\nREPLICATORS\n\nITRANSFER OUT\n\nSERIAL REDUNDANT CHIP SCHEMATIC\n\nTRANSFER IN LOOP\n\nFigure 9-1.

Abstract\n\nThis report covers development of a Bubble Memory Module as a general purpose\nstorage unit in recorders or mass memory for spacecraft applications. Design,\nfabrication and test of a partially populated prototype recorder using 100 kilobit\nserial chips is described. Electrical interface, operating modes, and mechanical\ndesign of several module configurations are discussed.\nFabrication and test of the module demonstrating the practicality of multiplexing\nand matrixing multiple bubble chip cells as a means of minimizing support circuitry\nresulting in lower power, weight, and volume.\nThis effort resulted in the completion of a module consisting of a fully engineered\nprinted circuit storage board populated with 5 of 8 possible cells and a wire\nwrapped electronics board.
