b"Health and Medicine\n\nCell Growth Enhancement\n\nI\n\nn the accompanying photos, laboratory\ntechnicians of Exogene Corporation,\nMonrovia, California are engaged in bioprocessing experiments. A company\nformed in 1987, Exogene teams with pharmaceutical, biotechnology and chemical companies in applications of Exogene's advanced\ntechnologies to enhance production of bioprocessed substances, such as proteins, antibiotics and amino acids.\nA long standing problem in bioprocessing is ensuring adequate oxygen to\nachieve the desired cell growth and productivity; cells starved for oxygen often create\ncompounds that inhibit or even terminate\ncell growth. Where efforts to improve oxygenation usually focus on increasing the\namount of oxygen transported to the cell,\nExogene takes an entirely new approach to\nthe problem: it employs genetic modification\nof the cells to enable synthesis of a novel\nhemoglobin molecule that allows the cells to\nuse the available oxygen more efficiently,\nresulting in higher product yields.\nAnother Exogene innovation is an\noxygen-sensitive genetic switch, or promoter,\nthat facilitates increased production of pharmaceutical proteins. The promoter provides\nhigh levels of protein synthesis\nwhile eliminating\nsome of the problems and costs\nassociated with\ntraditional promoter systems.\n\nThese and other Exogene technologies originated in research performed for\nNASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory by Professor James E. Bailey and Chaitan Khosla of the\nCalifornia Institute of Technology (Caltech)\nChemical Engineering Department. In the\nlatter 1980s, Bailey and Khosla conducted\nextensive experiments in cell growth through\nproduction of hemoglobin as a way to improve oxygen supply to cells. Exogene was\ngranted a worldwide exclusive license to\ncommercialize the Caltech work.\nBy improving the efficiency of oxygen use by the cells, Exogene says, major\noperational expenses associated with oxygen\ntransfer can be reduced. Greater product\nyields result in decreased raw material costs\nand more efficient use of capital equipment.\nIncreased concentrations can lower downstream processing costs and, with fewer batches needed to meet manufacturing requirements, quality control costs are also reduced.\nThe company cites a broad range of applications for its core technologies, including a\nvariety of products and processes in the areas\nof biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, specialty\nchemicals and waste treatment.\n\n"
