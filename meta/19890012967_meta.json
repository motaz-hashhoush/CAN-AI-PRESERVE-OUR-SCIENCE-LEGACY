The NASA Communication Network, called NASCOM, is the worldwide operational telecommunications system which interconnects as the tracking and telemetry acquisition sites, launch areas, mission and project control centers, data capture facilities, and network control centers in support of space flight. For the Space Station era, NASCOM plans are set for higher data rate service utilizing data packet switched technology. Increased use of fiber optics is expected in a much more diverse network topology. The second major ground network, the Program Support Communications Network (PSCN), interconnects all NASA Centers and NASA contractor locations for intercenter non-operation communications. The primary functions are to transport voice, video, data and facsimile information for intercenter coordination, and to provide user access to space science and applications data bases. For the Space Station era, PSCN plans address the significant increase in forecast requirements for science data distribution and access to the Numerical Aerodynamics Simulator, and increased use of the Video Teleconference System.", "title": "NASA ground communications", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-05T23:48:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19890012967, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Roeder, John"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Headquarters", "location": "Washington, DC United States"}}, "id": "c2221949ab324eb79a64d28daf2bcff4"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19890012967, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19890012967, "id": "4e1dcec41b69407a8347bbce471c7562", "publicationName": "NASA.
