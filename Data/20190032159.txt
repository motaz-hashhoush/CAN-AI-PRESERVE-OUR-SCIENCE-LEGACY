The CMB-S4 science case is spectacular: the search for primordial\ngravitational waves as predicted from in\xef\xac\x82ation and the imprint of relic particles including\nneutrinos, unique insights into dark energy and tests of gravity on large scales, elucidating the role of baryonic feedback on galaxy formation and evolution, opening up a window on the transient Universe at millimeter wavelengths, and even the exploration of the\nouter Solar System. The CMB-S4 sensitivity to primordial gravitational waves will probe\nphysics at the highest energy scales and cross a major theoretically motivated threshold\nin constraints on in\xef\xac\x82ation. The CMB-S4 search for new light relic particles will shed light\non the early Universe 10,000 times farther back than current experiments can reach. Finally, the CMB-S4 Legacy Survey covering 70% of the sky with unprecedented sensitivity\nand angular resolution from centimeter- to millimeter-wave observing bands will have\na profound and lasting impact on Astronomy and Astrophysics and provide a powerful\ncomplement to surveys at other wavelengths, such as LSST and WFIRST, and others yet\nto be imagined. We emphasize that these critical thresholds cannot be reached without\nthe level of community and agency investment and commitment required by CMB-S4.\nIn particular, the CMB-S4 science goals are out of the reach of any projected precursor\nexperiment by a signi\xef\xac\x81cant margin.\nCMB-S4 is planned to be a joint NSF and DOE project, with the construction phase to be\nfunded as an NSF MREFC project and a DOE HEP MIE project. An interim project of\xef\xac\x81ce\nhas been constituted and tasked with advancing the CMB-S4 project in the NSF MREFC\nPreliminary Design Phase and toward DOE Critical Decision CD-1. Support for the of\xef\xac\x81ce\nis being provided in part by DOE, and a funding proposal to the NSF MSRI-R1 program is\npending. DOE CD-0 is expected imminently and will be a major milestone for the project.\nCMB-S4 was recommended by the 2014 Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel (P5)\nreport Building for Discovery: Strategic Plan for U.S. Particle Physics in the Global Context and\nby the 2015 National Academies report A Strategic Vision for NSF Investments in Antarctic\nand Southern Ocean Research. The community further developed the science case in the\n2016 CMB-S4 Science Book [1] and surveyed the status of the technology in the 2017 CMBS4 Technology Book [2]. This work formed the foundation for the joint NSF-DOE Concept\nDe\xef\xac\x81nition Task Force (CDT), a subpanel of the Astronomy and Astrophysics Advisory\nCommittee (AAAC), a FACA committee advising DOE, NASA, and NSF. The CDT report\nwas enthusiastically accepted by the AAAC in October 2017.\nBuilding on the CDT report, the CMB-S4 Collaboration and the pre-Project Development\nGroup composed of experienced project leaders drawn primarily from the national laboratories have produced the comprehensive document, The CMB-S4 Science Case, Reference\nDesign, and Project Plan [3], which we refer to here as the Decadal Survey Report (DSR).\nThe material presented in this white paper has been extracted from the DSR, and we\nencourage the reader to see the DSR for more detail. It and numerous other reports, col1\n\nlaboration bylaws, workshop and working group wiki pages, email lists, and much more\nmay be found at the website http://CMB-S4.org.\nTo achieve its transformational science goals, CMB-S4 requires an enormous increase\nin sensitivity over all current CMB experiments combined, and roughly an order-ofmagnitude increase over any projected precursor experiment. A signi\xef\xac\x81cant and unique\nfeature of CMB-S4 from the outset has been the use of multiple sites, speci\xef\xac\x81cally combining the two best currently developed sites on Earth for millimeter-wave observing: the\nhigh Atacama Plateau in Chile and the geographical South Pole. The design of CMB-S4\nexploits key features of the two sites, namely the ability to drill deep on a single small\npatch of the sky through an extraordinarily stable atmosphere from the South Pole, and\nthe ability to survey up to 80% of the sky from the exceptionally high and dry Atacama\nsite.\nCurrent experimental efforts at these two sites are already being consolidated into two\nmajor precursor observatories to CMB-S4, the Simons Observatory (SO) and the South\nPole Observatory (SPO), whose teams also make up the vast majority of the CMB-S4\ncollaboration. The timing of both of these observatories is well-aligned with CMB-S4,\nenabling them to act as valuable path\xef\xac\x81nders for CMB-S4 by providing technical and scienti\xef\xac\x81c data that have informed and will continue to inform our design and operations.\nTo this end, both have also provided Letters of Intent to share their technical and cost\ndata with CMB-S4. Nonetheless, while both will make signi\xef\xac\x81cant advances in key CMB\nscience goals, they will still fall well short of the thresholds targeted by CMB-S4. For example, to match the sensitivity to primordial gravitational waves provided by the ultradeep CMB-S4 survey, SPO would have to integrate for nearly 50 years; it would take SO\na similar amount of time to match the sensitivity to light relics provided by the CMB-S4\ndeep and wide survey.\nFrom space, the LiteBIRD CMB satellite mission was recently selected by JAXA for launch\nin 2028 for a 3-year mission, concurrent with CMB-S4 operations. With its lower resolution but wider frequency coverage, LiteBIRD\xe2\x80\x99s science goals are distinct from but highly\ncomplementary to CMB-S4\xe2\x80\x99s, and we are already discussing the parameters of a possible\nMemorandum of Understanding to enable both experiments to enhance their reach using\nelements of the other\xe2\x80\x99s data.\nIn short, CMB-S4 will enable transformational science that cannot be achieved otherwise,\nthe CMB-S4 concept has clear community and agency support, and the CMB-S4 collaboration and project are moving forward. CMB-S4 thus represents a unique and timely\nscienti\xef\xac\x81c opportunity.\n\nKey Science Goals and Objectives\nWe have organized the rich and diverse set of CMB-S4 scienti\xef\xac\x81c goals into four themes:\n1. primordial gravitational waves and in\xef\xac\x82ation;\n2. the dark Universe;\n2\n\n3. mapping matter in the cosmos;\n4. the time-variable millimeter-wave sky.\nThe \xef\xac\x81rst two science themes relate to fundamental physics. The other two themes relate\nto the broader scienti\xef\xac\x81c opportunities made possible by a millimeter-wave survey of unprecedented depth and breadth. Here we brie\xef\xac\x82y review the key high-level goals and refer\nthe reader to the science case detailed in the DSR and in the decadal survey science white\npapers referenced.\nPrimordial gravitational waves and in\xef\xac\x82ation. We have a historic opportunity to open\nup a window to the primordial Universe [4]. If the predictions of some of the leading\nmodels for the origin of the hot big bang are borne out, CMB-S4 will detect the signature\nof primordial gravitational waves in the polarization pattern of the CMB. This detection\nwould provide the \xef\xac\x81rst evidence for the quantization of gravity, reveal new physics at the\nenergy scale of grand uni\xef\xac\x81ed theories, and yield insight into the symmetries of nature.\nThe current leading scenario for the origin of structure in our Universe is cosmic in\xef\xac\x82ation,\na period of accelerated expansion prior to the hot big bang. During this epoch, quantum \xef\xac\x82uctuations were imprinted on all spatial scales in the Universe. These \xef\xac\x82uctuations\nseeded the density perturbations that developed into all the structure in the Universe today. While there are still viable alternative models for the early history of the Universe,\nthe simplest models of in\xef\xac\x82ation are exceptionally successful in describing the data.\nTantalizingly, the observed scale dependence of the amplitude of density perturbations\nhas quantitative implications for the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves, commonly parameterized by r, the ratio of \xef\xac\x82uctuation power in gravitational waves to that in\ndensity perturbations. All in\xef\xac\x82ation models that naturally explain the observed deviation\nfrom scale invariance and that also have a characteristic scale equal to or larger than the\ngravitational mass scale predict r\n0.001. A well-motivated sub-class within this set of\nmodels is detectable by CMB-S4 at 5\xcf\x83. The observed departure from scale invariance is\na potentially important clue that strongly motivates exploring down to r = 10\xe2\x88\x923 . With\nan order of magnitude more detectors than precursor observations, and exquisite control\nof systematic errors, CMB-S4 will improve upon limits from pre-CMB-S4 observations by\na factor of \xef\xac\x81ve to reach this target, allowing us to either detect primordial gravitational\nwaves or rule out large classes of in\xef\xac\x82ationary models and dramatically impact how we\nthink about the theory.\nThe dark Universe. In the standard cosmological model, about 95% of the energy density of the Universe is in dark matter and dark energy. With CMB-S4 we can address\nnumerous questions about these dark ingredients, such as: How is matter distributed on\nlarge scales? Does the dark matter have non-gravitational interactions with baryons? Are\nthere additional unseen components beyond dark matter and dark energy?\nLight relic particles are one very well-motivated possibility for additional energy density,\nas additional light particles appear frequently and numerously in extensions to the standard model of particle physics [5]. For large regions of the unexplored parameter space in\n3\n\nthese models, the light particles are thermalized in the early Universe. The Planck satellite has sensitivity to light particles that fell out of thermal equilibrium in the \xef\xac\x81rst 50\nmicro-seconds of the Universe. With CMB-S4 we can push back this frontier by over a\nfactor of 10,000, to the \xef\xac\x81rst fractions of a nanosecond.\nThe contribution of light relics to the energy density, often parameterized as the \xe2\x80\x9ceffective number of neutrino species,\xe2\x80\x9d Ne\xef\xac\x80 , leads to observable consequences in the CMB temperature and polarization anisotropy. Current data are only sensitive enough to detect\nadditional relics that froze out after the quark-hadron transition, so CMB-S4\xe2\x80\x99s ability to\nprobe times well before that transition is a major advance. Speci\xef\xac\x81cally CMB-S4 will constrain \xe2\x88\x86Ne\xef\xac\x80 < 0.06 at 95% C.L., achieving sensitivity to Weyl fermion and vector particles\nthat froze out at temperatures a few hundred times higher than that of the QCD phase\ntransition.\nCMB-S4 will also enable a broader exploration of the dark Universe in combination with\nother probes, often signi\xef\xac\x81cantly enhancing them by breaking their intrinsic degeneracies.\nIt will improve or detect various possibilities for the dark matter properties beyond the\nsimplest cold dark matter models [6]. It will add to dark energy constraints through precision measurements of the primordial power spectrum, through precision measurements\nof the lensing convergence power spectrum, through the CMB-lensing-derived mass calibration of galaxy clusters [7], and through CMB lensing tomography [8].\nMapping matter in the cosmos. Observations indicate there is roughly \xef\xac\x81ve times more\ndark matter than baryonic matter and that most of the baryonic matter is in the form of\nhot ionized gas rather than cold gas or stars. CMB-S4 will be able to map out normal\nand dark matter separately by measuring the \xef\xac\x82uctuations in the total mass density (using\ngravitational lensing) and the ionized gas density (using Compton scattering).\nObservations of gravitational lensing of the CMB are key to many CMB-S4 science goals.\nCMB-S4 lensing data will lead to a precise two-dimensional map of the total matter distribution. The statistical properties of this mass map will provide important constraints\non dark energy [8], modi\xef\xac\x81ed gravity [8], and the neutrino masses [9]. When combined\nwith CMB-S4-derived or external catalogs of galaxies or galaxy clusters, this mass map\ncan be used to \xe2\x80\x9cweigh\xe2\x80\x9d the galaxy or cluster samples. With galaxies, this can be done in\na redshift-dependent or tomographic manner out to redshifts as high as z \xe2\x88\xbc 5, making\npossible new precision tests of cosmology and gravity. With robust CMB-lensing-based\ncluster masses at high redshift, the abundance of galaxy clusters can be used as an additional probe of dark energy and neutrino masses.\nMost of the baryons in the late Universe are believed to be in a diffuse ionized plasma that\nis dif\xef\xac\x81cult to observe [10, 11, 12]. CMB-S4 will measure the effect of Compton scattering\nby this gas (the Sunyaev-Zeldovich or SZ effects), both the spectral distortion from hot\nelectrons (thermal SZ or tSZ) and a general redshift or blueshift of the scattered photons\ndue to coherent bulk \xef\xac\x82ows along the line of sight (kinematic SZ or kSZ). The nature of\nthe scattering makes the SZ effects independent of redshift. With a deep and wide survey covering a large amount of volume and an ultra-deep survey imaging lower-mass\n\n4\n\nclusters, CMB-S4 will be an effective probe of the crucial regime of z\n2, when galaxy\nclusters were vigorously accreting new hot gas while at the same time forming the bulk\nof their stars [13]. The CMB-S4 catalog will contain an order of magnitude more clusters\nat z > 2 than will be discovered with Stage 3 CMB experiments [7, 14]. CMB-S4 will also\nmeasure the diffuse tSZ signal everywhere on the sky and make a temperature-weighted\nmap of ionized gas that can be used to measure the average thermal pressure pro\xef\xac\x81les\naround galaxies and groups of galaxies. CMB-S4 will make maps of the kSZ effect, which\nwill be combined with data from other surveys to make maps of the projected electron\ndensity around samples of objects. Applications of these maps include measuring ionized gas as a function of radius, directly constraining the impact of feedback from active\ngalactic nuclei and supernovae on the intergalactic medium [15] and constraining theories of modi\xef\xac\x81ed gravity with the bulk \xef\xac\x82ow amplitude as a function of separation. Even\nwithout overlapping galaxy catalogs, the kSZ signal can be used to probe the epoch of\nreionization, in ways that are highly complementary to the measurements of the neutral\ngas that can be obtained with redshifted Ly-\xce\xb1 and 21-cm studies [16, 17, 18, 19].\nThe time-variable millimeter-wave sky. There have been relatively few studies of the\nvariable sky at millimeter wavelengths, with only one systematic survey done to date\n(by a CMB experiment [20]). A deep, wide, millimeter-wave survey with time-domain\ncapability will provide key insights into transient or burst events, moving sources such\nas Solar-System objects, and variable sources such as AGN.\nTargeted follow-up observations of gamma-ray bursts, core-collapse supernovae, tidal\ndisruption events, classical novae, X-ray binaries, and stellar \xef\xac\x82ares have found that there\nare many transient events with measured \xef\xac\x82uxes that would make them detectable by\nCMB-S4. A systematic survey of the mm-wave sky with a cadence of a day or two over a\nlarge fraction of the sky, combined with an ultra-deep daily survey of a few percent of the\nsky, would be an excellent complement to other transient surveys, \xef\xac\x81lling a gap between\nradio and optical searches [20]. Gamma-ray burst afterglows are particular interesting\ntargets as they peak at millimeter wavelengths and there is a possibility of capturing mmwave afterglows that have no corresponding gamma-ray trigger, either from the geometry\nof relativistic beaming and/or from sources at very high redshift [20]. Both are predicted\ntheoretically but have never been detected.\nThermal emission from planets, dwarf planets, and a selection of asteroids has been measured at these wavelengths; since these sources move across the sky they can be differentiated from the stationary extrasolar sky. CMB-S4 will provide a long well-sampled time\nbaseline and a wavelength range that is well-suited for the detection of possible large\nobjects in the outer Solar System. These measurements will be highly complementary to\nthose using optical re\xef\xac\x82ected light or thermal emission at infrared wavelengths.\nCMB-S4 will play an active role in multi-messenger astronomy, providing a long baseline with high-cadence sampling in both intensity and linear polarization over a wide\nsky area. For example, the IceCube event IC170922A is believed to be associated with\na \xef\xac\x82aring gamma-ray state of the blazar TXS 0506+056. In December 2014, however, the\nsame source appears to have had a neutrino luminosity at least 10 times larger with no\n5\n\nassociated gamma emission\xe2\x80\x94and no data existed at other wavelengths. Having highcadence wide-\xef\xac\x81eld non-gamma-ray data will be critical to understand sources like this\none. Any similar source is likely to be included in CMB-S4\xe2\x80\x99s near-daily, high-signal-tonoise monitoring of the blazar population. The wide-area nature of the survey will also\nmake it straightforward to search for gravitational wave sources, particularly for sources\nthat happen to be poorly localized and are challenging for other instruments.\n\nTechnical Overview\nThe CMB-S4 collaboration and project have developed a Reference Design that meets the\nmeasurement requirements and therefore can deliver the CMB-S4 science goals. The main\ncomponents of the Reference Design are described in detail in the DSR and summarized\nhere. The major components of the Reference Design are as follows:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 An ultra-deep survey covering 3% of the sky, more if a gravitational-wave signal is detected, to be conducted over seven years using: fourteen 0.55-m refractor small-aperture telescopes (SATs) at 155 GHz and below and four 0.44-m SATs at\n220/270 GHz, with dichroic, horn-coupled superconducting transition-edge-sensor\n(TES) detectors in each SAT, measuring two of the eight targeted frequency bands\nbetween 30 and 270 GHz; and one 6-m class \xe2\x80\x9cdelensing\xe2\x80\x9d large-aperture telescope\n(LAT), equipped with detectors distributed over seven bands from 20 to 278 GHz.\nMeasurements at degree angular scales and larger made using refractor telescopes\nwith roughly 0.5-m apertures have been demonstrated to deliver high-\xef\xac\x81delity, lowcontamination polarization measurements at these scales. The combination of the\nSATs with the 6-m LAT therefore provides low-resolution B-mode measurements\nwith excellent control of systematic contamination, as well as the high-resolution\nmeasurements required for delensing. The ultra-deep survey SATs and 6-m LAT\nare to be located at the South Pole to allow targeted observations of the single smallarea \xef\xac\x81eld, with provisions to relocate a fraction of the SATs in Chile if, for example,\na high level of r is detected or unforeseen systematic issues are encountered.\nThe total detector count for the 18 SATs is 153,232, with the majority of the detectors\nallocated to the 85 to 155 GHz bands. The total number of science-grade 150-mm\ndetector wafers required for 18 SATs is 204. The delensing LAT will have a total\nTES detector count of 114,432, with the majority of the detectors allocated to the 95\nto 150 GHz bands. The total number of science-grade 150-mm diameter detector\nwafers required for this single LAT is 76.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 A deep and wide survey covering approximately 70% of the sky to be conducted\nover seven years using two 6-m LATs located in Chile, each equipped with 121,760\nTES detectors distributed over eight frequency bands spanning 30 to 278 GHz. The\ntotal number of science-grade 150-mm diameter detector wafers required for these\ntwo LATs is 152.\nIn the context of their legacy value to the wider community, we refer to the deep/wide\n6\n\nand ultra-deep high-resolution surveys together as the CMB-S4 Legacy Survey. The total detector count for CMB-S4 is 511,184, requiring 432 science grade wafers. This is an\nenormous increase over the detector count of all Stage-3 experiments combined. Such a\ndramatic increase in scale is required to meet the CMB-S4 science goals.\n\nTechnical Drivers\nThe CMB-S4 reference design uses existing, well-demonstrated technology that has been\ndeveloped and demonstrated by the CMB experimental groups over the last decade,\nscaled up to unprecedented levels. The design and implementation plan addresses the\nconsiderable technical challenges presented by the required scaling up of the instrumentation and by the scope and complexity of the data analysis and interpretation. Features\nof the design and plan include: scaled-up superconducting detector arrays with wellunderstood and robust material properties and processing techniques; high-throughput\nmm-wave telescopes and optics with unprecedented precision and rejection of systematic contamination; full internal characterization of astronomical foreground emission;\nlarge cosmological simulations and improved theoretical modeling; and computational\nmethods for extracting minute correlations in massive, multi-frequency data sets, which\ninclude noise and a host of known and unknown signals.\nA CMB-S4 Risk and Opportunity Management Plan describes the continuous risk and\nopportunity management process implemented by the project, consistent with DOE\nO413.3B, \xe2\x80\x9cProject Management for the Acquisition of Capital Assets,\xe2\x80\x9d and the NSF 17066, \xe2\x80\x9cNSF Large Facilities Manual.\xe2\x80\x9d The plan establishes the methods of assessing CMBS4 project risk and opportunities for all subsystems as well as the system as a whole. The\nCMB-S4 risk register has 213 risks identi\xef\xac\x81ed. There are three risks that are currently assessed at Critical and 26 risks at High. The project is working on mitigations to ensure\nthat these risks are lowered to reasonable levels on a timescale consistent with our overall\nproject timeline.\nFor example, a current identi\xef\xac\x81ed critical risk is meeting the scaled-up production and\ntesting timeline of the transition-edge-sensor detector arrays. This is a major focus of\nthe R&D program supported by the DOE. The Interim Project Of\xef\xac\x81ce formed a Detector\nand Readout (D&R) Task Force in early 2019 to evaluate existing fabrication and testing\ncapabilities and to provide recommendations on production plans. A formal review of\nthe resulting detector fabrication plan will be completed in mid-2019.\n\nOrganization, Partnerships, and Current Status\nCMB-S4 is both a scienti\xef\xac\x81c collaboration and a nascent DOE/NSF project. While these\nare certainly tightly coupled, they do have different roles and responsibilities; the overall\norganization of CMB-S4 therefore decouples into the organization of the collaboration\nand the project.\nThe formal CMB-S4 collaboration was established in 2018 with the rati\xef\xac\x81cation of the by7\n\nlaws and election of the various of\xef\xac\x81cers including the collaboration Governing Board. As\nof summer 2019 the collaboration has 198 members, 71 of whom hold positions within\nthe organizational structure. These members represent 11 countries on 4 continents, and\n76 institutions comprising 16 national laboratories and 60 universities.\nThe CMB-S4 Collaboration and a pre-Project Development Group of experienced project\nleaders drawn largely from the national labs, jointly contributed to the development of\nthe project Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), Organization, Cost Book, Resource Loaded\nSchedule, and Risk Registry. The top level WBS Structure and Cost is summarized in\nTable 1. The schedule has 1110 activities, 1928 relationships, 5 Level 1, 20 Level 2 and 299\nLevel 3 Milestones for the CMB-S4 project.\nThe reference design and project baseline summarized here and detailed in the DSR is\nthe basis for subsequent design and project development work to be led by the Interim\nProject Of\xef\xac\x81ce (see Fig. 1) and the Collaboration. A permanent Integrated Project Of\xef\xac\x81ce\nwill be established in 2020 to manage the construction phase which is anticipated to start\nin 2021.\nAs shown in Fig. 1, a key feature of\nthe organization is the role of collaboration members in the project of\xef\xac\x81ce,\nin particular as leaders of the Level 2\nsystems. The Level 2 managers are\nsupported by engineering and projectmanagement leaders. The NSF/DOE\nscope distribution will promote the engagement and participation of universities and national laboratories. Graduate students, postdocs, professional\ntechnicians and engineers are expected\nto be involved in all aspects of the\nproject.\n\nTable 1: CMB-S4 WBS Structure and Cost\nWBS Level 2 Element\nTotal Estimated Cost (TEC)\n1.01 \xe2\x80\x93 Project Management\n1.03 \xe2\x80\x93 Detectors\n1.04 \xe2\x80\x93 Readout\n1.05 \xe2\x80\x93 Module Assembly & Testing\n1.06 \xe2\x80\x93 Large Aperture Telescopes\n1.07 \xe2\x80\x93 Small Aperture Telescopes\n1.08 \xe2\x80\x93 Observation Control & Data Acquisition\n1.09 \xe2\x80\x93 Data Management\n1.10 \xe2\x80\x93 Chile Infrastructure\n1.11 \xe2\x80\x93 South Pole Infrastructure\n1.12 \xe2\x80\x93 Integration & Commissioning\nDirect TEC\nTEC Contingency (35%)\nTotal TEC\nOther Project Cost (OPC)\n1.01 \xe2\x80\x93 Project Management\n1.02 \xe2\x80\x93 Research & Development\nDirect OPC\nOPC Contingency (35%) - excludes R&D\nTotal OPC\nTotal Project Cost (TPC)\nTEC + OPC with contingency\n\n$M\n19.6\n39.5\n59.9\n31.8\n86.5\n52.3\n13.9\n26.9\n38.1\n37.0\n7.7\n413.2\n144.6\n557.9\n\nThe project of\xef\xac\x81ce is responsible for\nforming partnerships with key stake7.0\n24.2\nholder institutions, including DOE Na31.2\ntional Laboratories, universities, and\n2.5\npotential collaborating projects such\n33.7\nas the Simons Observatory, South\nPole Observatory, and the CCAT-prime\n591.6\nproject.

We are actively pursuing\npartners who could make signi\xef\xac\x81cant scope contributions in areas aligned with their expertise.\n\npartners will need to be negotiated and incorporated in the project design within the next\ntwo to three years to avoid adding schedule and cost risk.\n\nSchedule\nTable 2 shows the proposed timeline via the NSF Level 1 Milestones along with the corresponding DOE Critical Decision Milestones. The schedule development strategy is to\nde\xef\xac\x81ne a schedule that is consistent with the funding potentially available during FY2019FY2021 and is subsequently technically driven. The project is working towards an early\ncompletion milestone that contains limited schedule \xef\xac\x82oat. A year of schedule \xef\xac\x82oat following this early project complete milestone is included in the overall project complete\nmilestone CD-4. The Interim Project Of\xef\xac\x81ce will continue to optimize the schedule and\ninclude explicit \xef\xac\x82oat for activities that are not on the critical path. The best opportunity\nto improve on the schedule is to reduce the time required to deliver the full quantity of\nthe Detectors and Readout (D&R) components.\nSeven years of operations are needed to achieve the CMB-S4 science goals.\nTable 2: Timeline and Funding Agency Milestones\nNSF Level 1 Milestone (DOE Critical Decision)\nPre-Conceptual Design (CD-0, Mission Need)\nPreliminary Baseline (CD-1/3a, Cost Range/Long-Lead Procurement)\nPreliminary Design Review (CD-2, Performance Baseline)\nFinal Deign Review (CD-3, Start of Construction)\nCompletion of 1st Telescope (CD-4a, Initial Operations)\nProject Completion(CD-4, Operations)\n\n9\n\nSchedule (FY)\nQ3 2019\nQ3 2021\nQ2 2022\nQ4 2023\nQ2 2026\nQ1 2029\n\nCost Estimates\nThe CMB-S4 project total estimated cost is currently $591.6M (fully loaded and escalated\nto the year of expenditure) including a 35% contingency budget. The breakdown of the\ncosts by major components of the construction phase is shown in Table 1. The cost estimate is the full cost, i.e., it does not take credit for use of any legacy infrastructure or for\ncontributions from collaborating institutions supported by private and international partners, e.g., large-aperture telescopes currently under construction in Chile as part of the\nSimons Observatory, or large- and small-aperture telescopes proposed by international\ncollaborators. In-kind contributions delivered by private and international partners are\nexpected and would reduce the total cost to NSF and DOE. It is estimated that the value\nof in-kind contributions could reduce the total cost of the CMB-S4 project by 20-25%.\nThe total estimated cost is built on detailed cost estimates made for each task in the project\nschedule. The estimates are documented with a Basis of Estimate (BOE) developed by the\nsubsystems leads. The task resources and their quantities are assigned from a standardized list of resources. The list includes multiple resource classes in each of the categories:\nlabor, materials/non-labor, or travel. A task estimate consists of the number of hours of\neach labor resource class, the base-year dollar cost of each materials/non-labor resource\nclass, the number of trips for each travel resource class, and the basis for each estimate.\nThe cost contingency estimate was constructed using input from experts with experience\nin previous CMB experiments and similar NSF MREFC projects and DOE MIE projects.\nAs the design, cost estimates, and schedules mature the contingency as a percentage of\nthe base cost estimate is expected to decrease to 30% or less. The target range for the start\nof the CMB-S4 construction project is 25-30%. A notional distribution of project scope by\nfunding agency is shown in Fig. 1, where blue indicates NSF and green DOE. The level\nof the NSF and DOE costs are expected to be comparable, with the notional distribution\nhaving NSF and DOE contributing 42% and 58% of the funding, respectively.\nThe basic operations model for CMB-S4 will be observations with multiple telescopes\nand cameras distributed across two sites, with observing priorities and speci\xef\xac\x81cations optimized for the CMB-S4 science goals, and data from all instruments shared throughout\nthe entire CMB-S4 collaboration. The operations cost is based on a preliminary bottomup estimate that includes management, site staff, utilities, instrument maintenance, data\ntransmission, data products, pipeline upgrades, collaboration management, and key science analysis. The annual operations cost is $32M in 2019 dollars, excluding 20 FTE/year\nof scientist effort supported by DOE research funds, with roughly 60% allocated to operations and 40% allocated to analysis of the key CMB-S4 science goals. The non-key science\nanalysis of CMB-S4 data products will be carried out by laboratory and university scientists, with support for the latter expected to be provided by individual NSF and DOE\nawards.\nNormal end-of-life decommissioning costs for South Pole and Chile infrastructure are\nanticipated.\n\n10\n\nReferences\n[1] CMB-S4 Collaboration, K.
