These requirements will standardize management to provide the minimum oversight and effective use of resources. This handbook implements Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 46, NASA FAR Supplement 18-46, Quality Assurance, and NMI 7410.1. Achievement of established quality and reliability goals at all levels is essential to the success of NASA programs. Active participation by NASA and other agency quality assurance personnel in all phases of contract operations, including precontract activity, will assist in the economic and timely achievement of program results. This involves broad participation in design, development, procurement, inspection, testing, and preventive and corrective actions. Consequently, government, as well as industry, must place strong emphasis on the accomplishment of all functions having a significant bearing on quality and reliability from program initiation through end-use of supplies and services produced. For purposes of implementing NASA and other agency agreements, and to provide for uniformity and consistency, the terminology and definitions prescribed herein and in a future handbook shall be utilized for all NASA quality assurance delegations and subsequent redelegations.", "title": "Management of government quality assurance functions for NASA contracts", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T19:14:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19940027881, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19940027881, "id": "b08fca9ce9d54450b7604a2a90d509fd", "publicationDate": "1993-04-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19940027881.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19940027881/downloads/19940027881.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19940027881/downloads/19940027881.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19940027881/downloads/19940027881.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
