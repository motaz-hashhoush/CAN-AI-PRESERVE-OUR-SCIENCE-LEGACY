Pinelli, John M. Kennedy, and Rebecca O. Barclay\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe diffusion of knowledge resulting from federally funded aerospace research and development (R&D) is indispensable in maintaining the vitality and international competitiveness\nof the U.S. aerospace industry. This knowledge is understood to be central to innovation\nand its management and crucial to the technical performance of aerospace engineers and\nscientists. However, little is known about the diffusion of federally funded R&D and the\naerospace knowledge diffusion process itself. Whereas knowledge resulting from federally\nfunded aerospace R&D is understood to be a valuable strategic resource for innovation,\nproblem solving, and productivity, linkages between the various sectors of the R&D infrastructure are weak, poorly defined, and, in some cases, simply not understood. It is\nassumed, however, that the ability of engineers and scientists to identify, acquire, and utilize\nthis knowledge is of paramount importance to the efficiency of aerospace R&D. Understanding knowledge diffusion, therefore, is a precursor to the rapid diffusion of federally funded\naerospace R&D and to maximizing the aerospace R&D process. Both, however, require an\nunderstanding of the information-seeking behavior of U.S. aerospace engineers and scientists.\nAs Menzel (1966) states\nThe way in which [aerospace] engineers and scientists make use of scientific\nand technical information (STI), the demands they make on STI systems, and\nthe satisfaction achieved by their efforts are among the items of knowledge which\nare necessary for the wise planning of [aerospace] STI systems and policy.\nIn this paper, the diffusion of federally funded aerospace R&D is explored from the\nperspective of the information-seeking behavior of U.S. aerospace engineers and scientists.\nThe following three assumptions frame this exploration: (1) knowledge production, transfer,\nand utilization are equally important components of the aerospace R&D process; (2) the\ndiffusion of knowledge resulting from federally funded aerospace R&D is indispensable for\nthe U.S. to remain a world leader in aerospace; and (3) U.S. government technical reports,\nproduced by NASA and DoD, play an important, but as yet undefined, role in the diffusion\nof federally funded aerospace R&D. A conceptual model for federally funded aerospace\nknowledge diffusion, one that emphasizes U.S. government technical reports, is presented.\nData regarding three research questions concerning the information-seeking behavior of U.S.\naerospace engineers and scientists are also presented.\n\nBACKGROUND\nTo remain a world leader in aerospace, the U.S. must improve and maintain the\nprofessional competency of its engineers and scientists, increase the R&D knowledge base,\nincrease productivity, and maximize the integration of recent technology into the R&D\n\nprocess. How well these objectives are met, and at what cost, depends on a variety of\nfactors, but largely on the ability of U.S. aerospace engineers and scientists to acquire and\nprocess the results of federally funded R&D. In terms of empirically derived data, very little\nis known about the diffusion of knowledge in the aerospace industry both in terms of the\nchannels used to communicate the ideas and the information-gathering habits and practices\nof the members of the social system (i.e., aerospace engineers and scientists). Most of the\nchannel studies, such as the work by Gilmore, et al. (1967) and Archer (1962), have been\nconcerned with the transfer of aerospace technology to non-aerospace industries.\n\nRelated Work\nMost of the studies involving aerospace engineers and scientists, such as the work by\nMcCullough, et al. (1982) and Monge, et al. (1979), have been limited to the use of NASA STI\nproducts and services and have not been concerned with information-gathering habits and\npractices. Although researchers such as Davis (1975) and Spretnak (1982) have investigated\nthe importance of technical communications to engineers, it is not possible to determine from\nthe published results if the study participants included aerospace engineers and scientists.\nIt is likely that an understanding of the process by which STI in the aerospace industry\nis communicated through certain channels over time among the members of the social\nsystem would contribute to increasing productivity, stimulating innovation, and improving\nand maintaining the professional competence of U.S. aerospace engineers and scientists.\n\nAerospace Knowledge Diffusion Research\nWe have organized a research project to study aerospace knowledge diffusion. Sponsored\nby NASA and the Department of Defense (DoD), the NASA/DoD Aerospace Knowledge\nDiffusion Research Project is being conducted by researchers at the NASA Langley Research\nCenter, the Indiana University Center for Survey Research, and Rensselaer Polytechnic\nInstitute (RPI). This research is endorsed by several aerospace professional technical societies\nincluding the American Institute for Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) and the Royal\nAeronautical Society (RAeS). In addition, it has been sanctioned by the Advisory Group\nfor Aerospace Research and Development (AGARD) Technical Information Panel and the\nAIAA Technical Information Committee.\nThis four-phase project is providing descriptive and analytical data regarding the diffusion\nof knowledge at the individual, organizational, national, and international levels. It is\nexamining both the channels used to communicate and the social system of the aerospace\nknowledge diffusion process. Phase 1 investigates the information-seeking behavior of U.S.\naerospace engineers and scientists and places particular emphasis on their use of federally\nfunded aerospace R&D. Phase 2 examines the industry-government interface and places\nspecial emphasis on the role of the information intermediary in the knowledge diffusion\nprocess. Phase 3 concerns the academic-government interface and places specific emphasis\non the information intermediary-faculty-student. Phase 4 explores the information-seeking\nbehavior of non-U.S. aerospace engineers and scientists from Brazil, India, Israel, Japan,\nPortugal, Spain, the Soviet Union, and other Western European nations.\nAs scholarly inquiry, our research has both immediate and a long term purposes. In\nthe first instance, it provides a practical and pragmatic basis for understanding how the\n\nresults of NASA/DoD research diffuse into the aerospace R&D process. Over the long term,\nit provides an empirical basis for understanding the aerospace knowledge diffusion process\nitself and its implications at the individual, organizational, national, and international levels.\nThe results of the project should provide useful information to R&D managers, information\nmanagers, and others concerned with improving access to, the quality of, and the utilization\nof federally funded aerospace STI. (Pinelli, Kennedy, and Barclay, 1991).\n\nTHE DIFFUSION OF FEDERALLY FUNDED R&D\nFederal involvement in stimulating technological innovation is a recent phenomena\nin American government. With the possible exceptions of aerospace and agriculture,\nattempts by the Federal government to stimulate technological innovation have been largely\nunsuccessful.\n\nThree Models\nThree approaches or models have dominated the "transfer" of federally funded R&D\n(Ballard, et al. 1989; Williams and Gibson, 1990). While variations of the three approaches\nhave been tried, Federal R&D transfer and diffusion activities continue to be driven by a\n"supply-side" model.\nThe appropriability model emphasizes the production of knowledge by the Federal\ngovernment and competitive market pressures to promote the use of knowledge. Deliberate\ntransfer mechanism and intervention by information intermediaries are viewed as unnecessary. Appropriability emphasizes the supply (production) of knowledge in sufficient quantity\nto attract potential users. Good technologies, according to this model, sell themselves.\nThe dissemination model emphasizes the need to transfer information to potential\nusers and embraces the belief that the production of quality knowledge is not sufficient to\nensure its fullest use. Linkage mechanisms such as information intermediaries are needed\nto identify useful knowledge and to transfer it to potential users. This model assumes that\nif these linkage mechanisms are available to link potential users with knowledge producers,\nthen better opportunities exist for users to determine what knowledge is available, acquire\nit, and apply it to their needs. While the dissemination approach facilitates access, it is\na passive structure that does not take users into consideration except when they enter the\nsystem and request assistance.\nThe knowledge diffusion model mandates an active process that stresses intervention\nand reliance on interpersonal communications as a means of identifying and removing\ninterpersonal barriers between users and producers. This approach also emphasizes the link\nbetween producers, transfer agents, and users and seeks to develop user-oriented mechanisms\n(e.g., products and services) specifically tailored to the needs and circumstances of the user.\n\nFederal Aerospace Knowledge Diffusion\nA model depicting the transfer of federally funded aerospace R&D through U.S. government technical reports appears in figure 1. The model is composed of two parts-the\ninformal that relies on collegia! contacts and the formal that relies on surrogates, information products, and information intermediaries to complete the "producer to user" transfer\n\nprocess. The producers are NASA and the DoD and their contractors and grantees. Producers depend upon surrogates and information intermediaries to complete the knowledge\ntransfer process.\nWhen U.S. government (i.e., NASA) technical reports are published, the initial or primary\ndistribution is made to libraries and technical information centers. Copies are sent to\nsurrogates for secondary and subsequent distribution. A limited number are set aside to be\nused by the author for the "scientist-to-scientist" exchange of information at the individual\nlevel.\nInformal (Collegia!)\n\nI\nSurrogates\n\xe2\x80\xa2 DTIC\n\xe2\x80\xa2CAB\n\xe2\x80\xa2 DROLS\n\xe2\x80\xa2 CASI\n\xe2\x80\xa2STAR\n\xe2\x80\xa2 RECON\n\nInformation\nIntermediaries\n\nProducers\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 DoD\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Librarians\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 NASA\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Gatekeepers\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 DoD/NASA\ncontractors\n& grantees\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Linking\nagents\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Knowledge\nbrokers\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 NTIS\n\xe2\x80\xa2GRA& 1\n\xe2\x80\xa2 NTIS file\ni,\n\ni,\n\nt_^_J\n\nUsers\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Aerospace\nengineers\nand scientists\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Aerospace\nengineering\n(acuity and\nstudents\n\ni.\n\nFormal\n\nFigure 1. A Model Depicting the Diffusion of Federally Funded Aerospace R&D.\nSurrogates serve as technical report repositories or clearinghouses for the producers and\ninclude the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC), the NASA Center for Aero\nSpace Information (CASI), and the National Technical Information Service (NTIS). These\nsurrogates have created a variety of technical report announcement journals such as CAB\n(Current Awareness Bibliographies) and STAR (Scientific and Technical Aerospace Reports)\nand computerized retrieval systems such as DROLS (Defense RDT&E Online System) and\nRECON (REmote CONsole) that permit online access to technical report databases.\nInformation intermediaries are, in large part, librarians and technical information specialists in academia, government, and industry. Those representing the producers serve as what\nMcGowan and Loveless (1981) describe as "knowledge brokers" or "linking agents." Information intermediaries connected with users act, according to Allen (1977), as "technological\nentrepreneurs" or "gatekeepers." The more "active" the intermediary, the more effective the\ntransfer process becomes (Goldhor and Lund, 1983). Active intermediaries take information\nfrom one place and move it to another, often face-to-face. Passive information intermediaries, on the other hand, "simply array information for the taking, relying on the initiative\nof the user to request or search out the information that may be needed" (Eveland, 1987).\nThe overall problem with the total Federal STI system is that "the present system for\ntransferring the results of federally funded STI is passive, fragmented, and unfocused."\nEffective knowledge transfer is hindered by the fact the Federal government "has no coherent\nor systematically designed approach to transferring the results of federally funded R&D to\nthe user" (Ballard, et al. 1986). In their study of issues and options in Federal STI, Bikson\nand her colleagues (1984) found that many of the interviewees believed "dissemination\nactivities were afterthoughts, undertaken without serious commitment by Federal agencies\n\nwhose primary concerns were with [knowledge] production and not with knowledge transfer;"\ntherefore, "much of what has been learned about [STI] and knowledge transfer has not been\nincorporated into federally supported information transfer activities."\nThe specific problem with the informal part of the system is that knowledge users can\nlearn from collegial contacts only what those contacts happen to know. Ample evidence\nsupports the claim that no one researcher can know about or keep up with all the research\nin his/her area(s) of interest. Like other members of the scientific community, aerospace\nengineers and scientists are faced with the problem of too much information to know about,\nto keep up with, and to screen. To compound this problem, information itself is becoming\nmore interdisciplinary in nature and more international in scope.\nTwo problems exist with the formal part of the system. First, the formal part of\nthe system employs one-way, source-to-user transmission. The problem with this kind of\ntransmission is that such formal one-way, "supply side" transfer procedures do not seem to\nbe responsive to the user context (Bikson, et al. 1984). Rather, these efforts appear to start\nwith an information system into which the users\' requirements are retrofit (Adam, 1975).\nThe consensus of the findings from the empirical research is that interactive, two-way\ncommunications are required for effective information transfer (Bikson, et al. 1984).\nSecond, the formal part relies heavily on information intermediaries to complete the\nknowledge transfer process. However, a strong methodological base for measuring or\nassessing the effectiveness of the information intermediary is lacking (Beyer and Trice,\n1982). In addition, empirical findings on the effectiveness of information intermediaries\nand the role(s) they play in knowledge transfer are sparse and inconclusive. The impact\nof information intermediaries is likely to be strongly conditional and limited to a specific\ninstitutional context.\nFurthermore, according to Roberts and Frohman (1978), most Federal approaches to\nknowledge utilization have been ineffective in stimulating the diffusion of technological\ninnovation. They claim that the numerous Federal STI programs are "highest in frequency\nand expense yet lowest in impact" and that Federal "information dissemination activities\nhave led to little documented knowledge utilization." Roberts and Frohman also note that\n"governmental programs start to encourage utilization of knowledge only after the R&D\nresults have been generated" rather than during the idea development phase of the innovation\nprocess.\nDavid (1986), Mowery (1983), and Mowery and Rosenberg (1979) conclude that successful\n[Federal] technological innovation rests more with the transfer and utilization of knowledge\nthan with its production. In a critique of Federal innovation policy, David (1986) states\nthat "innovation has become our cherished child, doted upon by all concerned with\ncompetitiveness; whereas diffusion has fallen into the woeful role of Cinderella."\n\nINFORMATION-SEEKING BEHAVIOR OF\nU.S. AEROSPACE ENGINEERS AND SCIENTISTS\nThe following three research questions were formulated for this paper:\n1. Is there a difference between the information-seeking behavior of U.S. engineers in\ngeneral and U.S. aerospace engineers and scientists?\n\n2. Is there a difference between the information-seeking behavior of U.S. aerospace\nengineers and U.S. aerospace scientists?\n3. Is there a difference between the information sources used by U.S. aerospace engineers\nand scientists in problem solving and those used to find out about U.S. government\ntechnical reports?\n\nMethodology\nThe data reported herein were collected from U.S. aerospace engineers and scientists\nbelonging to the AIAA. The AIAA is a professional research society and the characteristics\nof its members reflect a research orientation. Over 31 percent of the respondents hold a\ndoctorate and an additional 39 percent have earned masters degrees. Most of the respondents\nare managers, researchers, or academics. Only 28 percent reported their principal job\nactivity as "design or development." The vast majority of the respondents reported that\nthey were educated and work as engineers. Following Vincenti\'s (1990) statement that\n"engineering implies a knowledge-producing activity embedded within a larger problemsolving activity," we expect that those surveyed will be especially involved in "seeking and\nusing" information.\nThe data used to answer the research questions were obtained through the use of self\nadministered questionnaires. The data were derived from three surveys (samples) of the\nAIAA membership. Sample 1 was used to undertake a pilot (exploratory) study that was\nconducted between July and September 1988. Approximately 2,000 individuals, randomly\nselected from the 1988 AIAA membership list, were sent questionnaires and 606 usable\nresponses were received (30 percent response rate) by the established cutoff date. The\nresults of the pilot study (study 1) are documented in NASA Technical Memorandum 101534\n(Pinelli, et al. 1989).\nTwo random samples were used to select 3,298 (Study 2) and 1,795 (Study 3) persons\nfrom the 1989 AIAA membership list. Overall, 2,016 U.S. aerospace engineers and scientists\nresponded to the second study and 975 responded to the third study. The adjusted response\nrate (corrected for sample problems) for studies 2 and 3 was about 70 percent. Studies 2\nand 3 were conducted during the the summer and fall of 1989. The results of study 2 are\ndocumented in NASA Technical Memorandum 102774 (Pinelli, 1991). The results of study 3\nare being documented but have not been published as of this date.\n\nResearch Question 1\nOur review of the literature reveals certain general characteristics about the informationseeking behavior of engineers (Pinelli, 1991). They are not interested in guides to the\nliterature nearly so much as they are in reliable answers to specific questions. They\nprefer informal sources of information, especially conversations with individuals within\ntheir organization. Engineers may have psychological traits that predispose them to solve\nproblems alone or with the help of colleagues rather than seeking answers in the literature.\n"Engineers like to solve their own problems by drawing on past experiences, using the\ntrial and error method, and asking colleagues known to be efficient and reliable instead of\nsearching or having someone search the literature for them" (Anthony, East, and Slater,\n1970). According to Allen (1977), engineers seldom use information services which are\n\ndirectly oriented to them. When they use a library, it is more in a personal search mode,\ngenerally not involving the professional (but "non-technical") librarian.\nTo answer Question 1, we compared selected results of Shuchman\'s (1981) study with\nselected results from Study 1 (Pinelli, et al. 1989). The comparison appears in table 1.\nShuchman\'s (1981) study is a broad-based investigation of information transfer in engineering. The respondents represented 14 industries and the following major disciplines: civil,\nelectrical, mechanical, industrial, chemical and environmental, and aeronautical. Seven percent, or 93 respondents, were aeronautical engineers. The engineers in Shuchman\'s study,\nregardless of discipline, displayed a strong preference for informal sources of information.\nFurther, these engineers rarely found all the information they needed for solving technical\nproblems in one source; the major difficulty engineers encountered in finding the information\nthey needed to do their job was identifying a specific piece of missing data and then learning\nwho had it.\nTable 1.

(1989)\nIn terms of information sources and problem solving, Shuchman (1981) reports that\nengineers first consult their personal store of information, followed in order by informal\ndiscussions with co-workers, and discussions with supervisors. Next they search the library.\nIf they fail to obtain the needed information, they contact a "ker* person in the organization\nwho usually knows where the needed information may be located. Having failed to\nthat point, they search or have a database searched and/or seek the assistance of the\norganization\'s librarian. Based on these findings, Shuchman concluded that librarians are\nused by a small proportion of the engineering profession.\nUsing Shuchman\'s list of information sources, our survey respondents were asked to\nindicate those sources used to solve technical problems. Although the amount of use\nappears higher for U.S. aerospace engineers and scientists, their responses, which appear\nin table 1, compare favorably with Shuchman\'s findings. Like the engineers in Shuchman\'s\nstudy, the U.S. aerospace engineers and scientists in our study display a preference for\nusing their personal store of STI, especially that which they keep in the office; personal\ncontacts; and informal sources of information. Engineers in general and U.S. aerospace\nengineers and scientists in particular begin with an informal search for information followed\n\nby what Allen (1977) calls "an informal personal search for information followed by the use\nof formal information sources. Having completed these steps engineers turn to librarians\nand library services for assistance." Based on these focused but admittedly limited data,\nwe find no difference between the information-seeking behavior of engineers in general and\nU.S. aerospace engineers and scientists. While the pattern is the same, the amount of use\nis greater among our sample.\n\nResearch Question 2\nThe nature of science and technology and differences between engineers and scientists\ninfluence their information-seeking behavior. Evidence exists to support the belief that\ndifferences between science and technology and scientists and engineers directly influence\ninformation-seeking habits, practices, and preferences. The results of a study conducted\nby the System Development Corporation (1966) determined that "an individual differs\nsystematically from others in his use of STP for a variety of reasons. Chief among\nthese are five institutional variables\xe2\x80\x94type of researcher, engineer or scientist; type of\ndiscipline, basic or applied; stage of project, task, or problem completeness; the kind of\norganization, fundamentally thought of as academia, government, and industry; and the\nyears of professional work experience."\nTo answer Question 2, the U.S. aerospace engineers and scientists in study 2 were asked\nto describe briefly the most important technical project, task, or problem they had worked\non in the past six months. Respondents were given a list of nine information sources and\nwere asked to identify the steps followed (sources used) in looking for the information needed\nto complete the project, task, or to solve the problem.\nSurvey participants were instructed to enter "1" beside the first step, "2" beside the\nsecond, and so forth. Weighted average rankings were calculated to determine the actual\nsteps followed (sequence in which information sources were used) by survey respondents to\nacquire the information needed or used to complete their most important technical project,\ntask, or problem in the past six months. The steps followed in the search for information were\nexamined from the standpoint of educational preparation as either an engineer or scientist\n(table 2).\nIn terms of project and task completion and problem solving, the U.S. aerospace engineers\nand scientists in our study are a relatively homogeneous group. With few exceptions,\nthe steps used to acquire information are fairly uniform for both engineers and scientists.\nBoth begin their search for information using their personal store of knowledge followed by\ndiscussions with colleagues. The library, however, was used third most often by both groups\n(n = 942 for engineers and n = 146 for scientists) but they tend to use it later in the process\npresumably in a self-directed manner. The librarian, distinct from the library, is the last\nstep taken in the overall information strategy. Based on these data, we find no difference\nbetween the information-seeking behavior of U.S. aerospace engineers and U.S. aerospace\nscientists.\n\nResearch Question 3\nTo the extent that a generalization can be formed, U.S. engineers in general and the\nU.S. aerospace engineers and scientists in our studies appear to be a relatively homogeneous\ngroup in terms of their information-seeking behavior. Their search strategy begins with an\n8\n\nTable 2.

Discussions with coworkers is the next phase of the strategy, followed by\na personal search of formal information products and services in the library or technical\ninformation center. If they fail to obtain needed information, at this point they turn to the\nlibrarian or technical information specialist.\nWe found nothing in the literature that led us to conclude that their approach to finding\nout about U.S. government technical reports would be different. They would check their\npersonal store or collection; talk with coworkers; go to the library and look for themselves;\nand, if all else fails, ask a librarian or technical information specialist.\nTo answer Question 3, we asked survey respondents in study 2 if they used U.S.\ngovernment technical reports to complete their technical project, task, or problem. Next,\n\nwe asked the approximately 65 percent who did use them how they found out about these\nreports. We compared the responses to this question (Study 1) with the responses to the\nquestion (Study 2) concerning the sources used in problem solving. The data used in making\nthe comparison appear in table 3.\nIn completing their most important technical project, task, or problem, the U.S. aerospace\nengineers and scientists in our studies used their personal store of technical information first,\nfollowed by discussions with a coworker or key individuals. Next, they searched the library\nor a database and last, asked a librarian. The sources used by U. S. aerospace engineers\nand scientists to find out about U.S. government technical reports were very similar to those\nused to solve technical problems. Based on these data, we find no difference between the\ninformation sources used by U.S. aerospace engineers and scientists in problem solving and\nthose used to find out about U.S. government technical reports used in problem solving.\nA TEST OF THE AEROSPACE KNOWLEDGE DIFFUSION MODEL\nWe attempted to test our model (figure 1) and gauge the amount of "proactivity" on the\npart of librarians and technical information specialists in linking U.S. aerospace engineers and\nscientists with the results of federally funded aerospace R&D contained in U.S. government\ntechnical reports. We measured "proactivity" by attempting to determine the extent to\nwhich the librarians or technical information specialists took the initiative to "link" users\nto DoD/NASA/technical reports.\nIn testing our model, we asked survey respondents in Study 3 two questions: how they\nfind out about DoD and NASA technical reports and how they physically obtain them?\nResponses to the question of "how do you find out about DoD and NASA technical reports,"\nappear in figure 2. Responses to the question regarding "how do you physically obtain DoD\nand NASA technical reports" appear in figure 3.\nTable 3.

User methods, dominate the question of\n"awareness" with "cited in a publication" and "referred by a colleague" being the frequent\nchoices. Intermediary methods ranked second with "database search" being the frequent\nchoice. Producer methods ranked third with announcement journals such as STAR and\nCAB being the frequent choice.\n\nPhysically Obtaining DoD and NASA Technical Reports\nSurvey respondents were asked how they physically obtained copies of DoD and NASA\ntechnical reports. Their responses were grouped into the following three categories.\nProducer, including sent by author; User, including obtained from a colleague; and\nIntermediary, including routed to me by my library.\nOverall, User methods dominate the question of "physical access" with "requested/ordered\nfrom my library" being the frequent choice (see figure 3). Producer methods ranked second\nwith "sent by DoD/NASA" being the frequent choice. Intermediary methods were third\nwith "requested/ordered from NTIS" being the frequent choice.\nIn our test of the model (figure 1), we attempted to ascertain a measure of "proactivity"\nfor aerospace librarians and information specialists by determining their role in Unking U.S.\naerospace engineers and scientists with DoD and NASA technical reports. Our design is\nadmittedly crude. Our findings lead us to the following preliminary conclusions: (1) the\nsuccess of the system for transferring the results of federally funded aerospace R&D via\nthe U.S. government technical report depends in large part on the "proactivity" of the\nuser, (2) the data support our earlier statement regarding the "passive" nature of the\nformal part of the system, and (3) although aerospace librarians and technical information\nspecialists play an important "linking" role in the "producer-to-user" transfer process, their\nmeasure of "proactivity" is rather weak. On the other hand, we must also restate that a\nstrong methodological base for measuring or assessing the "proactivity of the information\nintermediary" is needed before such a statement can be made with confidence and certainty.\n\n11\n\nAnnouncement\nJournal\nCurrent Awareness\nPublication\nSent by\nDoD/NASA\nCited in\nPublication\nReferred by\nColleague\nReferred by\nAuthor\nIntentional\nSearch\nAccident or\nBrowsing\nDatabase\nSearch\nReferred by\nLibrarian\nRouted to me\nby Library\n0.0%\n\n20.0%\n\n40.0%\n\n60.0%\n\n80.0%\n\n100.0%\n\nFigure 2.

However, the U.S. aerospace industry is experiencing\nprofound changes created by a combination of domestic and international circumstances.\nSome features of these changes result from domestic actions and circumstances such as\nairline deregulation, while others result from external trends and events such as emerging\nforeign competition. Consequently, while the implications of these changes are of national\nimportance, they are not well understood.\nCertain factors, events, and trends are changing the nature of the U.S. aerospace industry\nand the commercial aviation sector in particular. The continuation of the domestic airlines\'\ntraditional role in launching new aircraft is uncertain due to economic deregulation and\nthe deteriorating financial performance of domestic airlines. Worldwide, the manufacture\nof aircraft is becoming an attractive industry and many foreign companies enjoy a special\nsupportive (financial) relationship with their governments. Domestic air travel is projected\nto grow less rapidly than in foreign markets, so export sales will become increasingly\nimportant. Countries are demanding a participatory role in manufacturing as the price\nof entry into their markets. Simultaneously, U.S. producers are seeking to spread risks and\nto develop additional capital. Thus, increasing U.S. collaboration with foreign producers\nresults in a more international manufacturing environment. The changing composition\nof the industry will foster an increasing flow of U.S. aerospace trade. At the same\ntime, international industrial alliances will result in a more rapid diffusion of technology,\nincreasing pressure on the U.S. aerospace industry to push forward with new technological\ndevelopments.\nThe importance of the U.S. aerospace industry to the American economy is illustrated in\nthe following commentary offered by the Aerospace Industries Association (1990).\nLast year U.S. aerospace exports totaled nearly $32 billion. Imports of similar\ngoods were approximately $10 billion for a positive sectoral trade balance of\n$22 billion. This was a net improvement of $4 billion over 1988. In fact, the\nU.S. sectoral trade balance in aerospace products has improved every year since\n1984. The contrast to other U.S. manufacturing industries is striking. The trade\ntrend for high-tech U.S. industries, such as computers and automobiles, has\nbeen steadily negative. For such industries, the goal is reversing these persistent\nnegative trends; for U.S. aerospace, the goal is to maintain its positive trade\nbalance.\nIn spite of its importance to the U.S. economy and the balance of trade, very little is known\nabout aerospace knowledge diffusion, both in terms of the channels used to communicate the\nideas and the information-gathering habits and practices of the members of the aerospace\nsocial system.\n"Judged against almost any criterion of performance-growth in output, exports, productivity, or innovation-the U.S. aerospace industry, in particular the commercial aviation\nsector, must be considered a star performer in the American economy" (Mowery and Rosenberg, 1982). "Total factor productivity in this [the commercial aviation sector] industry has\ngrown more rapidly than in virtually any other U.S. industry during the postwar period"\n(Mowery and Rosenberg, 1982).\n13\n\nIn 1989, the U.S. aerospace industry was the leading positive contributor to the balance\nof trade among all merchandise industries, including agriculture (U.S. Department of\nCommerce, 1990). Along with this performance record, the U.S. aerospace industry, in\nparticular the commercial aviation sector, presents important anomalies in structure and\nconduct that make it worthy of investigation from the standpoint of enhancing innovation\nand productivity and understanding the innovation process. These anomalies include the\nfactors that influence the rate and direction of innovation, the diffusion of federally funded\naerospace R&D, and Federal involvement in supporting civilian R&D.\nTherefore, it is likely that an understanding of the process by which aerospace STI is\ncommunicated through certain channels over time among the members of the aerospace\nsocial system would contribute to stimulating technological innovation, maximizing the R&D\nprocess, increasing R&D productivity, and maintaining the professional competence of U.S.\naerospace engineers and scientists. Allen (1966), citing Herner (1959), states\nPerhaps the most important and least considered factor in the design of\n[aerospace] S&T information systems is the user of such systems. Regardless\nof what other parameters are considered hi the [design and] development of such\nsystems, it is necessary to consider its potential use and mode of use by the\npersons or groups for whom it is intended; it is necessary either to fashion the\nsystem to suit the user\'s information needs, habits, and preferences or to fashion\nthe user to meet the needs, habits, and practices of the system. Both approaches\nare possible. However, the [design and] development of any [aerospace] S&T\ninformation system should serve the user.\n\nREFERENCES\nAdam, Ralph.
