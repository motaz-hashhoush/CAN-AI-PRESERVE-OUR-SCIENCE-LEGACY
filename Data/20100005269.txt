b'ROM through all phases of testing.\nThe controller has been designed as\nan integral subsystem of a system that\nincludes not only the controller and the\ncontrolled EEPROM aboard a spacecraft but also computers in a ground\ncontrol station, relatively simple onboard support circuitry, and an onboard communication subsystem that\nutilizes the MIL-STD-1553B protocol.\n(MIL-STD-1553B is a military standard\nthat encompasses a method of communication and electrical-interface re-\n\nquirements for digital electronic subsystems connected to a data bus. MIL-STD1553B is commonly used in defense\nand space applications.) The intent\nwas to both maximize reliability while\nminimizing the size and complexity of\nonboard circuitry.\nIn operation, control of the EEPROM\nis effected via the ground computers,\nthe MIL-STD-1553B communication\nsubsystem, and the onboard support circuitry, all of which, in combination, provide the multiple layers of protection\n\nagainst inadvertent writes. There is no\ncontroller software, unlike in many\nprior EEPROM controllers; software\ncan be a major contributor to unreliability, particularly in fault situations\nsuch as the loss of power or brownouts.\nProtection is also provided by a powermonitoring circuit.\nThis work was done by Richard Katz and\nIgor Kleyner of Goddard Space Flight Center.\nFor further information, contact the Goddard\nInnovative Partnerships Office at (301) 2865810. GSC-15492-1\n\nQuad-Chip Double-Balanced Frequency Tripler\nThis technology has uses such as high-resolution radar and spectroscopic screening.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nSolid-state frequency multipliers are\nused to produce tunable broadband\nsources at millimeter and submillimeter\nwavelengths. The maximum power produced by a single chip is limited by the\nelectrical breakdown of the semiconductor and by the thermal management\nproperties of the chip. The solution is to\nsplit the drive power to a frequency tripler\nusing waveguides to divide the power\namong four chips, then recombine the\noutput power from the four chips back\ninto a single waveguide.\nTo achieve this, a waveguide branchline quadrature hybrid coupler splits a\n100-GHz input signal into two paths with\na 90\xc2\xb0 relative phase shift. These two\npaths are split again by a pair of waveguide Y-junctions. The signals from the\n\nfour outputs of the Y-junctions are\ntripled in frequency using balanced\nSchottky diode frequency triplers before\nbeing recombined with another pair of\nY-junctions. A final waveguide branchline quadrature hybrid coupler completes the combination.\nUsing four chips instead of one enables using four-times higher power\ninput, and produces a nearly four-fold\npower output as compared to using a single chip. The phase shifts introduced by\nthe quadrature hybrid couplers provide\nisolation for the input and output waveguides, effectively eliminating standing\nwaves between it and surrounding components. This is accomplished without introducing the high losses and expense of\nferrite isolators.\n\nA practical use of this technology is to\ndrive local oscillators as was demonstrated around 300 GHz for a heterodyne spectrometer operating in the 2\xe2\x80\x933THz band. Heterodyne spectroscopy in\nthis frequency band is especially valuable for astrophysics due to the presence\nof a very large number of molecular\nspectral lines. Besides high-resolution\nradar and spectrographic screening applications, this technology could also be\nuseful for laboratory spectroscopy.\nThis work was done by Robert H. Lin, John\nS. Ward, Peter J. Bruneau, and Imran Mehdi\nof Caltech; Bertrand C. Thomas of Oak Ridge\nAssociated Universities; and Alain Maestrini\nof the Observatoire de Paris for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

NPO-46567\n\nKa-Band Waveguide Two-Way Hybrid Combiner for\nMMIC Amplifiers\nThis technology is applicable as a power combiner for solid-state power amplifiers (SSPAs) with\nunequal and arbitrary power output ratios.\nJohn H. Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio\nThe design, simulation, and characterization of a novel Ka-band (32.05\xc2\xb10.25\nGHz) rectangular waveguide two-way\nbranch-line hybrid unequal power combiner (with port impedances matched to\nthat of a standard WR-28 waveguide) has\nbeen created to combine input signals,\nwhich are in phase and with an amplitude\nratio of two. The measured return loss and\nisolation of the branch-line hybrid are better than 22 and 27 dB, respectively. The\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, February 2010\n\nmeasured combining efficiency is 92.9 percent at the center frequency of 32.05 GHz.\nThis circuit is efficacious in combining the\nunequal output power from two Ka-band\nGaAs pseudomorphic high electron mobility transistor (pHEMT) monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) power\namplifiers (PAs) with high efficiency.\nThe component parts include the\nbranch-line hybrid-based power combiner and the MMIC-based PAs. A two-\n\nwaybranch-line hybrid is a four-port device with all ports matched; power entering port 1 is divided in phase, and into\nthe ratio 2:1 between ports 3 and 4. No\npower is coupled to port 2.\nMMICs are a type of integrated circuit\nfabricated on GaAs that operates at microwave frequencies, and performs the\nfunction of signal amplification. The\npower combiner is designed to operate\nover the frequency band of 31.8 to 32.3\n\n13\n\n'
