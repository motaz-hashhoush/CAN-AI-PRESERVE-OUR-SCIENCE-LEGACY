Introduction\nThe Traffic Aware Strategic Aircrew Request (TASAR) concept offers onboard\nautomation for the purpose of advising the pilot of traffic compatible trajectory changes\nthat would be beneficial to the flight. The TASAR onboard automation leverages\nsurveillance information to increase the likelihood of air traffic control (ATC) approval\nof pilot-initiated trajectory change requests, thereby increasing the portion of the flight\nflown on or near a desired business trajectory. All automation and pilot procedures are\nfully dedicated to a single aircraft which allows tailoring of optimization criteria to the\nobjectives of each flight and provides for timely responses to changing situations.\nA preliminary fast-time simulation benefits assessment 1 estimated the benefits of three\nTASAR use cases: (1) lateral change after a reroute traffic management initiative (TMI)\nends, (2) lateral change in the presence of convective weather, and (3) switch to a more\nwind-optimal trajectory (altitude, lateral, or combination). The agent-based simulation\ncontained aircrew/TASAR agents that generate requests that improve on the efficiency of\nhistorical trajectories and controller agents that evaluate these TASAR requests against\ntheir objectives. The benefits of TASAR were assessed for generic network, low cost,\nregional, and business jet airspace users. Network carriers saved, on average, 543 lbs of\nfuel (about 80 gallons) per flight and about 3.6 minutes per flight. The rate of Automatic\nDependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) Out equipage among traffic aircraft did not\nsignificantly impact benefits but lower levels of ADS-B Out adoption caused controllers\nto receive more TASAR requests that may cause conflicts and therefore would not be\nimmediately approveable.\nThis report builds on the preliminary benefits assessment by tailoring results to a specific\nairspace user, Virgin America. It extends the previous study by developing estimates of\nannual fuel and time cost savings due to TASAR tailored specifically for Virgin America.\nHistorical Virgin America trajectories are used as a baseline for comparison to simulated\ntrajectories that consider potential TASAR requests. Also, peak requests by sector are\nstudied in an attempt to further understand the impact of TASAR on ATC.\nThe document is divided into the following sections:\nSection 1 introduces the annualized benefits assessment\nSection 2 describes three use cases that were quantified\nSection 3 describes the simulation platform and method to quantify benefits\nSection 4 estimates annualized benefits results for Virgin America\nSection 5 estimates impact of TASAR requests on ATC\nSection 6 describes potential future refinements of the benefits assessment\n\n6\n\n2. TASAR Use Cases Analyzed\nBenefits of three types of aircrew requests were quantified. Other types of aircrew\nrequests that were not modeled have opportunities for benefits and therefore this analysis\nrepresents only part of the expected full benefit of TASAR. The benefits of the following\nthree types of aircrew requests were quantified in this paper:\n1) An aircraft is part of a reroute initiative to avoid convective weather or mitigate\ncongestion. Aircraft in these initiatives are sometimes not shifted back to userpreferred routes after the initiative has ended. The aircrew requests a lateral\ntrajectory change to a more efficient route.\n2) An aircraft is impacted by convective weather, and there is sufficient lead time to\nthe convective weather to allow a strategic route change rather than a tactical\nheading change. The aircrew requests a lateral trajectory change consisting of one\nor two named waypoints along the trajectory before reconnecting to the route.\n3) The aircrew requests a trajectory change (lateral, altitude, or combination lateral\nand altitude) to switch to a more wind-optimal trajectory. This request for a more\nwind-optimal trajectory is intended to occur when the aircraft is not impacted by a\nreroute initiative or convective weather.\nThe following logic is used to classify flights into one of the three request types. If an\naircraft is part of a reroute initiative that began before the aircraft departed, and the\nreroute initiative is cancelled or ended before the aircraft reached the arrival fix, then the\naircraft is classified as aircrew request type (1) above (even if convective weather is\npresent, since there may be overlap between the three request types). The data source for\nreroute initiatives is the National Traffic Management Log (NTML), available on the\nFederal Aviation Administration (FAA) Command Center website (www.fly.faa.gov). If\nat least one of the alternative routes of the aircraft is projected to enter convective\nweather, and the aircraft is not part of a reroute initiative that ends or is cancelled, then\nthe aircraft is classified as request type (2). The data source for convective weather is\nNext-Generation Radar (NEXRAD) radar mosaic base reflectivity (www.ncdc.noaa.gov).\nCertain conditions allow aircraft to request a higher altitude to fly over convective\nweather, but this is not included as part of (2) and so convective weather tops data is not\nconsidered. All other aircraft are classified as request type (3). However, there is overlap\nbetween the aircrew request types since the aircrew seeks a wind-optimal solution in all\ncases, but aircrew request type (3) does not have a reroute initiative or severe convective\nweather impacting the aircraft.\n\n3. Simulation Platform and Method to Quantify Benefits\nAn existing fast-time simulation platform that connects to the Future Air Traffic\nManagement Concept Evaluation Tool (FACET) through an Application Programming\nInterface (API) was used to model trajectories and airspace structure such as routes and\nsectors. In the integrated platform, two instances of FACET were used. One instance of\nFACET, the simulator FACET, was used to model the current state (simulation clock\n7\n\ntime) of aircraft trajectories. The other instance of FACET, the predictor FACET, was\nused to model future states of aircraft trajectories to test TASAR aircrew requests for\nconflicts with surrounding aircraft, conflicts with airspace hazards, and to calculate the\nimpacts of TASAR aircrew trajectory change requests on user time and fuel objectives.\nBoth the simulator and predictor instances of FACET were updated at one minute\nincrements.\nInput files to the simulation platform contain flight plans as well as corresponding\nhistorically flown four-dimensional (4D) trajectories. Aircraft were modeled to follow\ntheir flown trajectory until an aircrew request is granted. Traffic information was\nobtained from historical Aircraft Situation Display to Industry (ASDI) data.\nFACET was configured to predict future aircraft positions differently for historically\nflown 4D trajectories as compared to alternate trajectories generated by TASAR. Aircraft\nfollowing their historically flown 4D trajectory did not use aircraft performance or\natmospheric models and instead, arrived at the 4D waypoints as specified in the input file.\nFor synthesizing alternate trajectories generated by TASAR, FACET converted the flight\nplan to a series of latitude and longitude waypoints that were simulated based on aircraft\nperformance models. Wind modeling was based on historical Rapid Update Cycle (RUC)\nwinds data that was read from outside of FACET and was used to update the aircraft\ngroundspeed.\n3.1 TASAR Alternative Trajectory Generation (Optimization Model)\nIn the simulation, TASAR evaluated alternative trajectories at five-minute intervals from\ntop-of-climb to 200 nmi from the destination airport. Trajectories were evaluated against\na 50% fuel / 50% time objective and TASAR advisories were rejected if they increased\nfuel burned or flight time (i.e., tradeoffs between fuel burn and flight time were not\nconsidered).\nThe use of voice for aircrew requests limited the alternative lateral trajectories to\nchanging one or two named waypoints before reconnecting to the original trajectory. A\nbounding box was created for each origin-destination airport pair. All navigation aids\ninside the bounding box were used to generate alternative trajectories. The bounding box\nwas based on the geographical extent of the flown trajectories between each origindestination airport pair.\nThree alternate altitudes were considered at 2,000 feet above, 2,000 feet below, and 4,000\nfeet below the assigned altitude. Climbing was only permitted if the aircraft was at flight\nlevel (FL 350) or below to be conservative since aircraft weight was not modeled in the\nsimulation. Alternative trajectories consisted of lateral changes only, altitude changes\nonly, and combination altitude and lateral changes. The aircraft in the simulation were\nmodeled to follow their historical 4D trajectories once the aircraft were within 200 nmi of\nthe destination airport.\n\n8\n\n3.2 TASAR Request Model\nTASAR logic in the simulation implements filters to prevent the aircrew making requests\nthat would be considered unacceptable to the controller. Requests were not made if any\nof the following conditions are true:\nAircraft-aircraft conflict was predicted. The alternative trajectories generated by\nTASAR were probed to an eight-minute horizon to determine if there was a conflict\nwith the surrounding traffic using a conservative ten nmi lateral and 1,000 ft vertical\nminimum separation shell. It was assumed that 100% of traffic was equipped with\nADS-B Out since the earlier TASAR benefits study indicated that ADS-B Out\nequipage impacts ATC acceptability and workload but not user benefits since pilots\ncould make a user request soon after a denied request. It was assumed that the conflict\nprobe did not have access to flight plans and instead relied on state projections using\ncurrent heading, vertical rate, and speed. Post-processing of simulation results to\nassess the impact of ADS-B Out equipage is discussed in Section 5.\nAircraft-airspace hazard conflict was predicted. Alternative trajectories were also\nprobed for conflicts with airspace hazards including special activity airspace (SAA)\nand severe convective weather. Airspace hazards, either weather or SAA, were\ndefined as polygons with a floor, ceiling, and schedule for activation and\ndeactivation. Polygons were dynamic in the sense that they are active for a defined\nperiod of time and then replaced by other polygons at different locations to mimic the\nmotion of convective weather. If the aircraft was predicted (using the FACET\npredictor instance) to be inside an airspace hazard polygon, then the TASAR\nautomation was modeled to be aware of the airspace hazard conflict.\nAircraft had already made a request to current sector controller. Multiple requests in a\nsector are unreasonable and the aircrew waits until the next sector to make another\nrequest if the initial request is denied.\nAircraft was estimated to be in handoff status once the aircraft was within\napproximately 20 nmi of the sector boundary. Any request received while the aircraft\nis in handoff status is likely to be met with the response to make the request to the\nnext sector controller.\nAircraft was on initial climb from origin airport and had not yet reached cruising\naltitude. Controllers are concerned about potential interference of the departure\nstream with the arrival stream, so requests are generally denied until the aircraft\nreaches cruising altitude.\nAircraft is within 200 nmi of a large hub destination airport. Controllers indicated that\naircraft must generally be on their assigned arrival route within 200 nmi of a large\nhub destination airport.\n\n9\n\n3.3 Controller Evaluation of TASAR Requests\nThe controller was modeled to reject an aircrew request if any of the following conditions\nexist.\nThe aircrew request was projected to cause an aircraft-aircraft conflict. The controller\nhad more information about the surrounding traffic than the TASAR-equipped\naircraft including (1) the flight plans for all aircraft and (2) the ADS-B-equipped\naircraft beyond the sixty nmi assumed ADS-B range.\nThe aircrew request occurs in a sector that was experiencing traffic exceeding its\nmonitor alert parameter value (i.e., a red sector). This was an attempt to model the\nphenomenon that, as traffic demand increases in their sector, controllers develop\nplans to cope with the rising traffic and, unless the request is consistent with the\ncontroller plan, the aircrew request is likely to be denied. Under higher traffic levels\nthe aircrew request is less likely to be consistent with the controller plan\nThe aircrew request was projected to enter an adjacent red sector. Controllers are\ngenerally not aware of red sectors elsewhere and will not consider traffic demand in\nother sectors when evaluating aircrew requests. However, the area manager may\ninstruct the controller not to send traffic through an adjacent sector if the adjacent\nsector is currently experiencing high traffic.\nThe TASAR filters described previously, such as not making multiple requests to the\nsame sector controller, were not applied again on the controller side since these types of\nrequests would not reach the controller in the simulation.\n\n4. Annualized TASAR Benefit Results for Virgin America\nThe benefits analysis focused on Virgin America operations in the continental United\nStates. Operations performed using Airbus A320 and A319 aircraft were analyzed since\nthese are both candidates to be equipped with TASAR.\n4.1 Airport Pair Selected for Analysis\nThe Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) T-100 Domestic Segment databasei from\nApril 2013 to March 2014 was used to determine the annual frequency of Virgin America\noperations between airport pairs by aircraft type. The departures performed and aircraft\ntype fields in the T-100 database were used to determine annual operations by aircraft\ntype. These annual operations were then divided by the number of aircraft of each type to\nobtain the operations per aircraft shown in Table 1. The airport pairs that were analyzed\nare shown as shaded cells. The remaining airport pairs in the continental United States\nwere not analyzed due to time constraints.\n\ni\n\nhttp://www.transtats.bts.gov/Fields.asp?Table_ID=311\n\n10\n\nTable 1.

The expired reroute initiative and convective weather use cases did not\noccur frequently (less than 10% of historical flights). This does not imply that 10% of\nflights were impacted by convective weather since flights may be delayed or cancelled at\nlarge hub airports until the convective weather passes and therefore TASAR would not\ninteract with convective weather data. For the more common A320 aircraft, the expired\n11\n\nreroute initiative had highest average benefit (597 gallons/operation, 7.0 min/operation)\nand the convective weather and wind use cases had similar benefits (about 210\ngallons/operation, about 2.5 min/operation).\nDue to the similar convective weather use case per operation benefit as compared to the\nwind use case, the results are scaled without attempting to estimate the number of annual\nconvective weather use cases. For example, 3 out of 76 historical A320 flights between\nNew York (JFK) and Los Angeles (LAX) were classified as expired reroute initiative and\neach A320 operates between JFK and LAX an average of 64 times annually so (3/76)*64\n= 2.5 annual cancelled expired reroute initiative use cases between JFK and SFO\noccurred per A320. The fuel and time raw simulation outcomes in Appendix A are\nscaled, and the resulting fuel and time benefits are shown in Tables 2 to 3. Benefits are a\nfunction of both the benefit per operation and number of operations, so that the New\nYork-San Francisco (JFK-SFO) airport pair fuel benefit of about 4,900 gallons per\naircraft per year is higher than the Los Angeles-San Francisco (LAX-SFO) airport pair\nfuel benefit of about 700 gallons per aircraft per year, even though there are almost twice\nas many flights between LAX-SFO than JFK-SFO.\nTable 2.

A fuel cost of $3.03/gallon\nwas multiplied by fuel savings for the three use cases (i.e., 195.5 + 2628.6 + 22789.5 =\n25613.1 gallons for A319, rounded down to 25,000 gallons) and the number of aircraft of\nthat type to obtain a total annual savings of $4.27 million per year as shown in Table 4.\nTable 4.

Shown to illustrate that different amount of operations\nfor each aircraft type cause difference in benefits.\n\n13\n\nBTS Form 41i financial data was used to obtain maintenance and depreciation costs in\norder to convert time savings to cost savings. Schedule P-5.2 reports the total\nmaintenance, depreciation, and aircraft hours by aircraft type for Virgin America and\nother large carriers. These figures were used to estimate maintenance and depreciation\ncosts per minute by aircraft type shown in Table 5. These costs were used to convert time\nsavings into annual maintenance ($740,005) and depreciation ($72,090) savings.\nVirgin America incurs other costs, including crew costs, which are based on actual block\ntime. Flight crews are paid based on the scheduled block time or actual block time,\nwhichever is greater. TASAR was found to reduce actual block time above the scheduled\nblock time by an average of about 0.4 minutes per flight out of an average time savings\nper flight of 2.8 minutes to 3.3 minutes for the A320 and A319 respectively. These time\nsavings result in an additional crew cost savings that were not quantified but represent a\npotential additional TASAR benefit. The time savings may also result in increased\ncustomer satisfaction over time, but no attempt was made to quantify that benefit.\nTable 5.

A breakdown of\nthese percentages by aircraft type is included in Appendix B.\n\n5. ATC Impacts\nA total of 6,038 TASAR requests were simulated of which 470 (8%) were rejected due to\nconflicts (305) and other factors (165). Recall that it was assumed in the simulation that\n100% of traffic aircraft was equipped with ADS-B Out. However, this did not result in\nTASAR detecting all conflicts since TASAR does not have as much information as the\ncontroller. A total of 7,403 requests which, if approved, would save fuel and time were\nnot made by TASAR aircraft since they were predicted to be unapproveable to ATC\nincluding 1,162 due to conflicts. If the surrounding traffic was not equipped with ADS-B\nOut or the TASAR ownship was not equipped with ADS-B In, then this would imply that\napproximately (470 + 1,162) / (6,038 + 1,162) = 23% would reasonably be expected to be\nrejected. The (470 + 1,162) includes the original 470 rejections and the 1,162 requests not\nmade since they were predicted by TASAR to contain conflicts and, without both\ni\n\nhttp://www.transtats.bts.gov/Tables.asp?DB_ID=135\n\n14\n\nsurrounding traffic being equipped with ADS-B Out and TASAR ownship being\nequipped without ADS-B In, these conflicts would not be known to TASAR and the\nrequests would have been made. Therefore, while the previous benefit study indicated\nthat ADS-B Out equipage rate and TASAR ownship ADS-B In equipage does not\nsignificantly impact benefits, they are important in reducing nuissance requests that\nincrease controller workload. Also, while an attempt has been made to model controller\nbehavior as closely as possible, there is still uncertainty as to whether a controller will or\nwill not grant a request. Even if a request would cause a conflict, the controller may hold\nonto the request and wait for the traffic to pass and be clear of projected conflicts before\ngranting the request.\nIt was found that Virgin America TASAR requests were spread across the country and\nnot concentrated in a single Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC). The two sectors\nthat experienced the most TASAR requests at about 3% of total requests each, ZOA33\nand ZOA34, are high altitude (FL 240+) sectors east of San Francisco. ZLC45, which lies\non ZOA33\xe2\x80\x99s eastern border, is the sector with the next highest number of requests . The\nhigher number of requests in ZOA33, ZOA34, and ZLC45 is due to east-west traffic\ngoing to and from Virgin America\xe2\x80\x99s hub at San Francisco (SFO).\nDue to computational reasons, there was only one TASAR aircraft active in the\nsimulation at once, and so the following procedure, which also takes into account that not\nall airport pairs were simulated, was used to estimate daily requests by sector across\nmultiple simulation runs. The following statistics were used to derive (1) the expected\ndaily TASAR requests per day and (2) TASAR requests not made due to conflicts:\naverage daily Virgin America continental US flights (159) derived from Table 1, the\nnumber of flights simulated (1,554), the number of TASAR requests by sector, and\nTASAR requests not made due to conflicts (i.e., filtered) by sector. For example, ZOA33\nhad 203 requests reported in the simulation so it was estimated that (203)(159/1554) = 21\nrequests per day occur in ZOA33. The requests not made (filtered) were used to\napproximate the number of requests if the aircraft was not equipped with ADS-B In.\nThese filtered requests were added to requests made to approximate the number of\nrequests if the TASAR aircraft was not equipped with ADS-B In or traffic aircraft were\nnot equipped with ADS-B Out. A summary of this calculation is shown in Table 6 for the\nten sectors receiving the most TASAR requests.\nTable 6.

Table 7 shows\nhourly results for the three sectors with the most requests which indicate that 2 to 4\nrequests per sector occur during the peak hours between about 9 AM and 2 PM. If\nnecessary, the peak requests of 2 to 4 requests per sector per hour could potentially be\nmanaged through coordination with dispatchers or another procedure.\nTable 7.

Future Work\nA TASAR flight trial is planned for 2015 with one of the objectives to develop a\nmethodology to verify the accuracy of the TASAR Traffic Aware Planner (TAP)\nsoftware computed outcomes. This method could be applied to the simulation benefits\nresults presented in this report to verify that benefits are not systematically being over or\nunder reported. Following that flight test, it is expected that TASAR will be placed on a\nrevenue flight so the method can be applied and suitable adjustments made to TAP and\nthe benefits assessment.\nObservations at ATC facilities are also planned which could be used to refine controller\nmodels in the simulation to better estimate the conditions under which a TASAR request\nis accepted or rejected.\n\n7.
