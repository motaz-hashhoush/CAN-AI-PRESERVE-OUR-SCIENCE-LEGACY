Time signals via two modes high frequency and satellite were critically monitored and analyzed. This time format was modified to include the additional information about time of the day in year, month, day, hour, minute and second as well as DUT1 in BCD code and was disseminated via the satellite. These signals were decoded, displayed and studied. Some preliminary work on time transfer via TV using direct satellite broadcast, was also conducted.", "title": "A study of time dissemination via satellite in India", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-10T09:27:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19800020615, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Mathur, B.
