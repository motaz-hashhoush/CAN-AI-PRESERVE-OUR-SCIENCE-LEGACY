The effects of engineering works on maritime environments and resources, with the Chesapeake Bay as the area of prime interest are examined. Significant engineering projects, both actual and proposed, are described. The conflict of navigational demands and maintenance of an estuarine environment for commercial and sport fishing and recreation is described. Specific applications of remote sensors for analyzing ecological conditions of the bay are included.", "title": "Engineering works and the tidal Chesapeake", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-06T19:08:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19720018631, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Hargis, W.
