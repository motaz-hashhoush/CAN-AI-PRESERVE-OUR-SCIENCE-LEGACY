The eucrites are basalts that contain approx. 18 wt% FeO and contain trace metal. The eucrites are very depleted in siderophile elements, so it appears that the source regions of these basalts once equilibrated with Fe-Ni metal. Therefore, it is of interest to ask what fo2 is required to precipitate metal from a liquid of eucrite composition. Or in other words, what f02 did eucrites form under? This fo2 has been determined experimentally by and was found to be IW-1. Therefore, eucrites formed at about IW-1. In addition, it is interesting to note that assuming X(sub feo) = alpha(sub FeO) allows calculation of eucrite fo2 (assuming equilibrium with Fe metal). This calculation yields the same result as the experiments to within approx. 0.25 log units, reinforcing this result.", "title": "Redox Conditions on Small Bodies", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-21T22:50:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20040085422, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Jones, J.
