Saturn, like Earth, has a fullydeveloped magnetic tail, 80 to 100 R S in diamet,, r. Pioneer 11 made multiple\ncrossings of the tail current sheet during its near equatorial outbound trajectory in the dawn direction. One major difference between the two outer\nT\nmagnetospheres is the hydrogen and nitrogen torus roduced by itan which\nmaintains the 6plasma density between 10 -1 and 5 X 10\' P ions/cm3 and a te7n eraThis plasma is, in general, convected in the corotation\nture of - 10 K.\t\ndirection at nearly the rigid corotation speed. Energies of magnetospheric\nparticles extend to above 500 keV. A large increase in the proton and electron population below - 500 keV is found at the magnetopause. In contrast,\ninterplanetary protons and ions above 2 MeV havQ.Free access to the outer maqnetosphere to distances well below the Stormer cutoff. \t\nThis access\np resumably occurs through the magnetotail. As a result, the p roton eneray\nspectrum has two components: a low-energy power law component, E -Y , with Y 7, which becomes less steep below 100 keV; and a much harder interplanetary\nhigh-energy component with Y - 2. In addition to the H + , H 2 + , and H 3 + ions\nprimarily of local origin, energetic He, C, N, and 0 ions are found with solar\ncomposition. Their flux can be substantially enhanced over that of\ninterplanetary ions at energies of 0.2-0.4 MeV/nuc.\t\nProton pitch-anqle\ndistributions are generally pancake, while electron pitch-angle distributions\nmay be either dumbell (field-aligned) or pancake.\t\nField-aligned flow of\nobserved\t\npositions\t\nprotons anu electrons was\t\nat various\t\nin the\nAcceleration of particles into the several-hundred-keV range\nmagnetosphere.\t\nmust be taking place in the tail. Besides the field-aligned streaming\nmentioned earlier, Voyager 2 observed impulsive electron acceleration; and\nrapid changes in the proton and electron population (E - 1 MeV) require, at\ntimes, the existence of an intense source. No evidence has been found in the\nmagnetotail for either radial outflow of plasma or the presence of a magnetic\nanomaly at Saturn, but the spectrum of electrons and ions in the magnetotail\nappears to be modulated by the Kronian period.\n\nAD\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\nA planetary magnetosphere is formed by the interaction between the solar\n10\n\n\t\nwind its embedded magnetic field and the magnetic field near the planet(\').\nThe latter field can be due to ionospheric currents as at Venus or due to the\nplanetary dynamo field as at Earth, Jupiter and Saturn. Various p rocesses in\nthe magnetosphere require energy, such as heating t^ p ambient plasma to a\nsuper-thermal temperature, accelerating electron and ions to eneraies in the\nMeV range, or creating an aurora. At Earth, the magnetospheric processes\nderive their power primarily from the solar wind; at Jupiter, the\nmagnetosphere probably extracts most of its energy from the rotational energy\nof the planet. The Kronian magnetosphere is of special interest because its\n\nparameters are intermediate, and both processes might make significant\ncontributions.\nThe outer magnetosphere and magnetotail are thought to be the primary\nregions where the solar wind energy is transferred to the maqnetosphere; they\nare also regions where instabilities in the rapidly rotating plasma may be\nable to extract energy from the planetary angular momentum. To elate, we have\n\nfound good evidence for solar wind effects, but evidence for major rotational\nenergy sources at Saturn is still lacking. Because of the evolution of the\nsolar wind between 1 and 9.5 AU, the details of the interaction at Saturn may\n\nbe quite different from those at Earth, but the major features such as the\nexistence of a bow shock and magnetopause are unchanged. The density of the\nsolar wind is only 1% of its density near Earth, the Alfvenic-Mach number has\n\n(1) For clarity of presentation we have deleted all references from the\nsummary. References about the magnetosphere of Saturn are g iven later in the\nchapter. For more information on The Jovian Magnetosphere the reader should\n\nrefer to Dessler (1983), and on The terrestrial Magnetosphere to Hess (1968),\nor any number of other reviews. The changes in the properties of the solar\nwind are discussed by Smith and Wolfe (1977).\n\ne\n1\n\nI\n2\n\nincreased substantially, and the density and velocity fluctuations have damped\n\nout, while foreward and reverse shocks have developed at the boundaries\nbetween solar wind streams with appreciable velocity differences.\nThe outer magnetosphere is generally defined as the re g ion in which the\n\nfield in the magnetosphere is no longer symmetric around the planet. The\nsolar wind compresses the magnetosphere in the subsolar hemis p here and\n\ndistends it on the down-stream side where the outer magnetosphere merges\ngradually into the magnetotail. The energetic particles have soft spectra,\nand their fluxes show considerable temporal variability. Trapping lifetimes\ntend to be short, and near the magnetopause particles can probably- not\ncomplete a drift orbit around the planet. The boundary between the inner and\n\nouter magnetosphere is not sharp and covers the ranqe from 6 to 10 R S at\nSaturn (1P. S = 60,330km, Saturn\'s radius). Because the E-ring and Rhea\n\nabsorption processes fall logically into the discussion of the inner\nmagnetosphere, this chapter covers primarily the region from 10 R S to the\n\nmagnetopause and bow shock.\nSaturn\'s outer magnetosphere is filled with thermal plasma with a density\nof 2 x 10\n\n-2\n\nto 5 x 10 -1 ions cm -3 near the e q uator. The density decreases at\n\nhigher latitudes because the scale height is moderately small in the centrifugal potential. No such plasma exists in the outer terrestrial maaneto-\n\nsphere; there are two reasons for the difference.\nsource in addition to the polar ionosphere.\t\n\nFirst,\t Titan is a p+s^ima\n\nPhoto - . ionization of neutrals\n\nescaping from Titan\'s atmosphere are the dominant process, and direct\ninteraction between the magnetosphere and Titan\'s ionosphere is another\nmechanism when Titan is inside the magnetopause.\n\nIn addition,\t plasma is not\n\nconvected out of the magnetosphere as rapidly as at Earth because the\ncurotational electric field shields the plasma.\n\n3\n\nContinuous readjustments of\n)\n\ns\n\nVFW\n\n3\n\nthe outer magnetosphere to solar wind fluctuations are probably responsible\nfor heating the plasma and producing a tail of superthermal particles. As a\nresult, the energy density in the plasma is often comparable to that of the\nmagnetic field, thot is a - 1. Such a plasma can be unstable and may\n\nsignificantly modify the energetic: particle population.\nThe energet i c particle population consists of electrons and protons plus\nsome heavier Ions. Their energies are mostly less than 2 MeV at 10 R S and\nlessE3an 1 MeV near the mrronetopause, but higher energy cosmic rays have free\naLcess to the outer magnetosphere. On the average, the particle flux\nincreases inward but is subject to large temporal changes. These fluxes and\notter properties of Saturn\'s magnetosphere resemble those of the terrestrial\nmagnetosphere which will be used as a point of departure.\nThe reader should keep in mind that our knowledqe about the Kronian\nmagnetosphere is based on data from only three passes through that\nmagnetosphere, those by Pioneer 11 and Voyagers 1 and 2. The relevant\ninstruments on these spacecraft are listed in Table 1. Trajectories together\nwith the bow shock and magnetopause positions are shown in Fig. 1. The three\nspacecraft entered near the subsolar point at latitudes between 0\xc2\xb0 and 17\xc2\xb0.\nThe spacecraft left the magnetosphere towards dawn, Pioneer it and Vo l rager 2\nabout -\xc2\xb00\xc2\xb0 from the Saturn-Sun direction and Voyager 1 at about -120 0 . The\n\nlatitude of the 0ut40ind trajectories was restricted to about 1-20\xc2\xb0. We have\nno direct information about the polar region, the dusk side, or most of the\nmagnetotail. Similarly, we lack data over a large ranqe of interplanetary\nconditions. Clearly, our understanding of the magnetosphere based on ;uch\nlimited data is bound to contain uncertainties and incorrect interpretation of\nsome of the observations.\n..\n\n4\n\nThe discussion in this chapter has been kept general, but some\nfamiliarity on the part of the reader with magnetospheric terminolcgy and\nphenomena had to be assumed. The motion of trapped charged particles is\ndescribed by adiabatic theory (e.g. Northrop, 1963; Hess, 108) which breaks\nthe particle motion down into three components: The motion of the particle\naround a field line in a gyrocircle, the motion of the center of this circle\nalong the field line and the slow drift around the planet. A constant of the\n\nmot-\' , n, adiabatic invariant, is associated with each of the ci)Monents. The\nMcIlwain L parameter (McIlwain, 1961) is a convenient way to characterize a\ndrift shell and indicates approximately the distance in R S at which the\nparticle crosses the equator. In a rotating magnetosphere, a stationary\nobserver sees also the bulk motion of the plasma which may be -.1 r;aid or\n\npartial corotation (Northrop and Birrt\xe2\x80\x9e ngham, 1982). Electric and magnetic\nfield fluctuations permit particles to move radially across ma gnetic field\nlines, and because of the random nature of the fluctuations, this process can\nbe described as a diffusion of the particle density (Schulz and Lanzerotti,\n1974; Birmingham and Northrop, 1981).\n\nSolar Wind - Magnetosphere Interaction\n.-.]\n\nThe interaction of the solar wind with an obstacle like Saturn\'s magnetosphere can be modeled by gasdynamic theory in which particle collisions in\nclassical theory are replaced by coupling through electric and magnetic field\nfluctuations in the solar wind (Spreiter et al., 1966, 1968). A detached bow\nshock forms if the flow is supersonic, and a transition region called the\nmagnetosheath is created in which the shocked solar wind plasma flows around\nthe object. The magnetopause is the boundary between the solar wind plasma\nand the obstacle or magnetosphere. Because the magnetosphere is not riqid,\n\n\t\n3\n\n5\n\nthe magnetopause occurs at a distance where th , momentum flux of the impinging\nsolar wind is balanced by internal pressure at the boundary of the\nmagnetosphere. The "subsolar" distance where this occurs is proportional to\nthe inverse 1/6 power of the solar wind ram pressure if the compressibility of\nthe planetary magnetic dipole field controls the magnetopause position. This\nis the case at the Earth and was also found to be true at Saturn (Bridge et\nal., 1981 and 1982; Slavin et al. 1983). In contrast, the relation is p-1/3\nat Jupiter where the dynamic solar wind pressure is p.imarily balanced b y the\npressure and diamagnetic effect of the magnetospheric plasma rather than by\nthe planetary field itself (Siscoe et al., 1980).\nA variety of solar wind conditions existed during the Saturn encounters\nof Pioneer 11 and Voyagers 1, 2. Table 2 lists the positions relative to\nSaturn at which the bow shock and magiietopause were encountered. These were\nidentified in both the magnetic field and plasma signatures, excent for some\noutbound crossings (especially for Voyager 2) during which the magnetic\nsignatures were less distinct. A fast solar wind stream compressed the\nmagnetosphere just prior to the time when Pioneer entered the magnetosphere at\n17.3 R S . The solar wind pressure relaxed while Pioneer 11 was in the\nmagnetosphere and must have been quite variable to account for the many\noutbound crossings of the magnetopause and bow shock. The solar wind\nconditions were relatively stable during the Voyager 1 encounter and the bow\nshock and magnetopause were observed at "typical" distances, but the subsolar\nmagnetosheath was significantly thinner than during the other crossings.\nHowever, even during this encounter, the dynamic solar wind pressure varied by\nat least a factor of two (Bridge et al., 1981) as deduced from interplanetary\nVoyager 2 measurements made at the appropriate time to account for the\npropagation delay between the two spacecraft.\n\n6\n\nThe Voyager 2 encounter with Saturn occurred durinq more disturbed\ninterplanetary conditions than the others. An interplanetary shock wave had\npassed this region 3 1/2 days prior to encounter and an interplanetar y current\nsheet 12 hours after the shock. The magnetic field jumped from < M nT to\n>1.0 nT in the shock, and both the density and speed of the solar wind\nincreased (E.C. Sittler \xe2\x80\xa2 , private communication). Inbound, five bow shock\ncrossings were observed between 31.5 and 23.6 R S . Voyager 2 entered a\ncompressed magnetosphere at 18.5 RS , but the magnetosphere must have expanded\nwhile the spacecraft was in the magnetosphere because the last outbound\nmagnetopause crossing did not occur until 70.4R S (Table 2). Observations of\nthe dynamic pressure of the solar wind during the preceedin q nine months gives\na , 3% chance, based on the p -1/6 scaling, that ti, magnetosphere could have\nexpanded that much (Behannon et al., 1983; Bridge et al., 1982; Ness et al.,\n1982). An alternate explanation for the large size is that Saturn passed\nthrough the extended Jovian magnetotail (Scarf et al., 1982; Warwick et al.,\n1982). Prior to the Saturn encounter, recurring anamolous magnetic field,\nplasma and plasma-wave features observed by Voyager 2 were interpreted as\nencounters of the Jovian tail at - 9000 RJ from Jupiter (Scarf, 1979; Scarf et\t\n\nr\n\nal., 1981b, 1982; Lepping et al., 1982; Kurth et al., 1982; Desch, 19A3), and\nthe geometry for encountering the Jovian tail was still favorable while\nVoyager 2 was in Saturn\'s magnetosphere (Behannon et al., 1983).\nThese differences between encounters were also reflected in the particle\npopulation and other properties of the outer magnetosphere and will be\ndiscussed in the next sections. The observed large changes of the boundary\nlocation introduce uncertainties into the deduced shape of th= bow shock and\nmagnetopause. The shapes appear to be similar to those in the terrestrial\nmagnetosphere, but the bow shock and magnetopause at Saturn may be somewhat\n\na\n\n7\n\nblunter in ecliptic plane projection (Slavin et al., 1983; Smith et al.,\n1980). Observations were made only near the equatorial plane of Saturn, and\nno definitive information is available about the shape in a meridional plane.\nThe solar wind-magnetosphere interaction at Saturn occurs at sonic- and\nAlfvdnic-Mach numbers of 10-20 and at pressures that are down by a factor of\n- 100 from those at Earth. A major effect of the higher Mach number, as predieted by gas dynamic theory, is a larger Jump in the plasma temperature\nacross the shock, which should be proportional to the square of the Mach\nnumber (Spreiter et al., 1966). This increase was observed in the jump of\nelectron temperatures Te (2) /Te (1) which is - 50 at Saturn, - 15 at Jupiter,\nand only 3-4 at Earth (Scudder et al., 1981; Scudder, private communications).\nPlasma-wave turbulence was observed at the Saturnian bow shock, which suggests\nthat the plasma instabilities associated with the higher Mach number shock\ndiffer from those of lower Mach numbers found at the terrestrial planets\n(Scarf et al., 1981a). The enhancement of the wave spectrum below the ion\nplasma frequency characteristic of bow shocks at Earth and Venus is not\nobserved at Jupiter or Saturn.\nIn the subsolar hemisphere, the Saturnian bow shock is a strong, quasiperpendicular shock, as is to be expected from the avera ge spiral angle direction of the interplanetary field. Thus, the field magnitude changes at the\nshock but not its direction (Fig. 2). The Jump in magnitude is significantly\nsharper when the magnetosphere contracts than when it expands (Leppinq et al.,\n1981a; Smith et al., 1980). The shock is about 2000 km thick corresponding to\na few ion inertial lengths, much smaller than the ion cyclotron radius and\ni\nlarger than the electron cyclotron radius. Thus, cyclotron waves do not play\na major role in the formation of the shock.\n\n8\n\nThe level of plasma waves in the magnetosheath was found to be extremely\nlow (Scarf et al., 1981x). At much lower frequencies, the magnetic field magnitude varied semi-periodically throughout the sheath (Fig. 2) during the\nPioneer 11 and Voyager 1 inbound passes. These large field changes are anticorrelated with the plasma density in the sheath. Lepping et al. (19A1a) have\ninterpreted these observations in terms of slow mode magnetosonic waves. An\nalternate explanation is based on the twan and Wolf (1976) mechanism. The\nlarge size and bluntness of the magnetopause may mean that flux tubes remain\nin the sheath for a relatively long time and the plasma could drain off\n\nby\n\nmoving parallel to the field (Stavin et al., 1983; Smith et al., 1980). In\nthis explanation, an unspecified wave is required to account for the even\nspacing throughout the sheath. No such fluctuations in field magnitude were\nobserved by Voyager 2 during its inbound magnetosheath passage.\nThe magnetopause of Saturn as well as that of the other planets may\ngenerally be characterized by a tangential discontinuity in the magnetic\nfield. A minimum variance analysis applicable to tangential discontinuities\n(Siscoe et al., 1968) and the more general method of Sonnerup and Cahill\n(1967) give consistent results. These analyses give the direction of the\nnormal to the magnetopause, and the directions agree with those pred \xe2\x80\xa2 ted by\nthe models of the magnetopause position (Lepping et al., 1981x; Less et al.,\n1982; Smith et al., 1980). The presence of surface waves on the magnetopause\nwas deduced from the five regularly spaced crossings daring the Voyager 1\ninbound pass (Figs. 2 and 3). Such waves have also been seen at the Earth\'s\nmagnetospause and were studied initially by Aubry et al. (1971; see also\nLepping and Burbaga, 197 4 and references therain). The waves at Saturn may be\n\ncharacterized by a period of 23m, an amplitude of - 0.5 R S , and a wave length\nof - 5 RS . It is believed that they propagate parallel to the equatorial\n\na\t\n\n^\n\n1\n\n9\n\nplane of Saturn and "tailward" with a velocity of 180 t 90 km/s (Leppinq et\nal., 1981x). These characteristics are consistent with a Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability operating at the frontside of the magnetopause which is drive n by\nthe faster moving plasma in the magnetosphere. This is in contrast to the\ncase at Earth, where the waves at the dawn and dusk magneto pause are thought\nto be driven by the more rapidly moving magnetosheath plasma (Miura and\nPritchett, 1982; Pu and Kivelson, 1983).\nThe magnetopause constitutes a boundary to electrons, protons, and ions\nwith energies below 0.5 MeV. An exception to t l% is rule occurred during the\nVoyager 2 inbound pass when enhanced energetic particle fluxes were already\nobserved 15 minutes prior to the magnetopause crossing as identified by\nmagnetometer and plasma cup data (Krlmigis et al., 1982; Vogt et al., 1982).\nThis increase was accompanied by a change in the magnetic field of the\nmagnetosheath from one with a vertical component opposite to the planetq-y\nfield to one with a parallel vertical component. The first order anisotropy\nin the angular distribution of protons suggests that the magnetopause was\nmoving inward at that time :v:":h a speed of 10 km s -1 .\n\nThe enhanced density of\n\nhot plasma in the outer magnetosphere may have changed the magnetopause\ncharacteristics during the Voyager 2 observations (Maclennan et al., 1983).\n\nThe Cold Plasma in the Outer Magnetosphere\nere\nThe plasma density decreases at the magnetopause and its temperature\nincreases (Fig. 4) as the spacecraft moves from the sheath into the hotter\nmagnetospheric plasma (Bridge et al., 1981). At the Earth, in contrast, no\nthermal plasma is found between -- 5.6 R E and the magnetopause. Before\ndiscussing the variations of the plasma parameters, let us fis-st treat the\naverage properties of the thermal plasma in the outer magnetosphere. A syn-\n\nb,\n\nA_\t\n\n__\n\n10\n\nthesis of the data from the three spacecraft shows a fairly thick sheet of\n1\n\nplasma with a radial density profile proportional to L" 3.5\nAn ion spectrum taken about 0.5 %s south of the equator at L\n\n0.5 (Fig. 5).\n\nn\n\n15 (Fig. b)\n\nshows a heavy ion component of either 0 \xe2\x99\xa6 or N\' which has three times the\nnumber density of protons (Bridge et al., 1981). In the centrifugal potential\nof a rotating magnetosphere, the heavy ions should dominate at the center of\nthe sheet because of ambipolarity. This effect is demonstrated by comparing\nion spectrw taken at different latitudes (Fig. 7). The Voya ger 2 spectra taken\nat 18\xc2\xb0 contain almost no heavy ions. It may also be noted from Fig. 7 that\nthe temperature of the hydrogen component was considerably higher during the\nVoyager 2 encounter (the distribution function peaked at\n\nA\n\nhigher energy and\n\nwas wider). In a two component plasma, a higher temperature of the light component would be expected off the equator, but differences in the state of the\nmagnetosphere may also have contri4vted to the difference between the two\npasses.\nOne major difference between the outer magnetospheres of Saturn and Earth\nis the presence of the giant satellite Titan and its dense atmosphere. At any\ngiven time Titan can be in the magnetosphere, in the magnetosheath, or in the\nsolar wind (Wolf and Neubauer, 1982).The statistics of magnetopAuse locations\ngiven by Siscoe (1978) when extrapolated to the observed magnetic moment of\nSaturn lead to the prediction that the orbit of Titan will lie\n\n--fiolly within\n\nthe magnetosphere approximately 50% of the time. In fact, of the three\nspacecraft that have flown past Saturn, only Voyager 1 found Titan\'s entire\norbit enclosed within the magnetosphere. Titan itself,however, is generally\ninside the magnetosphere because it spends relatively littla tirse near the\nsubsolar part of its orbit.\nTitan, its atmosphere, and the Titan-magnetosphere interaction are dealt\n\nof plasma. Titan is the direct source of a stream of plasma extending in the\nlocal corotation direction. Estimates of the source strength range from 1.2\n1024 ions/sec (Gurnett et al., 1982) to 6 x 10 24 ions/sec (Bridge et al.,\n1981). This matter is apparently made up primarily of heavy ions of mass 14\n(N+ ) and possibly even molecular ions of mass 2b (N 2+ or H2CN+ ) (Hartle et\nal., 1982). This directly outflowing plasma or Titan plume tends to remain\nin the equatorial plane and to merge into the background, somewhat as a comet\ntail eventually merges into the interplanetary plasma.\nIn addition to the stream in the Titan wake (density peak no. 1 in Fig.\n4), the PLS instrument on Voyager 1 also encountered density enhancements\ninward and outward of the orbit of Titan (density peaks 2, 3 and 4 in Fig.\n4). These enhancements are also characterized by a high density and a low\ntemperature and have been interpreted by Eviatar et al. (1982) to be multiple\nenciunters with the extended Titan plume. They showed that the plume would he\nwrapped around Saturn by corotation and could last three Kronian periods\nbefore being reduced to the density of the background plasma. The plume would\nbe dispersed by the combined effects of acceleration up to corotation speed,\nof radial expansion by the centrifugal interchange mode and of heatin g which\nincreases the vertical thickness of the plume. The radial displacements of\nthe plume as a whole are related to magnetopause motions driven by variations\nin solar wind dynamic pressure. In addition to the density enhancements\ntentatively identified as the extended plume of Titan, other less pronounced\nenhancements occur between L = 10 and 17 (Fig. 4) which are also correlated\nwith lower temperatures. At a higher latitude of - 18 0 , `r\'oyager 2 observed\nsimilar density increase!, N ut these correlate with higher rather than lower\ntemperatures. It has been suggesxed that the flux tube content remains\n\n12\n\nconstant and that the decrease in scale height at lower temperatures\nconcentrates the plasma near the equator (Sittler et al., 1983). This can\naccount for the anti-correlation between temperature and density near the\nequator and correlation at a higher latitude.\nAn alternate explanation for the large variation of the plasma density in\nthe outer magnetosphere has been proposed by Goertz (1983). The plasma\nbecomes potentially unstable against radial outflow when the centrifugal force\non the plasma exceeds the magnetic field stress; this occurs when the\ncorotation energy density of the plasma becomes greater than the maonetic\nfield energy density (hill et al., 1974; Kennel and Coroniti, 1978). This\ncondition is satisfied at some locations in the outer magnetosphere. For\ninstance at L-15 near, the equator, Bridge et al., (1981) find a heavy ion\nplasma rotating at 139 km s -1 with a density of - 0.4 cm - 3 . Since the\nmagnetic field is about 1OnT, the corotation energy density is about twice the\nfield energy density for a nitrogen plasma. The solar wind pressure would\ninhibit radial outflow in t\t\n\nsubsolar hemisphere, but plasma outflow into the\n\ntail will occur if the instability can grow sufficiently rapidly. In contrast\nto Evitar et al. (1982), Goertz (1983) concluded that the Titan plume and the\nhigh density edge of the plasma sheet at L-15 (Fig. 4) are sufficiently\nunstable to produce radial outflow into the magnetotail in the form of a\nplanetary wind. In this A cture, detached plasma blobs from the inner,\nstably-trapped plasma sh eet account for most of the density enhancements\nobserved by Voyagers 1 and 2.\nThe plasma in the outer magnetosphere may also be moved around by means\nof a large-scale magnetospheric circulation, which is referred to as\nconvection. In the case of Earth, the solar wind exerts a tangential drag on\nthe magnetospheric plasma near the magnetopause. A convection pattern results\n\n)\n\n13\n\nwhich is fixed in the frame of reference in which the magnetopause is at\nrest.\t\n\nThe depth of penetration of the convection into the magnetosphere is\n\nlimited by a tendency of the resident plasma to corotate with the planet. \t\ntendency to corotate increases toward the planet. \t\n\nThe\n\nIn the case of the Earth,\n\nthe convection pattern penetrates about half way from the magnetopause to the\n\nE\n\nEarth.\t\n\nLocally generated plasma in this region is, in a manner of speaking,\n\nE\nt\n\nscoured out by the convection.\t\n\nBrice and Ioannides (1970) predicted on the\n\nr\nbasis of a simple scaling argument that at Jupiter rotation should dominate\nover convection all the way to the magnetopause.\t\n\nThe same conclusion should\n\nalso apply to Saturn (Scarf, 1975); however, Kennel and Coroniti\t (1978)\npointed out that the Brice and Ioannides calculation ignored the time\ndependence of the convection process, and this could occasionally expose the\nouter magnetosphere to convective transport. \t\n\nThe possibility is more likely\n\nin the case of Saturn where rotational dominance is predicted to be smaller\nthan at Jupiter.\t\n\nSince the refill time scale can be very long in the large\n\nvolume of the Saturnian magnetosphere, the scars left by occasional scouring\nevents would persist for a correspondingly long time (Siscoe, 1979). \t\n\nIt is\n\npossible that the discontinu i ty in the radial\t density profile between L = 8\nand L = 9 seen in the Pioneer 11 data in Fig. 5 is such a scar.\t\n\nA more\n\nr\ndefinitive test for the presence of the scouring process was possible with the\nVoyager data, which permitted a determination of the radial profile of the\n\ntotal number of electrons contained in a unit magnetic flux tube.\t\n\nIn contrast\n\nto the number density profile, the magnetic flux tube content showed no\nappreciable discontinuity in the outer magnetosphere at least out to L = 14\n(Bridge et al., 1982), but almost complete plasma dropouts were observed\nbeyond L = 14 (Fig. 4).\t\n\nWe may infer that rotation completely dominates solar\n\nwind driven convection to this distance.\n\n-\n\nu\n\nr\t\n\n_\n\n14\n\nThe above discussion has shown that several processes individually or in\ncombination can account for the large fluctuations in plasma density observed\noutside of L=15. On a phenomenological basis, this region has been described\nas the plasma mantel, and we find that magnetic field magnitudes and the\nfluxes of more energetic particles (Krimigis et al., 1982) also show larqer\ntemporal variations in this region than inside of L - 15.\nIn addition to the plume of Titan, there are several other candidate\nsources for the observed plasma. Ionization of the large neutral cloud of\nhydrogen reported by the UVS group (Broadfoot et al., 1981) will be a much\nstronger source of plasma than the Titan plume. Bridge et al. (1982)\ncalculated the neutral hydrogen lifetime against ionization processes and\nfound a maximum lifetime near Titan where photoionization is the dominant\nprocess. Closer to Saturn the plasma density increases, and the hydrogen is\nlost to both charge exchange and electron impact ionization. In equilibrium,\nthe rate at which plasma is generated from the neutral cloud must be eoual to\nthe rate at which the neutral hydrogen is added to the cloud by nonthermal\nescape from Titan, which occurs at the rate of approximately 2 x 1026 atoms\nS -1 .\n\nAlso according to their calculation, nonthermal escape of atomic\n\nnitrogen occurs at the rate of approximately 3 x 1026 atoms s -1 .\n\nUnder the\n\nassumption that all of the neutral matter entering the cloud is ionized, mass\nis added to the plasma from all of the Titan-related sources at a rate of the\norder of 7 kg s` 1 . Protons could also originate from the atmosphere of\nSaturn, and both protons and oxygen ions would be produced by sputtering of\nthe icy satellites, Tethys, Dione and Rhea (Lanzerotti et al., 1983b) and of\nthe A ring. Thus, the composition at any one point is determined by the\nrelative source strength, by poF ^able loss mechanisims, and by transport that\n\nredistributes ions once they are formed.\n\n15\n\nIn addition to the rapid transport mechanisms described above, a more\nuniform redistribution of the plasma can be achieved by means of diffusion.\nDiffusion can be driven by the centrifugal force (autotropic diffusion; Siscoe\nand Summers, 1981) or by the electric field generated in the dynamo region of\nthe atmosphere and mapped into the magnetosphere along the highly conducting\nmagnetic field lines (heterotropic diffusion; Brice and Ioannidis, 1970). In\nthe Jovian magnetosphere, the Io torus provides a large mass on which the\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\ncentrifugal force can act, thereby assuring the dominance of autotropic over\nheterotropic diffusion. At Saturn, on the other hand, the mass of locally\ngenerated plasma is much smaller, and it is not evident which mode of\ndiffusion dominates. However, as Siscoe and Summers (1981) showed for\nJupiter\'s magnetosphere, the radial density profile produced by the two types\nof diffusion are virtually indistinguishable. Both yield profiles of the form\nL_p where p depends on precise details of the structure of the turbulence\neither in atmosphere or in the magnetosphere. A value between 3 and 4 is\nconsistent with predictions based on simple models of the driving turbulence\nin both cases.\nFor heterotropic diffusion, the applicable diffusion coefficient has the\nparadigmatic form\nD = kL 3\t(1)\n\nwhere k = 1x10" 10 Ri sec -1 has been suggested by extrapolation from Jupiter\n(Siscoe, 1979). Krimigis et al. (1981) have derived a diffusion coefficient\nf\nfrom electron observations near Rhea with k - 6x10 -11 Ri sec -1 , A steady\n\nt\n\nstate model of the population of the region by neutral and ionized matter from\nTitan yields a similar value for the diffusion coefficient (Eviatar and\nPodolak, 1983). These results ,re consistent with radial transport by means\ni\n\nI\n\n-^.\t\n\n-{^..t\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2.^\n\n\'a.\n\n^\n\n^\n\n\t\n\n_\t\n\ni!\n\n*.\n\n16\n\nof simple heterotropic diffusion, but they do not constitute a definitive\ndetermination of the transport process. Based on the above diffusion\ncoefficient, one can calculate the rate of outward transport of oxygen ions\nfrom the inner magnetosphere and balance this against the loss rate due to\ncharge exchange in the neutral hydrogen torus from Titan. This is a very\nefficient loss mechanism for 0 + ions because of the near resonance of the\nreaction, and Eviatar et al. (1983) concluded that most of the 0+ ions could\nnot diffuse far beyond the inner boundary (8 RS ) of the hydrogen torus.\nWe have not considered diffusion associated with solar wind fluctuations\nwhich can cause motion of the magnetopause and thereby violate the third\nadiabatic invariant. Such fluctuations are the prime source of radial\ndiffusion of energetic particles in the Earth\'s magnetosphere\n(Faltham er, 1968) and produce magnetic impulses which generate a diffusion\ncoefficient that varies as L 10 (Schulz and Lanzerotti, 1974). If the\ndiffusion reported by Krimigis et al., (1981) was attributed to such a\nprocess, we would find k - 1.4 x 10" 17 RS\n\ns -1 .\n\nAveraging this L dependence\n\nover the outer magnetosphere gives a mean radial transport rate three orders\nof magnitude greater than that calculated by Eviatar and Podolak (1983) and\nwould re q uire a cold plasma source strength wastly in excess of the fluxes\nobserved during the Titan encounter (Hartle et al., 1982). It appears\ntherefore that Saturn\'s outer magnetosphere resembles in this respect more the\nJovian than terrestrial magnetosphere.\nAnother potential plasma source for the outer magnetosphere are the gas\nand ions surrounding the A ring. A hydrogen cloud of 6x10 33 atoms has been\ndetected (Broadfoot et al., 1981). A charge exchange reaction between ions\ncorotating with the planet and the neutral cloud would produce energetic\nneutrals with enough velocity to reach the outer magnetosphere but less than\n\n\t\n\n17\n\nthe local escape velocity. As Eviatar et al. (1983) have shown, these\nneutrals have a hi9t probability of being re-ionized in the outer\nmagnetosphere and may add significantly to\n\np lasma from Titan.\n\nIt is of interest to determine whether the plasma in Saturn\'s outer\nmagnetosphere can corotate with Saturn. For the purpose of this calculation\nwe will ignore the other plasma sources and use only the - 7 kg s -1 of plasma\noriginating directly or indirectly from Titan. Corotation is retarders in\nJupiter\'s magnetosphere by the outflow of plasma composed of matter\noriginating on Io (McNutt et al., 1981). The breaking results from the\nnecessity to supply angular momentum to the outflowing matter by means of an\nelectrical current system that links the magnetospheric plasma to the planet\'s\nionosphere (Hii\'i, 1980). Beyond 20 R S , the electrical circuit at Jupiter is no\nlonger able to transfer the angular momentum required to maintain rigid\ncorotation.\nThe neutral particle torus of Titan produces ions over a large radial\nrange (6.5-23.5 RS ). Because we do not know the mass loading rate as a function of distance, we cannot derive rigorously the partial corotation velocity\nas a function of distance. However, we can estimate an average by treatinq\nthe torus as a rigid unit. The resulting expression for the lag is (Eviatar\net al., 1983)\n\ntic\n\nV\t\n\nc\nV -\n\n(2)\n\nc+\n\nin which\n\n8n E BS RS d.\n\n^\n\nc\t `\n\n\t\n(in Gaussian units)\n\nc\n\n(3)\n\nL\n\nA\n\n__..Jag\n\n18\n\nwhere V is the partiel corotation speed, V C , the rigid corotation s peed is\nevaluated at the center of the torus, L; E is the ionospheric heiqht\n\nintegrated Pederson conductivity, B s is the equatorial surface magnetic field\nstrength, R s is the planet\'s radius, AL is the radial thickness of fte torus\nin units of R S , and\t\n\nA is the mass loading rate. Eviatar et al. (1982) have\n\ncalculated a conductance of E = 1.7 x 10 10 cm s -1 (or 0.018 mho) on the basis\n\nof electron and neutral particle densities in Saturn\'s ionosphere provided by\nVoyager data. For & = 17 and L = 15, which are representative of the neutral\n\nAC - 14 kg s-1\n\nhydrogen torus (Broadfoot et al., 1981), we obtain\nAnother recent estimate (Connerney et al., 1983) of E\t\n\nMc\n\n1.\n\n70 kg s -1 .\t\n\nUsing the value of\t\n\n9x1010 cm s -1 gives\n\n- 7 kg s -1 deduced earlier, we\n\nobtain V/V c =0.67 - 0.91. Bridge et al. (1981) found that corotation was\nmaintained to within 10 percent out to 15 R S , but probably beqan to lag\nbetween 15 and 18 Rs. Given the uncertainties in the determinations of E and\n\nM, we can only conclude that rigid corotation is marginal, and substantial\ndepartures may occur at times as seen by Frank et al. (1980).\n\nThe Magnetic Field and Hot Plasma in the Outer Magnetosphere\n\nThe magnetic field configuration at Saturn resembles that found in the\nouter terrestrial magnetosphere except that the direction of the field is\nreversed (Fig. 8 and 9). In the subsolar hemisphere the observed field is\nhigher than the model field because of compression by the solar wind, and in\nthe dawn direction we can observe the onset of the magnetotail (Fig. 8) which\nwill be discussed in a later section (Ness et al., 1981 and 1982; Smith et\nal., 1980). Fig. 9 shows averaged vector fields for both Voyaqers projected\ninto XSM-ZSM plane of the solar-magnetospheric coordinate system (X SM toward\n\n19\n\ni\nthe sun, Z SM positive northward and oriented such that the planetary dipole\naxis lies in the XSM-ZSM plane; Ness, 1965). The field magnitudes are scaled\nlogarithmically, and the positions of a model magnetopause in the XSM-ZSM\nplane are illustrated for both missions. The magnetic field observed by\nVoyager 1 outside of 15 R S pointed almost perfectly southward, which is\nconsistent with the relatively quiet conditions of the solar wind durin g the\nearly part of the encounter.\nVoyager 2 encountered a more compressed magnetosphere, and the hourly\na l;erages shown in Fig. 9 were less steady. Initially, the field pointed predominately southward (B Z = -6.6 nT) but with substantial sunward (2.5 nT) and\neastward (1.8 nT) components. Starting near 15 R S , the field rotated towards\nthe radial direction with a decrease in the eastward component and corresponeding increase in the sunward component until B X was comparable to B Z (at -in\nR s in Fig. 9). These changes have been interpreted in terms of an expansion\nof the magnetosphere in response to a major decrease of the external pressure\n(Ness et al., 1982). Based on the position of the magnetopause crossing\nobserved during the outbound pass, such an expansion must have occurred while\nVoyager 2 was in the magnetosphere, and the field changes identify the time\nwhen the expansion occurred. It is quite possible that this expansion\noccurred because the distant Jovian magnetotail engulfed Saturn at that time\n(Desch, 1983). Significant changes in the energetic particle population were\nobserved concurrently with the field changes. Their flux became more variable\nand increased by an order of magnitude followed by a brief decrease by a\nfactor of - 40 at 15.5 R S (Vogt et al., 1982). The Voyager 2 observations are\nat least qualitatively similar to changes in the magnetic field magnitude and\ndirection observed with Pioneer 11 which occurred most likely in response to a\nlarge decrease of the solar wind pressure (Smith et al., 1980).\n\nsF\n\nI\n20\n\nAs can be seen in Fig. 8, the addition of a ring current field to the\nintrinsic planetary magnetic field improves substantially the fit between\nobservations and the model field (Connerney et al., 1981, 1983; Ness et al.,\n1982). A good fit to both Voyager 1 and 2 data has been obtained with a rinq\ncurrent between L=8 and 15.5 RS , which falls off as L -1 and is confined to\nwithin t 3 R S of the equator. Under the assumption of a very cold plasma,\nConnerney et al. (1983) have derived the ion density in the outer\nmagnetosphere (Fig. 5). Their values are in reasonab l e agreement with\nobservations but consistently higher. The agreement between observed ion\ndensities and densities derived from the model magnetosphere could be further\nimproved by including the effect of the hot plasma.\nThe importance of the hot plasma is best expressed in terms of the ratio\nbetween the plasma and magnetic field pressures or energy densities. As\nKrimigis et al. (1983) have shown, this ratio in the outer magnetosphere near\nthe equator is generally between 0.1 and 1.0 (The inbound pass in Fig. 10).\nWhen\n\nd - 1, the plasma is responsible for a major part of the pressure and\n\ncan therefore significantly effect the field configuration. The plasma\npressure is particularity high at the subsolar magnetopause with B - 1 and\nthus contributes half of the internal pressure required to balance the dynamic\npressure of the solar wind (Smith et al., 1980). A very similar situation\nexists at the magnetopause of Jupiter (Lanzerotti et al., 1983). Thus one\nmight expect that the magnetopause and bow shock distances would also scale as\nat Jupiter which is a p_1/3 rather than as at Earth, a p_1/6. However,\nthe significant quantity that controls the scaling is not the value of g but\nthe origin of the magnetic field at the magnetopause. At Saturn this field is\napparently due to the intrinsic planetary field and thus the magnetopause\ndistance follows the scaling law of a dipole. At Jupiter when the subsolar\n\nA90t\n\n21\n\nmagnetopause is beyond 50 Rj , the field in the outer magnetosphere is highly\nvariable and apparently is prim-irlily due to the magnetospheric plasma/current\nsystem. Because the plasma/currents will readjust themselves in response to\nchanges of the solar-wind pressure, a different scaling law applies.\n\nEnergetic Particles in the Outer Magnetosphere\nA flux of energetic electrons, protons, and heavier ions with energies up\nto - 1 MeV is trapped by the magnetic field of the outer magnetosphere. Fig.\n11 gives a three dimensional overview of the ion (protons and heavier ions)\nand electron spectra observed with Voyager 2. A sharp increase in particle\nflux occurred at the magnetopause with the largest increase at lower energies.\nOn the average, the flux increased further between the magnetopause and 10 RS,\nalthough substantial spatial and/or temporal fluctuations were superimposed on\nthe average increase. The most noticeable of these is the decrease in the low\nenergy ion flux inside of 15 R S which coincides with the magnetic field\nchanges discussed previously and is presumably due to an expansion of the\nmagnetosphere in response to a large decrease of the external pressure.\nThe observed fluxes are not symmetric between the inbound and outbounI\npass of Voyager 2. This asymmetry is partially due to the difference in latitude but also reflects to a large extent the asymmetry of the magnetosphere\nbetween the suhsolar direction and the dawn direction (Fig. 1b). The onset of\nthe magnetotail in the dawn direction is reflected in the more rapid decrease\nof particle flux with distance. These differences will be discussed in the\nnext section on the magnetotail.\nDuring the inbound pass of Voyager 1, the Kronian magnetosphere was less\ndisturbed than during the Pioneer 11 and Voyager 2 encounters; therefore, our\n\n22\n\ndiscussion is based primarily on Voyager 1 data with a mention of major differences relative to the other passes. Fig. 12 shows the energetic electron\nintensities observed at different energies. Large variations are superimposed\non the general decrease of the flux with distance from Saturn. These changes\nare most probably temporal and appear at the same time at all ener g ies. They\nare thought to reflect the response of the magnetosphere to changing\ninterplanetary conditions; however, other processes may have contributed. For\ninstance, a flux minimum was found at the distance of Titan during both\ninbound and outbound passes. If the energetic particles constitute the nonMaxwellian tail of the thermal plasma, then the lower temperature in the Titan\nplume (Fig. 4) could be reflected in a lower flux of energetic particles. The\ntwo orders of magnitude flux dropout between 10 and 15 R S observed outbound\nwill be discussed in the next section. The energetic particle population was\nrelatively stable during the Pioneer it pass (Fig. 12b); but large temporal\nchanges were also observed by Voyager 2 especially during the period when the\nmagnetosphere expanded.\nThe differential energy spectra of electrons in the outer magnetosphere\nfollow a power law in energy, E -Y , with Y - 3.8 to 4 6uring the Pioneer it\npass (McDonald et al., 1980; Van Allen et al., 1980); Y was in the range from\n3.4 to 4 during the Voyager encounters (Krimigis et al., 1983). Such a\nspectrum is characteristic of magnetospheric electrons and is consistent with\na non-Maxwellian tail of a thermal plasma produced by various acceleration\nprocesses.\nDuring the Pioneer 11 encounter, the angular distributions of electrons\nabove 0.4 Me.V in the outer magnetosphere were field-aligned or "dumbbell"\n(Fig. 13) near the magnetopeuse and slowly changed towards "pancake"\n(perpendicular to the field) distributions at 10 R S (Bastian et al., 1980;\n\nI^\n\n-_^_\n^.\n\n^\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\n23\n\nFillius at al., 1980; Krimigis at al., 1981, 1982; McDonald et al., 1908(1; Van\nAllen at al., 1980). This change in the pitcto-angle distribution is\n\nillustrated in Fig. 14, where the coefficient of the cos 2e term in the\nFourier expansion is plotted versus distances (e is the angle between the look\ndirection and the projection of the field into the scan plane). Because of\nthe symmetry of particle motion around field lines, this term corresponds to a\npitch-angle distribution that is either field-aligned or perpendicular to the\nfield. The distribution is proportional to 1 + b sin2 e where b - 2A21(1-A2)\nand A2 is negative for dumbbell distributions. The behaviour of the 0.16 to\n0.43 MeV channel (Fig, 14) is markedly different from that at higher energies,\nand the angular distribution changes back and forth between pancake and\nftnibbell distributions. At yet lower energies, 37-70 keV, the pitch-anqle\ndistribution is pancake (Voyager 1) throughout the outer magnetosphere\n(Krimigis at al., 1983) and changes to dumbbell near Rhea where particles with\npitch angles near 90 0 are prererentially absorbed.\nThe energy dependent changes in the pitch-angle distribution are probably\ndue to wave-particle interactions. Waves that could be responsible for these\npitch-angle changes havn not been observed directly, but bursts of electrostatic waves near the electron plasma frequency occur throughout the outer\nmagnetosphere (Fig. 15; Kurth et al., 1982). These bursts resemble terrestrial emissions which are associated with chorus emissions, and the latter do\ncouple to - 0.1 MeV electrons.\nButterfly pitch-angle distributions (maximum flux near a - 45 and 1350)\nwere observed at least at some energies near the inner boundary of the nuter\nmagnetosphere at - 10 RS (Fig. 13; the 0.43-0.80 MeV channel at 11.6 RS\ninbound and the 0.80-1.1 MeV Channel at 9.1 R S outbound). Such distributions\ncan be produced by shell splitting (Roederer, 1967) which occurs if the\n\n-\n\n24\n\ntrapping field deviates from r dipole field and is asymmetric relative to the\nsubsolar direction. In such a field the drift shells of particles with\ng\ndifferent mirror points separate as the particles drift around the planet. As\na result one can find regions in which the particle population is deficient at\ncertain pitch an1les. Based on the asymmetry of the observed magnetic field,\nshell splitting must occur, but it has not yet been demonstrated that the\nobserved butterfly distributions are due to shell splitting rather than\nanother cause.\nProton fluxes are plotted in Fig. 16. Protons were identified above 2\nMeY by the aE - E technique (Stone et ai., 1977), but the lower Energy\nchannels include contributions from heavier ions; however, composition\nmeasurements to be discussed later indicate that the heavy ion contribution is\nsmall. Outside the oribit of Rhea and below 1 MeV, the same general trend and\ntemporel variations are present as in the electron flux. Above 2 hieV, the\nproton flux is unaffected by the presence of the magne^ipaurd and remains at\ninterplanetary values. This effect is clearly visible in the proton energy\nspectrum (Fig. 17) which consists of tws\n\ncomponents. The high energy\n\ncomponent is due to cosmic rays which gain access to the outer magnetosp.ere\n\n(Vogt et al., 1981). This component was much more intense during the Pioneer\n11 encounter when a solar cosmic ray event was in progress and the obse\nproton to alpha particles ratio was characteristic of cosmic rays (McDo\nal., 1980; Simpson et al., 1980). Because the magnetic field near the\nmagnetopause was undergoing time dependint changes, Simpson et al. (198\nsuggested direct penetration of the magnetopause by > 0.5 MeV ions and\nsubsequent trap?\', ng. McDonald et al. (1980) suggested that these part\',\ngain access through the magnetotail and then drift into the subsolar\nhemisphere without being stably trarped; such access occurs in the terr\n\nh\n\n25\n\nmagnetosphere.\nThe low energy part of the proton spectrum resembles a hot, convected\nMaxwellian distribution with a high energy tail and can be fitted by a K\n\ndistribution (Krimigis et al., 1983). Temperatures in the outer magnetosphere\nfell into the range from 16 to 21 keV during the Voyager 1 inbound pass and 35\nto 45 keV for Voyager 2; somewhat lower temperatures were observed during the\noutbound passes. The high energy tail above 0.2 MeV follows a power law\nspectrum with y - 7 (McDonald et al., 1980; Vogt et al., 1981). Near the\nequator, the diamagnetic pressure of this proton population constitutes a\nsubstantial fraction of the magnetic field pressure, and it appears that a - 1\n\nwhen the pressure due to the low energy thermal plasma is added.\nThe proton pitch-angle distributions were pancake, and during the Pioneer\n11 inbound pass, the distributions became progressively flatter from the maqnetopause to 11.5 R S but then beca..- almost isotropic at 10 R S (Bastian et\nal., 1980; McDonald et al., 1980). Superimposed on this pitch-angle\ndistribution is the Compton-Getting effect which is a first order anisotropy\ndue to the corotation of the plasma rest frame (Krimigis et al, 1981, 1982;\nCarbary et al., 1983; Thomsen et al., 1980). The magnitude of the first order\nanisotropy of the energetic particle population confirms that the plasma in\nthe outer magnetosphere co;otates nearly ridgidly with Saturn out to - 20\nRS . The changes in the pitch-angle distribution (second order anisotrophy)\nbetween the magnetopause and 11.5 RS are qualitatively consistent with the\ninward diffusion and energization of protons starting at the magnetopause. The\nsuu :za disappearance of the anisotropy near 10 R S would not be expected, and\n\xe2\x80\x94\nit is further surprising that this change in anisotropy was observed about 2\nRs closer to Saturn on the outbound pass of Pioneer 11. Again wave-particle\ninteractions are the most likely cause because absorption by a dust ring,\n\n26\n\nwhich could cause a similar change of the angular distribution, should be\nsymmetric between the noon and dawn directions.\nA small flux of energetic ions heavier than protons are also found in the\nouter magnetosphere (Hamilton et al., 1983; Krimigis et al., 1981, 1982). The\ndominant species are H2+ and alpha particles (Fig. 18); Voyager 2 observed\nalso a small flux of H3+ . The presence of molecular ions indicates an\nionospheric source which could be either the ionosphere of Titan or Saturn;\nHamilton et al. (1983) consider the latter the more likely source. Molecular\n\n.\t\n\nx\n\nions are photodissociated with a lifetime that depends on the vibrational\nstate of the molecule. The longest lifetime for H 2 + ions is - 23 days, and\nthis sets the time scale on which these ions have to be replenished. The\nspectrum of H2+ ions is very soft (Fig. 19) consistent with magnetospheric\nacceleration.\nIons from C, N, 0 through Fe are also found in the outer magnetosphere in\nthe energy range from 0.2 to 0.4 MeV/nu. The composition of these ions and\ntheir relative abundances are consistent with a solar wind source (Fig. 18).\nFrom the composition of the maynetospheric plasma, ions accelerated from a\nT\n\nlocal source should consist primarily of N + and 0+ with an almost complete\nabsence of C. The abundance relative to He at equal energy per nucleon is\nalso indicative of a solar wind source. Again the soft spectra (Fig. 19)\nindicate magnetospheric acceleration. These observations are most easily \t\n\ng\n\nexplained if the acceleration mechanism is sensitive to charge to mass\nratio. The solar wind ions are more highly stripped and have a smaller charge\nto mass ratio than the ambient magnetospheric plasma (Hamilton et al., 1983).\nVoyager 2 observed not only a much larger flux of heavy ions than Voyager\n1 but also a proton to alpha ratio that is consistent with a solar wind source\nfor the protons. In contrast, a local source for protons below - 1.5 MeV was\n\nF\n\n\t\nbo\n\n:a\n\n27\n\nobserved by both Pioneer 11 and Voyager 1 (Hamilton et al., 1983; McDonald et\nal. 1980; Simpson et al., 1980). At the Earth, solar wind plasma populates\nthe plasma sheet of the magnetotail; at Saturn the dense local plasma\npopulation could populate the plasma sheet in the near tail but probably not\nthe far tail with the boundary between the two populations moving in and out\nin response to interplanetary conditions. If the particle acceleration occurs\nprimarily in the near tail region, one would normally expect to find a large\nexcess of energetic protons and, occasionally under more disturbed conditions,\na solar wind composition as existed during the Voyager 2 encounter.\nThe phase space density of energetic electrons and protons at constant\nmagnetic moment or first adiabatic invariant is approximately independent of\nthe l value in the outer magnetosphere provided their energy falls below the\ncut-off energy (Armstrong et al., 1983; Krimigis et al., 1981; McDonald et\nal., 1980; Van Allen et al., 1980). This is consi- tent with loss-free\ns\n\ndiffusion from a source near the magnetopause or distributed sources\nthroughout the outer magnetosphere.\n\nThe Magnetotail\n\nThe outer magnetosphere in the pre-dawn direction at -90\xc2\xb0 to -120\xc2\xb0 from\nthe subsolar direction differs substantially from the subsolar outer magnetosphere; the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field (Fig. 8) and the\nenergetic particle population (Figs. 12 and 16) are distinct. Minor differences are already observable at - 6 RS , and major differences start at - 10\nRS . The asymmetry relative to sold; aspect is due to the onset of a\nmagnetotail resembling its terrestrial counterpart. The most direct evidence\nfor the magnetotail comes from Voyager 1 which passed through the tail lohe.\nThe magnetic field observations have been modeled by a cross-tail current\n\n28\n\n(Fig. 20) which is driven by the convective electric field of the solar wind\nrelative to the stationary magnetosphere (Behannon et al., 1981). This\ncurrent passes through a plasma sheet located approximately in the magnetic\nequatorial plane near the planet and, farther from the planet, in the X-Y\nplane of the solar-magnetospheric coordinate system. To simplify the model,\nthe inclination of Saturn\'s magnetic axis relative to the ecliptic has been\nignored in Fig. 20. The cross-tail current increases the radial component of\nthe field which becomes almost parallel to the Saturn-Sun line. The tail\npresumably extends to a large distance from Saturn in the down stream solar\nwind; for instance, the Jovian magnetotail was observed at - 9 AU which is - 4\nAU behind Jupiter (Scarf et al., 1981b, 1982; Lepping et al., 1982; Kurth et\nal., 1982; Desch, 1983.)\nThe radial component of the field reverses across the plasma sheet (Fig.\n20). That such a reversal does occur can be seLn by comparing the Voyager 1\ndata north of the plasma sheet with Voyager 2 observations south of it (Fig.\n21). Only Pioneer 11 was at a low enough latitude (- 4\xc2\xb0) to see direct evidence for the existence of the plasma sheet. Because Saturn\'s magnetic axis\nis closely aligned with its spin axis, the position of the magnetic equator\nand plasma sheet does not wobble in latitude as is the case at Earth and\nJupiter. Consequently, no plasma sheet crossings could be seen inside of 25\nR S ; however, near the magnetopause the solar wind can move the plasma sheet\nposition to some extent and the sheet crossed Pioneer 11 several times as\nexemplified in Fig. 22.\nBased on Voyager 1 data, the magnetotail diameter is - 40 R S at 25 RS\nbehind Saturn with a typical field of 3 nT. By matching the total magnetic\nflux content in the tail with that in the polar cap, one finds the boundary of\nthe polar cap in the ionosphere between 75 0 and 78.5\xc2\xb0 (Ness et al., 1981).\n\n29\n\nBased on similar arguments, Smith et al. (1980) placed this boundary at - 77\xc2\xb0.\nOp tical observations place the southern auroral zone between 78\xc2\xb0 and 81.5\xc2\xb0\n(Sandel and Broadfoot, 1981).\nVoyager 2 observed a stable tail field (Fig. 21) during the entire\noutbound pass; the field varied in a smooth fashion in both magnitude and\ndirection. The Voyager 1 data, in contrast, indicated that the tail\nconfiguration changed noticeably during the outbound pass of that spacecraft\n(Behannon et al., 1981). The data in Fig. 21 suggest that the magnetopause\nmay first have moved outward when Voyager 1 was at - 13 R S . This caused a\nweakening of the tail field and a rotation towards the radial direction.\nSeveral hours later, in response to a compression, the field direction swung\nback to being nearly parallel to the model magnetospause surface (dashed curve\nin Fig. 21), and the field strength increased again. The greater average\nstrength of the tail field is evident in the greater length of the Voyager 1\nfield vectors as compared to the Voyager 2 values (Fig. 21) even though\n:^yager 1 was at a greater distance down the tail.\nThere were no local simultaneous solar wind and interplanetary magnetic\nfield observations; however, projections of the Voyager 2 interplanetary\nobservations indicate that a temporary change in interplanetary field polarity\nand solar wind ram pressure may have occurred coincident with the changes\nobserved while Voyager 1 was in the magnetotail (J.O. Sullivan and H.S.\nBridge, private communications ; see Fig. 4 in Behannon et al., 1981). The\ninterplanetary observations had to be projected over a distance of - 1.7 AU,\nbut the good correspondence between variations seen by both spacecraft preand post-encounter increases our confidence in the validity of the\nprocedure. A two order of magnitude decrease in the energetic particle flux\naccompanied this perturbation as if the field lines through the spacecraft\n\n4\n\n30\n\nwere suddenly connected to interplanetary field lines. (This is the dip at\n10-15 RS outbound, Figs. 12 and 16.) Simultaneously the thermal electron\ndensity (eV energy range) dropped to very low values and the electron temperature increased markedly. These observations demonstrate the large influence\nof interplanetary conditions on the magnetotail and probably also on the\nsubsolar outer magnetosphere through coupling with the magnetotail.\nAdjacent to the tail magnetopause Voyager 1 observed magnetic field and\nplasma behavior characteristic of "boundary layer" or "mantel" plasma flowing\ntailward (Behannon et al. 1983). A similarly directed flow is not evident in\nVoyager 2 outbound observations, possibly because of the very low pressure\nexternal to the magnetosphere when the observations were made.\nA substantial population of 20-100 keV electrons and ions exist in the\ntail lobe at 20 0 -300 latitude (Figs. 12a and 16a); however, without data near\n\nthe plasma sheet it is not known how their flux changes with latitude\n(Krimigis et al., 1981, 1982). The first order anisotropy of the ions\nreflects full or partial corotation Superimposed on the solar wind convective\nelectric field which drives the cross-tail current (Fig 23). The corotation\nvelocity starts to fall below rigid corotation at L - 27 (Carbary et al.,\n1983). The anisotropy also has a field-aligned component which results from a\nnet flow of energetic electrons and ions from the equator towards the\nionosphere. As in the subsolar magnetosphere, electron pitch-angle\ndistributions are field aligned. Fluxes of more energetic electrons and\nprotons up to about 0.5 MeV are also found out to the magnetopause (Figs. 12\nand 16b). These fluxes are subject to large temporal fluctuations. The\nelectron flux disappears above 0.5 MeV. The ion flux above 0.5 MeV is due to\ncosmic rays that enter the magnetosphere (McDonald et al., 1984; Simpson et\nal., 1980; Vogt et al., 1981).\n\n31\n\nJust like the terrestrial and Jovian magnetotails, Saturn\'s tail is the\nsite of particle acceleration. Below 100 keV, this results in a flow of particles towards the planet (Krimigis et al., 1981, 1982). At energies of - 0.4\nMeV, ions were seen streaming away from Saturn by Voyager 1 between 35 and 45\nRS (Fig. 24a). Rather unusual bursts of electrons (Fig. 24b) accelerated to\nabove 1 MeV were observed by Voyager\n\n2\n\nbetween 18 R S and the magnetopause at\n\n- 50 RS (Vogt et al., 1982). For each burst the acceleration lasted about 5\n\nmin. with all energies (0.15 to > 1 MeV) peaking simultaneously and an energy\ndependent exponential decay with T - 11 min. for 1-2 MeV electrons and - 19\n\nmin. at - 0.4 MeV. Numerous acceleration mechanisms have been proposed to\naccount for the observations in the Earth\'s tail, but the data at Saturn are\nstill too fragmentary to identify specific mechanisms responsible for the\nobservations.\nThe planetary field was found to be axisymmetic (see chapter on Magnetic\nField Models), but the particle data indicate that an asymmetry may yet exist\nin the polar region. This is based on the apparent modulation of the < 0.5\nMeV electron and ion spectra with approximately Saturn\'s period (rarbary and\nKrimigis, 1982). During the Voyager 2 outbound pass between 20 and 50 RS\nabout three modulation cycles were observed (Fig. 25) in the ratio of two\nelectron channels [(22-35)/(183-500) keV], 10h 21m \xc2\xb1 59m period, and of two\nion channels [(43-80)/(137-215) keV], 9h 49m \xc2\xb1 59m period. One cycle of\nmodulation was observed by Voyager 1 in the same SLS longitude range of 090\xc2\xb0. For a definition of the Saturn Longitude System MS) see Desch and\nKaiser (1981).\n\nSummary and Discussion\n\nSaturn\'s outer magnetosphere looks superficially very much like the\n\n32\n\nEarth\'s. Both have a bow shock, magnetopause and magnetotail (Fig. 26), and\nsubstantial fluxes of energetic electrons and protons exist with soft spectra\nand large temporal variability. Acceleration of particles in the magnetotail\nis another common feature, and particle diffusion toward the planet with\nconservation of the first and second adiabatic invariants leads on the average\nto an increase in the particle flux above a fixed threshold energy. The size\nof both magnetospheres is controlled apparently by the pressure balance\nbetween the planetary magnetic field and dynamic ram pressure of the solar\nwind.\nThe most obvious differences between the two magnetospheres is the\npresence of thermal plasma out to the magnetopause at Saturn; in contrast,\nplasma is convected out of the terrestrial magnetosphere for L > 6.5. It\nappears that the B in the outer magnetosphere is - 1; this implies the\npossibility of plasma instabilities which may affect many properties of the\nouter magnetosphere. Specific instabilities have not been identified, but\nmany as yet unexplained phenomena may or may not have such a cause. Among\nthese are the energy dependent changes in the electron pitch-angle\ndistribution (Fig. 14) and the almost regular changes in electron density and\ntemperature observed between 10 and 15 R S (Fig. 4). Plasma properties depend\non solar aspect, which is consistent with the lack of symmetry of these\nphenomena between inbound and outbound passes.\nCoincident minima in electron and ion densities were observed in the\nsubsolar direction at the same dipole L values of 14 to 15 by Pioneer it and\nVoyagers 1,2 and at - 19 by both Voyagers (Lazarus et al., 1983); coincident\ndecreases occurred also in the energetic particle population. Because of the\n\nk\n\nlarge ring current, the dipole L value is only an approximate measure of the\nfield-line distance at the equator, still the coincidence is surprising.\ni\n\nstructure to explain the observations, but the lack of symmetry between\ninbound and outbound passes presents problems for this proposal. Other\nexplanations are based on the escape of plasma bubbles, on occasional\npenetration of solar wind convection into the magnetosphere, or on the\nexistence of a magnetospheric anomaly at a fixed Kronian longitude.\nThe frequent and large changes in the energetic particle fluxes (Figs. 12\nand 16) have not been explained in detail. One possibility is that the shock\nwhich develops at boundaries between slow and fast solar streams disrupts the\nmagnetosphere substantially more than the smoother transition observed at\nEarth. This change in the character of the solar wind and how it affects a\nmagnetosphere deserves further study.\nIt appears that the magnetospheres of Earth, Jupiter, and Saturn have the\nsame ratio between the energy content E B of the planetary magnetic field and\nthe energy content E of the particles trapped in the field (Connerney et al.,\n\n1983). In each case the ratio between the quiet time ring-current field AB at\nthe equator and the equatorial planetary field B is n6/B - 112000. Accordinq\nto the Dessler-Parker relation (Carovillano and Siscoe,\n\n1973 and references\n\ntherin):\nE/EB - 1.5 e6/B(4)\nThe total energy content between the three magnetospheres varies by orders of\nmagnitude and the energy sources driving the magnetosphere are quite different.\nStill the energy in the plasma and energetic particles builds up to only about\n1/1000 of the field energy in each of the magnetospheres. It would appear that one\nor another plasma instability is triggered at that point to prevent further build\nup.\n\n6^ T\n\n34\n\nIn summary, the three traversals of Saturn\'s magn pLosphere have provided a qood\noverall description, and as the analysis progresses, we will be able to fill in\nfurther details. However, our picture is bound to remain incomplete until lon q term\nobservations are performed with a Saturn orbiter. In contrast to Jupiter, the solar\nwind appears to be the dominant energy sources and we need, therefore, observations\nof the magnetospheric response to various solar wind conditions.\nAcknowledgements: The authors are greatly indebted to many scientists studying\nthe magnetosphere of Saturn for helpful discussions, for prepublication copies of\ntheir work, and for permission to reproduce their illustrations.

This\nrepresentation gives the spacecraft position in the plane through the\nspacecraft and the Saturn-Sun line (X axis) with the distance from\nthat line plotted to the left for Voyager 1 and to the right for\nVoyager 2. For Voyager 1, the model bow shock and magnetopause\nboundaries are given and Pioneer 11 followed a very similar\ntrajectory; for Voyager 2, observed average inbound and outbound\nshock location plus model magnetopause shapes are shown (Ness et al.,\n1982). The outbound "early" positions are based on the average of\nthe first 5 outbound crossings; the outbound "last" curve is based on\nthe last crossing (Bridge et al., 1982) and preserves the earlier\nshape of the magnetopause (courtesy of Behannon et al., 1983).\nFig-2\t\n\nThe magnetic field (9.6s averages) observed while Voyager 1 traversed\nthe bow shock, magnetosheath and entered the magnetosphere of\nSaturn.\t\nNotice the absence of a systematic change in the field\ndirection (a and d) at the bow shock and the major change in\n\ndirection that occurred at the magnetopause. The semi-periodic\nchanges in, the field intensity in the magnetosheath are\nanticorrelated with the electron density. The angles a and d are\n\nexpressed in a heiipraphic, spacecraft-centered coordinate system,\nsuch that a = tan -\n\nB T /B R and d = sin -1 B/B. The Vector R is\n\nradially away from the Sun; T is parallel to toe the Sun\'s equatorial\nplane, normal to R and positive in the direction of Saturn\'s orbital\nmotion; and R = R x T is within 2\xc2\xb0 of being normal to the ecliptic\n\nplane. The day numbers in the trajectory insert refer to spacecraft\npositions at the start of the referenced day (courtesy of Lepping et\nal., 1981a).\nFig.3\t\n\nSketch of magnetopause surface wave observed during the inbound pass\nof Voyager 1. The X M p axis is aligned with the unperturbed\nmagnetopause, and the Voyager 1 trajectory is shown relative to the\n"tailward" moving wave. D 3 , D 4 , and D5 refer to the 3rd, 4th, and\n5th magnetopause crossing and the change in the width of the line\nindicates variability of the estimated magnetopause thickness\n(courtesy of Lepping et al., 1981a).\n\nFig.4 Electron densities and temperatures observed during the inbound pass\nof Voyager 1. The high density and low temperature regions numbered\n1 to 4 have been attributed to a plasma plume from Titan, with number\n1 corresponding to the most recent interaction and number 4 to an\ninteraction which occurred 3 Saturn periods earlier. The low density\nregion between L = 18 and 19 corresponded to an almost complete\ndisappearance of the thermal plasma (adopted from Sittier et al.,\n1983).\n\n40\n\nFig-5 Models of the electron density in Satur\'s magnetosphere inferred\nfrom Voyagers 1, 2 (Bridge et al., 1082) compared with the ion\ndensities derived from Pioneer 11 plasma ion data (Frank et al.,\n1980). Also shown is the ion density cupputed from the ring current\nThe\nmodel of Saturn\'s magnetic field (Co^.nerney et al., 1983). \t\nlocations of the orbits of Enceladus, Thethys, Dione, and Rhea are\n\nindicated by arrows labeled E, T, D and R (courtesy of Connerney et\nal., 1983)\n\nFig.6\t\n\nA nigh resolution spectrum of positive ions obtained by the thermal\nplasma cup on Voyager 1 during the ir\xc2\xb1bo nd pass at L - 15. AlthouV\nthe heavy ion peak has been fitted with a curve corresponding to 0 ,\nanequally acceptable fit is obtained for N + (courtesy of Bridge et\nal., 1981).\n\nFig.1 Relative plasma distribution functions between 14 and 18 R S observed\nduring the inbound passes of Voya;e \xe2\x80\xa2s 1 and 2 at Kronian latitudes of\n- 2\xc2\xb0 and + 18% respectively. The distribution functions were derived\nfrom low resolution mode spect,,. of the side-looking plasma cup (D\nsensor). Peaks appearing at a ,cw energy per charge (10-100 volts)\nare attributed to H + and tho 2 \'t high values (> 800 volts) are\nattributed to N+ . Note the high temperature of the H+ ions at the\nlatitude of Voyager 2 (18 0 ) and the near absence of N + ions ( courtesy\nof Bridge et al., 1982).\nFig.8\t\n\nComparison of the magnetic field strength observed by Voyager 1 with\npure dipole and dipole plus ring current models. The Voyager 1\ntrajectory, illustrated below the observations, shows the distance\nfrom the equatorial plane. Note the different scale used for the\nvertical spacecraft position ( courtesy of Connerney et al., 1981).\n\nFig.9\t\n\nProjection of the Voyagers 1 and 2 hourly average magnetic field\nvectors into the noon-midnight meridian plane ( X-Z plane in solar-\n\nmagnetospheric coordinates, see Ness, 1965). Intersection of the\nplane with a cylindrically symmetric magnetopause are also shown.\nDuring the Voyager 1 inbound pass, the magnetosphere was initially\n\nmore compressed and then more dynamic when the spacecraft was between\n10 and 15 R S (courtesy of Behannon et al., 1983).\n\nFi g.10 The top panel displays the proton energy density a\t\n\ncomputed for\n\nprotons with energies above 40 kev as a function of radial\ndistance. Any heavy ion admixture would increase the energy\n\ndensity. The middle panel shows the magnetic-field energy density\n\n^, based on in-situ observations (Ness et al., 1981) . The bottom\npanel 1hows B also under the assumption that the ions were 0+ rather\nthan H . Data from the inbound pass are shown with a solid line and\noutbound data with a dotted line (courtesy of Krimigis et al., 1983).\nFig.11 Differential energy spectra for ions ( upper panel) and electrons\n(lower panel) observed by Voyager 2. The last inbound bow shock and\nmagnetopause crossings are indicted by BS and MP, respectively.\n\nBecause of the high radiation background, spectra are not shown near\nclosest approach ( courtesy of Krimigis et al., 1982).\t\n\n\'`\n\n\t\n\n41\n\nFi9.12 Energetic electron intensities observed during the Voyager 1 pass.\nThe upper panel shows 15m averages observed with the LECP experiment\n(courtesy of Krimigis, 1983).

Curves 3 and 5 give Pioneer 11 rates for energies >\n0.25 MeV and 2.0 MeV, respectively, normalized to the geometric\nfactor of the Voyger instrument. The magnetopause crossings are\nindicated by MP with a circle around the MP for the Pioneer crossing\n(courtesy of Vogt et al., 1981).\nFig.13 Polar histograms of sectored electron counting rates (432-minute\naverage) observed with Pioneer 11. The dashed circle gives the spin\naverage rate. The dashed arrow shows the projection of the magnetic\nfield ?nto the scan plane, and the dashed line gives the direction of\nthe second order anisotropy (courtesy of McDonald et al., 1980).\nFig.14 Thirty-two minute averages of second-order anisotropies of electrons\nin three energy intervals as observed with Pioneer 11.

Pancake (perpendicular to the field)\ndistributions resul from A 2 > 0 and dumbbell (field-aliqned)\ndistributions from A2 < 0. Ao corrections have been made for the\ninclination of the magnetic field relative to the scan plane. The\npositions of Saturn\'s satellites are indicated by arrows (courtesy of\nMcDonald et al., 1980).\nFig.15 A 1.8-second average frequency spectrum of wide-band data observed by\nVoyager 1 inbound at L = 15.6 and a latitude of -2.3\xc2\xb0. This emission\nis spread over a substantial frequency range and is therefore not due\nto the usual narrowband Langmuir waves (courtesy of Kurth et al.,\n1983).\nFig.16\t\n\nEnergetic ion intensities observed by Voyager 1. The ions consist\nprimarily of protons; the two highest, energy rates in the lower panel\nresponded only to protons. The upper panel shows 15m ave ages\nobserved with the LECP experiment (courtesy of Krimigis, 1983) and\nthe lower panel shows 1h average fluxes observed with the CRS\nexperiment.\n\nFig.17 Typical differential proton spectra in the outer magnetos phere and\nmagnetotail observed by Voyager 1. The indicated dipole L values\ncorrespond to the position at the middle of the 1 hour averaging\ninterval. The open circles represent LECP data and the crosses CRS\ndata.\nFi9.18 Mass histograms of light and heavier ion species in the subsolar\nouter magnetosphere. The histograms were derived from 2-dimensional\npulse-height matrices accumulated over 10h periods by Voyagers 1 and\n2. Note the nearly equal abundance of H 2 molecules and He ions. The\nflux of medium weight nuclei was much higher during the Voyager 2\nflyby. A histogram of energetic solar ions is shown for comparison\nby a dashed line in panel\n\nW.\n\nThe relative lack of nitrogen\n\nsuggests solar wind origin rather than the plasma torus in the outer\nmagnetosphere (courtesy of Hamilton et al., 1983).\n\n\t\n\n42\n\nFig.19 Energy spectra of the most abundant ion species averaged over the\nsame 10h period as Fig. 18. A single power law in energy fits the H,\nHe, and Voyager 1 C + N + 0 data. The H 2 spectrum ( open circles) and\nVoyager 2 C + N + 0 spectrum (triangles) requires 2 components with a\ncutoff above 0.4 MeV which falls at least as fast as E - . The H3\n\nions were observed over such a narrow energy range that no spectrum\n\ncould be derived. Interplanetary intensities and spectra of H, He,\nand C + N + 0 observed just prior to encounter are shown with dashed\nlines (courtesy of Hamilton et al., 1983).\nFig.20 Model of Saturn\'s magnetic field in the noon-midnight meridian plane\n(solar magnetospheric coordinates). The model is based on a centered\ndipole planetary field, an azimuthal ring current between 8-16 R\n(stippled) and a cross-tail current extending from 16 to 100 R S whic9\ncloses on the magnetopause boundary. Field lines are drawn every 2\xc2\xb0\nof invariant latitude, and the projections of the observed magnetic\nfield vectors (Voyager 1 outbound) are shown. The insert illustrates\n\nthe cross-tail current in the solar magnetospheric X-Y plane\n(courtesy of Behannon et al., 1981).\nFig.21 Magnetic fields measured in Saturn \' s magnetotail and predawn\nmagnetosphere by Voyagers 1 and 2 are shown in the plane through the\nspacecraft and the Saturn-Sun line (X axis). Hourly averaged field\n\nvectors have been rotated about the X axis into this plane and their\nlength represents the field strength, scaled logarithmically.\nGreater temporal variations were observed during the Voyager 1\noutbound pass than during the Voyager 2 pass. Because of the\nexpanded magnetosphere during the Voyager 2 outbound pass, it\n\nobserved significantly smaller field magnitudes than Voyager 1 even\nthough the latter was at a greater distance down the tail (courtesy\n\nof Behannon et al, 1983).\nFig.22 Multiple current sheet crossings observed by Pioneer 11 just after\nentering the magnetosphere for the second time, when the magnetopause\nmoved past the spacecraft near dawn. The data are presented in a\nprincipal axis (PA) system determined by minimum variance analysis\n(Sonnerup and Cahill, 1967), which minimizes variation in the angle\ntheta. Current sheet crossing were accompanied by a decrease in the\n\nfield magnitude B (courtesy of Smith et al., 1980).\nFig.23\t\n\nFifteen-minute averages of fluxes and anisotrophy parameters of 4380 kev ions from the out bound pass of Voyager 2. The parameters are\nform\nfit\t\nof\t\nthe\t\na\t\nderived\t\nfrom\t\na 0 [1+a cos(a-a l ) + a cos2(a-a )]. The angles and a2 are\nmeasured ^elative to We projecti on of the corotation d1recton into\nthe scan plane. The standard deviation of the fit to the data is\nis a measure of the\ngiven by\t\nQ and the ratio\t\nQ/\t\n. The results should be discounted when this ratio\nsignificance of a 1\napproaches 1. The plus symbols indicate the expected anisotropy\npar^.:.eters from rigid corotation for a convected K distribution.\n"MP" denotes magnetopause position while "M" indicates spacecraft\nmaneuvers. The dipole L-shell position is given on top of the figure\n(courtesy of Carbary et al.. 1983)\n\nj=\n\nt\t\n\n`\t\n\n*A.\n\n43\n\nFig.24\t\n\nThe top panel shows tailward-streaming bursts of > 0.43 MPV\nprotons. These were observed by Voyager 1 primarily near the\nmagnetopause between 35 and 45 R S (courtesy of Vogt et al., 1981).\nThe lower panel shows electron counting rates in the dawn side outer\nmagnetosphere observed with Voyager 2 at a latitude of -29\xc2\xb0. Curve A\ndisplays the rate of 0.14-0.4 MeV electrons (x 10); curve B, the rate\nof > 0.35 MeV electrons, curve C, the rate of > 0.6 MeV electrons;\nand curve D, the rate of 1-2 MeV electrons (x 0.1). Typically, the\nelectron fluxes increased by about an order of magnitude with a rise\ntime of T - 5 min. The decay time was energy dependent with T - 11\n\nmin. above 1 MeV and - 20 min. at - 0.4 MeV (courtesy of Vogt et al.,\n1982).\nFi g.25 Ratios of counting rates (15 minute average) in two energy channels\nfor electrons and ions. The dipole L shells of Rhea and Titan are\nshown as dotted lines, and the tick marks identify the minima used to\ndetermine the period. Times when the spacecraft was at an SLS\nlongitude of 0\xc2\xb0 are indicated at the top of the figure (courtesy of\nCarbary and Krimigis, 1982).\nFig.26 Schematic of the global structure of Saturn\'s magnetosphere. Bow\nshock and magnetopause positions are "typical". A two component H + N + plasma fills the subsolar outer magnetosphere, with the heavier\nEnergetic proton pitch-anqle\nion concentrated near the equator. \t\ndistributions are pancake and electron distributions primarily\ndumbbell. An equatorial ring current extends into the outer\nmagnetophere and is continued by a plasma sheet in the magnetotail.\nProton and electron acceleration occurs in the magnetotail.\nStreaming of low energy electrons and protons towards Saturn was\nobserved in the tail lobes as well as streaming away from Saturn at\nhigher proton energies. Major solar wind induced changes have been\nobserved in the magnetic field properties, plasma densities and\nenergetic particle fluxes.\n\n\t\n\n\xe2\x96\xba ^^ \xc2\xb0^r^:\t\n\n^\t\n\nterra\n\nOR10M1AL PAGE 19\nOF P OOR QUALITY\n\nRS\n\nn IN\nVOYAGER\n\n5\t\n\n2ti_-.--i\n\nVOYAGER o\nI\t\nRINGS\t\n\nPIONEER II\n\ni\n15\t\n\nIG\t\n\nM E Ji\n\n20\n\n^D R\t\n\n\xe2\x80\x94T\n\nT\n\nSATURN\n\nPIONEER I!\t\n5 --- VOYAGER I\n\nAVERAGE\nSUNWARD\nMAGNETOPAUS^\n\nVOYAGER 2\t\n\n.\n\nFigure la\n\nVOYAGERS AT SATURN\nTO SUN\nX\nV2\n\nP .\t\n\ny2., Z2\n\nVl\n\n40\t\n\nAVE BS\n236\'- (IN)\n\n20\t\n\nn(In^`^\n\n--\t\n\ni\n/20\t\n\nPV 11\n\n238\n\t\n\n\\\\\n\nn(OUt)\nIn\n\t\n\n(RS)\n\n0\n\nIs\n\n\tp\n\t\n\n\\\\\t\n\nV1,\n\n/ VI,MP\t\n\n242\n\n\\\\ \\ AVE 65\n(OUT)\n\n\\ V2,MP^\t\n\nV2,MP\\\\(out \\\\l\nost \\^\n\\early \\ _/^\n(in 1\t\n\n(RS)\t\n\nFigure lb\n\nI\n\n\\240 \\\t\n\\\t\n\\\\\t\n\n0-6 PIONEER 11\nNEAREST MAGNETOSMEATN\n\n1\t\n\nORIGMAL PAGE 19\n\nOF POOR QUAL"\n\nrl 1\nMP\t\n\n(1)\t\n\n(2)\t\n\nI\t\n\nII\n\n^\t\n\n^w\n\n(3)\t\n\nI\t\n\nBS\t\n\n+il\t\n\n(41(5)\n\nI\t\n\nI\t I\n\nK\nro\t\n\ng\nB pyyyy\t\nK\t\n\nS(IV\n\n^^^ Sr9\t\n\nvl"\t\n\n!IB\t\n\nB\n\nW)\n\n^\t\n\nMAGNETOSPHERE\t\n\n/^ I\n\n_\t\n\nI\n\n^^\t\n\n31r\n\nI\n\n0\n\n360\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n71 180\'\n*I\n\n1\t\n\n0\xe2\x80\xa2\n90\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n8\t\n\nI\nit\n\n0\xe2\x80\xa2\n-90\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nRMS 1\xe2\x80\xa2S\nW) 0\n\n2300 UT\t\nDAY 316, 1980\t\n\n0000\t\nIDAY 317\n\nG100\t\n\n0200\t\n\n6300\n\nFigure 2\n\nSURFACE WANE FOR III (1970)\nYMP\n\nMAGNETOSHEATH\n\n10\n\nEL AT\n\nD3\n\nFR\nSPACEC\t RAFT I\nMOT I OPI \t\n\n05\n\n0.0\nF-\n\nTAI LWARD\n\n05\n\nxMP\n\n-0 5\n-10\n\n0 4\t\n\n197\xc2\xb0(X0)\n\nL\n\n0.0\t\n\nTO SATURN\nI\t\n\nI\t\n\n1.0\t\n\nI\t\n\nI\t\n\n2.0\t\n\nFigure 3\n\nI\t\n\nI\n\n3.0\t\n\n4.0 RS\n\n\t^\n\na\t\n\nIt\n\nOF jPOOR QUALITY\n\nI\n\n,\n\ni\n\n10\nl\n\nVOYAGER I INBOUND\n\n1-\n\nI\n\n-rte\t\n\nTITAN\n\n10\'\n\n1\n\nMP\t\n\nn\n\n\'lr\n\nI\t\n4\t\n\nid\n\nE\n\n1\n\nZ 10^\n\n^\t\n\ni\t\n\n1\n\nI 1^\n\nI\t I \t\n\nI\t\n\n102\n\nI\t\n\nI\n\nI^^\t\n\nI\n\n^\t\n\nI\n\nI\t\n\nI\t\n\nI\n\nI\t\n\n103\n\ncu\n\nd 102\n\n10\'\n\nL\n\n25\n\n20\t\n\n15\n\n\t\n10\n\n01POLE L SHELL\n\nF 1 g ure 4\n\ni\n\nI\n\nr\n\nt\n\nC3R,Ofh\'A\xc2\xb1 PAGE IS\nOF POOR QUAUTy\n0\nr\n\nIC\n\nM.\nFRANK ET AL.
