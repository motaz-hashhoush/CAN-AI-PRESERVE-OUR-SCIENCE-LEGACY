The NMC is comprised of three operational\ndivisions (Development, Automation, and Forecast) and an Administrative\nDivision as illustrated in Figure 1.\n-\n\nThe names of the three operational divisions within the NMC\ndescribe their job functions fairly well. \t\n\nThe Development Division\n\ndevelops and implements mathematical models for forecasting the weather.\n--The-Automation Division provides the software and processing services\nhil\n\nto accommodate the models used in daily forecasts.\t\n\nThe Forecasting\n\nDivision applies a combination of numerical and manual techr.iques to\nALI\n\nproduce analyses and prognoses up to 120 nr into the future, emphasizing\nthe period 2 to 72 hr. \t\n\nThis guidance material is combined with severe\n\n^r-\n\nstorm information from the National Hurricane Center (NHC) and the\nj\t\n\nkJ\n\nNational Severe Storms Forecasting Center (NSSFC) to develop locally\ntailored forecasts by the Weather Service Forecast Offices \t (WSFOs) and,\nUri\n\nin turn, by the local Weather Service Offices (WSOs).\t\n\n74,\n\na very general flow of this information. \t\n\niwn\n\nof data flow into, within, and from the NMC is given in Figure 3.\n\nFigure 2 shows\n\nA more detailed illustration\n\nFigure 4 depicts the interrelations between the various meteorological\nw\n\norganizations and activities, of which the NMC is more or less the focal\npoint, especially for non-DoD weather activities.\nThe operations of NMC will be modified somewhat when the NWS\nAutomated Field Operations and Services (AFOS) System becomes operational.\n\nL\'>\n.\n\nin 1981.\t\n\nNMC will be the entry point for all basic national analysis,\n\nprognostic, and guidance products. \t\n\nIt will also be the exchange point\n\nfor most international data and, during the early stages of implementa^.\ntion, for the exchange of data and ptoducts between AFOS and the parts\n\nOR\t\n^\'\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n"I\'\n\niii\t\n\nPooR\n\n01)R\n\nIZ\n\n\t\n\nDEPARTMENT\nOF C0191ERCE\n\nNATIONAL OCEANIC\nAND ATMOSPHERIC\nADMINISTRATION\n\nNAT\n\nI "AL\n\nI\t\n\nMANAGEMENT\t\n\nOFF\t\nMETEOROLOGICAL\nOPERATIONS\n\n\t\n\nI\n\nI\t\n\nI\t\n\nHYDROLOGY \t\n\nI\t\n\nTECHNIQUES\nBRANCH\t\n\nI\t\n\nDIVISIONING\n\nI\t\n\nDIVISIONENT\n\nI\t\n\nI\t\n\nDATA R SERVICE L\n\nI\n\n\t\n\nPROGRAMMING\t\nBRANCH\t\n\nI\t\n\nMET O R\n\nI\t\n\nI\t\n\nI\t\n\nSATELLITENTAL\n\nI\n\nI\t\n\nI\t\n\nI\t\n\nSERVICE\n\nI\t\n\nI\t\n\nDIVISION N\t\n\nI\t\n\nI SUPPORTTRAiIYE\n\nOPERATIONS\t\nBRANCH\n\nI\t\n\nI\n\nOLOGICAL\n\nRT\nSIERVICES\n\nELECTRONICS\n\nCIANS\nTEC HNI\n\nFIGURE 1.

Other models are the Hemispheric Fine-Mesh Model (HFM), the\nNested Grid Model (NGM), and the Nine-Layer Global Prediction Model.\nSince 1966, the PE model has been the principal NMC operational\nmodel. The LFM model has been used to improve the output provided by\nthe PE since 1971. The LFM provided forecasts to 24 hr until early\n1976, when the program was expanded to run to 48 hr. The forecasting\ncommunity in the United States now receives forecasts out to 48 hr from\nthe PE and regional LFM models twice each day, based on analyses made\nfrom 0000 and 1200 GMT surface observations. The PE model is also run\nout to 84 hr, once per day, from the 0000 GMT observations.\nThe PE and LFM models are numerical prediction models that provide the state of the atmosphere. Objective forecasts of local weather\nare obtained using model output statistic techniques to complement\n\nthese\n\nnumerical prediction models. Using this technique, local observations\nof weather parameters are matched with output parameters from numerical\nmodels for a period of a year or more. Statistical techniques then are\n\nviii\n\nused to derive forecast equations that can account for biases and\ninaccuracies in the numerical model and for local climatology. MOS\npredictions giving probability of precipitation, conditional probability\nof frozen precipitation, minimum and maximum surface temperatures, surface wind direction and speed, ceiling, and visibility are transmitted\ntwice daily over nationwide facsimile and teletypewriter. During the\nwarm season, MOS forecasts of the probability of thunderstorms and the\nconditional probability of severe local storms are made available to\nforecasters in both digital and map form once per day.\nThe use of wind and temperature predictions from NMC\'s PE model\nhas become routine among domestic and foreign airlines for flight planning. Direct output of forecast parameters at cities in this country\n(e.g., boundary-layer winds, layer humidities, vertical velocity, and\nlifted index) from the LFM in bulletin form are available twice each\nday via request-reply from the Federal Aviation Administration\'s\nWeather Message Switching Center in Kansas City, Missouri. These parameters are also very useful to the forecaster in the prediction of precipitation. The MOS technique has been applied to forecasts of many\nweather elements including temperature, precipitation, winds, and\nthunderstorms and is now an important part of the daily operational\nproducts transmitted via fasimile and teletypewriter by NMC.\nIt is difficult to specify progress in the state of the art in\nnumerical forecasting of rainfall occurrence and quantity, thunderstorms, clouds, visibility, and ceiling since most numerical forecasts\nof these weather elements have become available only within the last\n2 or 3 years. Useful forecasts of minimum and maximum temperatures at\nindividual cities, however, have been available to forecasters from\nNMC\'s computer facility for several years. During the period between\n1968 and 1975, a steady increase in forecasting skill can be attributed\nto several factors, including rederivation of the equations with a\nlayer data base, increased skill of the PE model to make the foralasts,\nand introduction of the MOS technique in 1973.\n\nix\n\nTemperature is, according to most weather forecasters, one of\nthe easiest weather elements to predict; precipitation is one of the most\ndifficult. Numerical forecasts of precipitation have been the least useful of all the output from numerical models. According to Fawcett*, personal skill and previous experience in interpretation of numerical guidance are needed by forecasters when making precipitation forecasts.\nAnother factor that shows as a seasonal improvement in forecasting is\nthat it is easier to predict occurrence and distribut:jn of precipitation\nin winter storms than for summer thunderstorms.\n\n*E.

The\nHFM is basically the same as the 6LP except it uses a half-mesh size.\nIt should be noted that going to this model is expected to increase the\nworkload by a factor of 5. The NWS staff is confident that this added\nprocessing load can be accomplished using existing hardware. However,\nthis added processing also can push the existing configuration to the\nbrink of its capabilities and any addirional effort will likely require\nincreases in the processing capabilities of the facility. Internal\nstudies have been performed to evaluate the tradeoffs associated with\nreplacing the existing configuration with a CRAY-1 versus adding a\nfourth IBM 360/195. A decision has not beer made, but the indications\nare that a fourth IBM 360/195 is the probable conclusion that will be\nreached. Another area under investigation is the possibility of replacing the IBM 360/40\'s with an IBM-compatible CDC machine. Again, this\ndecision is still pending.\n\nORIGINAL PAGE 1S\nOF POOR QUALITY\n\n7-7\n\ni\n^u\n8. DATA BASE SYSTEM ELEMENTS\n\n1 1A data base is maintained of 1,600 North American hourly reporting stations, which are primarily FAA and NWS stations. These data are\nused by the models and are also accessible by the KCRT and River Forecast\n\nr\n\nCenter users via RJE. (Twelve of the 57 Sanders 720 CRTs (2,400 baud,\nfull duplex) are connected to the central facility located in Suitland,\nMaryland.)\nSequential partitioned data sets are used to save observational\ndata. A file directory is maintained in which the file name consists\nof the time of data reception and pointers to the actual data. A data\nset is maintained so that the user may request hourly, latest, or\nprevious data.\nThe data base handlers use ISAM techniques (random access with\nindex table) basically using their own software. The operating system\nhas also been tailored to fit these requirements.\nAll observational data are maintained for 7 days, and selected\narchival data sets are kept on offline disk packs for verification and\ncomposite preparation. Data are then put into microfiche and hardcopy\nform and sent to the National Climatic Center in Asheville, North\nCarolina, for archival.\n\n8-1\n\ne\n\nE\n\n9. DATA DISTRIBUTION ELEMENTS\n\n,, Cd\nCommunications are handled by an IBM 360/30 and two IBM 360/40\ncomputers. The IBM 360/30 is interfaced to two INTERDATA 50 computers\nby a 50-kbit line. This portion of the system generates all facsimile\n\nF\n\noutput products. A front-end Systems Engineering Labs (SEL) minicomputer, which is connected to one of the 360/40 1 x, handles point-topoint communications for the 360/40 systems. This collection and dissemination of meteorological information is accomplished via 1.\'our 2,400baud FDX, 43 medium- and low-speed domestic circuits, and three 2,400baud FDX and 21 low-speed international circuits.\nA message switching directory is maintained on disk and is\nreferenced each time a message is received from polling a station in\nthe communications system. Approximately 8,000 uniquely identifiable\nmessage descriptors are contained in this directory.\nAll observational data received are sent to the 360/195 processors for use in forecast and analysis. The path of this data is from\nthe communication system via common disk to the processing system,\nand from there to the 360/195 by computer-to-computer channel.\nUnder normal conditions, a complete set of surface data are\nreceived within 15 min of the initiation of the polling process (also\ncalled "data time"). The synoptic data are received at about 40 min\nafter data time. About 6 hr after data time, all information from ships\nhas been received. Three circuits transmit ship observational data to\nNMC. The data are then run in the background partition with special\nprograms that perform quality control functions.\nDigital graphics products are sent from the 360/195 via computer\nto computer interface to the support 360/40, stored on a common disk,\nretrieved, and transmitted to users by the Digital Graphics System\n(360/30) via the INTERDATA 50 minicomputer in either analog or digital\n\n9-1\n\nform. Alphanumeric data from the 360 / 195 are sent via computer-tocomputer interface to the support 360/40 and stored on a common disk,\nwhere it is retrieved and transmitted to the appropriate station via\nthe communications system.\nApproximately 550 terminal forecasts are distributed at regular\nI\n\ntime intervals and weather warnings are transmitted as appropriate.\nThese messages are maintained on disk in the message switching directory.\n\nIAll information required for local distribution and external dissemination\nare available in the descriptor entry.\nNMC data products are disseminated throughout the world by the\nNWS/FAA intercommunications system shown in Figure 9-1. For a more\n`\t\n\ndetailed discussion of the communications network refer to a report\n\nt\t\n\nentitled "Survey: Federal Aviation Administration National Communications Center" and in particular the information concerning the Weather\nI \'\t\n\nMessage Switching Center\n\n( WMSC).\n\nAs is evident from Figure 9-1, NMC products are distributed\nt\t\n\ninternationally. NMC provides the U.S. inputs to the World Weather\n\n1\t\ntl\t\n\nWatch and provides the most important forecasts for marine weather and\n\n{\n\nfor the southern hemisphere. The primary input to these forecasts is\nsatellite data.\n\nt;\n\nI\n1\n\n1\n\nI\t\n\n^\'\n\n9-2\n\n-7\n\n13 1\n\n1\n\n;\n!.irkk\n^\t\n\nkkG)k^)\n\n^^B\n\n|^\xc2\xa7^k^\n|_\xc2\xa7\n=\t \xc2\xa9\nn %|\n\\\n|\nn\n\n\xc2\xa7\n|\n&\n\n^\n\n!n\n\nk\t\n\n^|\xc2\xa7! n \xc2\xa7!\xc2\xa7\n`\n\n|\n\nr\n\nLU\n)\n\n^\n\n^^^\n\n!\n\n2\n|\n\n"\n\n\xc2\xa7\n\n|\\|\n\xc2\xa7 n^\n(\n\nk\n\n^\n2\n\nn\xc2\xa7\n\n{ \\^ \\\nk^\xc2\xa7|)f\n\xc2\xab |@\xc2\xa7/z\n\nuj\n_\n\n^\xc2\xa7\n\n( /)\n2\n\n^\n\n\\\n^\n\n2\n\n;\\\nui\n\n^^^)\\\n\n\xc2\xa7\n\n!\t\n\n\xc2\xa7\n\xc2\xa7\n\n|\n\n|\n!!\n\n_\n\nk\n\n\\\n)\n\n%\n\n:\n\n=k:\n^\xc2\xa7\n\n-\n\n^\n\n2\nk\xc2\xa7\n\n}}}!\n\nORIGINAL PAGSa\nOF POOR Q ALITIr\n9-3\n\n10. INFORMATION PRESENTATION ELEMENTS\nTo be determined.\n\n10-1\n\n11. WORKLOAD/CAPABILITIES\nThe NMC and the National Environmental Satellite Service are\nr\t\nnA L\n\nby far the largest users (approximately 90%) of the data processing\nresources of the IBM 360/195 computer systems at Suitland. The remainder\nof users consists of members from the Office of Hydrology, government-\n\ni\t\nsupported university research, and other NOAA organizations. Fenced\nregions arc set up especially for NMC and NESS users; the NMC fence\nconsists of 600K and the NESS fence has 450K in the attached 360/195\nsystems. Other users compete for user regions of 1, 1.3, and 1.4\nj\n\'\xe2\x80\xa2-\t\n\nMbytes; one user region is located in each 360/195.\nApproximately 2,000 modules are executed on the 360/195\'s each\n\n\xc2\xb1\t\n\nday. About 700 to 800 modules are run within 100 to 200 jobs and\napproximately 300 modules are used to process hourly data.\n\'\t\nf _\t\n\nApproximately 1 hr is required to complete a 24-hr forecast on\nthe 360/195, which operates at a machine speed of approximately 7.2\nMIPS. To this processing time must be added:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The time necessary to assimilate the data,\nwhich remains almost constant regardless of\nthe length of the forecast (about 1 hr on the\n360/195)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The time required for generating the state of\nthe weather forecast at NMC. This is dependent\non the difficulty of the weather situation and\non the skill of the meteorologist (between 1\nand 2 hr)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The transmission time to the WSFOs (a few\nminutes).\nCurrent models in use are constrained to the processing capabilities of the 360/195. The future trend will be toward both improving\nthe models and toward reducing the grid size used to make better use of\navailable data. Both will increase Zhe processing time required to\nproduce a forecast substantially. At best, for instance, reducing the\n\nj\n\ngrid size by one-half is expected to increase processing time by a\nfactor of five. When the grid size is reduced in late 1977, it is\nexpected that the increased processing load will essentially take up\nthe available processing reserves within f-he\nto NMC\n\nNMC\n\nsystem. One concern\n\npersonnel is that reducing the grid size may be corrupted more\n\nby coarseness in processing as a result of roundoff than was originally\nbelieved. Studies are currently underway to determine if this problem\nhas been underestimated.\nSatellite data will be used more in the future, particularly if\nthe resolution of these data can be improved by a factor of 2. Ong\nproblem with using satellite data is instrumentation errors; future\ngeneration satellites (e.g.,\n\nTIROS-N)\n\nare expected to have largely over-\n\ncome this problem. Another is the problem of moving cloud contaminations. Satellite soundings are based on a clear atmosphere, so any\nclouds that are present cause errors. On the other hand, tracking\nclouds by satellite yields information concerning wind direction and\nvelocity.\n\n11-2\n\n'
