Even the most wildly successful programs will eventually come to an end.  The challenge in that moment, when a project ends, is how to take what was learned in that project and apply it to the next research activity you undertake.  Although not always possible, information and insights from a project that is underway or coming to a close can be leveraged to identify a new research direction and advance existing tangentially related activities.  In this presentation, a common thread will be followed through a series of sequential research projects where lessons learned in each activity were built into the next enabling each new research project to advance further and faster.  Initial research focused on lunar dust adhesion mitigation coalesced into two major contributors to adhesion interactions; which were, not surprisingly, surface chemistry and topography.  This knowledge was applied to addressing insect residue adhesion mitigation on commercial aircraft leading edge surfaces.  Composite epoxy coatings formulated with controlled surface chemistry and topography were evaluated and led to identification of additional relevant considerations: dynamics and surface morphology.  Collectively, these considerations were applied to address impact ice adhesion mitigation where further properties were elucidated: surface mechanical properties and durability.  Seeking commonality between these research endeavors led to greater understanding of each new research objective and ultimately, identification of robust, viable pathways toward meaningful results.
