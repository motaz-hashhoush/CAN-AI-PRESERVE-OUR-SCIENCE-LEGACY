The experiment was conducted at the NASA Ames Vertical Motion Simulator (VMS). The goals were to (1) design a VMS experiment that can accurately simulate the motion of high sea conditions and to (2) collect data for the U.S. Coast Guard on human performance related to small boat recovery operations. The experiment setup included a software operation model designed around empirical boat position data; a replica boat section manufactured to incorporate real-world task elements; and the means to collect objective and subjective data from human participants. The VMS provided a viable testbed to assess certified U.S. Coast Guard crewmember\u2019s task performance while in motion.\n\n\n\n\n", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20200000442, "endDate": "2020-01-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA)", "location": "Reston, VA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "601a5101b7374177b26a4771583aae96", "id": "88a59856c6c6419394217435bd01a32a"}], "name": "SciTech Forum", "location": "Orlando, FL", "id": "601a5101b7374177b26a4771583aae96", "startDate": "2020-01-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20200000442, "id": "966e1175d0764e78aedefce5b44280b1", "publicationDate": "2020-01-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20200000578, "type": "SEE_ALSO", "title": "U.S. Coast Guard Boat Recovery Simulation at the NASA Ames Vertical Motion Simulator", "stiType": "PRESENTATION", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20200000442.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20200000442/downloads/20200000442.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20200000442/downloads/20200000442.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20200000442/downloads/20200000442.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
