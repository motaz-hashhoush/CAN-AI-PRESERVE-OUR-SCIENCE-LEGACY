The motivation for such a scheme is based on\nthe desire to integrate the very diverse elements of the OMS while taking\nmaximum advantage of knowledge-based systems technology. This\ntechnology is needed not only to solve problems that are specific to various\nelements of the OMS, but also to help solve the problems of integration and\nevolutionary growth.\nPart of the foundation work for an Ada-based distributed expert system\nwas accomplished in the form of a proof-of-concept prototype for the KNOMES\nproject (Knowledge-based Maintenance Expert System). This prototype\nsuccessfully used concurrently active experts to accomplish monitoring and\ndiagnosis for the Remote Manipulator System. We have named the basic\nconcept of this software architecture ACTORS, for Ada Cognitive Task\nOrganization Scheme. An individual ACTOR is a modular software unit which\ncontains both standard data processing and artificial intelligence components.\n\nv\n\nThe work accomplished in the KNOMES project and in similar efforts\nthroughout the industry suggest that the maintenance task for Space Station\ncan best be accomplished via a knowledge-based system approach. In\naddition, tasks such as planning and scheduling, as well as logistics\nmanagement and payload activity management, may also benefit greatly from\nthe use of knowledge-based reasoning in some form. Since all of the above\napplications form a subset of the complete OMS,it will therefore be necessary\nto include the potential for utilizing knowledge-based systems within the OMS -if not at IOC, then during the growth of the station. In addition, it will be\nnecessary for all of these OMS components to talk to each other.\nIt is when one considers the overall problem of integrating all of the OMS\nelements into a cooperative system that the AI solution stands out. By utilizing a\ndistributed knowledge-based system as the framework for OMS, it will be\npossible to integrate those components which need to share information in an\nintelligent manner. This will be particularly crucial where processes need to be\ncontrolled in a hierarchical manner. One example is where a maintenance\nsystem for a particular subsystem needs to inform the scheduler about new\nconstraints on the activities which that subsystem can perform.\nAda is a trademark of the U.S. Government, (Ada Joint Program Office)\nE.4.6.1\n\nFinally, there remains the question of implementing such a system within\nthe confines of Ada. The proof that this can be done rests on the KNOMES\nprototype's use of ACTORS, on past implementations of AI languages using\nmore traditional languages (eg., OPS-5 using BLISS), and on the\nimplementation of a major commercial knowledge-based system environment\nin C. In fact, without the benefits of object-oriented programming as\nimplemented in Ada, or the integration afforded by Ada's development\nconstructs, the task for implementing a distributed knowledge-based system for\nOMS would be considerably more difficult.\n\nM.
