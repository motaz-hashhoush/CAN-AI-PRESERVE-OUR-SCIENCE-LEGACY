Four basic requirements for robotic field geology were determined: geologic content; surface vision; mobility; and manipulation. Geologic content requires a combination of orbital and descent imaging. Surface vision requirements include range, resolution, stereo, and multispectral imaging. The minimum mobility for useful field geology depends on the scale of orbital imagery. Manipulation requirements include exposing unweathered surfaces, screening samples, and bringing samples in contact with analytical instruments. To support these requirements, several advanced capabilities for future development are recommended. Capabilities include near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy, hyper-spectral imaging, multispectral microscopy, artificial intelligence in support of imaging, x ray diffraction, x ray fluorescence, and rock chipping.", "title": "Field Geology/Processes", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T23:49:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19960051156, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Allen, Carlton"}, "organization": {"name": "Lunar and Planetary Inst.", "location": "Houston, TX United States"}}, "id": "164b204a94264c2d8fd38fbbfa8ffcc8"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19960051156, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Jakes, Petr"}, "organization": {"name": "Lunar and Planetary Inst.", "location": "Houston, TX United States"}}, "id": "fb343f6f37d547a387a3b8516db0eba1"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19960051156, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Jaumann, Ralf"}, "organization": {"name": "Lunar and Planetary Inst.", "location": "Houston, TX United States"}}, "id": "c667b3373aea4bfab997e1ee7c9d2b05"}, {"sequence": 3, "submissionId": 19960051156, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Marshall, John"}, "organization": {"name": "Lunar and Planetary Inst.", "location": "Houston, TX United States"}}, "id": "b9d037d05b0542079adf31ba815c5bab"}, {"sequence": 4, "submissionId": 19960051156, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Moses, Stewart"}, "organization": {"name": "Lunar and Planetary Inst.", "location": "Houston, TX United States"}}, "id": "46b48c33a774406aa4e44eb8aab4d781"}, {"sequence": 5, "submissionId": 19960051156, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Ryder, Graham"}, "organization": {"name": "Lunar and Planetary Inst.", "location": "Houston, TX United States"}}, "id": "1209f2c88aa645c99483208b0bb49b93"}, {"sequence": 6, "submissionId": 19960051156, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Saunders, Stephen"}, "organization": {"name": "Lunar and Planetary Inst.", "location": "Houston, TX United States"}}, "id": "23bb64bd195c429199e40ff7cfa20627"}, {"sequence": 7, "submissionId": 19960051156, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Singer, Robert"}, "organization": {"name": "Lunar and Planetary Inst.", "location": "Houston, TX United States"}}, "id": "3b124dffbbab465e82cec72aab161e31"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19960051156, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19960051156, "id": "8bc164777c884856a2f6f32a703a4a11", "publicationName": "Planetary Surface Instruments Workshop", "publicationDate": "1996-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19960051148, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Planetary Surface Instruments Workshop", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19960051156.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19960051156/downloads/19960051156.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19960051156/downloads/19960051156.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19960051156/downloads/19960051156.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
