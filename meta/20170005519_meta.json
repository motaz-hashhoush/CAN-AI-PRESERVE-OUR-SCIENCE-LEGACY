A comprehensive suite of instruments capable of measuring atmospheric composition was deployed around the Korean peninsula on aircrafts, ships, and at ground sites in order to characterize local and transboundary pollution. The NASA Goddard Earth Observing System, version 5 (GEOS-5) forecast model was used for near real time meteorological and aerosol forecasting and flight planning during the KORUS-AQ campaign. Evaluation of GEOS-5 against observations from the campaign will help to identify inaccuracies in the models physical and chemical processes in this region within East Asia and lead to further developments of the modeling system.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20170005519, "id": "b07fbc2923584f5bbf9285e723aca20b", "publicationDate": "2017-05-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20170005519.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20170005519/downloads/20170005519.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20170005519/downloads/20170005519.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20170005519/downloads/20170005519.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
