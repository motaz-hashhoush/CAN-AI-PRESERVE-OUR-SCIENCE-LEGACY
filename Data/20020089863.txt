Inherent in these goals are\n\nseveral time-phased\nSTS augmentations as shown in the evolution table\n(table I). The Johnson Space Center\n(JSC) plays a major role in the definition\nand development\nof these\ncapabilities.\nThe research and technology activities sponsored by the Advanced Programs Office are divided\ninto two major categories.\nThe first\n\nTABLE\n\nI._EVOLUTION\nGoal:\n\nOF SPACE\nPermanent/manned\n\nObjective:\nroutine operation of Shuttle/\nSpacelab Inertial Upper Stage, Spinning\nSolid Upper Stage, and Manned\nManeuvering\nUnit\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Augment\n\nSTS operational\n\nTRANSPORTATION\noccupancy\n\nSYSTEMS\n\nof low Earth orbit\n\nGoal:\n\ncapability\n\nObjective:\npermanent\nEarth orbit\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 High-performance\nsuch as advanced\n\nfacility\n\nin low\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Satellite\n\nservices\n\ngeosynchronous\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Crew capsule\n\nAdapters, tools, and devices for\noperations using Orbiter Remote\nManipulator\nSystem\n\nnear Orbiter\nmodule\n\nfacility\n\ntransfer vehicle\n\n(OIV)\n\n(MOTV)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Shuttle-derived\nlaunch vehicle\n\nhealth determination\n\n(placement,\nretrieval,\nreplacement)\n\nObjective:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Orbital\n\nupper stage\nCentaur\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 High-energy\nSolar Electric\nPropulsion System (SEPS)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Orbiter\n\nOperation of manned\ngeosynchronous\nfacility\n1990 to 2000\n\nPower Extension Package (PEP)\nShuttle thrust augmentation\n\nServices\n\nNEEDS\n\n1985 to 1990\n\n1980 to 1985\n\nTransportation\n\ncategory\nis that of major systems\nstudies, which pursues the definition\nof augmentations\nto the Space\nTransportation\nSystems that are required to support new initiatives identified\nin the activity\nplan.

Specific\nareas of near-term high priority include\nthose of satellite services near the Orbiter and Shuttle augmentation.\nFor\nthe 1985 to 1990 time frame, the\nSpace Operations Center (SOC) lowEarth-orbit manned facility is the highest priority new initiative. The following paragraphs highlight\nthe current\nin-house and funded activities in support of these goals.\nFigure 2.--The open cherrypicker,\nSatellite\n\nServices\n\nNear\n\nOrbiter\n\nSatellite\nservices\nis a high-priority\nevolutionary\nprogram\nat JSC. The\nbaseline STS, through the use of the\nRemote Manipulator\nSystem (RMS),\nthe Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU),\nand the Manned\nManeuvering\nUnit\n(MMU), will offer users the capability\nto deploy and retrieve satellites and to\nprovide\nlimited\npayload\nservices.\nFuture near-term\npayloads are expected to require much more extensive supporting\nservices\nthat will\nnecessitate\nlonger extravehicular\nactivity (EVA) periods and more extensive astronaut support equipment and\nservice tools. The spectrum\nof activities that is expected to be required\nin the mid- to late-1980\'s is shown in\nfigure 1.\nThe specific activities underway at\nJSC fall into both the major system\nstudies and the supporting studies and\nadvanced\ndevelopment\ncategories.\nTwo parallel studies are the augmenting of in-house activities\naimed at\nidentifying\nsatellite services requirements and the specific\nhardware\nnecessary\nto satisfy these requirements. Additional activities are underway to design, develop, and test prototype hardware that has already been\ndetermined\nto be a vital part of the\nsatellite services program.\nTwo key hardware elements,\nreported in more detail in the text of this\nreport, are the open cherrypicker\n(OCP) (fig. 2) and the Maneuverable\nTelevision (MTV) (fig. 3).

The OCP is\nattached to the end of the Remote\nManipulator\nSystem and thus augments both the utility of the RMS and\nthe capability of the astronaut to perform useful work. The MTV is a small\nfree-flying television that will provide\na vital inspection function in the nearOrbiter vicinity to determine the status\nof payloads before berthing with the\nOrbiter\nand to provide\nmonitoring\ncapability\nduring satellite servicing.\nAdditional capabilities and equipment\nthat are being considered include zero\nprebreath suits to reduce EVA overhead, handling and positioning aids to\nprovide\naccess\nto payloads,\nand\nspecial tools to accomplish\ndetailed\nservice tasks.\n\nShuttle\n\nAugmentation\n\nShuttle augmentation activities for the\nnext several years wilt concentrate on\nincreasing\nthe\nSpace\nShuttle\ncapabilities,\ndecreasing\nthe weight\nand cost, enhancing\nreliability\nand\nsafety,\nand reducing\nground\nturnaround time. JSC continues an active\nresearch\nand technology\nprogram\naimed at these areas to bring the STS\nto a routine operational status.\nOne major concern of the Space\nShuttle\npayload community\nis the\nlimited capability\nof the Orbiter for\nuser onorbit energy requirements.\nFor\nthe last several years, a major portion\nof the JSC advanced\nprograms activities has been the pursuit of augmenting\nthis power capability.\nThe\nPower Extension Package (PEP) (fig.\n4) is a fiscal year 1982 new initiative\nthat promises\nboth increased\nuser\npower and extended mission duration.\nIt is an easily installed\nlightweight\nmission kit consisting of two deployabte solar arrays that augment the\ncryogenic fuel cell power system. A\ntypical PEP mission at 55 \xc2\xb0 orbital inclination would provide an increase in\nuser power to 15 kilowatts from the\nnominal 7 kilowatts while increasing\npotential mission duration to 20 days.\nPEP performance\nis influenced\nby\nseveral mission-planning\nvariables including\naltitude,\ninclination,\nlaunch\ndate, launch time, orientation, and required\npower\nlevel.\nSignificant\n\nprogress was achieved in expanding\nthe PEP performance\ndata base addressing these variables. Results have\nbeen\npublished\nwith a complete\ndescription\nof the PEP design and\noperational\ncharacteristics\nin a convenient "PEP User\'s Handbook."\nThis\nhandbook\nhighlights\nthe\nmajor\nbenefits of PEP starting with the increased power it offers payloads, the\nassociated\nincrease\nin electrical\nenergy that allows mission extensions\nof two to three times the Orbiter\nbaseline of 7 days, and its enhancement of Orbiter heat-rejection\ncapacity resulting from reduction in fuel cell\nwaste heat generation.\nOther major\nbenefits are described including comanifesting\nopportunities,\nall-altitude\nand all-inclination\nflight\nregimes,\nquick\ninstallation\nand removal\nof\npayloads for fast mission turnaround,\nlight weight, and compact packaging.\nThrough an intercenter agreement,\nJSC and Lewis Research Center have\ninitiated\nthe development\nof largearea low-cost solar cells for application in the PEP program. The goal of\nthis development\nis to achieve\na\nreduction\nin solar cell procurement\ncosts from current levels of approximately Sl00/watt\nto S30/watt. In this\ndevelopment,\ntwo solar cell vendors\n\nFigure\n\n4.--The\n\n:_.\n\nPower\n\n_I\n\n;\n_\n\n.\n\nExtension\n\nPackage.\n\nwill develop wraparound contact cells\nas well as conventional\ntop/bottom\ncontact cells. Phase 1 of this activity\n(cell development\nand production\nreadiness) will be completed\nby June\n1981, at which time phase 2 (production verification)\nwill begin.\nBoth\nphases of the activity are scheduled to\nbe completed\nbefore the initiation of\nPEP hardware development.\nAnother area of operational concern\nas mission durations increase is that of\natmospheric\nrevitalization.\nThe Space\nShuttle\nuses expendable\nlithiumhydroxide canisters for carbon dioxide\nremoval. Mission durations in excess\nof 7 days with this system would impose severe stowage problems as well\nas increase weight penalties. A prime\ncandidate for early incorporation is the\nregenerable solid amine carbon dioxide removal system that has been\ndeveloped\nunder\nthe advanced\ndevelopment funding. Also high on the\npriority list for Shuttle enhancement\nis\n\'the Solid Polymer Electrolyte\n(SPE)\nfuel cell. The solid polymer fuel cell\nwill provide an order of magnitude increase\nover the current\nfuel cell\nsystem.\nThis system\naugmentation\npromises both cost and weight savings\nand considerably reduces ground turnaround requirements.\n\nSpace\n\nOperations\n\nCenter\n\nThe Johnson Space Center continues\nin its role of principal proponent of a\npermanently\nmanned low-Earth-orbit\nfacility. A prime candidate for such a\nfacility is the Space Operations Center\n(fig. 5). The SOC is intended to provide a permanent base for the construction of large structures, the servicing of orbital transfer vehicles\nand\nsatellites,\nand the provisioning\nof\nscientific and medical endeavors. The\nconcept was developed and analyzed\nby a JSC in-house study team in fiscal\nyear t979. In fiscal year 1980, studies\nwere awarded to industry to provide\nfurther configuration\ndefinition\nand\nsystems analysis and to define and\nanalyze the interaction\nof the SOC\nwith the Space Transportation System.\n\nFigure\n\n6\n\n5.--Space\n\nOperations\n\nCenter.\n\nThe JSC team that participated\n_n\nthe concept definition has been expanded and is now comprised of some\n20 specialists\ncovering all areas of\nsystem and subsystem\ndesign and\nanalysis,\noperations,\nand programmatics and costs. In addition to supporting the technical management of\nthe contracted studies, this group is\ncontinuing\nin-house tasks that reinforce the industry study efforts. It is\nalso a key participant in the program\nplanning activities that are developing\nthe various options available to establish a manned operational facility by\nthe end of the decade. The SOC is\ncurrently proposed as a new initiative\nfor fiscal year 1985 with initial operational capability in 1988.\n\nOffice of\nAeronautics\n\nSummary\nand\n\nSpace\nTechnology\n\nThe activities\nat Johnson\nSpace\nCenter (JSC) funded by the Office of\nAeronautics\nand Space Technology\n(OAST) involve aeronautical,\nspace,\nand energy research and technology\n(R&T) development.\nThese research\nand technology\nareas encompass\nfuture developments\nof all NASA program offices as well as other Government agencies. The use of the Space\nShuttle Orbiter as an experimental\nvehicle, the development\nof spacebased power satellites to beam energy\nto Earth, the electrolysis cell/fuel cell\norbital energy storage systems, the\nadvanced\nonboard propulsion\ntechnology and the large space systems\ntechnology\nare areas of continuing\nJSC interest and activity.\nThe major\nactivities\nin space\nresearch and technology at JSC during\nfiscal year 1980 were (1) support to\nthe Orbiter Experiments\nProgram for\nwhich JSC continues to provide overall\nintegration management\nand program\nplanning,\ntechnical\ndevelopment\nfor\nspecific\nexperiments\n(including\ndevelopment\nof supporting\nequipment), and integration of experiments\ninto the Orbiter;\n(2) in-house\nand\nfunded system definition\nstudies of\nthe solar power satellite (SPS) system\nthat would generate terrestrial electric\npower from orbiting SPS systems; (3)\nlarge-capacity\norbital energy storage\nsystems\nresearch\nand technology,\nwhich\ninclude\nelectrolysis\ncell/fuel\ncell development, laboratory modeling\nof space plasma environmental\ninteractions of large high-voltage\nsolar\narrays in the large vacuum chamber,\nand development of advanced thermal\nmanagement\nsystems for space use;\n(4) advanced\nonboard\npropulsion\ntechnology;\n(5) advanced\nsynthetic\naperture radar; and (6) large space\nsystems technology\nto lower cost of\nspace\nassembly,\nfabrication,\nor\ndeployment\nof large space systems.\nAnother major area of continuing JSC\n\ntie flight data in related technology\ndisciplines and to verify, correlate, and\nextrapolate data derived from groundbased facilities with the flight data.\n\nactivity\nis the transfer of Shuttlerelated technology\ndevelopments\nto\nan all new technology\nairplane with\nlower weight and reduced operational\ncost.\n\nSolar\nExperimental\n\nPrograms\n\n1 .--Shuttle\n\nmission\n\nexperiment\n\nSatellite\n\nJSC in-house and contractor studies\nhave shown that space generation and\ntransmission\nof solar power is an attractive candidate for augmenting\nterrestrial\nfossil-fueled\nelectric\npower\n\nThe Orbiter Experiments Program will\nuse the Space Shuttle Orbiter as a\nflight research vehicle to obtain inflight data over a broad flight spectrum\nfor a variety of technology disciplines\n(fig. 1). As the lead center for the overall project, JSC is responsible for project management\nand integration of\nvarious Orbiter experiments. These experiments are designed\nto augment\nthe research and technology\ndata\nbase for design verification of current\nand future vehicles by collecting Shut-\n\nFigure\n\nPower\n\ngeneration plants in the future. As a\nresult of these studies, NASA and the\nDepartment of Energy (DOE) initiated\nthe Solar Power Satellite\nConcept\nDevelopment and Evaluation Program.\nThis evaluation program is guided by a\njoint DOE-NASA plan that covers the\nperiod from mid-1977 to mid-1980.\n\nopportunities.\n\nFUGHT\n\nCONTROLS\n\n_:\n\nRO THERMODYNAMICS\n\nFUGHT\n\nCONTROLS\n\nSTRUCTURES\n\n,_ MATERIALS\n\n_,,=\n\n,,r\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nAEROTHERMOOYNAMICS\n\nSTRUCTURES\n\n& MATERIALS\n\nPROPU_ON\nSTRUCTURES\n\n_,T_*_C_JI_E\n& M z\'Tt-R\n\nA\n\nS\n\n>\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 MATLRb_LS\n\n"rE\n\nThe overall objective\nof this program is to conceptually\ndefine\na\nreference system (fig. 2) and to understand the economic practicality\nand\nthe social and environmental\nacceptability of the SPS system. The program\nis divided into four major components:\nsystem\ndefinition:\nenvironment,\nhealth, and safety; socioeconomic\nissues; and comparative\nassessment.\nNASA is responsible\nfor conducting\nthe system definition activity and the\nDOE is responsible for the other three.\nThe objective of the activity at JSC is\nto conceptually\ndefine\na reference\nSPS system and to identify alternative\ntechnologies within the reference concept. The four major elements of the\nJSC activity are as follows:\n1. Energy conversion in space\n2. Power transmission to Earth\n3. Space transportation\n4. Space construction\nThe first milestone of the joint DOENASA plan was completed\nwith the\ndelivery\nof the Reference\nSystem\nDocument in October 1978. The DOE\nhas made extensive use of these data\nto perform environmental,\ncomparative, and socioeconomic\nassessments.\nIn 1979, JSC continued system definition studies to iterate design of the\nreference\nconcept\nwith\nmajor\nemphasis\non updating\nthe system\nconcept, optimizing\nthe construction\nand maintenance\napproach, defining\nthe industrial and Earth transportation\ncomplex, defining the total SPS operations, defining\nthe SPS integration\nwith the grid network, preparing technology advancement\nplans, and performing cost and schedule analyses.\nThe major study areas for fiscal year\n1980 include the following.\n1. Summary reports were submitted to DOE in support of the SPS Program Assessment Report that is being\nprepared by DOE.\n2. Workshops were conducted\nin\nthe technical\nareas of microwave\npower transmission,\nspace structures\nand construction,\nenergy conversion\nand power management,\nand space\ntransportation.\n3. System definition studies were\nconducted\nwith emphasis on costing\nthe reference system and on defining\nalternative\nconcepts\nthat included\nlaser-power\ntransmission,\nreducedsize cargo launch vehicles, and solidstate microwave systems.\n4. Critical\nsupporting\ninvestiga-\n\ntions were completed\nin the areas of\n(a) solid-state\ncombining\ndevice\nassessment\n(which allows the combination of several low-power solidstate devices into an efficient highdensity\nmicrowave\ngenerator),\n(b)\nfiber optics investigations\n(for phasecontrol system circuits), (c) evaluation\nof a retrodirective\nphase-control\nbreadboard system, and (d) the SPS\nmicrowave/ionosphere\ninteraction experiment.\nThe results of the ionosphere heating experiment\nindicate that the 23mW/cm 2 power density limit for the\nmicrowave beam is too conservative\nand could be raised. Effects produced\nby simulated SPS ionosphere heating\nare many times less than natural\nionospheric\ndisturbances\nas introduced by solar flares. The ionospheric\npower density limit is a critical SPS\nsystem sizing parameter and has a\nsignificant impact on the cost. A higher limit allows more power to be\ndelivered to a smaller rectenna.\nThree additional\nefforts that also\nsupport the SPS study are (1) large\nspace systems technology,\n(2) space\nplasma\ninteraction\nexperiments\nfor\nlarge power systems, and (3) a continuing study of techniques\nto use\nlunar materials for space construction.\n\nIntegrated\nSystem\n\nOrbital\n\nEnergy\n\nAdvances\nin critical\nspace power\nresearch and technology at JSC in fiscal year 1980 include (t) low-cost\nsolar arrays in support of the Orbiter\nPower Extension Package, (2) highcapacity energy storage based on the\nSolid Polymer Electrolyte\nmembrane\nfuel cell, (3) thermal management\nof\nonorbit\nenergy\nsystems,\nand (4)\nmodeling\nof space plasma environmental\ninteraction\nof large highvoltage solar arrays.\nA subauthorization\nfrom\nLewis\nResearch Center aided in developing\nlow-cost solar cells for the Power Extension Package Solar Array being\ndeveloped by JSC with sponsorship by\nthe Office of Space Transportation\nSystems.\nThe\nregenerative\nfuel\nce I/\nelectrolysis\ncelt integrated\nenergy\nsystem involves development\nof technology with many applications.\nWith\nreadily available water as the resupply\ncommodity, it is a prime candidate as\nthe preferred energy system for any\nextended\nduration\nmanned\nor unmanned\norbiting\nspacecraft.\nFrom\nShuttle-supplied\nwater, this system\n\nFigure 2.--Artist\'s concept of the reference solar power satellite system.\n\ncan also be used for orbital manufacture of propellants for orbital transfer\nvehicles. It is ideally suited for space\nplatforms in which experiments could\ndraw power and/or hydrogen or oxygen\nfor propellants, for feedstock for space\nmanufacturing\nprocesses,\nor for life\nsupport use as required. Thus, the\nsystem serves as an orbiting utility\nsubstation.\nResearch and technology\nin integrating thermal management\nconcepts for onorbit power systems was\noriginally\ninitiated\nby the Office of\nSpace Transportation\nSystems. Joint\nfunding was provided by the Office of\nSpace Transportation Systems and the\nOffice of Aeronautics and Space Technology in fiscal year 1980. The Office\nof Aeronautics and Space Technology\nwilt continue to sponsor the effort in\nfiscal year 1981 and beyond.

The fiscal year 1980\neffort at JSC involved the characterization of nontoxic propellants and corresponding properties of ignition and\nburn systems\n(thrust\nchambers,\nnozzles, etc.).\n\nA large space system technology program has been initiated\nto develop\ntechniques for space construction (fig.\n3). These techniques include erection,\ndeployment,\nand automated\nfabrication methods.\n\ntechniques.\n\nFabrication\n\nAperture\n\nDeployment\n\nAutomated\nfabrication\nis believed\nto be a key requirement for a viable\nprogram\nto construct\nlarge-scale\nspace systems. Some laboratory work\nis underway to study such machines.\nIn addition to the fundamental\nconstruction techniques,\nnumerous other\nelements of construction systems are\nbeing identified (fig. 4).\nLarge space systems technology\nadvances for fiscal year 1980 include\n(1) designing and fabricating\na fullscale functional model of a hexagonalframe/berthing-latch\ninterface mechanism, and (2) forming and welding a\ncomposite\nmaterial\n(graphite-fiberreinforced\nthermoplastic)\nfor space\nstructures.\nThe design requirements for the interface mechanism were derived from\nan analysis of Orbiter constraints, platform interface requirements,\nand Or-\n\nFigure\n\n4._onstruction\n\nsystem\n\nbiter Remote Manipulator\nformance.\n\nThe graphite-fiber-reinforced\nthermoplastic has many desirable material\nproperties\nfor application\nto space\nstructures.

The program\nis a\ncooperative effort of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), NASA, the\nU.S. Department\nof Commerce,\nthe\nU.S. Department\nof Interior, and the\nAgency for International Development.\nThe goal of the AgRISTARS Program is to determine the usefulness,\ncost, and extent to which aerospace\nremote-sensing\ndata can\nbe integrated into existing or future USDA\nsystems to improve the objectivity,\nreliability, timeliness, and adequacy of\ninformation required to carry out USDA\nmissions.\nThe overall\napproach\nis\ncomprised of a balanced program of\nremote-sensing\nresearch,\ndevelopment, and testing\nthat addresses\ndomestic\nresource management\nas\nwell as commodity\nproduction\ninformation needs.\nThe program specifically\naddresses\nthe seven information\nrequirements\nidentified\nin the USDA Secretary\'s\nInitiative.\'\n1.

It is a 3-year cooperative project between\nthe Southern Timberlands Division of the St. Regis Paper\nCompany, the Laboratory for Applications of Remote Sensing of Purdue\nUniversity\nand the Johnson\nSpace\nCenter (JSC). The project represents\nthe first private sector (wood products\nindustry)\nuser\nin NASA\'s\nEarth\nresources programs and is significant\nsince the user also shares in the management and cost responsibilities\nfor\nthe implementation\nof the Forest\nResource Information System. JSC is\nprimarily responsible\nfor the contractual support with the Laboratory for Applications\nof Remote\nSensing\nin\ndeveloping\nspecified\nquantifiable\nforest resource information from Landsat multispectral-scanner\ndata and\ncorrelating\nthis information\nwith St.\nRegis-furnished\ninventory\ndata on\nspecific test sites. The contractor will\ndevelop the software and classification analysis procedures and provide\nfor the technical training of St. Regis\npersonnel. This project also calls for\nthe establishment\nof a Forest\nResource Information System design\nand implementation\nbased on the\nproject results and, finally, documentation of these results for release to the\npublic domain.\n\nWildland Vegetation\nInventory\n\nResource\n\nA Wildland\nVegetation\nResource Inventory Application Pilot Test is being\njointly undertaken\nby the Bureau of\nLand Management of the Department\nof the Interior and JSC to test and implement\nan interactive\nsystem\nto\nassist in the inventory of public lands.\nThis test is presently in the third and\nfinal phase. Each phase--Alaska,\nArizona, and Idaho--was\nrelated to a\ndifferent\necological\nzone; the sites\nwere carefully selected to represent\nthe varied lands under the management of the Bureau of Land Management. The Alaska phase, which began\nin May 1977 and was successfully\ncompleted in July 1978, was primarily\na land-cover\ninventory\nof approximately 2.5 million\nacres in South\nCentral Alaska. The Arizona phase,\nOctober 1978 through June 1980, not\nonly\nused\nthe experience\nand\nknowledge gained in the Alaska project but went one step further by\ndeveloping\nproductivity estimates for\nrange forage (pounds per acre) and\nforest and woodland\nvolume (cubic\nfeet per acre) by type. The Bureau of\nLand\nManagement\ntested\nthe\nknowledge gained during the project\nby doing an independent\nland-cover\nclassification\nof the Arizona Test Site.\nThe Bureau of Land Management\nis\npresently\nconducting\na project over\nthe Idaho Test Site using all the\ncapabilities\nlearned during the other\ntwo phases of the Application\nPilot\nTest. The NASA contractor is completing project documentation\nand transfer\nof the technology\nto the Bureau of\nLand Management\nwith the Application Pilot Test scheduled for completion in March 1981.\n\nTexas Application\nSystem\nVerification\nand Transfer\nThe JSC is participating with the State\nof Texas in a joint Application\nSystem\nVerification\nand Transfer Project to\ndevelop, evaluate, and transfer techniques for applying Landsat and other\ndata to the needs of Texas natural\nresources management agencies. The\nmajor objectives of the project are (1)\nto update and integrate state-of-theart remote-sensing\ntechnology\nwith\nother information sources available to\nthe State to form a functional Texas\nNatural\nResources\nInventory\nand\nMonitoring System, and (2) to test and\nevaluate the utility and cost-effectiveness of natural resource information\nderived from Landsat data and other\nsources when applied in a total system\ncontext to selected State agency management\nactivities.\nThe Texas Applications Project began in June 1978\nand spans 3 years.\nThe remote-sensing\ncomponent\nof\nthe system is NASA\'s major responsibility. A prototype of the system will\nbe operational\non Texas facilities\nin\nlate 1980. The system is being tested\nand evaluated in support of application categories in the areas of coastal\nzone management,\nforestry,\nwater\nresources,\nmineral\nresources,\nand\nwildlife management.\n\n13\n\nSummary\n\nOffice\nof Space\nSciences\n\nLunar\n\nand Planetary\n\nSciences\n\nDuring fiscal year 1980, planetary\nsciences came of age at the Johnson\nSpace Center (JSC) as evidenced by\nthe broad range of experimental\nand\ntheoretical\ninvestigations\ncurrently\nbeing\npursued.\nSample-oriented\nresearch\non lunar and meteorite\nmaterials continues to be the major\nactivity of JSC scientists.\nNew and\ncontinued studies of Mars, Venus, and\nthe Galilean satellites of Jupiter demonstrate\ninvolvement\nin up-to-date\nplanetary research. The consolidation\nof research on the ancient crust of the\nEarth has been gratifying\nas such\nresearch will form a solid base for\nplanetary research during the decade\nof the 1980\'s.\nThe activities of JSC in lunar and\nplanetary\nsciences\nthat are summarized in the following paragraphs\ninclude\nlunar studies,\nmeteorite\nstudies, Earth\'s ancient crust, Mars,\nVenus, cosmic dust, comets, Galilean\nsatellites, cratering, and technology.\n\nLunar\n\nStudies\n\nAs research in Lunar and Planetary\nSciences\ndiversifies,\nthe fraction of\ntotal effort devoted to lunar studies\ncontinues to decrease and now accounts for about one-third of the total;\nbut there are three investigations\nthat\ndemand special mention.\nA study of the relative composition\nof the elements samarium, titanium,\nand scandium in lunar plutonic rocks\nfound that the processes\nthat are\nresponsible\nfor the formation of the\nlunar crust were strongly constrained.\nThis\nwork\ndemonstrated\nthat\nanorthosites did not experience a previous ilmenite fractionation\nwhereas\nnorites and troctolites did. Conversely,\nall plutonic rocks experienced\nsome\nprevious\npyroxene\nfractionation,\n\nalthough this effect is more important\nfor the norites and troctolites than it is\nfor the anorthosites.\nThe rocks that form the lunar crust\nare widely believed to have formed\nfrom an outer shell of liquid rock\nseveral hundred kilometers thick early\nin lunar history. A problem is how to\naccount for the compositions\nof the\nobserved\nrocks if the liquid shell,\ncalled a magma ocean, has a composition like the bulk Moon. A study of\nthe effects of impact showed that the\nimpacts that account for the accretion\nof the Moon were of relatively\nlow\nvelocity and as such could not produce\nimpact melts. However, impact melts\nare melts with compositions\nof the\nbulk Moon. What low velocity impacts\ncan produce is general heating which,\nin excess, will produce partial melting.\nA magma ocean formed by partial\nmelting will be basaltic, and not of\nbulk Moon composition.\nThis idea\nsimplifies\nthe problem of accounting\nfor the compositions\nof the observed\nrocks.\n\nOne of the most important Apollo\nexperiments\nwas the X-ray map of a\nportion of the Moon obtained during\nApollo 15 and 16. However, the usefulness of that data has been very limited\nbecause of the low spatial resolution.\nOne scientist, in a new effort using image-enhancement\ntechniques,\nhas\nimproved the spatial resolution of the\nX-ray data by a factor of two (fig. 1).\nThis advance should provide the grist\nfor many interpretative\ninvestigations.\n\nMeteorite\n\nStudies\n\nThe JSC continues to be involved in\nthe collection and curation of Antarctic\nmeteorites in association with the National Science\nFoundation\nand the\nSmithsonian Institute. The meteorites\nare proving to be a vast storehouse of\nsecrets concerning the solar system.\nThe\nearly\nexamination\nof the\nmeteorites in the meteorite laboratory\nis yielding important new data concerning\nmeteorite\npopulations.\n\nFigure 1 .--An example\nof a portion\nof the X-ray map for the Moon revealing\nthe improved\nresolution and contrast\no! geochemical\n"pictures."\nThe two views illustrate\nthe power of the new JSC\nimage enhancement\ntechnique.\nThe improvement\nin spatial\nresolution\nis obvious\nby inspection\nof the two images\ngenerated\nby a computer\nprinter.\nThe density\nof the regions\nrepresent\ndifferences\nin the ratio of magnesium\nto aluminum\non the surface\nof the Moon.\n\nOriginal\nSoutheast\n\nEnhanced\nMare Serenitatis\n\nBy Laplacian\n\nSubtraction\n\n15\n\nResearch Antarctic and other\non\nmeteorites\ncovers range descripa\nof\ntive topics.A particularlymportant\ni\nresultinvolvesthe discovery a\nof\nyoung age for severalachondritic\nmeteorites.\n\nAncientanorthositesrom Minf\nnesota and Ontario are being\ninvestigatedas a model for the\nbasaltic\ngrowth continents.\nof\nRecent\nworkhasdemonstrated\nthatancient\nanorthosite\ncomplexes\narechemically\nricher in aluminumthan younger\nanorthositic\ncomplexes.\nTheoretical\nstudies\nareattempting\nto integrate knowledge\nthe\ngained\ndirectly\nfromtheMoon\nandapplyit to\nthe studyof the Earth. odels\nM\nhave\nbeen\ngenerated\nthatdemonstrate\nhow\nan Earthmagma\noceanwouldwork\nandwhattypeof crustit wouldproduce.Thepossible\nexistence f an\no\nEarth magma ocean is being\ninvestigated a worldwide\nby\nstudy\nof\ntheoldest ocks\nr\nonEarth.\n\nEarth\'sAncientCrust\nRecognition\nthattheEarth a planet\nis\nthatisaccessible\ntodetailedtudy\ns\nhas\ndirected\nsignificant\neffortto usethe\nEarth\nasamodel\nforthegeneral\nplanetaryprocess f crustal\no\nformation.\nJSC\nefforts\nhave\nbeen\ndirected\ntoward\nthe\norigin\nanddevelopment\noftheEarth\'s\ncontinentalcrust.

The model suggests that the\nvery level surface of Venus (fig. 3) is\ndue to windblown sediments and that\nthe material in the level part of Venus\nis transported\nfrom the few plateau\nregions.\n\nCosmic\n\nDust\n\nJSC is pursuing a twofold thrust involving the collection\nand population\nanalysis of cosmic dust.

The collectors\nfor the\naircraft program are being fabricated\nand the first collection will be made in\nfiscal year 1981. Expectations are that\nmuch new and important data will be\nobtained\nfrom\nthese\ncollected\nmaterials.\n\nat JSC conducts a broad range of\nmedical research and operations activities in support of the goals of the\nOffice of Space Science. The basic\nobjective\nof these activities\nis to\nassure the health and safety of all\nthose who fly in space. In pursuing this\nobjective, every effort is made to increase man\'s knowledge of the medical sciences\nand to apply\nthis\nknowledge\nto the solution of man\'s\nproblems on Earth as well as in space.\nResearch areas of significance\nto\nmanned space flight include neurophysiology\n(space motion sickness),\ncardiovascular\nphysiology,\nbone and\nmuscle metabolism,\nendocrinology,\nand microbiology.\nThe technology\ndeveloped\nin carrying out investigations in these areas has resulted in\nseveral significant\nadvancements\nin\nmedical research during the past year.\nAn area of research of considerable\nimportance to the Space Shuttle Program is that of space motion sickness.\nAlthough less than half of all those\nwho have flown in space have shown\nany symptom of space motion sickness, this illness can incapacitate\nan\naffected\ncrewman\nfor several days.\nThus, it is important that all avenues of\nresearch be explored\nthoroughly\nto\nassure that every step is taken to understand the cause, the effect, and the\ntreatment\nof this space-associated\n\nCratering\nCratering\nstudies,\nwhich receive\na\ncontinuing\nstrong emphasis,\nhave\nresulted in the publication of a major\nnew model for the mechanics of crater\nformation as a function of the impacting projectile\'s\ncomposition\nand\nvelocity and target composition\nand\nvolatile content. This model was used\nto predict the effects of cratering on\nicy planets.\n\nTechnology\nComets\nOne of the most exciting activities during 1980 was formally proposing two\nflight instruments for NASA\'s proposed\nmission\nto Comet\nHalley\nand\nTempel-2.\nBoth instruments\nwere\ndesigned\nto collect comet dust and\nperform geochemical\nanalysis on that\ndust. One instrument,\nthe scanning\nelectron\nmicroscope,\nanalyzes\nindividual\ndust particles\nfor particle\nmorphology\nand size and analyzes\nmajor elements and organic molecule\ncontent.\nThe other\ninstrument\nanalyzes a bulk sample of comet dust\nfor trace elements and isotopic composition and obtains an age for the\ncomet (fig. 4).\n\nA major technology effort to improve\nthe curation\nof Moon rocks and\nmeteorites\nwas completed\nwith the\nopening and operation of the Lunar\nCuratorial Facility. Technology efforts\nalso continue in a range of analytical\nendeavors. Fiscal year 1980 marked\nthe first direct dating of an anorthosite.\n(The Adirondack Anorthosite is 1200\nmillion years old,) Image enhancement of lunar X-ray data and new instrumentation\nfor flight experiments\nhave been mentioned previously.\n\nLife Sciences\nThe Medical Sciences Division of the\nSpace and Life Sciences Directorate\n\nFigure\n\nGalilean\n\nSatellites\n\nA new project was initiated in 1980 to\nstudy\nthe global\ntectonics\nof\nGanymede,\nthe largest satellite\nof\nJupiter.

However, many mission\npayload concepts now being proposed\nand under study will require operational support\ncapabilities\nbeyond\nthose of the Space Shuttle. Future\nplanned programs and projects indicate a need to deploy, assemble, and\nconstruct large systems in space and\nto support long-duration\nmissions for\nscience\nand applications,\nsatellite\nservicing,\ntechnology\ndevelopment,\nand flight support for orbit transfer\nspacecraft.\nAdditionally,\na larger\nmultiskilled crew will be required with\nthe necessary habitability\nprovisions\nand with provisions for increases in\nelectrical\npower, communications,\nmultidocking\nor berthing,\npropellant\nstorage and transfer, and construction\nand manipulator equipment. A facility\nsuch as the Space Operations Center\n(SOC) is needed to provide these\noperational capabilities\nto accomplish\ncurrent and future planned programs\nand projects.\n\nThe Space Operations Center system\nanalysis performed by Boeing Aerospace Company will include identification\nof a mission\nmodel and\nrequirements for facilities for construction, flight support, and satellite servicing. An overall system analysis will\nbe performed that will include technology assessment for the SOC program.\nRockwell\nInternational\nwill\nanalyze SOC/Shuttle\ninteraction\nand\nwill address the issues of Orbiter\ndocking or berthing with SOC, SOC\nassembly and buildup, resupply and\npropellant\ntransfer,\nand\nmore\nspecifically, SOC flight support facility\nrequirements.\nA SOC assembly and\nbuildup is shown in figure 1.\n\nThe output of the SOC/Shuttle interaction effort will be an input to the overall\nstudy of the SOC concept which has\nbeen underway in-house at Johnson\nSpace Center for the past several\nyears. Emphasis will be placed on the\nidentification\nof constraints\nimposed\nby the Space Shuttle in its interaction\nwith the SOC and on design or technical solutions that will allow satisfactory\naccomplishment\nof the interactions.\nThe overall system analysis study will\nthen provide SOC system requirements, system\ndescription,\nsystem\nanalysis\nresults, and a technology\nassessment\nand advancement\nplan\nthat will be used in future development activities.\n\nFigure 1..--.FinalSOC configuration.\n\n23\n\nPower\nPower\n\nExtension Package\nConditioning\nEvaluation\n\nA highly critical element in the Power\nExtension\nPackage\n(PEP) (fig. 1)\nsystem design is the choice of the\npower conditioner or voltage regulator\nused to convert the unregulated high\nvoltage (130 to 170 V dc) at the output\nof the PEP solar array to regulated low\nvoltage\n(30 V dc) for the Orbiter\nelectrical power system. The conversion efficiency and peak-power-tracking efficiency of the regulator design\nare important because both affect the\nsize, and consequently the cost, of the\nPEP solar array required to deliver 26\nkilowatts electrical\npower to the Orbiter at the array end-of-life.\nConversion efficiency\nis also important\nbecause it determines\nthe heat load\nimposed on the Orbiter thermal control\nsystem by the regulators. Other factors\nthat are critical are the overall system\noperating\nstability,\nthe ripple produced, and the transient\nresponse\nwhen the regulators are supplying the\nOrbiter electrical buses in parallel with\nthe Orbiter fuel cells. Early attempts to\ngather regulator performance\ndata on\nwhich to base PEP regulator selection\nproved futile because of the immature\ndevelopment status of suitable regulators and the unique nature of the PEP\napplication.\n\nFigure 1.--Orbiter\nPackage.\n\nPower\n\nA study was initiated at JSC in April\n1978 that had multifold purposes: (1)\nto conduct an industry-wide survey to\ndetermine\npredicted\nperformance\nparameters for a number of regulators\nin various stages of development,\n(2)\nto select three or four of the most promising design approaches and obtain\nbreadboard\nmodels\nfor detailed\nevaluation\ntesting\nin the Shuttle/Orbiter\nElectrical\nPower Distribution and Control (EPDC) breadboard\n(fig. 2) at JSC (the only high-fidelity\nsimulation of the entire Shuttle/Orbiter\nelectrical power system in existence),\nand (3) to select one or more successful models for further testing with\nan actual Orbiter fuel cell to validate\nthe breadboard test results and to investigate fuel cell performance in the\nPEP operating mode. Following completion of the industry survey, four candidate regulator designs were chosen\nfor testing in the EPDC breadboard: (1)\na McDonnell-Douglas\nbuck regulator,\n(2) a NASA Marshall Space Flight\nCenter\nprogrammable\npower\nprocessor (p3) (buck regulator),\n(3) a\nLockheed Missiles and Space Company transformer-coupled\nconverter,\nand (4) a series resonant converter\nfrom Wright-Patterson\nAir Force Base\nmodified for the PEP application.\nA\nsimulated\nsingle-string\nPEP was\nadded to the Orbiter EPDC bread-\n\nboard, including a high-fidelity\nsolar\narray simulator, high- and low-voltage\ndistribution\nwiring, and high-power\nswitching contactors and fusing. Test\nplans and procedures were developed\nand testing began in August 1979. The\nparameters evaluated\nincluded\nconversion and peak-power-tracking\nefficiencies;\ninput and output ripple;\nresponse to a variety of load transients; regulator and fuel cell load\nsharing at various regulator\noutput\nvoltage set points; and overvoltage,\noverload, and short circuit fault protection techniques.\n\nTo date, three of the four regulators\nhave been tested in the EPDC breadboard with results that tend to verify\nearlier\npredictions\nof PEP performance.\nBuck-type\nas well\nas\ntransformer-coupled\nconverters/\nregulators have been demonstrated\nto\noperate with conversion\nefficiencies\nas high as 92 percent and peakpower-tracking\nefficiencies as high as\n99 to 99.5 percent. Load sharing between the regulators and the fuel cell\nsimulator has been as expected and\nvaries with regulator voltage as predicted.\nFinal verification\nof these\nresults is expected\nto be achieved\nthrough actual fuel cell tests during\nearly 1981.\n\nExtension\nFigure2.---Power ExtensionPackage power conditioningsystembreadboard.\n\n.\n\n24\n\ni\n\nManned Remote\nDevelopment\n\nWork\n\nStation\n\nA prime Space Shuttle requirement is\nthat the\nShuttle\nwill\nhave\nthe\ncapability to service the satellites that\nare attached in the payload bay and\ndetached\nin a free-flying\nmode.\nStudies have identified\nthe specific\nhardware development\nnecessary for\nthe extravehicular activity (EVA) astronaut to increase orbital productivity for\nsatellite servicing and maintenance,\ninspection, and repair of the Orbiter.\nOne identified need is to provide the\nastronaut with a stable platform from\nwhich he can perform a variety of work\nfunctions coupled with the capability\nto transport replacement\nmodules to\nand from the Orbiter.

The\nOCP DTA will be integrated with the\nJSC Manipulator Development Facility\nin mid-1981 and used in simulations\non the end of the RMS arm while both\nare supported on an air-bearing floor\n(fig. 2).

The effort identified a maneuverable\ntelevision concept for a subsatellite that will free-fly\nin the vicinity\nof the Orbiter. This\ntelevision is remotely controlled by the\ncrew of the Orbiter and is directed by a\ncrewman to fly to the desired inspection point. The maneuverable\ntelevision is approximately\n1 meter on each\nside and is berthed in the payload bay\nof the Orbiter. Docking and undocking\nis remotely controlled and real-time\ntransmission\nis provided to the crew\nduring flight.

Research is being conducted\nto identify potential hazards, evaluate\nalternatives,\nand recommend\npolicy\nchanges as necessary. The analysis to\ndate has identified three areas of concern: the hazards from the tracked\npopulation, from the untracked population, and from the future population.\nThese concerns are identified for both\nlow Earth orbit\n(less\nthan 2000\nkilometers) and geosynchronous\norbit.\n\nUntracked\nTracked\n\nPopulation\n\nSPACE OBJECT\n\nI.--\n\nSOURCE\n\nPERCENTAGE\n\nOF IN-ORBIT\n\npayloads\n\nPOPULATION\n\nTRACKED\n\nOF TRACKED\n\nPOPULATION\n\nOperational\n\nPopulation\n\nKnowledge that an untracked population exists follows from two principal\nsources: (1) that the more than 50 explosions in space would have been\nexpected to have produced many objects too small to be tracked and (2)\nthat objects that appear to be as small\n\nThe NORAD is currently tracking approximately\n4700 objects in space.\nMost of them appear to be larger than\nabout 10 centimeters\nin diameter, in\nlow Earth orbit, and to originate from\n\nTABLE\n\nas 4 centimeters\nin diameter are frequently detected by NORAD radar just\nprior to reentry. Objects of this size are\nsufficiently energetic in low Earth orbit\nthat, at their average relative velocity\nof 10 km/s, they would penetrate approximately\n20 centimeters\nof solid\naluminum upon collision. Based on the\nobserved number of these objects at\n400 kilometers and on the size distributions that could be expected from\nlow-intensity\nexplosions,\ncollision\nprobabilities\ncan be estimated.\nThe\nprobability of collision for a 50-meter\nradius spacecraft\nwith the 4-centimeter and larger population\nis estimated to be 0.01/yr at 500 kilometers\nand O.05/yr at 1100 kilometers.

This growing need for\npower has put stress on the fuel cell\nlife capabilities,\ngreatly reducing the\namount of useful life available\nfor\nflight. This, together with increased\nhardware costs due to inflation, has\ncaused serious concern regarding the\ncontinued use of alkaline fuel cells to\nsupport future spacecraft. In the past\ndecade, the individual fuel cell power\nrequirements have increased from a 3kilowatt average onorbit and a 4.5kilowatt peak during ascent to a 6.5kilowatt\naverage onorbit and a 10kilowatt peak during ascent. This has\nresulted in a reduction of fuel celt life\nexpectancy from 20 missions to as low\nas 4 missions depending\non power\nlevels and mission profile. Increased\nspacecraft turnaround time is also required\nfor additional\nfuel\ncelt\nchangeouts,\nmore frequent fuel cell\nrefurbishments,\nand additional\npurchases of fuel cell components\nto\nsupport increased activity. As a result\nof the average mission energy growth,\nthe Space Shuttle Program cost to\nsupport the power generation system\nis expected to increase dramatically.\n\nSolid Polymer Electrolyte (SPE) acid\nfuel cell technology\nwas studied to\nprovide a fuel cell system that would\nimprove cost, weight,\nperformance,\nand efficiency\nwhile retaining\nthe\ndesirable\ncharacteristic\nof operating\nlife. In addition, the SPE has the serendipitous\ncharacteristic\nof operating\npropellant\ngrade reactants.\nThese\ngoals were met with a 1.1-square-foot\ncell that was representative of a Shuttle-designed\ncomponent\n(fig. 1). The\ncell accumulated\nover 3200 hours of\ninvariant performance\nat a current\ndensity range between 100 and 500\nAtftL A tear down analysis of this cell\nrevealed\nno evidence\nof material\ndegradation.\nAn 18-cell stack of 1.1-square-foot\nSPE cells (fig. 2) that represents onehalf of a Shuttle-configured\nfuel cell\nhas been assembled and a 2000-hour\ndemonstration test has been initiated.\nAfter initial calibration,\nthis hardware\nwill be tested specifically to the Shuttle qualification\ntoad profile operating\nat Shuttle conditions of onboard gasreactant pressures, temperatures, and\nheat-rejection\ncapabilities.\n\nThe goal of the program is to develop a\nSpace Shuttle fuel cell engineering\nmodel of the Solid Polymer Electrolyte\ntype that is interchangeable\nwith the\nShuttle alkaline type now being used.\nThis change would result in a weight\nsavings to the Orbiter of approximately\n171 pounds and also would reduce the\naverage vehicle turnaround time significantly. Because the SPE fuel cell is\ncompatible\nwith propulsion\ngrade\nreactants, a related weight reduction\noption is also available. Recovery of\nmain propulsion system residual liquid\noxygen for use with the Solid Polymer\nElectrolyte (only) fuel cells could provide an additional 1500-pound weight\nsavings on missions of 4 days or\nlonger. This option\nrequires\nminor\nplumbing changes to the Shuttle vehicle; however, these are considered to\nbe low-risk changes.\n\nFigure 1.---Solid polymer electrolyte fuel cell components.\n\nFigure 2.--A 7-kilowatt reactor stack with 18 cells.\n\nII\n\n3O\n\nSpace Construction\nConcepts\n\nExperiment\n\nFuture space program plans include\nspacecraft with a size and/or weight\nthat exceeds\nthe volume\nlimits or\nboosts the capabilities\nof the Space\nTransportation\nSystem (STS). Implementation of any of these programs\nwill require the capability to construct\nlarge\nsystems\nin space.\nThese\nsystems will initially be constructed\nfrom the Orbiter. Because the ability to\nconstruct\nand operate\nlarge space\nsystems has not been demonstrated,\nusers may be reluctant to employ large\nspace structures concepts with the accompanying implications of high costs\nand high risks. Several complex ambitious demonstration\nprojects have\n\xe2\x80\xa2 been studied;\nhowever,\nnone has\nbeen of a practical size and cost that\ncould be implemented\nin a simple\nOrbiter-based\nflight experiment.\n\nThe approach used was to evaluate\nthe construction\nrequirements\nof the\nseveral large systems that were being\nexamined in the Space Construction\nSystem Analysis study. From this list,\nconcepts\nfor flight\nexperiments\nto\nevaluate specific issues were generated. Three principal areas of technical concern are the actual construction\n\nFrom\nthe experiment\nconcepts\ndeveloped,\na concept\nmay\nbe\nselected for a relatively simple early\nflight experiment that will be valuable\nin reducing the risk and uncertainty in\nplanning large systems later.\n\noperations, the characteristics\nof the\ndynamics of low-frequency\nstructure,\nand the ability to control the system\nduring and after construction.\nFour flight\nexperiment\nconcepts\n(fig. 1) were produced that, in conjunction with a ground test program,\ncould generate the technology\nbase\nneeded\nto support construction\nof\nfuture large space systems. An early\nexperiment concept was the use of the\nRemote Manipulator System (RMS) to\ndeploy a structural\nsubassembly,\nto\neffect multipoint\nattachment\nof the\nstructure, and to install a simulated\nequipment module. A subsequent experiment would exercise extravehicular activity (EVA) and support equipment to access a structure for the installation\nof lines\nand systems.\nAnother variation in the experiment\nconcept would evaluate the joining of\nbeam segments that might have been\nfabricated\nin space\nby a beam\nmachine.\nThe interaction of a low-frequency\nstructure with the Orbiter might be\nstudied by the deployment\nof a long\nboom that could replicate the dynamic\nperformance of a large structure element such as an antenna feed mast.\n\nFigure\n\n1 .Gour\n\nflight\n\nexperiment\n\nconcepts.\n\n31\n\nSpace Construction\nAnalysis\n\nSystem\n\nStudies of large orbiting systems concepts have projected a need for assembly or construction\nin space to\nachieve operational\nconfigurations.\nSpace construction methods and techniques need to be identified\nand\nevaluated for various sizes and shapes\nof structures. Although\npast studies\nhave evaluated\nvarious construction\nmethods,\nno detailed\nend-to-end\nanalysis\nhas been performed\nof a\nspecific large space project system to\nunderstand and evaluate the construction techniques, the construction support equipment\nrequired,\nthe time\nlines, the system installation/location,\nand the extravehicular\nactivity (EVA)\nassisted\nsubsystem\ninstallation\nand\ncheckout.\n\nPart 2 of the study was initiated in\nJune 1979 to establish\nmission requirements\nand concepts\nfor an\nEngineering and Technology Verification Platform (ETVP). This platform\nwas selected\nto represent\na future\nsystem that would eliminate most of\nthe construction\nrequirements\nenvisioned through the decade of the\n1990\'s.\nA detailed\nconstruction\nanalysis was performed of time lines,\nSpace Shuttle crew duty cycles, integrated lighting and power requirements, payload\nmanifests,\npayload\nbay packaging,\nShuttle\nlaunch requirements,\nand overall analysis of\nconstruction drivers. Determination\nof\nrequirements\nfor early Shuttle flight\nconstruction\nexperiments\nwas also\nidentified and evaluated. The use of\nthe ETVP as an advanced communications platform is shown in figure 1. A\nmultiple\nfabrication\nand assembly\nconcept used for construction of the\nplatform is shown in figure 2,\n\nFigure 1.--The Engineering Technology\nVerification Platform in an advanced communicationsplatform configuration.\n\nThe study was concluded\nin June\n1980. Study conclusions\nindicate the\nfollowing. Large space systems should\nbe designed\nfor space construction\nand constructed\nprimarily\nby automated systems augmented by astronaut EVA. Uncertainties\nin space construction analysis must be resolved by\nearly ground and flight tests. Linear\nstructural configurations\nare preferred\nover the other configurations\nstudied\nfor Earth-oriented\nmissions. Systems\ninstallation\ndesign is determined\nby\nconstruction\nand servicing\nrequirements.\nConstruction\nrequirements\nshould be incorporated\ninto ongoing\ndevelopments\nsuch as the open cherrypicker and the EVA mobility aids.\nThe results indicate that the Orbiter\ncan potentially\nbe used as the construction facility; however, limitations\non Orbiter power/energy\nmay constrain this type of activity.\n\nTRI-BEAM\n\n\xc2\xb0\xc2\xb0ULE7\n\nY\n\n7\n_PAYLOAD\n\n-_\nt ENGTH\n-REACTION\n\nCONTROL\n\nSYSTEM\n(4\n\nMODULE\n\nlOB\n6.5\n\n"_\n\nMETERS\n\nCROSSBEAM\n\nPLACES!\n\nX\n\nMETERS\n\nHEIGHT\n\nZOROITTOANS R\n\nWEIGHT\n\n17.4\n30\n\n4]5\n\nMETERS.\nKILOGRAMS\n\nrh70SO\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nP L\n\n8\n\nPOUNDS,\n\nTYPICAL\nINTERFACE\n\nKILOW,_\xc2\xa2ATT\n\nEXTENSION\n\nFigure 2.--The multiple fabrication and assembly station concept for use in platform\nconstruction.\n\nSTATION\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFAB\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nASSEMBLY\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFDUAL\nPACKAGES\n\nPAYLOAD\n\nLOCATIONS\n(ANTENNA)\n\n60\n\n-[\n\'\n\nINSTALLATION\n\nPOWER\nARRAy\n\nl\n\nLONGITUDINAL\n\nCHECK-OUT\n\nBEAMS\n\nANDINSTALLATION\n\nG_AND\n\n32\n\nSERVICE\n\nPORTS\n\nLoads and Dynamics\nGeometry\nStructures\n\nSeveral\nvariable-geometry\nspacestructure concepts were reviewed in\norder to select a configuration\nfor exploring new analytical techniques. The\nselected configuration\nis illustrated in\nfigure 1. Two separate construction\nproblems\nwere studied. In the first\ntask, beam fabrication, a beam is constructed\nby an Automated\nBeam\nBuilder\nmounted\nin the Orbiter.\nBecause of the inclusion of a power\nmodule with very flexible solar panels,\nproblem\n1 forms the basis for investigating\nbeam fabrication\nfrom a\nflexible\nbase. In the second task,\nbeam relocation, the completed beam\nis grasped by the Remote Manipulator\nSystem (RMS) and moved through a\nlarge angle by rotating the manipulator\nabout its shoulder joint.\nSimple\nmathematical\nmodels\nof\nthese structures were developed and\ncomputer\nprograms were written to\ngenerate solutions by numerically\nintegrating the equations of motion in\nphysical coordinates. The models included\na simplified\nclosed-loop\nidealization\nof the Orbiter vernier\nattitude-control\nsystem.\nA new\nreduced-coordinate\nvariable-geometry\nmethod and an approximate technique\nbased on fixed-geometry\nmethods\nwere then developed. Finally, physical\ncoordinate\nsolutions\nwere\nused\nas a standard of comparison to evaluate the accuracy of the approximate\ntechniques.\n\nof Variable-\n\nNearly all methods for dynamic structural analysis are applicable\nonly to\nstructures\nwith\nfixed\ngeometry.\nHowever, for new concepts in large\nspace structures that require space\nconstruction\nor deployment,\nthe\ncapability\nis needed\nto predict\ndynamic\nresponses\nand\nloads\nalthough\nthe structural\ngeometry\nis\nvarying. The most direct approach to\nthis problem -- obtaining\nsolutions\nusing physical degrees of freedom -requires too much computing time for\nroutine application on even moderatesize finite-element\nmodels. Therefore,\na more economical dynamic-analysis\nmethod based on a reduced number of\ncoordinates is needed. In addition, it\nwould be desirable to develop innovative approaches by which the range of\napplicability\nof standard\nfixedgeometry structural-analysis\nprograms\nsuch as NASTRAN could be extended\nto solve at least some of the variablegeometry problems.\n\nFigure\n\n1 .---Study\n\nconfiguration\n\nof construction\n\nThe modal-analysis\napproach conventionally used for reducing the size of\ncomplex\nfixed-geometry\nproblems\nwas extended\nto variable-geometry\nproblems. This new approach reduced\nthe computer time by 85 percent with\nno appreciable loss in accuracy for the\nproblems\nthat were investigated.\nA\nsample time history generated\nwith\nthe new modal method is shown in\nfigure 2. In this problem, a 100-meter\nbeam is being fabricated from the Orbiter while the control system is correcting a 1\xc2\xb0 initial attitude error about\neach axis. The illustration shows the\nOrbiter pitch angle, the beam fabrication rate, and the elastic deformation\nof the beam relative to the Orbiter in\nthe fore-and-aft direction.\nIt was\n\nalso\n\ndemonstrated\n\nthat\n\nthe\n\ndynamic response of the structure to\nexcitation\nresulting\nfrom variablegeometry motion could be accurately\ndetermined by employing a standard\nfixed-geometry\nprogram,\nsuch\nas\nNASTRAN, in an innovative way. This\ntechnique\nis useful\nfor studying\nresponses during time intervals when\nproblems are expected; e.g., when a\nsudden\ngeometry\nchange\noccurs,\nalthough it is limited to time spans for\nwhich the variation\nin geometry\nis\nsmall.\n\nproblems.\n\n1-METER\nBEAM\nFigure 2._ample\ntime histories\nfabrication\nfor the variable\nmodal\n\nRADIATOR\n\nfor beam\nmethod,\n\n.O200\n\n_\'--\n\nSOLAR\n\ni_(\'_ _;,>_f_/_,,_\n\n- o_oo\n\nMANIPUL\'ATOR\n\nORBITER\n\n0-q\n\npITCH\n\nANGLE\n\nfq\n\nj\n\ni\n\nMODULE--J\nVELOCiTy\n\nOF gElM\n\nOROWTH\n\nORBITER\nPROBLEM\nPROBLEM\n\n1: BEAM FABRICATION\n2."

This study emphasizes manned\ngeosynchronous-orbit\nsortie missions and associated crewsystem concepts.\n\nIn phase 1 of the study, a broad range\nof generic missions was selected from\nwhich Manned Orbital Transfer Vehicle\n(MOTV)\nrequirements\nwere\nderived. These generic missions were\ndivided into five categories as follows:\ninspection, service, and repair; operation of a large space system; debris\nremoval; construction; and unmanned\ncargo transport. The missions range\nfrom short duration, two-man crews,\nand low mission-hardware\nweight to\norbit\nto long duration,\nthree-man\ncrews, and heavy mission-hardware\nweight to orbit. The main objective\nwas to develop a versatile MOTV concept that would encompass\nmost of\nthese\ngeneric\nmissions\nwith\na\nminimum of modifications.\nThe concept that was selected was an all-propulsive MOTV using a 1-1/2-stage propulsion\nsystem\nand a 25.0-cubic\nmeter crew capsule. This concept can\n34\n\naccomplish all missions except a 30man crew rotation and supply mission.\nAll remaining\nmissions can be accomplished\nwith one MOTV flight to\norbit except the solar power satellite\ndemonstration\nmission that requires\nfour such flights because of the large\namount of mission hardware needed\nto be transported to the construction\nsite.\nIn phase 2 of the study, a communications satellite servicing mission\nwas selected as the design reference\nmission. In this mission, four communications\nsatellites,\nall using the\nstandard\nMultimission\nModular\nSpacecraft (MMS) for subsystem support functions and all identical to each\nother, are routinely serviced by the\nMOTV. The satellites are all located\n90 \xc2\xb0 apart in geosynchronous\nEarth orbit. Periodically, the MOTV visits each\nof these satellites and services the\nMMS subsystems.\n\nFigure\nEarth\n\n1 .--A\norbit.\n\nManned\n\nOrbital\n\nTransfer\n\nVehicle\n\nSome of the significant\nresults of the\nphase 1 and phase 2 portions of the\nstudy are as follows,\n1. Two- or three-man crews and a\nmission of up to 30 days duration will\naccomplish\n85 percent of the proposed Orbital Transfer Vehicle missions.\n2, A 1-1/2-stage propulsion system\nconcept (fig. 1) shows better performance and cost than a single- or twostage vehicle.\n3. Proposed MOTV missions can\nbe accomplished\nwith two to five STS\nlaunches.\n4.

The\nground\nturnaround\nis\nbaselined but low-Earth-orbit platform\nturnaround may be cost effective,\n6. A capsule diameter of 3 meters\nallows\nmission\nequipment\nto be\nmounted externally,\n7.

The\nuse of fiber optics for data handling\nand transmission\nis expanding rapidly\nin military and aerospace systems and\nin commercial\napplications.\nSignificant advantages of using fiber optics\nfor aerospace vehicle design are complete channel isolation, wide bandwidth, reduced electromagnetic\ninterference susceptibility,\nsmall terminal\nsize, low weight, reliability,\nand an\nultimately lower cost.\n\nThe optical multiplexer/demultiplexer\nis an advanced technological\ninstrument that provides for simultaneous\ntransmission of multiple channels over\na single\nfiber.\nThe approach\nis\nwavelength multiplexing\nusing "n" injection laser diodes biased to the lasing threshold and modulated by the input data.

Attempts\nto overcome\nthis\nproblem\nhave\ngenerally led to decreased reliability\nand excessively heavy packages. The\npurpose of this project was to design a\nhighly\nefficient\nhigh-power\nS-band\ntraveling-wave\ntube that is both lightweight and highly reliable and that\nalso demonstrates a "state-of-the-art"\napproach to cooling design.\n\nFigure\n\n36\n\n1 .--Traveling-wave\n\ntube.\n\nA program was initiated to build a\nhigh-power\nhigh-efficiency\ntravelingwave tube using heat pipes in the\nbase of the tube for cooling. Velocitytapering\nand multistage\ncollectors\nwere used to provide a high overall\nefficiency.\nIntegral heat pipes with\nstainless\nsteel wicks were chosen\nusing ammonia as the working fluid.\nTen heat pipes were used in the\nbaseplate,\nsix transverse\nand four\nlongitudinal.\nThe majority\nof these\nheat pipes were placed near the hot\nspot of the tube, the collector, which is\nlocated at the output end of the tube.\n\nThe result of this project is a 300-watt\ntraveling-wave\ntube (fig. 1) that is both\nelectrically\nand thermally\nefficient.\nTesting at the Johnson Space Center\nindicates that this efficiency\nis accomplished\nwithout sacrificing\nother\nperformance criteria such as low noise\npower density, low AM/PM conversion,\nlow voltage standing-wave\nratio, and a\nlow level of harmonic and spurious\nsignals. The traveling-wave\ntube is\ncapable of producing more than 321\nwatts output at more than 54 percent\nefficiency.\nThis efficiency\nis accomplished\nwith a maximum baseplate temperature of 121 \xc2\xb0 F by using a\nsmall blower on the cold plate. Heat\npipes will be used extensively in tube\ndesign in the future not only for increased power capability\nbut also for\nimproved reliability.\n\nOffice of\nAeronautics\nand Space\nTechnology\n\nSignificant\n\n41\n\nTasks\n\nShuttle-Launched\n\nResearch\n\nVehicle\n\nFunded by: Aeronautics Research and Technology Base (UPN-505)\n(Subauthorization\nfrom Langley Research Center)\nAeronautics System Studies (UPN-791)\nTechnical Monitor: J.

The\nnarrow entry corridor of the Orbiter and\nthe inherent\nlimitations\nof groundbased laboratories to simulate entry\nand aerothermal\nflight environments\ndictate a need for a separate category\nof entry research vehicles. The frequency of flights into space by the\nOrbiter\nwill\nprovide\na recurring\ncapability\nto carry advanced\nunmanned aerospace vehicles into Earth\norbit and perform research and technology demonstrations\nin many related disciplines\nwhile these vehicles\nmaneuver, enter, and fly in the upper\natmosphere\nbefore initiating a landbased recovery.\nThe Shuttle-Launched\nResearch\nVehicle (SLRV) program will enable\nthe NASA flight research centers to expand their knowledge in entry and hypersonic\ntechnologies\nfor future\ndevelopments\nin the Earth and planetary space programs, and will provide\nprincipal investigators with a dynamic\nflight research facility that will lead to\nnew generations of operational space\nflight vehicles.\nThe SLRV would be used to demonstrate new technology concepts in hypersonic flight environments\nthat lie\noutside the operational\nenvelope of\nthe Shuttle Orbiter. These concepts\ninclude aeromaneuvering\nsystems for\nreusable orbital transfer vehicles, advanced\nthermal\nprotection\nsystem\nmaterials for planetary entry probes\nand Earth-to-orbit\nvehicles,\nand\ncontrol-configured\ndesigns for heavylift launch vehicles.\nThe SLRV program uses the Orbiter\'s payload capability for advanced\ntechnology research and development\nand extends the aerodynamic\nand\naerothermodynamic\nresearch that will\nbe conducted from the Space Shuttle\nduring the Orbiter Experiments\nProgram.\n\nSignificant\nprogram\nactivities\naccomplished\nthis year at JSC include\ninitiation of an SLRV applications\nand\ncost-benefits\nstudy and completion\nof\ntwo interagency\nreviews\nof the\npreliminary study conclusions, candidate applications,\nand proposed vehicle configurations.\nThe purpose of the study is to conduct a cost-benefits analysis of various\ncombinations\nof SLRV\'s and research\n\nThe SLRV concept provides a common\nelectronics\n"core" system to which\nvarious aeroshell\nor fuselage\nconfigurations\ncan be attached.\nThis\n"core" will provide all normal avionics,\ncontrol, data, communications,\npower,\nand maneuvering\ncapability\nfor unmanned subscale reentry vehicles. Experiments selected for these vehicles\nwould\nbe designed\nto provide\nresearch data to support the Office of\nAeronautics\nand Space Technology\nresearch programs in advanced space\ntransportation\nsystems and planetary\nentry\ntechnology.\nAeroshell\nand\nfuselage configurations\nwould satisfy\nspecific experimental\nobjectives\nand\nwould\nfall into three\ncategories:\nballistic,\nmedium\nlift-to-drag\n(L/D)\nratio lifting bodies, and high LID ratio\nlifting bodies.\nThe SLRV development\nprogram is\ndesigned\nwith\nprimary\nemphasis\ndirected\ntoward cost-effectiveness.\nThis program employs a phased programmatic\napproach\nwhereby\ndevelopment of the flight vehicles will\nbe initiated on a modest scale. Major\ndecisions for subsequent growth will\nfollow technical advancements\nmade\n\nand technology\nexperiments.\nThe\nresults of the analysis wilt be used to\ndefine a flight test program to advance\nhypersonic\nreentry and cruise-flight\ntechnology\nrequired for the development of advanced space transportation systems.\nThis study has resulted in the identification\nof 28 research and technology experiments\nand 3 candidate\nvehicle configurations\nfor the SLRV.\nThese vehicle configurations\ninclude\nballistic, fixed-trim, and variable-trim.\nThe variable-trim\nvehicle (fig. 1) provides the greatest\nversatility.\nThis\nvehicle will use split windward flaps to\nfly at various angles of attack during\nentry.

JSC\ncontinues to support the Orbiter Experiments Program by providing\n(1)\noverall integration\nmanagement\nand\nprogram\nplanning,\n(2) technical\ndevelopment for specific experiments,\nand (3) integration of experiments into\nthe Orbiter. The Orbiter experiments\nare designed\n(1) to augment\nthe\nresearch and technology\nbase for\nverification\nor enhancement\nof the\noperational efficiency\nof current and\nfuture aerospace vehicle\ndesign by\ncollecting Orbiter flight data in all related technology disciplines,\nand (2)\nto correlate ground-based\ndata with\nflight data by developing\nprocedures\nto accurately\nextrapolate\ngroundbased facility results to flight conditions.\n\nAll experiments\nin phase I have\nbeen\n"prioritized"\nfrom a flight\nspectrum that includes launch, orbit,\nand entry maneuvers.\nThe experiments are selected by using the principles of development\nand succession. This unique approach has been\ncost-effective\nbecause of the maximum use of in-place hardware.\nTo obtain aerodynamic data during\nlaunch, orbit, and entry, the Aerodynamic\nCoefficient\nIdentification\nPackage (ACIP) has been installed on\nthe Orbiter at Kennedy Space Center.\nIt is expected\nto fly on all Orbiter\nflights through 1983. The ACIP hardware has undergone post-installation\nfunctional tests that included elevon\ncalibration and dynamic stability tests.\nAn underflight of the Shuttle Orbiter\nis planned during entry of the first Orbiter flight to obtain an infrared image\nof the thermal protection system of the\nOrbiter.

The reference system document\nwas prepared by JSC and included\ndata developed\nby both Marshall\nSpace Flight Center and JSC. It has\nbeen used as a reference point for the\nDOE in conducting their studies within\nthe joint program. The DOE has made\nextensive use of this document in performing environmental,\ncomparative,\nand socioeconomic\nassessments.\nBeginning\nin fiscal year 1979, the\nfunds for this program have been provided by the DOE. The funds at JSC\nwere used for continued\nsystem\ndefinition studies and critical supporting investigations.\nThe DOE/NASA\nSPS Concept\nDevelopment and Evaluation Program\nwill be concluded in 1980 with the issuance\nby DOE of the Program\nAssessment Report. Continued efforts\nwill depend on program recommendations following the completion of this\nreport.\n\nSolar Power Satellite\nSystem\nDefinition\nand Critical\nSupporting\nInvestigations\nThe possibility\nof generating\nlarge\nquantities of electrical power in space\nand transmitting\nit to Earth\nby\nsatelhtes was first suggested in 1968.\nThe solar power satellite (SPS) concept would provide an almost continuous supply of power to utility\nsystems\nwithout\nconsuming\nnonrenewable\nfuels. During the years\nfollowing 1968, several studies of the\nSPS concept\nwere conducted\nby\nNASA and industry. The energy shortage of 1973 spurred interest in the\nconcept and in early 1976 the Department of Energy (DOE) (then the\nEnergy Research and Development\nAdministration)\nand NASA initiated\nthe Solar Power Satellite\nConcept\nDevelopment and Evaluation Program.\nThis evaluation program is guided by a\njoint DOE/NASA plan that covers the\nperiod from mid-1977\nto mid-1980.\nThe basic objective of the SPS system\ndefinition\nstudies\nis to define and\ncharacterize environmentally\nacceptable and economically competitive SPS\nsystems.\nThe first milestone\nof the joint\n\nFigure\n\n1 .---Solar\n\nPower\n\nSatellite\n\nReference\n\nj_.\nSILICON\n\nJ\n\n_.\n\nSystem.\n\n:\'_52\n\nO0 m\n\n_f\'::\'_i)!\'\':_\n\n._"_470 ,,,\n\n1\xc2\xb0s\xc2\xb02 2\n\nso m\n\nALUMINUM\nARSENIDE\n\n5 m\n.\n\nI0\n\n,500\n\nrn\n\nSILICON\n\nSOLAR\nTOTAL\n\nCONCENTRATION\n\n52\n\nAREA\n\nRATIO\n\nkm 2\n\n26\n\nkm 2\n\n54\n\nAREA\n\nSOLAR\n\n44\n\nBLANKET\n\nGALLIUM\nALUMINUM\nARSENIDE\n\nkm 2\n\n55\n\nkm 2\n\n1\n\n2\n\nDuring fiscal year 1980, system definition studies\nwere continued\nwith\nemphasis on determining\nreference\nsystem costs; defining alternative concepts; and conducting\nworkshops in\nthe technical\nareas of microwave\npower transmission, space structures\nand construction,\nenergy conversion\nand power management,\nand space\ntransportation.\nSummary reports were\nalso submitted in support of the Program Assessment Report prepared by\nthe DOE.\nThe alternative\nsystems\ninvestigated included laser power transmission, reduced-size\npayload\nlaunch\nvehicles, and solid-state\nmicrowave\nsystems.\nStudies\nof laser power\ntransmission\nshowed\nhigh satellite\nmass (more than twice that of the\nreference\nsystem) and atmospheric\nabsorption of the laser energy as major\nconcerns\nrelative\nto microwave\nsystems. A breakthrough in laser technology, however, could change this\nconclusion. The reduced-size\npayload\nlaunch vehicle study indicated that a\n120-metric-ton\npayload vehicle would\nbe more cost-effective\nand would\nhave less environmental\nimpact than\nthe reference system 420-metric-ton\nvehicle.\nThe solid-state\nmicrowave system\nsatellite\nconcept\nusing\nantennamounted converter devices optimizes\nat a lower power than the klystron tube\nsystems and should have a higher\nreliability;\nhowever,\nthe cost per\nkilowatt would be about 25 percent\ngreater than for the reference system.\nCritical supporting\ninvestigations\nwere completed in the areas of solidstate combining\ndevice assessment,\nfiber optics investigations\n(for phase\ncontrol\nsystem\ncircuits),\nand\nretrodirective\nphase\ncontrol breadboard system evaluations.\nA space\nstructures control analysis effort conducted by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for JSC was continued with completion scheduled for early 1981.\nInvestigations\nwere also continued\nin the area of ionospheric testing. The\nmicrowave beam transmitting\nenergy\nfrom a proposed solar power satellite\nin geosynchronous\norbit to a ground\nreceiving antenna (rectenna) will interact with the ionosphere by heating\nthe free electrons in the ionosphere. A\nbeam power density of 23 mW/cm 2\nwas originally proposed as a threshold\nfor nonlinear\ninteractions\nwith the\n\nionosphere. number f theoretical\nA\no\nandexperimental\nstudies, ponsored\ns\nby the Department Energy, sing\nof\nu\nthe 1000-foot ntenna(fig. 2) at\na\nArecibo, Puerto Rico, and the\nionospheric\nheating\nfacility(fig.3) at\nPlattville,\nColorado,\nhavebeencompleted. hepurposef thesestudies\nT\no\nwastoascertain\nionospheric\nthreshold\nlevels\nandtodetermine\ntheassociated\nimpacts on communicationand\nnavigationystems.\ns\nTheresults\nindicatethattheoriginal\n23-mW limit\nlcm2\nwas conservative and can possibly be\nraised. Effects produced by simulated\nSPS heating are many times less than\nthose from natural ionospheric disturbances as introduced by solar flares.\nThe ionospheric power density limit is\na critical SPS system sizing parameter\nand has a significant impact upon the\ncost of electricity. A higher limit allows\nmore power to be delivered\nto a\nsmaller rectenna.\n\nIn addition to the DOE studies on SPS\nimpacts\nto communication\nand\nnavigation systems, NASA conducted\ntests to determine the effects of errors\nintroduced into the SPS phase control\nsystem by a heated ionosphere. The\nuplink phasing signal is transmitted\ndirectly\nthrough the center of the\nheated ionospheric region. The NASA\ntests used polar-orbiting\nNAVSAT\nsatellites\ntransmitting\ntwo coherent\nsignals in the 150- to 450-megahertz\nfrequency band through an ionosphere\nheated by the Plattville,\nColorado,\nfacility. Differential Doppler measurements were made to map electron\ndensity profiles. A phase perturbation\nmodel will use these profiles to predict\nphase\nperturbations\non a 2.45gigahertz uplink signal.\nAn analysis of phase fluctuations on\na radio star signal through an unheated\nionosphere has been made using data\nobtained\nfrom the National\nRadio\n\nFigure\nFigure\n\n2.--Arecibo,\n\nPuerto\n\nRico,\n\nobservatory\n\nAstronomy\nObservatory\nin Socorro,\nNew Mexico. Thirteen sets of interferometers, each using two 25-meter\nantennas, yielded data indicating the\nphase fluctuations\nthrough\nan unheated ionosphere should be less than\n1\xc2\xb0 during the 0.25-second\nperiod of\nthe uplink/downlink\nsignals.

The fuel cell has\nbeen the primary electrical\npower\nsource for all U.S. manned space programs (except Mercury) because of\nsuperior flexibility,\nweight, and cost\nfactors and continues to be the most\nviable candidate for 1 to 2 week missions to be conducted using the Shuttle. Since the Shuttle transportation\nsystem will probably be the space\n"workhorse"\nthroughout the remainder\nof the 20th century (perhaps beyond),\nfuel cell electrochemical\ndevices and\nderivatives\n(electrolysis\ncells) will\nhave a major role in the conduct of the\nmissions assigned to NASA.\nIn a regenerative\nfuel cell configuration, the role of fuel cells -- in\naddition to providing electrical power\nto the vehicle and to the experiments\non the dark side of the orbit -- is to\nprovide potable water for the crew and\nfor certain thermal control requirements. The role of electrolysis cells is\nto recycle\nfuel-celt-produced\nwater\n(and makeup water) using solar-arrayproduced power on the light side of\nthe orbit and thus provide power for\nextending\nmission\nduration\nand/or\nenhancing mission flexibility.\n\nRecycling of water in a regenerative\nsystem is an increasingly\nimportant\nconsideration\nin space missions.\nIn\naddition to regenerating the hydrogen\nand oxygen required for the fuel celt,\nanticipated\npropulsion\nsystem propellants\nare almost exclusively\nhydrogen\nand oxygen,\nand space\nmanufacturing\nmay use large quantities of hydrogen\nand oxygen\nfor\nvarious processes.\nThus, metabolic\nwaste water that may be undesirable\nfor recycling for metabolic use may be\ndiverted\nto propulsion\nand/or\nto\nmanufacturing\nrequirements\nyielding\nmultiple\nuses from a single commodity.\nThe expendables\nrequired\nfor\nelectrical\npower and propulsion and\nthe life support systems required for\nlong-duration\nmanned\nspace missions, such as work crews for space\nstation or satellite construction,\nwill\n46\n\nbecome a substantial portion of the lift\ncapability\nof launch vehicles.\nThe\nsolar-powered space station definition\nstudy of 1971 showed a weight and\ncost advantage using a solar-powered\nregenerative\nfuel cell system integrated with the life support system for\na six-man, 25-kilowatt space station.\nSubsequent\ndetailed\ndesign\nand\nanalysis studies expanded the results\nand established\ndefinitive\nconcepts.\nMore recent studies associated with\nsolar-powered\nspace\nconstruction\nfacilities indicate the potential of integrating certain propulsion\nrequirements into the system.\nThus, the\nregenerative\nfuel cell concept could\nserve as an orbiting utility substation. It\nis anticipated that this concept will be\nproven with a field test of an engineering model in 1986 and that the technology will be available\nfor orbital\nemplacement\nby the late 1980\'s or\nearly 1990\'s. Figure 1 illustrates how\nthis system integrates electrical and\nlife support functions.\nThe responsibility\nfor this technology development\nis shared by JSC\nand the Lewis\nResearch\nCenter\n(LeRC). JSC has the acidic technology\nwith the solid polymer\nelectrolyte\nmembrane and LeRC has the alkaline\ntechnology\nthat is derived from the\nShuttle capillary matrix fuel cell. LeRC\nis developing\nan alkaline\n"breadboard" article for testing at JSC.\n\nThe outstanding\nfeatures\nof the\nsolid polymer electrolyte concept include the extremely\nlong-life capability of the electrolytic membrane, the\nsuperior efficiency of the electrolysis\ncell, and the ability to operate at high\npressure. The alkaline capillary matrix\nconcept is presently superior in fuel\ncell efficiency and shows promise of\nimproved efficiency\nin the electrolysis mode with recently developed\ncatalyst/electrode\nconfigurations.\n\nA program was initiated in 1979 with\nthe objective of bringing the regenerative fuel cell energy storage concept\ninto technological\nreadiness by 1986.\nOne task was to perform an in-depth\nstate-of-the-art\nstudy to define the\nvarious elements of the system. That\ntask was completed\nwith the publication of a state-of-the-art\nreport in\nNovember 1979.\n\nFigure 1.--Integrated regenerative energystorage,\n\nSpaceConstructableHeatPipe\nRadiators\nThe primary means for rejecting heat\nfrom orbiting spacecraft\nis through a\nspace radiator system that rejects heat\nfrom a fluid circulating\nthrough it by\nradiation to the space environment.\nCurrent systems use a mechanically\npumped coolant circuit to transfer heat\nover the radiating surface. Because\nsystem operation is vulnerable to complete failure from a single meteoroid\npenetration, reliability over long mission durations is low. High reliability in\na pumped\nfluid\nsystem\ncan\nbe\nachieved, but the system is generally\nheavy because of the required redundant plumbing, pumping, and valving\nhardware. Long-duration\nhigh-power\nspace\nmissions\nwilt\ninclude\nexcessively\nheavy heat-rejection\nsubsystems unless significant\ntechnical\nimprovements\ncan\nbe\nmade.\nTherefore,\na long-life\nheat-rejection\nsystem that can be constructed\nand\ndeployed onorbit is required to support\nfuture tong-term high-power missions\nsuch\nas large\nspace\nstructures,\ngeostationary\nplatforms,\nor spacehabitable modules.\nThe solution to this problem\nis to\ndevelop a radiator system that can be\nassembled\nfrom a small number of\nrelatively large elements (limited only\nby the size of the Orbiter payload bay)\nso that overall system complexity\nis\nminimized.\nA space-constructable\nradiator system, the keystone of which\nis an innovative high-capacity\nheat\npipe design, will fulfill this requirement. This design,\nif successfully\ndeveloped,\nwill allow future\nlarge\nheat-rejection\nsystems to be built up\nto virtually any desired size (heat load\ncapability)\nusing a relatively\nsmall\nnumber of components. The large heat\npipes with radiator fins attached would\nbe "plugged\nin" to contact heat exchangers\nthat provide heat from a\ncentralized\nheat-transport toop (fig.1).\nSuch systems would be relatively insensitive to the micrometeoroid\nenvironment of space as the puncture of\nany module would cause only the loss\nof that module\'s 2-kilowatt capability,\nrather than the loss of all or a significant portion of the entire system. This\ntype of system would lend itself to\nonorbit\nmaintenance\nby simply\nunplugging damaged heat pipes and\n\nsubstituting\nnew ones. The damaged\npipes could be returned by the Shuttle\nfor refurbishment\nand later reuse. The\nrelative simplicity of this design could\nlead to the eventual manufacturing of\nthe heat pipes in space for use on very\nlarge-scale structures.\nThe initial effort of this task has been\nconcentrated\non a feasibility\ndemonstration of the simple dual-passage\nhigh-performance\nheat pipe design\nthat forms the basic component of the\nsystem.\nThis design\npermits\nhigh\nheat-transport\ncapability\nwithout impacting\nheat-transfer\nefficiency.\nIt\ncombines\nthe advantages\nof axial\ngrooves, such as simple construction\nand large liquid and vapor areas, with\nthe high heat-transfer\ncoefficients\nof\ncircumferential\nwall grooves.\nThe basic design of the improved\nhigh-performance\ngrooved heat pipe\ncontains two large axial channels, one\nfor vapor and one for liquid (inset, fig.\n1), that permit the axial transport and\nradial heat-transfer requirements to be\nhandled independently.\nThe small slot\nseparating\nthe channels\ncreates a\nhigh capillary pressure difference that,\ncoupled with the minimized flow resistance of the two separate channels,\nresults in the high axial heat-transport\n\nFigure\nefficient\n\n1 .--Mockup\nlarge-scale\n\nof onorbit\nheat\n\nassembly\n\nof heat\n\ncapability. The high evaporation and\ncondensation film coefficients are provided separately\nby circumferential\ngrooves in the walls of the vapor channel without interfering with the overall\nheat-transport\ncapability\nof the axial\ngrooves.\nResults of thermal bench tests of\nsmall-scale\n(30-inch-long)laboratory\nelements\nhave confirmed\nthe basic\noperating characteristics\nof the dualpassage\ndesign\nand indicated\nits\nfeasibility for the desired application.\nCurrent effort calls for the fabrication\nand testing of a breadboard\nmodel\n(approximately\n20 feet long) of the\nheat pipe to further demonstrate\nits\nheat-transport\ncapabilities,\nfollowed\nby a demonstration\nof the manufacturability and performance\ncapability\nof a full-scale\n(approximately\n60 feet\nlong) heat pipe. Development\nof the\nheat pipe will be followed\nby a\npreliminary\ndesign\nof a complete\nradiator system flight prototype during\ncalendar year 1981. Design, fabrication, and checkout of a prototype test\narticle\ncomprising\na representative\nportion\nof a complete\nsystem\nis\nplanned\nfor calendar\nyear 1982,\nfollowed by thermal-vacuum\ntesting in\nJanuary 1983.\n\npipes\n\nwith\n\nhigh-performance\n\ngroove\n\nconcept\n\nfor\n\nrejection.\n\n47\n\nSpace Plasma Interaction\nExperiments\nfor Large Power\nSystems\n\nThe interactions\nbetween the space\nplasma environment and surfaces elevated to high voltage (especially combinations of conducting and insulating\nsurfaces such as solar arrays) are complex. These interactions must be understood to develop the design criteria\nnecessary to build large high-voltage\npower systems for space.\nIn determining\ndesign criteria for\nspace development\ntesting, the large\nvacuum chamber at JSC can provide a\nvital intermediate\n"quasi-space"\ntest\nwith scaling parameters intermediate\nbetween the large ratio of object size\nto sheath size for testing associated\nwith large space systems such as the\nsolar power satellite (SPS) system and\nthe small ratio testing in the small\nchambers.\nThe technology\nto be\ndeveloped is important to an increasing number of programs\npresently\nbeing identified for Shuttle era operations. Large-scale\nhigh-voltage\ninteractions with the space plasma environment are inherent in such diverse\nsystems as electric (ion thruster) propulsion, the various SPS subsystems\nand\nlarge-scale\nspace\nenergy\nsystems,\ngeomagnetic\ninduction\npower supply, and various high-energy\nelectron/proton\nbeam experiments\nproposed\nfor magnetospheric\nand\nspace manufacturing studies. In addition to these intentionally\nexposed\nhigh-voltage\ndevices, it has been observed that many supposedly passive\nsurfaces acquire high-voltage\npotentials from time to time due to space\nenvironmental\ninteractions,\nparticularly in geosynchronous\norbit.\n\n48\n\nThe program employs the unique 20meter-diameter\nSpace\nPlasma\nLaboratory facility at JSC to provide\nsimulated space plasma conditions for\ntesting large models. Adequate room\nis available for free-space\ndevelopment of the high-voltage\nplasma\nsheaths without the usual limitations\ninherent to laboratory testing due to\nwall effects and scaling errors. The\nwork is conducted\nin close coordination with existing laboratory and flight\nprojects at the Lewis Research Center\nand is one part of the proposed joint\nAir Force/NASA\nEnvironmental\nInteraction Technology Investigation.\nPlasma may be generated\neither\nstationary or with a flow velocity to\nsimulate\nthe proper\nmotion\nof a\nsatellite through the ionosphere with\nthe magnetic field variable from 0.1 to\n3 gauss. The large sizes involved (both\nthe test object and the high-voltage\nsheath) wilt allow direct measurement\nof variations\nof plasma parameters\nwithin\nthe sheaths\nfor detailed\nverification\nof analytical\nmodel\nbehavior\npredictions.\nThe Space\nPlasma Laboratory experimental\nprogram is intended to provide a direct\nlink between\nsmaller scale experimental data, analytical models, and\nspace-flight\nsystems. The intermediate scale experimental\ncapability\nis\nimportant\nto avoid the large errors\noften encountered when attempting to\nscale hypothetical\nplasma behavior\nbeyond an existing smaller scale data\nbase.\n\nFrom April to July 1980, the large\nvacuum chamber at JSC was used to\nperform\nseveral\nexperiments\nin a\nsimulated\nlow-Earth-orbit/ionospheric\nspace plasma environment.\nIn addition to extending earlier studies (1977\nand 1979) of large-scale plasma interactions with lO-square-meter\nhighvoltage test panels, initial engineering\nverification\ntests were performed\nusing a prototype\nPower Extension\nPackage (PEP) solar array module in\n"flight" configuration. The 15- by 80inch array, consisting of 174 ultrathin\n6- by 6-centimeter solar cells mounted\non a 2-mil\nKapton\nsubstrate,\nis\ndesigned\nto produce 75 watts from\neach module. Each module weighs\nless than 3 kilograms and is designed\nfor mechanical mounting by means of\n40-mil\nhinge pins along each long\nedge, allowing series or parallel connection of successive modules to obtain 10 to 25 kilowatts total power.\nThe prototype PEP array was performance tested under conditions of\nsolar thermal-vacuum\nand low-Earthorbit plasma, both separately and in\ncombination, to fully explore and verify\nits response under actual space operational conditions (fig. 1). The results\nverify satisfactory performance\nunder\ncombined solar and plasma conditions\nwith plasma leakage current losses\nless than 2 percent at array voltages\nup to +280 volts (+80-volt\nsolar array\noutput plus 200-volt bias). Arcing to\nthe plasma was observed at voltages\nover 500 but was shown to cause no\n\nFigure 1.---Power Extension Package solar\narray under combined solar, thermalvacuum, and simulated low-orbit plasma\ntest exposure in chamber A.\n\no\no\ntime\ndamage\ntothearray\n(fig.2).Insulation Atotal f100hours fexperiment\nwasconducted three10-squareusing\nof the exposedelectricalinterconsolararraypanels\nnectsto reduce\nplasmainteractions metersimulated\nk\nwasobserved\ntobecounterproductive, biasedup to several ilovoltsin a\nsimulated\nlow-Earth-orbit\nplasma\nenresulting increased\nin\narcing\nandtotal\nvironment.\nMeasurements obwere\nplasma\nleakageurrents\nc\nforoperations\ntained\nofthefollowing:\nabove100to 200volts.Furtherni\n1.

Preliminary studies indicate that the liquid oxygen/hydrocarbon propellant\nfamily\nprovides the\nmost attractive alternative and that an\nincrease in system complexity will be\nunavoidable with these cryogenic propellants.\nThe present\nspacecraft\nauxiliary\npropulsion technology data base is too\nlimited to allow selection of an optimum system and propellant\ncombination. The objectives of this effort\nare to identify viable auxiliary propulsion system designs and propellant\ncombinations\nto replace\nhypergolic\npropellant systems and to develop the\ntechnology base that will allow an orderly and cost-effective\nselection and\nsubsequent development of a secondgeneration Shuttle auxiliary propulsion\nsystem.\nInitial analytical and subscale experimental efforts will be conducted\nover a wide range of operating conditions to provide basic propellant combustion and thrust chamber cooling\ncharacteristics\nfor promising\npropellant\ncombinations.\nPreliminary\nsystem design and trade studies will\ninvolve (1) determining\nthe inherent\ndesign, performance, and operational\ncharacteristics of promising propellant\ncombinations\nand system concepts,\n(2) providing a common basis to compare the weight, mission performance,\ncost, and operational characteristics of\npromising\npropellant\ncombinations\nand system concepts, and (3) identifying critical areas where full-scale\ncomponent\nlevel technology\nefforts\nwould be most beneficial.\nHigh-speed\ncolor photography\nof\nsingle-element\ncombustion\nhas recently\nbeen used to qualitatively\ncharacterize\nthe basic combustion\ntrends of different propellant combinations and injector element designs\n5O\n\nover a wide range of operating conditions.\nResistance-heated\ntubes\nthat\nsimulate actual engine operating conditions have been used to characterize\nthe thrust chamber regenerative cooling capability of propane.\nSubscale injectors of approximately\n1000 pounds force will be tested to\ncharacterize the combustion performance and stability of promising propellant combinations.\n\nSingle-Element\nPhotography\n\npetlant\nimpingement\nangle,\nand\nunlike spray impingement\nelements\nas opposed to coherent jet elements.\nThe same mechanistic\nmodel developed for hypergotic propellants\nis\npostulated\nto explain the trends observed with liquid oxygen/hydrocarbon\npropellants. In this model (fig. 1), the\nreaction of oxidizer and fuel vapors\nbefore the impingement\nof the main\nbody of the injected propellants counteracts the hydraulic forces of the\nunlike propellant streams, thus affecting the subsequent mixing process.\n\nCombustion\nSubscale\nTransfer\n\nLiquid oxygen was tested with rocket\npropellant-1\n(RP-1), propane, methane, and ammonia in seven different\nsingle-element\ninjectors. A total of\n127 hot-fire tests was conducted over\na chamber pressure range of 125 to\n1500 psia. Different\nbasic element\ndesigns were evaluated including (1)\nunlike coherent jet (fuel on oxidizer)\nimpingement\nand (2) unlike spray\n(preatomized)\nimpingement.\nStriation of the propellant spray patterns (reactive stream separation) was\napparent for all of the fuels and injectors except ammonia. The degree of\nreactive stream separation\nwas observed to increase with increasing\nchamber\npressure,\nincreasing\nfuel\ntemperature,\ndecreasing\nunlike pro-\n\nFigure\nmodel.\n\n1 .--Vaporization-controlled\n\nliquid\n\nTwelve\n\nCombustion\n\nheated\n\nand Heat\n\ntube tests\n\nhave been\n\nconducted with propane.

The need for an orbiting ASAR\nfor monitoring\nof surface water, soil\nsalinity\nand moisture,\nvegetation\nclassification,\nocean surface winds\nand waves, and snow and ice has\nbeen identified during several meetings sponsored by NASA. An L-band\nASAR was flown on the Seasat and a\nmodified L-band radar is planned for\nthe Office of Space and Terrestrial\nApplications+l\nShuttle\npayload.\nSingle-frequency\nASAR with swaths\nup to 100 kilometers typifies today\'s\ntechnology.\nThe envisioned\nASAR\nmission set for the 1980\'s includes\nShuttle imaging radar, Venus-orbiting\nimaging\nradar,\nice-monitoring\nsatellites,\nand Earth resources synthetic aperture radar.

This capability\nis\ncomplementary\nto the space construction plans of the system as directed by\nthe Large Space Systems Technology\nProgram Office at Langley Research\nCenter. The activities at JSC include\nplatform systems studies, simulation\nof the assembly of erectable\nstructures, and subsystem technology\nfor\nautomated fabrication in space.\nSimulation\nof the assembly\nand\nerection or deployment of space elements under zero-gravity\nconditions\ncan be performed in the Manipulator\nDevelopment\nFacility at JSC. From\nprevious platform system studies, the\nfollowing two areas for follow-on work\nwere identified.\n\nrecognizing\nthat requirements\nwould\nbe limited\nin scope,\nconceptual\ndesigns\ncould\nbe generated\nfor\nberthing mechanisms, umbilical interfaces, and end effectors for the RMS.\nA list of berthing system requirements was derived based on Orbiter\nconstraints, platform interface requirements, and RMS performance.\nFrom\nthese requirements,\nthe design requirements for a berthing-latch\ninterface mechanism were generated. Six\nconcepts were developed and evaluated. A hexagonal frame concept (fig.\n1) was designed and a full-scale functional model was fabricated for tests in\nthe coming year.

These\ntechnologies\ninclude\n(1) redundant\ndigital fly-by-wire\nflight control and\nstability\naugmentation,\n(2) comprehensive computer monitoring and\nmanagement\nof vehicle systems, and\n(3) digital data multiplexing.\nElectric\nactuation for aircraft control surfaces,\nalthough not currently in use in the\nSpace Shuttle, is suitable for aircraft\napplications\nas are fiber optics communication and data transmission, advanced sensor concepts such as laser\ngyros, and high-voltage\nelectrical\npower\nsystems.\nThese\nadvanced\nelectric/electronic\nsystems are potentially more energy-efficient\nthan current\nmechanical,\nhydraulic,\nand\npneumatic\nsystem designs\nused in\ncommercial\naircraft.\nFor example,\nreductions\nin aircraft "bare-airframe"\nstability can be permitted if a digital\nfly-by-wire\nrather than a mechanical\nflight control system is used. Reduced\nstability\nrequirements\nwill, in turn,\ndecrease\naircraft weight and aerodynamic drag, resulting in lower fuel\nconsumption.\nAlso, fluid transmission\nlosses in hydraulic systems will increase as the size of the airplane and\nlength-of-line\nruns increase. Electric\nactuation systems using high-voltage\nelectrical transmission\noffer a significantly more energy-efficient\nweightreducing\nalternative,\nparticularly\nfor\nthe large wide-body transports.\n\nA study to define the potential payoff\nfrom the incorporation\nof these advanced technologies\ninto commercial\naircraft has been completed\nby the\nJSC. Three types of aircraft selected\nfor the study included\na commuter\ntransport weighing\n28 606 pounds, a\nshort-haul transport weighing\n40 427\npounds, and an advanced wide-body\ntransport weighing\n459 437 pounds.\nFive candidate\nelectronic\ntechnologies that were applied\nto each\nvehicle\nincluded\ndigital\nfly-by-wire\nflight control with and without reduced\nstability requirements,\ndata multiplexing, ring laser gyros, an integrated\navionics/data\nprocessing system, and\nan all-electric\nsecondary\npower\nsystem. Baseline system designs were\ndefined\nfor the three aircraft\nand\nweight, cost, and reliability estimates\nwere made to establish a valid basis\nfor comparison. Preliminary designs of\nthe advanced\ntechnology\nsystems\nwere similarly defined for each vehicle. Investment,\nresearch and technology, and operating\ncosts of the\naircraft with these advanced systems\nwere then derived and incrementally\ncompared\nto similar costs for the\nbaseline vehicles.\n\nThe principal results of this study for\nthe wide-body\nadvanced\ntransport\naircraft (ATA) are summarized in figure\n1. The net value of technology\n(the\ndifference between the cost of technology and the savings resulting from\nit) and the total percent reduction in\ndirect operating cost for each technology are shown for the ATA with and\nwithout\nreduced\nairframe\nstability.\nThese data are based on an assumed\nfleet of 300 aircraft and a fuel cost of\nS1.80 per gallon. Current industry estimates project fuel prices between S2\nand S3 per gallon in the early 1990\'s.\nAs can be seen in figure 1, the allelectric secondary power system ATA\nshows the highest cost savings, totaling more than S9 billion over a 16-year\nperiod. This is a large payoff and supports further work by NASA in the\ndevelopment\nof these technologies\nfor\naircraft\napplications.\nThe benefits,\nwhen realized, will result in higher\nproductivity\nfor the airplane industry,\nlower airfares for the passenger, and\nsignificant\nenergy\nsavings\nfor the\nUnited States.

Two activities have been completed\nand\na third\nhas been\nredirected.\nHandbook\n\nof Lunar Materials\n\nThe physical and chemical properties\nof lunar rocks, soils, and minerals are\nbasic data needed for feasibility and\ndesign studies of advanced processes\nfor refining lunar materials. This need\nhas been filled by the preparation and\npublication of a document, "Handbook\nof Lunar Materials."\nIt is available as\nNASA Reference Publication 1057.\n\nNonterrestrial\nScale Space\n\nMaterials for LargeConstruction\n\nLarge-scale\nconstruction activities\nin\nspace\nmight\nbenefit\nif metals,\nceramics, glass, and other materials\ncould be produced from lunar rocks\nand soils. These potential resources\npresent\nsignificant\ntechnical\nchallenges, particularly in the area of refining.

The focus of this study has\nbeen the definition\nof the chemical\nand physical processes that could be\nused to produce construction materials\nfrom lunar "ores."\nPrior efforts concentrated\non the\nquantification\nof the mining and ore\nbeneficiation\nprocesses and on the\nscreening of various chemical\nprocesses for refining lunar materials.

The study results are presented in a contractor\nreport, "Extraterrestrial Materials Processing and\nConstruction."\nThe fiscal year 1980 efforts were\ndirected toward (1) preparing a more\ndetailed design and definition of the\nfluorosilicic acid process, (2) holding a\nworkshop on applied electrochemistry, and (3) determining\nthe use of\nproducts\nand intermediaries\nin the\nfluorosilicic\nacid process for ceramic\nmanufacture.\nThe study\nresults,\nworkshop reports, and all technical\npapers are included in the contractor\nreport.\nRefining\n\nof Nonterrestrial\n\nMaterials\n\nAlthough\nprocesses used to extract\nuseful materials from lunar ores may\nbe defined on paper by using thermodynamic\nand engineering\ncomputations, the actual viability of a process can only be tested in the laboratory. Two aspects of such testing have\nbeen explored this year.\nThe first aspect\nrelates to the\nextraction\nof oxygen\nby hightemperature\nelectrolysis\nof gaseous\nprocess effluents, especially the extraction from carbon dioxide, which is\nan effluent from some types of refining. Previous research has shown that\nthermal decomposition\nfollowed\nby\noxygen\npumping\nacross the solid\nelectrolyte appears to be the limiting\nstep. Therefore, a new test design that\npermits the use of ultraviolet\nlight\nstimulation\nhas been designed\nand\nbuilt. Tests are planned for the fall of\n1980.\nThe second aspect relates to the\ndefinition of the dissolution and phase\nseparahon\nsteps of the fluorosilicic\nacid process (fig. 1) in terms of experimental variables. The process steps\nwere mapped onto a pF-pH diagram\nand compared with known solubility\ndata. These were then reduced to a\nhierarchical set of unknowns that need\nto be specified to define the process\nbetter. A set of alternates for the process elements\nwas also defined as\nwere figures of merit. An in-house\nstatus report of the results is available.\n\nFire-Resistant\nLow-SmokeGenerating\nThermally\nStable End\nItems for Aircraft and Spacecraft\nThe general objectives\nare to apply\nfire-resistant\nmaterials technology\nto\ncrash and ramp fires in commercial\naircraft and to conduct systems testing\nof new and modified\nfire-resistant\nmaterials\nin configurations\nsuch as\naircraft\nlavatories,\ngalleys,\nseats,\nfuselage sections,\nand the general\ncabin area. The basic objectives of the\nprogram are as follows:\n1. To demonstrate\nthat the introduction of fire-barrier\nmaterials in\nthe exterior wall will prevent an external "design" fire from entering closed\nand intact habitable\nareas for the\nminimum 5-minute period needed for\npassenger evacuation\n2. To demonstrate\nthat a closed\nand intact cabin will not reach a temperature of 400 \xc2\xb0 F (considered a lethal\ntemperature\nlevel for humans)\nnor\ncontain smoke or toxic gases at temperatures up to 400 \xc2\xb0 F for a specified\n"design"\nfire\n3. To demonstrate that a "design"\nfire in the area of a cabin opening will\nnot propagate throughout the cabin\narea during the minimum\n5-minute\nperiod\nThe program was initiated to identify,\ndevelop, and characterize\nfire-resistant materials to meet the spacecraft\nflammability\nspecification\nrequirements of the Federal Aviation Administration, the aircraft manufacturers,\nand JSC. A fire-retardant\nrigid polyimide foam system was developed for\ninternal applications.\nUsing this technology and expanding the program to\ninclude other applications,\nsignificant\nprogress was made in developing fireresistant low-smoke-generating\nthermally stable polyimide end items.\n\ntion of the foam is expected by early\nsummer 1981. The latest formulation\nof the resilient foam has the lowest (90\npercent) compression set. It has been\ntested\nby a prime\naircraft\nseat\nmanufacturer\nfor indentation\nload\ndeflection and processability\nand was\nfound satisfactory.\nThe vendor has\nnow requested two different densities\nof the seat foam to make several passenger seat backs for flight tests. This\nresilient seat foam has also been sent\nto another prime aircraft seat manufacturer for fabrication\ninto prototype\nseats to be fire tested by two research\ncenters.\n\nThe recent advances in the polyimide\nresilient\nfoam technology\nresulted\nfrom increasing the power in the 6- by\n6- by 12-foot microwave oven from 15\nto 20 kilowatts. This power increase\npermitted\nproduction\nof large-size\nfoam "buns" and also accomplished\nfoaming and curing in one process. In\naddition, the spray-drying time for the\nbase resin has been reduced from 18\nhours to 30 minutes and the quantity of\nresin produced has been increased to\n39 pounds per day.\nFormulations of polyimide thermalacoustical foam insulation incorporating 20 percent milled fiberfrax fibers\ndid not shrink in length or width but\nablated\nin thickness\nwithout\nburnthrough and gave a satisfactory firebarrier time. The acoustical properties,\nhowever,\nwere not met. A newly\n\ndeveloped Fluorel/fiberglass\nlaminate\ndid meet\nthe acoustical\nrequirements and also showed promise as a\nwallboard.\nThe combination\nof\nFluorel/fiberglass\nlaminate\nand\npolyimide\nfoam as the thermalacoustical\ninsulation\nin a wallboard\nwill be tested for effective\nthermalacoustical\nfire-barrier\nproperties.\nMultiple-density\nfoam wallboards still\nrequire further development\nin the\narea of edging compounds with good\nscrew-withdrawal\nproperties\nbefore\nthey can be produced commercially.\nTwo rigid polyimide-foam-filled\nhoneycomb\nfloorboards\nwith improved\nadhesive to bond the face sheets are\nbeing fabricated for functional testing\nin a 747 jet aircraft. A previously installed panel failed after 2633 hours\nbecause\nthe face-sheet\nbond was\ninadequate.\nThe aircraft fuselage panel burnthrough test program was modified to\nfabricate and test standard wide-body\njet aircraft fuselage sections.\nThese\nwill be tested over a pit of burning fuel\npreviously calibrated\nto give a burn\ntime of specific\nlength and thermal\noutput. The jet fuel characterization\nfire for these tests is shown in figure 1.\nThe test stand includes\nan instrumented stainless steel panel used to\ncalibrate the jet fuel quantity for a burn\ntime of specific\nlength and thermal\noutput. If the wide-body\njet materials\nperform satisfactorily,\nthese materials\nwill be fabricated in a narrow-body jet\naircraft fuselage panel and retested.\n\nFigure 1.---Jet fuel characterizationfire.\n\nConcurrent\nwith the polyimide\ndevelopments,\na program was formulated to fabricate 8- by 12-foot aircraft\nfuselage\nsection\npanels\nusing\nbaseline and advanced materials and\nto test them for burnthrough properties\nover a pit of burning jet fuel simulating\na postcrash fuel fire.\nFire-resistant\nlow-smoke-generating resilient seat cushion polyimide\nfoam is available in laboratory quantities for flight tests.

To reduce this\nloss, new fire-resistant materials and\nchemical\nadditives\nhave\nbeen\ndeveloped\nthat significantly\nreduce\nthe flammability\nof conventional\nmaterials. Recent evidence, however,\nindicates\nthat materials\ncontaining\nfire-retardant\nadditives may produce\nseverely toxic gases in a fire. These\ngases could be extremely\ncritical\nbecause of their potential to induce\nbehavioral\nincapacitation\nand thus\nprevent\nescape.\nTherefore,\nthe\nscreening of materials for fire safety\nhas been expanded to include not only\ntests of flammability\nbut also of\nbehavioral toxicity. A major difficulty\nfacing material manufacturers\nis that\nthere is no standardized\ntest for\nbehavioral toxicity.\n\nAs a part of NASA\'s fire-retardantmaterials engineering program (FIREMEN) at JSC, operant behavior technology has been used in the toxicity\ntesting of aircraft cabin materials. A recent experiment\nillustrates how this\ntechnology could be employed in the\nscreening\nof materials for potential\ntoxicity.\nSmall uniform samples of either a\nconventional\nfire-retardant\npolyurethane or a newly developed polyimide\nfoam were pyrolyzed at three different\ntemperatures\nin a chamber housing\ntest animals trained to press a lever to\nterminate brief electric shocks (fig. 1).\nDuring each pyrolysis test, air samples\nwere withdrawn from the chamber and\nanalyzed for carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide. Throughout the test,\nthe lever-pressing\nbehavior\nof the\nanimals was monitored by computer.\nTo ascertain the relative toxicities of\nthe two polymers,\nthe behavioral\neffects\ninduced\nby their pyrolysis\nproducts at each temperature\nwere\ncompared and analyzed.\n\nFigure\n\n56\n\n1 .--Experiment\n\nsetup\n\nto test\n\npyrolysis\n\nThe results of this experiment\nindicated that the behavioral\ntoxicity of\nthese two polymers varied differentially with pyrolysis temperature.\nAt\nthe lowest temperature,\nthe greater\nresistance of the polyimide\nfoam to\nthermal\ndecomposition\nresulted\nin\nlower off-gas concentrations\nand consequently in fewer behavioral effects.\nAt the highest pyrolysis temperature,\njust the opposite effect was found.\nThese results help to identify some of\nthe complexities\ninvolved in ranking\nmaterials\naccording\nto potential\nbehavioral\ntoxicity.\nThe ranking of\nthese two polymers based only on\neither the high or the low pyrolysis\ntemperature\nwould not have been\naccurate.\nIn addition to the behavioral toxicity\ntests of these polymers,\nthe JSC\nFIREMEN program has included\n(1)\ncomparisons\nof the susceptibility\nof\ndifferent behaviors to toxic incapacitation, (2) full-scale fire tests of materials in a 737 fuselage, and (3) comparisons of full-scale\nand laboratory\ntoxicity tests.\n\ntoxicity\n\nof candidate\n\naircraft\n\nmaterials.\n\nAdsorption\nPumping\nRefrigeration\n\nCryogenic\n\nThe objective\nof this project is to\ndevelop and demonstrate operation of\na new type of cryogenic refrigeration\ncalled\nthe Molecular\nAdsorption\nRefrigeration\nSystem\n(MARS). The\ndevice (fig. 1), which uses an adsorption pumping cycle, is nonmechanical\n(has no moving parts) and will provide\na highly reliable source of cryogenic\ncooling.\nThis\ncooling\ncould\nbe\ncryogenic cooling for long-wavelength\ninfrared detectors for long-term orbital,\ndeep space, or aircraft missions. This\nsystem could also provide conventional cooling for spacecraft and/or terrestrial uses such as automotive air\nconditioning\nwhere waste heat could\nbe the power source.\n\nThe Molecular Adsorption\nRefrigeration System is capable, in the current\ndesign, of producing 5 watts of cooling\npower. To date, principles of operation\nand attainment\nof goals have been\ndemonstrated\nin the laboratory using\nan engineering\nevaluation model that\nis the culmination of the development\neffort. This model, the design of which\nis based on the theory and the models\ndeveloped in the course of the work,\nprovides proof of the Molecular Adsorption Refrigeration System concept\nand the availability of valuable design\ntools for future effort. A limited amount\nof investigative\nwork has also been\n\nFigure\n\nThe adsorption pumping cycle is similar to the better-known\nliquid absorbent cycle that makes use of the ammonia absorption properties of water.\nIn the liquid absorbent cycle, the application\nof heat to the mixture\nreleases the ammonia through an expansion valve and lowers the temperature. Conversely, the MARS cycle\nuses a mineral called zeolite (also\ncalled molecular\nsieves) that has a\ncrystalline\nstructure\nwith\nstorage\ncavities\nthat electrostatically\nattract\ncharged gas molecules to the inner\nwalls. The refrigerant is subsequently\ndriven out of the zeolite and pressurized by the application\nof heat,\nwhich may be waste heat or solar\nenergy. Expansion through a JouleThomson valve liquefies the gas and\nproduces\ncryogenic\ntemperatures.\nClosed-loop and continuous operation\nis effected by the use of other containers of zeolite, one of which adsorbs the cooled\nrefrigerant\nwhile\nanother is preheated to be switched in\nwhen the gas is exhausted from the\ncontainer in use.\n\n1 .--Schematic\n\ndiagram\n\nof a two-stage\n\naccomplished\nusing a naturally occurring zeolite, called mordenite, as opposed\nto the original\nsynthesized\nzeolite.

The preprocessing\nprograms\nconsist\nof three major\nprocessors.\nThese processors convert the standard\nLandsat MSS digital tapes to a LARSYS format,\nperform\nsystematic\ngeometric corrections, and provide the\ncapability to register temporal scenes\nof Landsat data sets and to register the\nLandsat data to a map base.\n\nA cooperative agreement between St.\nRegis and NASA is the instrument of\nrecord that defined the responsibilities\nof both parties. NASA shares in the\nproject management\nby providing for\nthe contractual support (the Laboratory\nfor Applications\nof Remote Sensing\n(LARS)\nof Purdue\nUniversity)\nto\ndevelop specific\nquantifiable\nforest\nresource\ninformation\nfrom Landsat\nmultispectral-scanner\n(MSS) data and\ncorrelate this to the inventory data furnished by St. Regis on specific test\nsites.

The purpose of\nthe project is to provide an integrated\nresearch effort that supports several\nother AgRISTARS projects.\nDirectly\nsupported are the Foreign Commodity\nProduction\nForecasting,\nthe Early\nWarning/Crop\nCondition Assessment,\nand the Yield Model Development projects. Indirect benefits accrue to the\nDomestic Crops and Land Cover, the\nSoil Moisture,\nand perhaps\nthe\nRenewable Resources Inventory projects. The Supporting\nResearch project continues the previous focus on\ntechniques\nrelated\nto production\nestimation of wheat, barley, corn, and\nsoybeans\nin foreign\nregions\nwith\nplanned extensions\nto rice, cotton,\nsorghum,\nand sunflowers\nin future\nyears;\nthe project\nalso\ncontains\nenhanced efforts in agronomic remote\nsensing.\n\nThe technical effort in this project is\ndivided into the following areas.\n1. Area estimation\nresearch:\nincludes machine processing,\nmanual\nprocessing (labeling/image\ninterpretation),\nand preprocessing\n(image\nregistration and image display)\n2. Agronomic remote sensing: includes\ncrop\ndevelopment\nstage\nestimation and spectral inputs to yield\nestimation\n3. Supporting field research\nThe area estimation research plan\nincludes\nthe development\nof technologies for estimating\ncrop proportions in small (5 by 5 mile) segments\nof Landsat\nmultispectral-scanner\n(MSS) digital imagery, for estimating\ncrop proportions in larger areas such\nas Landsat MSS full frames, and for\nsegment\nestimates\nin Landsat\nD\nthematic mapper data. Currently, active research is aimed at the MSS fullframe estimation;\nresearch on use of\nthematic mapper data is at a background level but a substantial effort\'\nwill begin in fiscal year 1981.\nMany crops appear spectrally similar in Landsat MSS data at a given\npoint in time; separations\nof these\ncrops are only possible\nby use of\nmultidate sequences of MSS imagery,\nwhich allow individual\ncrops (e.g.,\n64\n\nwheat) to be recognized on the basis\nof their temporal spectral development. Even this approach, which was\nthe basis of the Large-Area Crop Inventory Experiment\n(LAClE) efforts,\ndoes not allow lO0-percent\naccuracy\nin crop recognition, both because of\nthe significant overlap of the individual\ncrop temporal spectral development\npatterns ("signatures")\nand because\nof the visibility in crop signatures due\nto such factors as planting\ndate,\nvariety, and weather. The approach to\nthis problem has been predicated on\nthe following judgments.\n1. The requirement\nto assess the\ncrop identity at a sufficiently\nlarge\nnumber of locations to make an accurate estimate of crop proportions cannot possibly\nbe done economically\nunless it is automated.\n2. The current lack of quantitative\nunderstanding\nof how crop signatures\nare affected\nby external factors requires the .use of a human analyst to\nadjust the parameters of ("train") the\nautomated processing system to the\nlocal conditions.\nIn practice,\nthe analyst\nhas\nmanually identified ("labeled")\ntraining samples from the Landsat image to\nbe machine processed. Several important accomplishments\nin this area\nhave occurred in the past year.\nPreviously, machine processing has\nbeen used primarily to reduce the error\nin an analyst-based\nestimate because\nthe analyst cannot economically\niden-\n\ntify all pixels in the Landsat MSS image ("sampling\nvariance") while propagating the effect of other analystinduced\nerrors. In the past year,\nhowever, several machine processing\napproaches\nhave been identified\nin\nwhich other analyst-induced\nerrors are\nsubstantially attenuated. The first such\ntechnique has been delivered to the\nForeign\nCommodity\nProduction\nForecasting\nproject. All these techniques have been enabled by the previous\ndevelopment\nof computer\nalgorithms\ncapable of automatically\nisolating\nand characterizing\nthe\nstatistical crop signature distributions\npresent in a segment of MSS data.\nFurther improvements in this area are\nanticipated.\nAnalysis of multidate MSS data has\nbeen a cumbersome\nprocess\nfor\nseveral reasons: (1) Each Landsat observation\ncontributes\nfour distinct\nmeasurements\non each pixel,\n(2)\ndifferent\nsegments\nof data have\ndifferent acquisition histories, and (3)\nvariations in planting date from field to\nfield cause substantial variations in individual crop signatures on each acquisition date. Simplified\nrepresentations of multidate MSS data that offer\nnew insights into the crop identification and assessment\nprocess, substantially reduce the cumbersomeness\nof the data, allow us to eliminate the\nplanting date influence, and reduce\nthe sensitivity to acquisition dates (fig.\n1) have been developed. These tech-\n\nFigure 1.--Multidate multispectral scannerdata. O\'s andX\'s are Landsat observations on overpass dates. (a) Typical crop profile.

The importance of this is twofold: (1) when\nthe spectrum of the crop development\nstage can be measured, rather than\nsimply estimated from meteorological\nor historical data, the performance of a\nmeteorologically\ndriven yield model\ncan be substantially improved; and (2)\nthe crop development\nstage models\ncan now be run on a per-field basis to\nimprove the accuracy of labeling. The\nsecond significant\naccomplishment\nwas the conceptual development of an\n\nIn LACIE, registered multidate MSS\ndata were provided by the Goddard\nSpace Flight Center LACIE processor.\nThis system, which provided registration to a 1974 state-of-the-art\nvalue of\n1 pixel rms (a marginal value for many\nof the applications),\nis now being\nphased out.

A major goal\nof the Supporting Research project is\nto advance the state-of-the-art\ntechnology in agronomic remote sensing to\na quantitative\nrather than qualitative\nlevel; resources directed to this area\nwill be substantially increased in fiscal\nyears 1981-85.\nDespite the limited\nlevel of resources in fiscal year 1980,\ntwo significant accomplishments\nhave\noccurred. The first was the discovery\nthat, at least for corn and soybeans,\nthe crop development\nstage is closely\nrelated to the accumulated versus the\n\nagronomically\nmeaningful\ndescriptions (e.g., planting date and growingseason length) rather than by a sequence of MSS observation values.\nPreviously, the labeling process has\nbeen a highly labor-intensive\nprocess\nin which the analyst has been called\nupon to make not only those decisions\nwhich he is uniquely qualified to make\nbut also a large number of relatively\nmundane decisions. Many of the more\nmundane\nhave become\nsufficiently\nquantitative to enable their automation\nin the labeling procedure. This will\nhave the major advantages\nof both\nreducing the cost of labeling and making it possible to objectively study the\neffect of variations in the labeling process.\n\nimprovements in registration\nhas been completed.\n\nand in\nProgram,\n\n5_\'_,\n/\n\nz_\n\nGREENNESS\n\n_5/MEASURE\n\n5/_\n\nOVER\nFIELD\n\nNO.\n\n5\n\n30\n5\\\nBARE\n\nL.,\n\n2o\n\nSOIL\n\n5\n\nLINE\n\nw\n\n----_\n-5\n\nCROP\n\n10\n\n5f _-\n\nRIPE\nSTANDING\n\nB\n\n5\n\nEMERGENCE_\nDATE\n_I\n\nI\n\n/\n\n_\n\n\\_\n\n\'l\n\n5._./_\n\n--\n\n_TO\n\nEXTRAPOLATION\nBARE\nSOIL\n\n.u\n\n........_I,\nf\n\nESTIMATION\nDATE\n\ni\n\n0\n\nI\n80\n\n40\n\nI\n160\n\n120\n\n/\n\n_\n\nII\no\n\nT-,ERO,--.J\n\ni\nI\n\nI\n200\n\nI\n240\n\nl\n280\n\nJ\n320\n\n_\n\ni\n\n3\n\nii\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTIME\n\n(CALENDAR\n\nBAYS)\n\nCROP\n\nDEVELOPMENT\n\nSTAGE\nAREA\nAREA\n\nIS\n\nLINEARLY\n\nRELATED\n\nTO\n\n9\n\n_z\nL%\n\n06\n\nACCOmPLISHM[NTS\n\nCOnCeptUAL\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 _E_O\nOF\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n6\n\nR_FLeCIANCe\nSTATUS,\n\nUEV(L\n\n_5\n\n_o\n\nto o ;,\nIO\n\nDATE\n\n_pPRC_CH\n_St_BL_SHM_N_\n\nPOt EN_AL\n\nCORN\n\nA\n\nA AND\n\nB\n\n65\n\nAgRISTARS:\nCommodity\nForecasting\n\nForeign\nProduction\nProject\n\nThe Foreign Commodity\nProduction\nForecasting\nproject\nof AgRISTARS\nbuilds on 6 years of joint experience\nby the U.S. Department of Agriculture,\nNASA, and the National Oceanic and\nAtmospheric Administration\nin foreign\ncrop production\nforecasting\nand\nremote-sensing\nresearch\nand\ndevelopment\nand on more than 15\nyears of crop-related\naerospace\nremote-sensing\ntechnology\nin the\nUnited\nStates.\nPrevious\ntriagency\nresearch of the application of Landsat\nmultispectral-scanner\nand weather\ndata has established\na suitable basis\nfor the Foreign Commodity Production\nForecasting project (fig. 1).

In particular, efforts were continued on advancing\ntechniques\nto\nperform\ncrop\nidentification\nand\nclassification\non corn and soybeans\nand wheat and barley. During the fiscal year, the supporting research and\ntechnology\ncommunity,\nprimarily the\nEnvironmental\nResearch Institute of\nMichigan (ERIM) and the University of\nCalifornia\nat Berkeley\n(UCB), was\ngiven the major role in corn and soy-\n\nbeans classification\ntechnology\nand\nthe JSC Earth Observations\nDivision\nassumed the lead in wheat and barley\ntechnology.\nAt JSC, the principal classification\neffort was to translate transition-year\ncorn and soybeans crop identification\nand classification\ntechniques\ninto\nwheat and barley techniques.\nThe\nsystematic\nobjective\nlabeling\nlogic\ndeveloped for corn and soybeans was\nmodified for wheat and barley and the\nincreased use of spectral aids was incorporated into the logic. The techniques developed during the transition\nyear for wheat and barley were also incorporated into this new labeling logic\napproach.\nThe "new"\nwheat and\nbarley\nlogic and procedure\nwere\ntested twice during the fiscal year. The\nfirst was a six-segment "shakedown"\ntest to identify procedural and logic\nproblems; the test results were encouraging and only minor modifications were made. Using the new procedure,\ncalled\nthe "reformatted"\nwheat and barley procedure, the US.\nwheat and barley exploratory test was\nthen conducted\nusing 11 segments.\nThe results indicated some previously\nundetected\nproblems\nwith the procedure and modifications\nare currently\nbeing made before its use in the fiscal\nyear 1981 U.S. Wheat and Barley Pilot\nTest. Simultaneously\nwith the U.S.\nwheat and barley exploratory test, an\nevaluation\nof a second wheat and\nbarley procedure,\nthe "integrated"\nprocedure, was conducted;\nthis less\nsystematic\nmore labor-intensive\nprocedure was also evaluated.\nThe corn and soybeans efforts of\nERIM and UCB have involved modifying the JSC-developed\ncorn and soy-\n\nbeans\ndecision\nlogic\nprocedure\ndeveloped in fiscal year 1979 and incorporating\nthe use of spectral and\nspatial transformations\ndeveloped\nby\nthe supporting\nresearch and technology community.\nThese developmental efforts have been continuously\nreviewed by JSC, and JSC has conducted a preliminary\nreview of the\ncorn and soybeans labeling logic. The\nfirst end-to-end\ntest of the procedure\nand logic developed by ERIM and UCB\nis planned for early in fiscal year 1981\nas part of the 1981 U.S. Corn and Soybeans Pilot Experiment.\nIn the area of sampling and aggregation, a new weighted aggregation approach\nhas been developed\nand tested that establishes\na more\nvalid technique for handling the "nonresponse"\nareas, or areas not adequately represented\nbecause of poor\nsatellite\nacquisition\nhistories.\nPoor\nsatellite\nacquisition\ncan result from\ncloud cover, operational constraints, or\nequipment\nmalfunctions.\nSimulated\naggregation software was developed\nto permit simulating the performance\nin area and production estimation over\na region, assuming different values for\nwithin-stratum\nvariance and for nonresponse. Sample frame development\nfor foreign areas to be addressed\nin\nlater AgRISTARS\nexperiments\nis\nprogressing\nwell.

The\nmajor goal is to integrate the use of\nLandsat\nand other remote-sensing\ndata into the day-to-day decisionmaking processes of the Texas resources\nmanagement\nagencies.\nTo accomplish this goal, the utility and costeffectiveness\nof the information\nderived from remotely\nsensed data\nmust be evaluated in an operational\nenvironment\nusing ongoing management requirements\nof selected state\nagencies as evaluation criteria.\n\nThis project is a joint effort of the JSC\nEarth Observations Division and a consortium of 13 Texas agencies known\nas the Texas Natural Resources Information System. The project started in\nJune 1978 and is expected to span 3\nyears. The project will develop, test,\nand\nevaluate\na Texas\nNatural\nResources Inventory and Monitoring\nSystem based in part on information\nderived\nfrom remote sensing.\nThe\nsystem will consist of three components: a remote-sensing\ninformation\nsubsystem, a geographic\ninformation\nsubsystem,\nand a natural resources\nanalysis\nsubsystem.\nFigure 1 illustrates the type of output products that\nwill be produced.\nThe major responsibility of NASA is\nto assist Texas in upgrading its existing experimental\nremote-sensing\ndata\nanalysis capability\nand to interface\nthis capability\nwith other sources of\nnatural resources information available\nto the state. The software capability is\nbeing developed in two parts. The first\npart was completed by NASA in early\nfiscal year 1980. The major responsibility of Texas includes developing\nthe remaining\nremote-sensing\nsoftware;\nexpansion\nof the existing\ngeographic\ninformation\nsubsystem;\ndevelopment\nof the natural-resources\nanalysis subsystem; and preparation,\ntesting, and evaluation of output products.\n\nFigure 1.---Computer classification.\nWATER\n\nSlightly\nturbid\nwater\nClear water\nModerately\nturbid water\n\nUNCULTIVATED\n\nBrushland\n\nI\n\nBru\'_hland\n\nII\n\nWoodlan(l\nRange, land\n\nI\n\nRangeland\n\nLAND\n\nII\n\nBARREN/WETLAND\n\nH\nHI\nIV\nv\n\nOTHER\n\nSuburban\n\n]\n7O\n\nF -bTo] ,q,2 ],3I" 1,51\n\'61E\n\nlawns\n\nand\n\nstreets\n\nBarren/welland clayey IV substrate\nV boundaries\nVegetated\nIndustrial complex\n\nand unclassified\n\nTo carry out the responsibilities\nof\nboth parties, a Memorandum of Understanding was instituted.

Development of remote-sensing\ndata analysis software and procedures\nto support use of the color graphics\nterminal for the display and enhancement of Landsat multispectral-scanner\n(MSS) digital\ndata. The system is\ncapable of displaying raw or classified\nLandsat 1,2, and 3 MSS digital data as\nwell as performing limited data enhancements including contrast stretching,\nband ratioing, and edge sharpening.\n2. Applications\nwere identified by\nstate agencies for the five test sites in\nthe areas of coastal zone management,\nforestry,\nwater\nresources,\nmineral resources, and wildlife\nmanagement. Remote-sensing\ndata were\ncollected at four test sites. This broadbased application\ntesting will help\ndemonstrate\nthe statewide\napplicability\nof remote-sensing\ntechnology.\n3. Development of the geographic\ninformation subsystem and the natural\nresources analysis subsystem was initiated. These subsystems will provide\nthe means for integrating and analyzing the information\nto support the\nspecific state agency applications.\n\nOrbiter\n\nCamera\n\nPayload\n\nSystem\n\nThe Orbiter Camera Payload System\nwas a fiscal year 1978 new start and is\nfunded through fiscal year 1984. This\ncamera\nsystem is composed\nof a\nlarge-format\ncamera, an electronics\ncontrol assembly, a high-pressure gas\nsupply system, and a flight support\nstructure. The system is designed for\noperation in the Orbiter cargo bay (fig.\n1) to obtain high-resolution\nvertical\nstereoscopic\nphotographs\nof the\nEarth\'s crustal and surface features\nfrom orbital altitudes. The large-format\ncamera (fig. 2) produces photographs\nof high geometric\nfidelity\nfor cartographic applications\nwhere precise\nheight and position of surface points\nare required. In addition to the cartographic\napplications,\nthe stereoscopic photographs will be of particular value to the geological\nexplorer\n(fossil\nfuels\nand minerals),\nthe\nengineering\ngeologist, and other investigators\nof renewable\nand nonrenewable resources.\n\nDuring fiscal year 1980, all development and manufacturing\ntasks were\ncompleted\nand all phases of testing\nwere nearly completed.\nFactory testing and calibration of the cartographic\nlens assembly (fig. 3) was completed.\nThe final two quarters of fiscal year\n1980 have been devoted\nto subsystems verification\nand full system\nenvironmental\nand functional testing.\nA thermal-vacuum\nretest has been\nscheduled for the first month of fiscal\nyear 1981, and delivery of the fully\noperational flight system and groundsupport equipment\nis scheduled\nfor\nNovember 1980.\n\nFigure\n\nFigure\n\n1 ..--Orbiter\n\n2.--Large\n\ncargo\n\nformat\n\nA tentative mission assignment for the\nOrbiter Camera Payload System has\nbeen made using the space available\non Space Transportation System (STS)\nmission 26.

These\ntest areas were then overflown by the\naircraft sensors and the two data sets\nanalyzed with respect to precision and\naccuracy\nto provide a measure of\ncalibration\nto the aircraft sensors for\nextended scenes. Data sets are taken\nat 1.6, 4.75, and 13.3 gigahertz.\n\nThe extended scene radar calibration\neffort was initiated to verify the precision and accuracy of scatterometers\nand imaging radars used for remotesensing investigations on JSC aircraft.\nThe precision\nand accuracy\nof\nmicrowave sensors must be verified to\nensure that day-to-day\nvariations\nin\ntheir data sets are truly remotely\nsensed phenomena rather than sensor\nvariations.\n\nThe effort was initiated in 1977, with\ntest sequences performed in 1978 and\n1979. In 1979, the effort was expanded to cover the effects of row\nspacing on radar reflectivity\nor backscatter curves. In fiscal year 1980, a\ntest series was again performed\nat\nNorthrup Strip, White Sands Missile\nRange, and Jornada\nExperimental\nRange in New Mexico. The Northrup\nStrip data will be used as baseline\ndata for radar calibration. The Jornada\ndata were gathered\nto study the\neffects of row height on radar reflectivity. Figure 1 is a plot of the backscatter difference between cross-row\nand along-row\nradar data of t.6\ngigahertz for two different field conditions. The first data set was taken over\nrows that were 25.4 centimeters high.\nThe second set was taken over rows\nthat were 15.0 centimeters high. Row\nspacing was the same in both sets.\nThe peaking effect caused by the rows\nis present in both but gets smaller with\nreduced row height. Analysis of the\naircraft data also showed that the\npeaking was not present in crosspolarized data. Figure 2 shows the\nnew configuration\nof the ground scatterometer system. During fiscal year\n1980, a new tower/trailer combination\nwas integrated into the system, providing a greater degree of transportability.\n\nFigure 1,--Comparisonof angularresponseof the modulation function,\n25\n\nDATA\n\nSET\n\n1 (NOV\n\n16,\n\n1979)\n\nDATA\n\nX--_--i(\n\nSET\n\n2 (DEC\n\n11,\n\n1979)\n\n2O\n\n1.6\n\nGHz\n\nVV\n\n_o=\n15\n\n10\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\nANGLE\n\n72\n\nOF\n\nINCIDENCE,\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n40\n\n50\n\n6O\n\nDEG\n\nFigure 2.--Ground scatterometer system.\n\nSIR-A Antenna\nOSTA- 1 Pallet\n\nIntegration\n\nto\n\nThe Shuttle Imaging Radar (SIR) A-developed to evaluate the potential of\nspaceborne imaging radar as a tool for\ngeologic exploration and, in general,\nfor mineral exploration, petroleum exploration, and structural mapping--is\npart of the Office of Space and Terrestrial Applications\n(OSTA) 1 payload\nto be flown on the Space Shuttle (SS)\n2 mission. The SIR-A antenna was\ndeveloped by the JSC to be used with\nthe SlR-A electronics\ndeveloped\nby\nthe Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nThe SIR-A antenna, manufactured\nby\nBall Aerospace Systems Division, consists of seven microstrip array panels\nmounted on a triangular support structure. The antenna is attached to the\nOSTA-1 pallet by an aluminum truss\nstructure (fig. 1). The nondeployable\n9.44by 2.1-meter\nantenna\nis\nmounted in the payload bay in a fixed\nposition at 47 \xc2\xb0 . Thermal protection is\nprovided by the multilayer aluminized\nmylar covering the support structure\nand by the Beta cloth covering the\ntotal system.\n\nThe 400-pound antenna system was\ninstalled on the OSTA-1 pallet in the\nOperations and Checkout Building at\nthe Kennedy Space Center in January\n1980. Verification\nof proper fit was\nmade. However, the planned course\nalinement was deferred because of an\nout-of-plane\ncondition\nof the pallet\ncaused by the pallet support method\nused in the engineering\nmodel stand.\nCourse alinement is anticipated\nto be\ncompleted when the OSTA-1 payload\nis located in the cargo integration test\nequipment stand. Electrical testing of\nthe antenna\nhas been successfully\ncompleted.\nThese tests consisted\nof\n(1) a continuity check of reflection and\nloss through the antenna and (2) a\ncoupling check of antenna/electronics\nand the interface by injecting a signal\ninto the antenna and monitoring\nthe\nradar system output.\n\nFigure 1.---SIR-A antenna installed.\n\n73\n\nOffice\nSpace\n\nof\nSciences\n\nTasks\n\nSignificant\n\n77\n\nMartian\n\nWeathering\n\nSimulation\n\nFunded by: Planetary Geology (UPN-151)\nTechnical Monitor: R.

The\ndifference among planetary bodies is\nin the form weathering\ntakes\nin\nresponse\nto its energy source. For\nplanetary bodies having atmospheres,\nsuch as the Earth, the energy source is\nthe\nsecondary\ndissipation\nof\nelectromagnetic\nradiation that arrives\nat the surface and heats the atmosphere. For planetary bodies having virtually no atmosphere,\nsuch as\nthe Moon, the energy source is the\ndirect transmission\nof energy in the\nform of meteorites,\nradiation,\nand\natomic and nuclear particles impinging on the surface.\nFor planetary\nbodies having thin atmospheres, such\nas Mars, the energy source embodies\naspects of both of the above limiting\ncases.\n\nData on planetary\nsurface materials\nobtained\nremotely\n(such as from\nEarth-based telescopes or spacecraft\nimagery), in situ (such as by the Viking\nlanders),\nor directly\n(such as by\nanalyses of returned surface samples)\nhave been influenced by weathering\nprocesses. Only when the extent and\nnature of weathering\nprocesses (and\nof other surface processes such as\nerosion, transportation,\nand lithification) are sufficiently\nunderstood can\nthe data on surface materials be properly interpreted and used to construct\nmodels\nabout the constitution\nand\nevolution of a planetary body. The accuracy and predictive capability of the\nmodels are directly related to how well\nthe changes introduced by weathering\nare recognized and understood.\nAt the present stage of the scientific study of Mars, it is of primary importance to establish to what extent\nthe remote sensing and Viking lander\ndata on surface material reflect primary versus secondary (weathered) surface material. One important avenue\nto use in determining\nand evaluating\nthe nature and influence of weathering\non Mars is through laboratory simulation experiments. In such experiments,\nterrestrial\nmaterials,\nincluding\nboth\nprimary and secondary rock types and\nsynthetic materials, are weathered in a\nsimulated Martian environment.\nFigure\n\n1.---Martian\n\nWeathering\n\nSimulation\n\nA Martian\nWeathering\nSimulation\nFacility (MWSF) is operational at the\nJohnson Space Center (fig. 1). The\napparatus in this facility can simulate\nsuperficial conditions on Mars in terms\nof temperature\n(below -10 \xc2\xb0 C), atmospheric\npressure and composition\n(mainly carbon dioxide at -- 6 tort),\nelectromagnetic\nradiation\nenvironment (ultraviolet through infrared), and\nthe normal Martian variations in these\nparameters. One of the studies performed in this facility is that of the\nkinetics of magnetite oxidation in the\npresence of ultraviolet radiation. Previously, researchers thought that magnetite would efficiently oxidize to ferric\noxide phases under Martian conditions\nof ultraviolet\nradiation. This process\nwas thought to be the dominant one\nthat has resulted in the apparently\nhigh-oxidation\nstate of the Martian surface.\nHowever,\nexperiments\nperformed\nin the Martian\nWeathering\nSimulation Facility revealed that this\nprocess does not proceed at a perceptible rate. What appears to happen is\nthat Martian\nsurface\nmaterials\nare\nheated by the infrared in sunlight and\nthe oxidation proceeds rapidly under\nthe effect of this heating.\n\nFacility.\n_JP\n\n77\n\nNew\n\nResults\n\nfrom\n\na Lunar\n\nCore\n\nAn Apollo\n15 lunar core recently\nanalyzed in detail has revealed some\ninteresting\nresults.\nThis\ncore\n(15010/15011 ) is a double-drive\ntube\nthat was taken by Astronauts Dave\nScott and Jim Irwin at Station 9A about\n20 meters from the rim of Hadley Rille\n(fig. 1). The 55-centimeter-long\ncore\nwas carefully\ndissected,\ndescribed,\nand photographed\nat JSC, a process\nwhich took nearly 2 years. Samples\nfrom the core were then analyzed by\nprincipal\ninvestigators\nat JSC and\nelsewhere by a variety of techniques\nand instruments.\n\nThe dissection revealed nine separate\nstratigraphic\nunits which\ndiffered\nslightly in color or texture. The core\ncontained\na number of small rocks,\nespecially\ntoward the bottom of the\ncore (fig. 2).\nThis core has several interesting\nfeatures related to its sampling location near the edge of the rille. Most of\nthe rock, mineral, and glass fragments\nare derived from basalt, reaffirming the\ninterpretation\nthat basalt flows underlie much of the site and comprise the\nedges of the rille. The largest rock\nfragment shown in figure 2, for example, is a basalt fragment.\nHowever,\n\nfragments of highland rocks are present throughout\nthe core and are\nsurprisingly\nslightly\nmore abundant\ntoward the bottom.\nFigure 2 also\nshows a whitish fragment which is\nprobably an anorthositic breccia. Such\nfragments are probably derived from\nthe Appenine Front some 4 kilometers\naway from the core site.\nThe soil in the core is relatively\ncoarse-grained\nwith a mean grain size\nof about 95 micrometers; it is slightly\ncoarser toward the bottom. The ferromagnetic resonance profile for the\ncore reveals that whereas the core is\nslightly more mature in its upper half\n\nFigure 2.---Photograph of the bottom of\npartly dissected core 15010/15011. Three\nrock fragments are visible. The lowermost is\napparently an anorthositic breccia; the\nother two are basalts.\n\nFigure 1.--Map of the Apollo 15 site showing the location of the four cores. When\ncompleted, analyses of these cores will\nprovide three-dimensional control for the\nApollo 15 re _olith.\n\nSTA\n\n.,o,\n_R_\n\n_15010115011\n\nAPOLLO\n\n15 CORES\n\n/ST OEOROE\\ "_--\',_.-"O_.l\nkm\n\n78\n\nCRATER\n\nSTA\n\n6\n\n(fig. 3), it does not have the weltdeveloped\nmaturity profile commonly\nfound in other lunar cores. This limits\nthe time the core material was in place\nto 100 million years or less. Furthermore, rare-gas data reveal that the\ncore does not have a significant\nproduction profile of cosmogenic species\nsuch as 3helium,\n21neon, 3aarg on,\n8Okrypton, and _26xenon. This means\nthat the core material was not irradiated by cosmic rays for very long, certainly no longer than 1O0 million years.\nYet individual samples from the core\nwere exposed to cosmic rays for 300\nmillion years or more. This indicates\nthat most of the core material was\npreirradiated\nsomewhere\nnear the\nlunar surface before the material was\nincorporated into the stratigraphic section sampled by the core. The formation of the present stratigraphic\nsequence occurred less than 1O0 million\nyears ago, which is a short time compared to the age of the basaltic\nbedrock\n(approximately\n3.3 billion\nyears).

Different crystal\ntypes affect the liquid in different\nways, influencing\nthe minerals that\nlater crystallize from the liquid. For instance, the mineral olivine, which is\nmagnesian,\ndepletes\nthe liquid\nin\nmagnesium and subsequent minerals\nare less rich in magnesium than they\nwould otherwise\nhave been. Even\nthough the olivine may no longer be\nseen, its effects can be inferred by inspecting\nthe rocks that accumulate\nfrom the later minerals. Magnesium is\na major element and olivine is a major\nphase, but the same kinds of effects\ncan be seen for trace elements and\ntrace\nminerals.\nThe\nratios\nof\ntitanium/samarium\nand scandium/\nsamarium have been used as tracers\nof the history of lunar-highlands\nigneous rocks. Samarium is not easily\nabsorbed\ninto any major minerals;\nhence, as crystallization proceeds, its\nabundance\nin the liquid increases. If\nilmenite crystallizes, then the titanium\nin the liquid decreases\nand rocks\naccumulating\nlater\nhave\nlow\ntitanium/samarium\nratios.\nScandium/samarium\nis a similar indicator of\npyroxene crystallization.\n\nbreccias (the impact-produced\nbroken\nand melted rocks that dominate the\nhighlands) suggest that they are a very\nsubstantial\npart of the crust. These\nrocks are more magnesian than are\nthe plagioclase-rich\nones (anorthosites) and hence are known as the\n"magnesium-suite"\nrocks. To understand the crust and its evolution, it is\nnecessary to understand the relationships between\nall the rocks. The\ntitanium/samarium\nratios of the rocks\n(fig. 1) show that the anorthosites\ncrystallized from a liquid from which ilmenite had not crystallized.\nHowever,\nthe magnesium-suite\nrocks\ncrystallized from liquids from which ilmenite\nhad at some time\nbeen\nremoved. This makes the origin of the\nmagnesium-suite\nrocks\ncomplex\nbecause ilmenite\nis a mineral that\ncrystallizes only at an advanced stage\nof the crystallization of a silicate liquid;\nyet all the other characteristics\nof the\nmagnesium-suite\nrocks suggest that\nthey crystallized\nat an early stage of\ncrystallization\n(including the fact that\nthey are rich in magnesium) and certainly earlier than the anorthosites.\n\nFigure\n\n1 .--The\n\ntitanium/samarium\n\n10000\n\ni\n\nratios\n\nThe conclusion\nis that the magnesium-suite\nrocks\nand\nthe\nanorthosites\nare not very closely related, but that the magnesium-suite\nrocks are related\nto each\nother\nbecause they have the same peculiar\ncharacteristic\nof low titanium/\nsamarium,\nunlike\nterrestrial,\nmeteoritic,\nor other lunar rocks. The\nscandium/samarium\nratios show a\nsimilarly\nperplexing\ndepletion\nof\npyroxene\nin the magnesium-suite\nparent liquid.\n\nBecause the magnesium-suite\nrocks\nare too dense to have floated over a\nsilicate\nliquid, the formation of the\nlunar crust must have involved a more\ncomplex origin than simply the flotation of rocks over a magma "ocean"\n(although this probably did happen to\nproduce the anorthosites).\nThere are\nseveral\npossibilities,\nbut none yet\nseem to be quite right.

This model\nwas proposed in 1967 by VanSchmus\nand Wood and assumes a progressive\nthermal metamorphism\n(type 6 being\nthe most highly metamorphosed)\nto\naccount for the textural and chemical\nvariations.\nStony\nmeteorites\nwithout\nchondrules\nare termed achondrites.\nThe achondrites are generally divided\ninto two groups based on calcium content. Calcium-poor\nachondrites\ninclude\nthe aubrites,\ndiogenites,\nchassignites,\nand ureilites.\nThe\ncalcium-rich\nachondrites\ninclude\neucrites,\nhowardites,\nangrites,\nand\nnakhlites.\nThe shergottites\nare considered\nto be eucrites\nby some\nresearchers but the majority believe\nthat they are sufficiently distinct to retain the term shergottite.\n\nTypes in the Antarctic\nCollections\n\nDuring the past year, meteorites with\nmasses greater than 150 grams collected by the joint Japanese-American Antarctic expeditions for the field\nseasons of 1977-78 and 1978-79 have\nbeen classified at the JSC and at the\nSmithsonian\nInstitution.\nTraditionally,\nmeteorites have been classified in the\nbroadest sense by the amounts of\nmetal and silicate they contain. Thus,\nirons are composed chiefly of metallic\nnickel-iron but may contain silicate inclusions. Stones are composed mainly\nof silicates but may contain more than\n24 percent nickel-iron. The stones can\nbe divided into two groups based on\ntheir\ntextures:\nchondrites\nand\nachondrites.\nChondrites\ncontain\nchondrules,\nwhich are spherical\nto\nsubspherical bodies composed mainly\nof silicates, and range in size from less\nthan 0.1 millimeter to more than 0.5\ncentimeter.\nChondrites are classified\nby their chemistries and mineralogies.\nThe amphoterites\n(LL group)\nare\nregarded as a subgroup of the olivinehypersthene chondrites\n(L group) by\nsome researchers, but others regard\nthem as a separate type of ordinary\nchondrite\nwith equal stature to the\nolivine-bronzite\nchondrites\n(H group)\nand\nthe\nolivine-hypersthene\n\nFigure\n\n1 .--Distribution\n\nof Antarctic\n\nmeteorite\n\nThe complete classified collection of\nthe 1977-78 season consists of 103\nmeteorites\nincluding\n7 irons, 2 carbonaceous chondrites, 5 achondrites,\n\ncollections.\n\n2,2\nr-] 1977\n28\nO9\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nH\n\n1978\n\n24\n20\n\nL\n\n12\n\nH\n\n8\n4\n0\n6\n\n5\nPETROLOGIC\n\n4\nTYPE\n\n3\n\n49 H-group chondrites, and 39 L- or\nLL-group\nchondrites.\nAchondrites\nrepresent\nfive individual\nclassifications: mesosiderite,\nureilite, diogenite,\neucrite, and winonaite.

The petrologic type 6 specimens\nare dominated\nby the L-group\nchondrites, and the petrologic types 4\nand 5 meteorites are overwhelmingly\nrepresented\nby\nthe\nH-group\nchondrites.\nBecause of the distinct\ngroupings and similarities between intraspecimen\nand interspecimen\ncomparisons, it is believed that the samples represent\na limited number of\nfalls.\n\nThe 1979-80 collection\nis comprised\nof 83 meteorites including 1 iron, 75\nchondrites,\nand 7 achondrites.\nThe\nchondrites\nare estimated\nto range in\nmass from tess than 20 grams to more\nthan 3 kilograms. The iron has a mass\nof approximately\n10 kilograms and is\nknown to have silicate inclusions that\nare believed\nto be of orthopyroxene\ncomposition.\nOf the seven achondrites, one is classified\nas a eucrite,\none as a howardite, and three as either\npolymict eucrites or howardites.

It will certainly be of great interest to the scientific\ncommunity\nbecause much speculation\nabout its\norigin still remains.\n81\n\nYoung Meteorites\nEarthlike\nParent\n\nfrom an\n\nMeteorites have long been objects of\ncuriosity. Centuries ago, stones that\nfell from the sky created sufficient interest among observers to ensure their\npreservation as evidence of a poorly\nunderstood natural phenomenon.\nOnly\nrelatively\nrecently\nhave scientists\npossessed the analytical\ntools with\nwhich to understand\nthe origins of\nthese visitors from space. As a result of\nintensive\nlaboratory studies,\nit has\nbeen shown that most meteorites are\nboth ancient and primitive. Chemical\nanalysis reveals that the majority of\nstony meteorites are undifferentiated;\ni.e., the relative abundances\nof nonvolatile elements in these meteorites\nare close to the relative abundances of\nthe same elements in the Sun. Such\nmeteorites\nare said to be primitive.\nRadiometric\ndating of primitive\nundifferentiated\nmeteorites\nshows that\nthey are nearly 4.6 billion years old.\nMost other meteorites and some lunar\nrocks also are about 4.6 billion years\nold. Although no terrestrial rock is this\nold, "model ages" can be calculated\nfor the bulk Earth; such ages are also\nabout 4.6 billion years old. Thus, 4.6\nbillion years is believed to be the age\nof the solar system.\nMeteorites\ntell us more about the\nsolar\nsystem\nthan just\nits age,\nhowever.\nEach meteorite\ntype was\nformed by a specific set of processes.\nSome\nof the\nmost\ninteresting\nmeteorites\nare\nthe\nbasaltic\nachondrites. They are called basaltic\nbecause\nthey are texturally\nand\nchemically\nsimilar\nto terrestrial\nbasalts, which\nare solidified\nmelts\nfrom\nthe interior\nof the Earth.\nSpacecraft exploration has shown that\nbasalts occur on the surface of the\nMoon and on the other terrestrial\nplanets as well as on Earth. Because\nbasalts are melt products from the interiors of planets, their chemical compositions vary with the variations in the\nbulk composition\nof their\nparent\nplanets. The ages of basalts are also\ncontrolled\nby the properties of their\nparent planets. Thus, large planets\nthat contain large quantities of heatproducing\nelements\nand that cool\nslowly have produced\nbasalts over\nmost of the solar system history. Earth,\nMars, and Venus are examples of such\nplanets.\nSmaller\nplanetary\nbodies\n82\n\nhave cooled enough so that basaltic\nvolcanism has ceased. The Moon is an\nexample of such an object; basaltic\nvolcanism on the Moon ceased about\n3 billion\nyears ago. Most basaltic\nachondrites\nhave ages of about 4.6\nbillion\nyears,\nshowing\nthat their\nparents were hot near the beginning of\nthe solar system\nbut cooled\nvery\nrapidly. The early heat source remains\na matter\nof some\nspeculation;\nhowever, rapid cooling is consistent\nwith the widely accepted concept that\nthe asteroid\nparents\nfor these\nmeteorites are small planetary bodies.\nSome basaltic\nachondrites,\nthe\nnakhlites and the shergottites,\nhave\nyoung radiometric ages. Identification\nof their parent planets remains a tantalizing puzzle. Young basalt ages normally imply a large planet. But which\nplanet, and how were rocks hurled\nfrom its surface into space so that they\nmight later fall on Earth? The natural\ntransport of rocks from the surface of\none large planet to the surface of\nanother seems so improbable\nthat\nmost scientists have sought other explanations.\nA favorite alternative\nhypothesis is that the meteorites were\n\nFigure\n\n1 .---Geochronological\n\nresults\n\nreally formed about 4.6 billion years\nago, like other achondrites, and have\nsimply had their radiometric\nclocks\nreset by the heat accompanying\nasteroid\nor meteoroid\ncollisions\nin\nspace.\n\nWork directed\ntowards solving\nthe\nnakhlite/shergottite\npuzzle is currently\nunderway at the JSC and elsewhere.\nThe emphasis\nhas been\non the\nshergottites,\nonly two of which were\nknown to exist at the beginning of the\nstudy. One, called Shergotty, fell in India in 1865; another, called Zagami,\nfell in Nigeria in 1962. A third shergotrite-like\nmeteorite was found in the\nAntarctic\nin 1977; it is called Allan\nHills 77005. A fourth shergottite-like\nmeteorite has recently been identified\namong meteorites found in the Antarctic in 1979; it is called Elephant\nMoraine A79001.

The slope of the\nline labeled TBABI = 4.8 AE is close to\nthat expected for a "normal" meteorite\nwith an age of -- 4.6 billion years (1\nAE = 1 billion years).\nAges obtained for the shergottites\nby the 4\xc2\xb0argon/39argon and samariumneodymium\nmethod\n(two\nother\nradiometric techniques) are older than\nthe rubidium-strontium\nages. These\nresults, in addition to petrographic evidence of shock metamorphism\nof the\nmineral phases, strongly suggest that\nthe rubidium-strontium\nage has been\nreset by a major collision. This conclusion does not solve the shergottite\npuzzle,\nhowever.\nThe\nsamariumneodymium\nmodel\nages\nof the\nshergottites\nrange from 2.8 to 3.6\nbillion years. These model ages give\nan upper limit to the time since the\nconcentration\nratio of two rare earth\nelements, samarium and neodymium,\nwas\nlast significantly\nchanged.\nBecause the chemical\nbehaviors of\nsamarium and neodymium\nare very\nsimilar,\nit is extremely\ndifficult\nto\nchange\nthe samarium/neodymium\nratio of rocks except by special igneous processes. Thus, if the shergottires were really 4.6 billion years old,\nthey should have 4.6 billion years\nsamarium-neodymium\nmodel ages.\nThus, whereas the rubidium-strontium\nages clearly suggest a "metamorphic"\nresetting,\nthe samarium-neodymium\nmodel ages also clearly suggest a\n"young" igneous event. Exactly when\nthe igneous event occurred is not presently known with certainty. A lower\nlimit of 6 X 108 years ago is obtained\nfrom samarium-neodymium\nanalyses\nof minerals\nfrom\nthe Shergotty\nmeteorite.\nGeochemical\nconsiderations suggest that the "whole\nrock"\nsamarium-neodymium\nage of the\nthree analyzed\nshergottites,\nabout\n1.35 billion years, is both an upper\nlimit and a good approximation\nof the\nshergottite age. This interpretation will\nbe strengthened\nif analyses of the\nnewly recovered shergottite also yield\nthe same whole rock age. Perhaps\ncoincidentally,\nthe nakhlites also have\nbeen dated as being 1.3 billion years\nold. In the case of the nakhlites, the\n\nsame age has been obtained by the\nrubidium-strontium,\nsamariumneodymium, and 4\xc2\xb0argon/39argon techniques. The nakhlite age must be considered as representing\nan igneous\nevent.\n\nscientific consideration,\nparticularly in\nview\nof a remarkable\nchemical\nsimilarity\nbetween\nthe shergottites\nand the Martian soil analyzed during\ntile Viking missions.\n\nThe most direct interpretation\nof the\nradiometric age data for the nakhlites\nand shergottites is that igneous melts\nwere formed on a planetary\nbody\nabout 1 billion years ago. The only\nknown objects that produced melts of\nabout the right age and composition\nare Earth and Mars. The volcanism\npresently\nobserved\non the Jovian\nsatellite\nIo is too sulfur-rich\nto be\nlinked to the achondrites. Although the\nnakhlites\nand shergottites\nhave\nchemical\naffinities\nto terrestrial\nbasalts,\nthey cannot\nbe terrestrial\nrocks because they have been exposed in space for about 2 million\nyears as shown by the presence of\nnuclear reaction products formed by\nexposure to cosmic rays. Indeed, the\n"cosmic-ray\nexposure"\nages of the\nmeteorites\nare typical\nfor stone\nmeteorites,\nsuggesting\norigin in the\nregion of the asteroid belt, i.e., between Mars and Jupiter. The three\npossible\nalternative\norigins\nare as\nfollows.\n1. A giant "asteroid"\nwas totally\ndisrupted less than 1 billion years ago.\n2. The meteorites were somehow\nblown\noff the Martian\nsurface,\npresumably by the impact of a giant\nmeteoroid on Mars.\n3. The meteorites\ncame\nfrom\nPhobos\nor Deimos,\nthe Martian\nsatellites.\nHypothesis\n1 is ad hoc and not\neasily\ntested.\nHypothesis\n3 is\ndynamically\nmore plausible than hypothesis\n2; furthermore,\nthe Viking\nmission has shown that a significant\nportion of Phobos has been blasted\naway by a single meteorite impact. A\nPhobos origin for the nakhlites and\nshergottites would only push the problem back one step as Phobos is far too\nsmall to have produced\nlate-stage\nmelts. Perhaps tiny Phobos is a "late"\nsatellite of Mars, having been ejected\nfrom and subsequently\ncaptured by\nthe parent planet. In this case, hypotheses 2 and 3 merge, suggesting\nthat Mars is the ultimate origin of\nnakhlites\nand shergottites.\nThis\npossibility\nis now receiving\nserious\n83\n\nMoon\n\nRock\n\nCuration\n\nThe prime physical\nlegacy of the\nApollo Program is the lunar sample\ncollection.

The truth must\nlie between these two. The objective\nof the ongoing research has been to\ndefine the history of the separation of\nmass from the mantle to form the continental crust.

This is illustrated for\nArchean rocks in the following argument.\n\nof Earth\'s\n\ncontinental\n\nAlthough typical Archean rocks yield\nages of 2700 to 2500 million years,\nmany rocks have been discovered during the past two decades that yield\nages as old as 3750 million years.\nThese older rocks have been discovered by the skill of geochronologists that enables\nthem\nto "see\nthrough"\nthe 2700- to 2500-millionyear event to an earlier event in a\nrock\'s history. There are two alternative models (fig. 2) to explain ages\ngreater than 3000 million years. In\nmodel A, nuclei of continent material\nexisted at 3750 million years and the\ncommon 2700- to 2500-million-year\nages represent later additions of continental material. In model B, most of\nthe 2700- to 2500-million-year-old\nterrain existed at 3750 million years\nand the younger age represents a time\nwhen\nthat terrain\nwas thermally\nmodified.\nIn a modeI-B\nworld,\na\ngeochronologist\nwould be able to discover pre-3000-million-year-old\nrocks\nin most places in the Archean that\nwere investigated\nin detail.\nIn a\nmodeI-A\nworld,\ngeochronologists\nwould expect to discover pre-3000million-year-old\nrocks in only a few\nplaces in the Archean terrain. The experience of geochronologists\nis that, in\nmost Archean\nregions\nstudied\nin\ndetail, pre-3000-million-year-old\nages\nwere discovered.\nThis suggests that\nmodel B is correct. Thus, the 2700- to\n2500-million-year\nevent\nis one of\nmodification\nof existing\ncontinental\nmaterial and not one of separation of\ncontinental\nmaterial from the mantle.\n\ncrust.\n\nFigure\nAFTER\n\n>-b\'h\nL_Z\nZO\n\nGASTIL,\n\n1960\n\n2.--Two\n\ning event\n\nalternative\n\nsequence\n\nmodels\n\ndisplay-\n\nages.\n\nO\'<\n\n_z\nLLc_:\nLJJ L,J\n\n,;"L2k,\nP_\n\nC_L,J\n,,_ ,"-,\n..Jw\nuJLO\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\nAGE (MILLION\n\n2000\nYEARS)\n\n2500\n\n3000\n3\n\n1\nEVENT\n\n4\n\n5\n\nSEQUENCE\n\n85\n\nRole of Anorthositic\nEarly Evolution\nCrusts\n\nRocks\n\nin\n\nof Planetary\n\nSignificant contributions to the growth\nof early planetary crusts are made by\nextrusive and intrusive melts. These\nmelts generally are derived from mantle material and provide the major constraint for the thermal and chemical\nhistory of the mantle during early\ncrustal evolution. Formation of melts\napparently occurs on all planets as indicated by samples from the Moon\nand Earth and as interpreted\nfrom\nremotely\nsensed\ndata from Mars,\nVenus, and Mercury. On Earth, the occurrence\nof early crustal rocks is\nlimited only to the Precambrian shield\nareas of the continents.\nThe earliest\npreserved rocks derived from melts\nare the Archean volcanic and associated anorthositic\nintrusive rocks that\nformed primarily over the period between 3.7 and 2.7 billion years ago\nreaching a peak at about 2.7 billion\nyears.\n\nThe work of the past year indicates\nthat anorthositic\nrocks are common\nin Archean\nterrains\nalthough\nvolumetrically\nminor. At least seven\nanorthositic\ncomplexes occur in the\nSuperior Province of the Canadian\nShield and similar units occur in similar settings in Archean terrains of other\ncontinents. Nearly all of the complexes\nhave an unusual\nand distinctive\nfeldspar\ntexture in the anorthositic\nrocks in which ptagioclase occurs as\nroughly equidimensional\ngrains ranging from pea to grapefruit size (fig. 1).\nIn some cases, various grain sizes are\nmixed;\nin others,\ngrain\nsize is\nhomogeneous.\nThis texture is distinctly different from that of younger\nrocks in which plagioclase commonly\noccurs in elongate laths and suggests\na significantly\ndifferent history.\n\nFigures\n1 .---Large\nequidimensional\ncrystals\nin anorthositic\nrocks.\n(a) Golfball-size\ncrystals\nfrom the Bad Vermilion\nLake intrusion.\n(b) Grapefruit-size\ncrystals\nfrom\na\nthick sill in Manitoba.\n\nTABLE\n\nI.--AVERAGE\n\nStudies have demonstrated an unusual\nand consistent\naverage composition\nfor several Archean anorthositic\ncomplexes (table 1) suggesting that they\nformed from either an unusual source\nmaterial or as cumulate complements\nof associated volcanic sequences that\nare derived from more typical mantle\nmaterials. If the former is true, then the\nunusual source material may represent\nheterogeneities\nin the mantle caused\nby very early separation of the Earth\'s\ncrust and mantle.

One\ninteresting\ndifference\nwas that the\nroles of pyroxene and plagioclase\nin\nthe texture were reversed in some\nrocks. In terrestrial basalts, certain textures are defined by a fretwork of\nplagioclase\nlaths enclosing\neither\nglass or pyroxene (intersertal\nto intergranular).\nIn some Apollo\n11\nbasalts, pyroxene formed the fretwork\nand plagioclase\nwas interstitial\nor\npoikilitic\n(enclosed\nthe pyroxene).\nThis reversal is a direct result of a near\nreversal in the model amounts\nof\npyroxene\nand plagioclase\nin the\nbasalt.\nSome Apollo 12 and 15 basalts are\nporphyritic basalts; i.e., large crystals\nof pyroxene\nand/or\nplagioclase\nenclosed in a finer grained matrix of\nmore plagioclase and pyroxene. This\nwas an important difference from the\nApollo-11\nbasalts\nbecause\nphenocrysts\ndefinitely\nindicated\na more\ncomplex\npreeruption\nhistory for the\nbasaltic magma, much like basalts on\nEarth. The phenocrysts, however, were\nnot like those commonly seen in terrestrial basalts. They were skeletal to\ndendritic\nand showed complex\nand\nextensive\nchemical\nzoning.\nSuch\nfeatures were not compatible with the\nslow growth typically associated with\nphenocrysts at depth in the Earth, but\nrather implied that the crystals grew\nrapidly on or near the lunar surface.\n\nExperiments conducted in the experimental petrology\nlaboratory at JSC\nconfirmed\nthat the lunar porphyritic\nbasalts did indeed crystallize\ncompletely at or near the lunar surface.\nThe phenocrysts did not represent a\npreeruption phase of the magma history. Continuation of those initial experiments has provided further insight into\nthe histories of lunar basalts and now\ninto terrestrial basalts as well.\nOne of the most important results of\nthis continued research is the effect of\nheterogeneous\nnucleation on the subsequent textural development.\nWhen\ncooled at the same rates from a complete liquid, terrestrial basalts do not\ncrystallize\nas readily\nas do lunar\nbasalts. This is another manifestation\nof the chemical differences\nbetween\nthe two groups of basalts. The lunar\nbasalts\nare far less viscous\nand\ntherefore\ncrystallize\nmore readily.\nThus, it is for terrestrial basalts that the\npresence of heterogeneous\nnuclei is\nso important. These nuclei need not\nbe large and in most cases are below\nthe resolution\nof the ordinary\npetrographic\nmicroscope.\nTheir presence\ncan\nbe strongly\nargued,\nhowever, based on the textures observed in the experiments.\nPlagioclase,\neven though\nit is\nusually the dominant mineral in terrestrial basalts, is the most reluctant\nmineral to nucleate.\nIn the basalt\nstudied most extensively, olivine is the\nfirst mineral to appear on cooling\n(1198 \xc2\xb0 C), followed\nby plagioclase\n(1187 \xc2\xb0 C) and pyroxene (1133 \xc2\xb0 C). If\nthe basalt is melted above the liquidus\nat, e.g., 1215 \xc2\xb0 C, so that all crystals\n(whether visible or not) have melted\n\nFigure 1.--Basalt melted above the liquidus\nso that all crystals have melted and then\ncooled at 2\xc2\xb0 C/hr, resulting in a product\ncontaining olivine and pyroxene.\n\nand then cooled at 2\xc2\xb0 C/hr, the product\ncontains only olivine and pyroxene in a\nmatrix of glass (fig. 1). The plagioclase\ndid not crystallize\nand its chemical\ncomponents are still contained in the\nglass. If the basalt is melted at a lower\ntemperature so that not all the olivine\nand plagioclase\nhave melted before\ncooling is initiated at the same 2 \xc2\xb0 C\n/hr, the resulting\ntexture\nis very\ndifferent\n(fig. 2). The plagioclase\nis\nwell crystallized into elongate crystals\nthat are somewhat\nskeletal.\nThe\nplagioclase\nforms a fretwork\nand,\nbecause the pyroxene\nis very finegrained, the texture is intersertal. To\nobtain such radically different textures\nat the same cooling rate helps to explain the greater variety of textures in\nterrestrial basalts compared\nto those\non the Moon. This phenomena\nwill\nalso help explain the existence of very\nthick basalt flows on Earth that have\nfiner-grained\ntextures than they should\nhave based on cooling rates that can\nbe predicted\nfrom thermal-cooling\nmodels. Either a very high density of\npreexisting nuclei or a total absence of\nnuclei (should they be reluctant\nto\nnucleate)\nwill result in fine-grained\ntextures at slow cooling rates.\n\nThe study\nof the crystallization\nbehavior of rock magmas is continuing\nwith the hope that at some future time\nthe histories of rocks can be read from\ntheir textures; i.e., the physical path\nfrom their birth to their current resting\nplaces as well as their chemical evolution.\n\nFigure 2.mBasalt\nperature so that\nplagioclase have\nresulting in a very\n\nmelted at a lower temnot all the olivine and\nmelted before cooling,\ndifferent texture.\n\n87\n\nAntarctic\nDry Valleys:\nAnalog of the Martian\n\nTerrestrial\nSurface\n\nThe Dry Valleys of Antarctica probably\nrepresent the best terrestrial analog of\nthe surface of Mars. The Dry Valleys\nare similar to the Martian surface in the\nfollowing\nmanner: low temperatures\nand humidities,\ndiurnal freeze-thaw\ncycles (even during daylight hours),\nlow annual precipitations,\ndesiccating\nwinds,\noxidizing\nenvironment,\nhigh\nsublimation\nand evaporation\nrates,\nhigh-radiation\nenvironments,\ntow\nmagnetic fields, absence of higher life\nforms, and irregular distribution\nand\ntow abundances\nof soil microorganisms. The Viking landers have shown\nthat the surface of Mars is similar to\nthose surfaces observed\nin the Dry\nValleys of Antarctica (fig 1).\n\nIn order to better study the properties\nof planetary regoliths, a large suite of\nsoils, rocks, and cores was collected\nfrom Wright and Taylor Dry Valleys located in southern Victoria Land, Antarctica. The suite of samples was collected using techniques developed for\ncollection of the lunar samples. Frozen\nsamples were returned to JSC and\ntheir initial characterization\nis underway in the geoscience laboratories of\nthe Planetary\nand Earth Sciences\nDivision.\n\nFigure 1.--Surface observed in the Dry Valleys of Antarctica.\n\n88\n\nPreliminary findings indicate that the\nsamples collected from regions surrounding evaporite ponds show sulfur\nabundances similar to those observed\non the Mars surface at both the Viking\n1 and 2 landing sites. The soils are\nenriched in sulfur (up to 4 to 6 percent) immediately\nbeneath\nthe surface and depleted above and below\nthe enrichment\nzone. It is believed\nthat the enrichment\nin sulfur represents deposition of evaporite minerals\nduring\nthe percolation\nof ground\nwaters toward the surfaces. Similar\nprocesses are believed to occur on the\nMartian surface resulting in the salt\ndeposits\nobserved\nby the landers.\nThus, there is good reason to expect\nthat further study of the collected suite\nof Dry Valley soils will provide important information that will assist in the\nunderstanding\nof the data returned\nfrom the Viking landers.\n\nThe Chemistry\nMicrometeoroids\n\nof\n\nA significant dust population exists in\nthe inner solar system, prominently\nmanifested, for example, by the zodiacal cloud, visible meteoroid showers,\nand small-scale\nimpact phenomena\non lunar surface materials. The origin\nof these particles is of great planetary\ninterest and current studies include\ntime-of-flight\nspacecraft experiments,\nastronomical\nobservations,\nlunar\nmicrocrater\nanalysis, and dynamical\nstudies relating to the evolution of their\norbits.\n\nThe planetary\ninterest is based primarily on the fact that a significant\nfraction of these particles originated\nfrom comets.\nAnother\nprominent\nsource area may be the asteroid belt\nand a small fraction may even be of interstellar\norigin. Each of the above\nsources may yield materials that are\nmineralogically\nand chemically\ndifferent from all other extraterrestrial\nmaterials\ncurrently\navailable\nfor\nanalysis in terrestrial laboratories.\nAlthough exact proportions of these\nthree sources in the makeup of the interplanetary dust population are presently unknown, it is generally agreed\nthat comets must be the major contributor. On close solar approach, comets release gases as well as solids; the\nsolids are manifested in "dust tails."\nBecause comets primarily consist of\nfrozen volatiles, they must have originated\nat different\npressure/temperature\nconditions\nduring\nsolar\nnebula condensation\nthan did the inner planets, which are characterized\nby relatively refractory elemental composition.\nTherefore,\ncomparison\nof\ncometary "solids" with materials from\nthe inner planets becomes fundamental in defining boundary conditions for\nthe early solar system.\n\nThe primary objective of the chemistry\nof micrometeoroids\nexperiment\nis to\ncharacterize\nthe chemical\ncomposition of interplanetary\ndust. Secondary\nobjectives focus on the total particle\nflux and some selected physical properties such as the bulk density and\nshape of individual particles.\nGold surfaces\ntotaling\napproximately 10 square feet will be exposed\nto the natural micrometeoroid\nenvironment onboard the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) (fig. 1). Upon\nimpact, the dust particles will create a\nhypervelocity\ncrater and remnants of\nthe projectile will reside in the crater\nbottom. Upon return to Earth, these\nprojectile remnants will be analyzed\nby a variety of microanalytical\ntechniques. The primary reasons for using\ngold as a collector surface consist of\nthe requirements to have a high-purity\nsubstrate to maximize\nthe signal-tonoise ratio during the analytical\ninvestigations and to have a chemically\n\ninert substrate. Furthermore,\na substrate material that is not an important\nelement in cosmochemical\nmodeling\nand meteorite\nstudies\nhad to be\nselected. Finally, a ductile material retains proiectile remnants much more\nefficiently than do brittle substances.\nFor an anticipated\nexposure time of\nabout 15 months, a total of approximately\n50 microimpacts\nare expected, ranging in size from 20 to 100\nmicrometers\nin diameter; the projectile remnants\nmay be as small as\n10 -_\xc2\xb0 to 10 -_2 grams. They will be\nanalyzed\nprimarily\nwith\nscanning\nelectron microscopes and energy-dispersive X-ray techniques.\nAssembly\nof the experiment\nis\ncompleted. Parts of the flight acceptance tests were accomplished\nand the\nexperiment\nshould\nsoon be flightrated. The Long Duration Exposure\nFacility launch is presently scheduled\nfor late 1984.\n\nFigure 1.---Schematic layout of the chemistry of micrometeoroids experiment. A clamshell-type\narrangement is used to open and close the collector doors that house the gold plates. One\nclamshell is illustrated in an open position; the second is in a closed position. Electronic sequencers will initiate opening and closing of the doors a few days after Shuttle deployment and\na few days before redocking for retrieval. This assures maximum protection from various contaminants during ground handling, launch, deployment, and retrieval. Part of one opened door\nshows rows of small collectors made for experimental purposes. These collectors consist of\nhigh-purity graphite, aluminum, beryllium, and various plastic products.\n\n89\n\nRemote Sensing of Lunar Rock\nComposition\nby Infrared\nMeasurement\nThe existence\nof weak reststrahlen\nbands\nin the 8- to 14-micrometer\nspectrum of the Moon was demonstrated during the previous reporting\nyear.\nThis past year, additional\nmeasurements\nwere made to verify\nthe results and to develop improved\nmethods for the detection of the weak\nbands.\n\nThe best technique was found to be a\ndifferential\nmeasurement.\nThe\ndifference\nspectrum\nwas measured\nbetween two lunar sites when the\nlocal lunar Sun angle was such that\nthey were at the same calculated temperature.\nIn this\nway,\nspectral\n\ndifferences\nbetween\nthe two sites\nwere emphasized.\nThe difference spectrum between\nthe central peak of Tycho and the\nApollo 1t site is shown in figure 1,\nalong with a laboratory spectrum of a\nfeldspar-rich lunar soil sample.\nApollo\n11 was chosen\nas a\nreference site because the old glassrich powder at this site should have\nfew, if any, spectral features. Tycho is\na relatively\nfresh crater and young\ncrystalline\nrocks should be exposed\nthere. Hence, most of the structure in\nthe difference spectrum is assumed to\nbe from Tycho.\nThis lunar difference spectrum was\nmeasured at a spectral resolution (1\ncentimeter -1 ) high enough to permit\nthe lunar continuum\nspectrum to be\nseen\nbetween\nthe water\nlines.\nHowever, ozone lines are not resolved\n\nFigure\n\n1 .---Spectrum\n\nof\n\ndifference\n\nbetween\n\ntwo\n\nat 1 centimeter -_ and the region\naround 1050 centimeters-_\nis completely\nscreened\nby atntospheric\nozone.\nOf particular\ninterest\nin this\nspectrum is the weak band near 820\ncentimeters -_. This band is not found\nin bulk samples of feldspar but does\nappear in feldspar powders when the\nparticle size is reduced below approximately 50 micrometers.\n\nThus, the lunar infrared spectra are\ndetermined not only by mineral composition but also by particle size. More\nlaboratory and theoretical work on the\nemission\nspectra\nof powdered\nminerals\nis needed\nbefore\nlunar\nspectra of this kind can be fully interpreted.\n\nlunar\n\nsites.\n\n2.0\n\n1.8\n\n1.6\nARONSON\n\netal.\n\n(1979)\n\n1.4\n\n1.2\nDIFFERENTIAL\nRADIANCE\n1.0\nW/cm2ster\n\ncm -1 x 10 6\n.8\n\n.6\n\n.4\n\n.2\n\n0\n750\n\n850\n\n950\nWAVENUMBER\n\n90\n\n1050\nor. -1\n\n1150\n\n1250\n\nAdvanced\n\nHyperthermia\n\nSystem\n\nThe advanced\nhyperthermia\nsystem\nwas a joint program involving NASA\nand the Stehlin Foundation for Cancer\nResearch. The objective of the project\nwas to employ NASA expertise toward\nthe development of an improved heating system that would be used by the\nFoundation in the treatment of certain\ntypes of cancer.\n\nOver the years, it has been demonstrated that hyperthermia\nhas been\nsuccessful in certain cancer therapies.\nTumor cells were found to be more\nsensitive to killing than normal cells\nwhen heat was applied. There is less\nblood flow (for heat transport) in solid\ntumors than in normal tissue, leading\nto greater heating for these tumor\ncells.\nEven partial\nregressions\nof\ntumors were observed\nwhere they\nwere previously\ninoperable.\nThe\nStehlin\nFoundation\nfor Cancer\nResearch has been using hyperthermia over the past 15 years with dramatic results. However, the present\nsystems have several basic disadvantages.\nThe Foundation\nsolicited\nNASA\'s support toward reducing\nor\neliminating\nthese problems. Preliminary background efforts indicated that\n\nFigure\nsystem.\n\n1 ._mall-animal\n\nNASA technology\ncould be applied,\nand the Foundation contributed funds\nfor the purchase\nof the necessary\nhardware.\nIn mid-1978,\nJSC signed\na\nMemorandum\nof Understanding\nwith\nthe Stehlin\nFoundation\nfor Cancer\nResearch at St. Joseph\'s Hospital in\nHouston, Texas, outlining the responsibilities\nof both organizations\nand\ndefining the technical support of JSC.\nThe challenge\nfor JSC engineers\nwas to improve radiofrequency\nheating techniques\nused at the Stehlin\nFoundation.\nThe first step was to\ndevelop a machine for treatment\nof\nsmall animals\n(fig. 1). The smallanimal experimental\nsystem that was\ndeveloped provided valuable data on\napplicator size and shape in addition\nto determining tolerable temperatures.\nA notable feature of the system was\nthe ability to apply up to 50 watts at\nfive\nfrequencies\nfrom\n3 to 30\nmegahertz. The small-animal\nsystem\nalso assisted in establishing\nhuman\nprotocols and studying the effects of\nhyperthermia\nat the cell level.\n\nAfter a year of tests on mice, JSC\ndeveloped an advanced radiofrequency hyperthermia system for treatment\nof humans (fig. 2). Developing\nthe\n\nhuman system involved concern about\nsafe and reliable performance. A team\nof engineers, scientists, and representatives of the JSC Safety, Reliability,\nand Quality Assurance Division helped\nmonitor and review the overall design\nand performance. In January 1980, the\nteam delivered\nan experimental\nhuman\ntreatment\nsystem\nto St.\nJoseph\'s Hospital.\nThe radiofrequency\nsystem\nfor\nhuman\ntreatment\nuses a gradual\nbuildup\nof power to a preselected\nvalue. Two pairs of sequentially driven\nelectrodes provide more concentration\nof radiofrequency\npower at the tumor\nand disperse heat at the skin. A feedback control that allows regulation of\ntemperatures within a specific area to\nan accuracy\nof 0.2 \xc2\xb0 C was also\ndesigned.\nOne area of concern was\nthe heating of the skin below the\nelectrodes\nthat,\nin some\ncases,\ncaused burns. The solution was to circulate temperature-controlled\nwater\nthrough metal tubing soldered onto the\nback of flexible\nelectrodes.\nA data\nprinter added to the system records\ntemperatures\nand power levels as a\nfunction of time. The human radiofrequency system has been used successfully on several cancer patients.\n\nexperimental\nFigure\n\n2.--Advanced\n\nradiofrequency\n\nhyperthermia\n\nsystem\n\nfor treatment\n\no! humans.\n\n91\n\nLinear\nAccelerator\nVestibular\nResearch\n\nfor\n\nHuman\n\nNASA has long been interested\nin\ndeveloping\ntests that assess\nthe\neffects of extended zero-gravity space\nflight\non the vestibular\nsystem of\nflightcrews.\nOn the basis of limited\nflight data and fairly extensive groundbased laboratory data, it is widely accepted that alterations in the otolith\nreceptors of the inner ear are primarily\nresponsible\nfor the vestibular disturbances (including space motion sickness) observed in about 40 percent of\nU.S. astronauts\nand Soviet\ncosmonauts. Therefore, investigations\nof\notolith function, both in the terrestrial\nand weightless\nspace flight environments,\nwill probably\nsignificantly\nenhance our understanding of vestibular function\nin zero gravity.\nSuch\nstudies should also provide insight\nregarding the etiology of space sickness and contribute\nto the development of methods for controlling\nthis\npotentially\ndebilitating\nsyndrome.\nDifferent\ntesting\nprocedures\nhave\nbeen used to apply meaningful stimuli\nto the otolith receptors in man. These\ninclude static tilt, the use of four-pole\nswings, and short periods of altering gforces achieved with parabolic flight.\nAlthough\nmuch can be learned by\nthese techniques, it is of great value to\nuse precisely controlled and programmable linear acceleration.\nIt was with\nthis objective\nin mind\nthat the\nNeurophysiology\nLaboratory\nat JSC\nelected in March 1978 to develop a\nman-rated\nlinear acceleration\ndevice\nfor ground-based\nvestibular research.\n\nDr. David Anderson of the Kresge\nHearing\nResearch\nInstitute\nat the\nUniversity of Michigan, because of his\nexperience in the design and fabrication of moving platform systems for the\nmeasurement of posturat mechanisms\nin man (fig. 1), was contracted\nto\ndesign and develop a human linear\naccelerator for use at JSC The linear\naccelerator system was delivered to\nJSC in June 1979. The system consists of several fundamental\ncomponents. A platform upon which the subject seat or restraint system is located\nrides on two parallel steel rods. The\nplatform\nis connected\nvia a cabledrive assembly to a dc torque motor\nmounted at one end of the frame. The\nsystem incorporates\nan electronic\npackage\nthat contains\na power\ntransformer, a power supply, a servoamplifier, and a controller interface\nfor connection\nto a LSI-11 microprocessor. The frame of the accelerator is 12 feet long and 3 feet wide and\nthe displacement\nof the accelerator\nplatform is approximately 8 feet peakto-peak. It is capable of achieving accelerations up to 0.5g over a frequency\nrange of approximately\n0.18 to 5.0\nhertz. The accelerator\ncan be programed to deliver constant g (ramp),\nsinusoidal or.pseudorandom linear displacement. Following delivery to JSC,\nthe linear\naccelerator\nwas "ruggedized" for use on the KC-135 zerogravity airplane and a number of subject/operator\nsafety devices\nwere\nadded.\nSeveral computer\nprograms\nhave been written for controlling\nthe\ndevice in various operating modes.\n\nActual experimental\nuse of this linear\nacceleration system has been limited\nduring the period from July 1979 to the\npresent. During this time, considerable\neffort was expended in implementing\nthe various system improvements previously defined\nand in conducting\nvarious\nfunctional\ncheckouts.\nThe\nsystem has also been used to conduct\npilot studies to evaluate the effects of\nlinear acceleration on vestibulo-spinal\nreflexes\nin man. Plans for everincreasing use of the system will be\nmade to conduct linear acceleration\nexperiments\nwith humans. These experiments will directly support the implementation\nof Spacelab\n1 Experiment\n1NS-104,\n"Adaptation\nof\nVestibuto-Spinal\nReflex Mechanisms\nDuring Space Flight," as will a similar\nflight experiment\ntentatively planned\nfor the first dedicated\nlife sciences\nSpacelab.\nCertain phases of these\nground-based\nsupport\nexperiments\nwill be conducted\nduring parabolic\nflight, representing the first time that a\nprecision\nlinear acceleration\ndevice\nhas been flown in such an environment. The linear accelerator will also\nbe evaluated for its ability to evoke\nsymptoms of motion sickness. If early\nstudies of this type are successful, the\ndevice will be increasingly\nused to\nevaluate susceptibility\nto motion sickness and to evaluate the efficacy of\nantimotion-sickness\nmedications.\nIn\ngeneral, the human linear acceleration\ndevice has added a significant dimension to the JSC Neurophysiotogy\nLaboratory\'s\nability\nto investigate\nvestibular function, especially otolith\nreceptor function in man.\n\nFigure 1.-.-Linear accelerator system for human vestibular research.\n\n92\n\nNuclear\n\nCardiology\n\nImaging\n\nSystem\nThe multiwire\nproportional\ncounter\n(MWPC) is a modern instrument used\nfor detection of ionizing radiation. It is\nwidely used in research applications\nfor accurate\nhigh-speed\nposition\nmeasurements\nof ionizing radiation. A\nsophisticated\nyet simple technique for\nelectronic\nreadout of this instrument\nwas developed\nfor space research at\nJSC and is currently being adapted for\nmedical\nimaging\napplications.\nThe\nvery high rate capability of this technique, combined\nwith its simplicity\nand low cost, offers the possibility of a\nsignificant advance in certain areas of\nnuclear medicine\nwhere high-speed\nimaging of dynamic radioisotope\ndistributions within the body is required.\nA prototype device currently in operation at JSC has demonstrated\nthis potential and a refined device is nearing\ncompletion and should allow medical\ntesting on human subjects in 1981.\n\nApplications of the JSC multiwire proportional counter in the field of nuclear\ncardiology\nare particularly promising.\nIn the nuclear cardiology technique, a\nradioactive tracer is injected and the\npassage of the tracer through the heart\nis viewed with the MWPC imaging\ndevice. By making\nrapid sequential\nimages that are stored and manipulated by an on-line computer,\nthe\ndevice can obtain measurements\nof\n\nbar at the right. An on-line computer\nwas used to locate the wall perimeter\nof the phantom. Computer software\nhas also been developed to determine\nthe stroke profile (volume versus time\ncorrelation) and ejection fraction. The\naccuracy of these measurements\nhas\nbeen validated\nfor various ejection\nfraction values, pulse rates, and stroke\nvolumes.\nA method was recently developed\nfor production\nof a radionuclide\ngenerator that provides a continuous\nsupply of the short half-life\nisotope\ntantalum-178\n(T_/2 = 9.3 min). This\nmakes possible the application of this\nisotope as a nuclear medicine tracer.\nTantalum-178\nis nearly optimum for\nuse with the multiwire\nproportional\ncounter. Tantalum\'s attractive intrinsic\nfeatures\ninclude\nits short half-life,\nwhich permits repeat studies at short\nintervals, and very low radiation exposure compared with currently used\nclinical radionuclides. A 100-millicurie\ntantalum-178 generator has been produced at JSC from tungsten-178\n(the\ngenerator parent isotope) which was\nfurnished by Lewis Research Center.\nEluent from this generator was used to\nperform the phantom tests.\nIn addition to the MWPC application, tantalum-178\nhas potential application\nfor use with commercially\navailable\nimaging devices\nif interference between its low-energy\nprimary photons\n\n(54 to 65 kiloelectron-\n\nvolts) and its less-abundant\nhighenergy photons can be resolved. In\ncollaboration\nwith Baylor College of\nMedicine,\ngood quality images have\nbeen produced by tantalum-178\nusing\nboth multicrystal\nand Anger cameras.\nThese\ncameras\nare the imaging\ndevices most used in clinical nuclear\ncardiology. The tantalum-178\nstudies\nincluded static and dynamic imaging,\nejection fraction, and wall motion and\nsensitivity\nmeasurements.\nThe quantitative results have been compared\nwith\nthose\nobtained\nusing\ntechnetium-99. Technetium-99\n(half life, 6\nhr) is the commonly used radionuclide\nin clinical angiocardiography\nstudies.\n\nCollaborative\nagreements\nhave been\nmade with E R. Squibb Research Institute and Harvard Medical School to\ntest NASA-produced\ntantalum-178\nto\nimprove the safety, reliability,\nand\nyield of the tungsten-tantalum\ngenerators. These studies will validate the\nuse of tantalum in human studies with\nparticular\nemphasis\non nuclear\nmedicine research uses.\nIt is expected that combined\napplication\nof MWPC\nimaging\ntechnology\nand tantalum-178\nto the\nnuclear cardiology field will open new\nareas of diagnostic capability and improve techniques already being extensively used with existing cameras and\nisotopes.\n\ngreat diagnostic value, such as determination of ventricular stroke volume\nand ejection fraction and observation\nof heart chamber\nwall motion\nirregularities.\nThe dynamic imaging capability of\nthe prototype device has been tested\nusing a cardiac phantom. This phantom was specially designed and constructed at JSC; it consists of a fluidfilled rubber bag with a volume that\ncan be rapidly modulated to simulate\nthe human left ventricle. Tests have\nbeen conducted in which a radioactive\ntracer was injected into the bag, which\nwas pulsed at 60 beats per minute\nfrom a diastolic\nvolume\nof 140\nmilliliters\nto a systolic volume of 0\nmilliliters.\nThe MWPC camera was\nused to produce 16 stop-action views\nof the ,phantom (fig. 1). The radiation\nintensities observed by the camera are\ninterpreted by using the color-coded\n\nFigure\ntracted\ncamera.\n\n1.--The\nMWPC\nand expanded\n(b) Wall\n\ncamera\nthrough\n\nperimeter\n\nproduced\nthese stop-action\nviews\none cycle.\n(a) Radiation\nintensities\n\nof a cardiac\n\nof the phantom\nobserved\nby\n\nas\nthe\n\nit conMWPC\n\nphantom.\n\n93\n\nMobile Biological\nSystem\n\nIsolation\n\ntn January\n1974, a request\nwas\nreceived from the Baylor College of\nMedicine outlining a need for a germfree suit system for use by a 2-1f2year-old child who was afflicted with a\nsevere immunization\ndeficiency\nand\nhad lived in a germ-free carefully constructed room (bubble)\nsince birth.\nThe objective of the ensuing program\nwas to develop a mobile biological\nisolation system for use by patients\nwith\nimmunization\ndeficiency\nor\naplastic anemia or who were undergoing chemical\ntherapy\nor organ\ntransplant, requiring their confinement\nto laminar-flow isolation facilities.\n\nThe mobile biological isolation system\nconsists of a bioisolation unit or suit\nassembly and a pushcart transporter\n(fig. 1) that carries a life support\nsystem. The mobile biological\nisolation system is divided into three subsystems: suit and air supply, mechanical, and electrical power.\nThe suit and pressure-retention\nassembly is of one-piece\nconstruction\nand consists of a neoprene-coated\nnonporous nylon bladder to which are\npermanently\nattached\na soft\ntransparent\nplastic\nhelmet,\nrubber\ngloves, and boots. The configuration\nsupplied to the Texas Children\'s Hospital, Baylor College of Medicine, includes a permanently attached tunnel\nand adapter ring assembly\nthat at-\n\nFigure 1.--The mobile biological isolation system consists of a suit assembly, a pushcart\ntransporter, and a life support system.\n\n94\n\ntaches directly to one of the patient\'s\nisolation bubbles. This allows the patient to don and doff the suit without\never coming in contact with the nonsterile outside environment\nor outer\nsurface\nof the garment.\nA 2-foot\nsheath was fabricated on the back of\nthe garment. After subject entry, the\nsheath is simply rolled shut and strapped in place.\nA lightweight\novergarment\nof\nporous nylon (Nomex) -- similar to\nthat used in certain outer layers of the\nGemini space suit -- is worn over the\nsuit and affords additional\nprotection\nagainst abrasion, puncture, and fire.\nThe tunnel is sheathed with a material\nidentical to that used for the pressure\ngarment and this sheathed configuration serves as a tether during patient\nexcursions. Ambient air, filtered to 0.3\nmicrometer via a high-efficiency\nparticle-accumulator\nfilter, is blown into\nthe helmet by one of three (two redundant, one emergency backup) ventilator fan assemblies, circulated over the\nbody for cooling, and exited at the\nankles under positive pressure.\nA typical\nlawnmower\nframe,\nwheels, handles, and brakes serve as\nthe basic transporter\nunit on which\nmechanical and electrical equipment\nis mounted.\nA seat is provided\ntogether with a swing arm to allow the\npatient to ride on the transporter or to\nwalk\nalongside\nwithin\nthe l O-foot\nradius of the suit tunnel\n\nThe electricalpowersystemincludes blowers, motors,\ntwo\ntwo\ntwo\n12-volt atteries,\nb\nandthecircuitry\nrequired\ntoutilize\npowerrom standard\nf a\nhousehold\nelectrical\noutletor a motor\nvehiclecigarette\nlighter.During\nnormaloperation, batteries reconthe\na\nnectedin parallel.Thesystem\nwas\ndesigned support 4-hour utside\nto\na\no\nexcursion minimum\nasa\n(fig.2).Additionaltime is permissibles patient\na\ncomfort ndendurancellow.(Addia\na\ntional emergencyequipmentand\nreconfiguration\noptions reavailable\na\nto\nthequalified\noperator.)\n\nFigure\n\n2.---Supported\n\nby\n\nthe\n\nmobile\n\nbiological\n\nTwo new largersuits are being\ndeveloped the patientat Texas\nfor\nChildren\'s ospital\nH\nandareexpected\ntobecompletedy late1980. esults\nb\nR\nofgrowth\nstudies ereincorporated\nw\nto\nincrease\ntheoverall eartimeof the\nw\nsuits.Newmaterials rebeingused\na\nthatallowstronger\nseams\nandeasier\nfabrication.\nGlovematerial\nhasbeen\nchangedfromneoprene dipped\nto\nlatex\ntoallowgreater\ntactility\nanddexterity.Boots\narenolonger artof the\np\nlegassembly.\nThenewconcept rop\nvides tubesockaspartofthelower\na\nleg, allowingthe subjectroomfor\n\nisolation\n\nsystem,\n\nthe\n\npatient\n\nis\n\nable\n\nto go\n\non an\n\ngrowthand permitting\nhim to wear\nbetterittingshoes rsneakers.\nf\no\nAnew\nhelmet aterial\nm\nanddesign\nincreases\noptical ualities ndvisibility.\nq\na\nTheairspray\ndesign\nisalsoimproved\ntoallow\nbetter dispersion f carbondioxide\no\nand to eliminatevisorfogging. he\nT\nouter arment\ng\nhasbeenredesigned\nto\ngivea casual\ndenim\nlookwithpockets\nlargeenough accommodate\nto\nmany\narticles.\nPerhaps\nthegreatest\nimprovementsachange theprevious\ni\nfrom\nexhaust orts more\np toa\nreliable\ntypethat\nis easily\nreplaceable.\n\nexcursion.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n.\n\n,r\n\n95\nNASA-JSC\n\nThe\n\ncharge-out\n\nnumber\n\n_or this book is\n\nL_BRARY\n\nl.js_\n/\n\nMAR _\n\n_,_i\n\nOHNSON SPACE CEN]\nHOUSTON,\nTEXAS\n\n(Accession\n\n_ ..--_\n\n,,/\n\nN\n\n._\n\no._\n\n'
