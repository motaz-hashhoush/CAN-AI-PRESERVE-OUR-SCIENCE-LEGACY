Considerable progress was made in determining accurate transition probabilities for the important band systems of NO that account for much of the emission in the ultraviolet region. Research carried out under this project showed that in order to reproduce the observed radiation from the bow shock region of missiles in their boost phase it is necessary to include the Burnett terms in the constituent equation, account for the non-Boltzmann energy distribution, correctly model the NO formation and rotational excitation process, and use accurate transition probabilities for the NO band systems. This work resulted in significant improvements in the computer code NEQAIR that models both the radiation and fluid dynamics in the shock region.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19940015345, "id": "d5ff261022704502826bf924b2c70501", "publicationDate": "1993-07-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19940015345.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19940015345/downloads/19940015345.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19940015345/downloads/19940015345.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19940015345/downloads/19940015345.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
