They were assisted by Marshall, which had developed water jetting technology to clean the Space Shuttles. The result was a completely automatic water jetting system which cuts rock and granite and removes concrete. Labor costs have been reduced; dust is suppressed and production has been increased.", "title": "Water Jetting", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-20T23:49:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020090836, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020090836, "id": "f18caae0c7d044f0abfc3e24100be7b7", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1985", "publicationDate": "1985-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020090836.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020090836/downloads/20020090836.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020090836/downloads/20020090836.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020090836/downloads/20020090836.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
