Because of the miniscule damping forces\ninvolved it was required that the inoperative damper\nbe completely isolated from the damping boom shaft\nduring test of the other damper.\nThe solution:\nA diaphragm spring clutch mechanism (solenoid\nactuated) which, when engaged in either direction, is\n\nessentially floating and completely free from the actuator and disengaged components.\nHow it\'s done:\nThe diaphragm spring has two stable positions and\noperates as an over-center toggle. In the left figure,\nthe spring is deflected through center on its mounting\nring by the actuator spool upper face so that the spring\nexerts force on the eddy-current damper shaft thus\nengaging the lower shaft grooved flange with the\nlower clutch face of the damping boom shaft. This\ndrives the damping boom shaft with no restraining\n(continued overleaf(\n\nNW\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National\t\nAeronautics and Space Administration.

This exerts force on the hysteresis damper\nshaft by engaging the upper shaft grooved flange with\nthe upper clutch face of the damping boom shaft.\nThus, the hysteresis damping effect alone is imposed\non the damping boom shaft as the eddy-current\ndamper shaft and actuator spool area are completely\ndisengaged.\nNotes:\n1. The fluted configuration of the diaphragm spring\npermits a wide range of load-deflection combinations that are readily calculated.\n\nBrief 66-10297\t\n\n2. The beryllium copper spring is made in a flat\n(on-center) position and is deflected at assembly\nin one direction or another since the diameter of\nthe mounting ring is smaller than the free diameter\nof the flat spring.\n3. The V-grooves of the two damper flanges and mating surfaces of the damping boom shaft ensure that\nthe parts will repeatedly engage in a concentric\nmanner and with parallel faces.\n4.
