The two microphone acoustic intensity techniques are investigated as a tool for path identification. Laboratory tests indicate that, if the intensity transmitted through a particular section of the fuselage is measured in the presence and absence of flanking paths using the face to face and side by side microphone arrangements, then no significant difference exists between the two measured intensities if the face to face microphone arrangement is used. However, if the side by side arrangement is used, then considerable difference exists between the two measured intensities.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19840020500, "id": "bb41ec9194694f84b9ae776f536001f9", "publicationDate": "1984-05-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19840020500.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19840020500/downloads/19840020500.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19840020500/downloads/19840020500.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19840020500/downloads/19840020500.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
