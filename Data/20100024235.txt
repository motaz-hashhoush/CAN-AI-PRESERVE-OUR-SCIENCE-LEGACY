b'Custom Unit Pump Development for the EVA PLSS\nMichael Schuller1, Cable Kurwitz2, Frank Little3, Ryoji Oinuma4, Ben Larsen5\nTexas Engineering Experiment Station, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas 77845 USA\nJeff Goldman 6, Filip Reinis 7\nHoneywell International, Torrance, Ca. 90504 USA\n\nThis paper describes the effort by the Texas Engineering Experiment Station (TEES) and Honeywell for\nNASA to design and test a pre-flight prototype pump for use in the Extra-vehicular activity (EVA) portable\nlife support subsystem (PLSS). Major design decisions were driven by the need to reduce the pump\xe2\x80\x99s mass,\npower, and volume compared to the existing PLSS pump. In addition, the pump must accommodate a much\nwider range of abnormal conditions than the existing pump, including vapor/gas bubbles and increased\npressure drop when employed to cool two suits simultaneously. A positive displacement, external gear type\npump was selected because it offers the most compact and highest efficiency solution over the required range\nof flow rates and pressure drops. An additional benefit of selecting a gear pump design is that it is self\npriming and capable of ingesting non-condensable gas without becoming \xe2\x80\x9cair locked.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe chosen pump design consists of a 28 V DC, brushless, seal-less, permanent magnet motor driven,\nexternal gear pump that utilizes a Honeywell development that eliminates the need for magnetic coupling.\nThe pump design was based on existing Honeywell designs, but incorporated features specifically for the\nPLSS application, including all of the key features of the flight pump.\nTesting at TEES verified that the pump meets the design requirements for range of flow rates, pressure\ndrop, power consumption, working fluid temperature, operating time, gas ingestion, and restart capability\nunder both ambient and vacuum conditions. The pump operated at 40 to 240 lbm/hr flow rate, 35 to 100 oF\npump temperature, and 5 to 10 psid pressure rise. Power consumption of the pump controller at the nominal\noperating point in both ambient and vacuum conditions was 9.5 W, which was less than the 12 W predicted.\nGas ingestion capabilities were tested by injecting 100 cc of air into the fluid line; the pump operated\nnormally throughout this test.\n\nI. Introduction\nNASA requires an improved portable life support subsystem (PLSS) water pump to support future missions. The\ncurrent PLSS water pump is a centrifugal multi-vane pump that operates at ~20,200 rpm. This centrifugal pump is\nsensitive to gas bubbles and can require priming before extravehicular activity (EVA), lengthening EVA\n\n_______________________________\n1\nAssociate Research Engineer and Visiting Professor, Space Engineering Research Center, Texas Engineering\nExperiment Station, Texas A&M University, 3380 University Dr. E., College Station, TX 77845\n2\nSenior Research Engineer, (same address as above for TEES)\n3\nTEES Distinguished Research Scientist, (same address as above for TEES)\n4\nSenior Research Engineer, (same address as above for TEES)\n5\nGraduate Student, (same address as above for TEES)\n6\nPrincipal Engineer, Honeywell Aerospace, Mechanical Systems Engineering and Applications, 2525 Bay\nArea Boulevard, Suite 200, Houston, TX 77058\n7\nSenior Technical Manager, Honeywell International, Torrance, Ca. 90504\n\n1\n\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\npreparation time. To minimize outgassing and bubble formation during EVA, the current PLSS uses a special\npressurizing system that maintains the water loop at 15 psi, via a dedicated 15 psi oxygen regulator that provides\nbackpressure to the feedwater tanks. In addition, the PLSS uses a gas trap and a centrifugal water separator to\nremove gas from the water loop. Despite these precautions, the current pump has experienced cavitation issues and\nhas shown susceptibility to water impurities.\nThe current PLSS design goals for the Constellation Space Suit Element require the PLSS pump to use potable\nwater from the vehicle or habitat that has been nominally delivered at 8 psi. NASA also desires to reduce the mass,\nvolume, and power consumption of the pump in order to support longer duration EVAs.\nAs a result of these goals and the deficiencies of the existing equipment, NASA contracted with TEES to design,\nbuild, and test a Custom Unit Pump (CUP) for future use in the PLSS. TEES in turn teamed with Honeywell on the\nbasis of their experience and success with gear pump designs for spaceflight.\nThe primary requirements for the CUP are derived from JSC-65685, Development Requirements for\nWaterpump in EVA Technology System (WETS), but are modified for the purpose of development testing. The\nprimary requirement is to provide water flow for thermal regulation to a suited EVA crewmember\xe2\x80\x99s Liquid Cooling\nGarment and to spacesuit components during EVA in vacuum, Lunar, and Martian environments. EVA duration has\nbeen set at 8 hours, with an additional 2 hours of pump operation during EVA preparation, leading to a requirement\nfor 10 hours of continuous operation. The design flow rate is 200 lbm/hr (1.5 L/min) at 5 psid water loop pressure\ndrop. The pump must be capable of operating from 40-240 lbm/hr (0.3-1.8 L/min) at 5 psid and must be capable of\nproviding 180 lbm/hr (1.35 L/min) at 10 psid for emergency operations. Operating temperature, defined as the\nwater temperature at the inlet of the pump, ranges from 35 to 100 oF. The pump must be capable of starting over\nthis entire temperature range. The pump must accommodate water loop pressures at the inlet ranging from 3.3 to 10\npsig. The pump may operate in ambient environments, but must be capable of operating in vacuum. Useful life is\nset at 2000 hours using potable water. Power consumption must not exceed 15 W +/- 10% at 28 VDC at nominal\noperating conditions. The testing carried out at TEES covered all of the requirements except for useful life, which\nwill be tested at NASA.\n\nII.\n\nPump Design\n\nA. Approach\nOur approach was to design an application specific pump that would meet all of the requirements of the flight\nPLSS Waterpump, then to fabricate a pre-flight prototype that contained the key design features of the flight pump,\nusing existing Honeywell designs that could be fabricated within program budgetary constraints. The features and\nmaterials of both flight and prototype pumps are similar, with the prototype modifications resulting in larger size\nand lower operating speed.\nB. Pump Type Selection\nPrior work by NASA determined that the PLSS pump must be a positive displacement type, selected for its\nability to ingest gas bubbles without becoming \xe2\x80\x9cair-locked.\xe2\x80\x9d There are a number of positive displacement pump\ntypes available, ranging from gear pumps and Gerotor pumps to screw and roots pumps, diaphragm pumps,\nreciprocating pumps, and scroll pumps. Each type has numerous variations. We selected a gear pump, as it offered\nthe most compact and highest efficiency solution. Gear pumps are self priming and capable of ingesting noncondensable gas without becoming \xe2\x80\x9cair locked.\xe2\x80\x9d Honeywell also has considerable experience with gear pumps,\nhaving a number of designs that could be modified for this application with minimum effort and cost.\n\n2\n\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nWe eliminated Gerotor pumps as we deemed them more complex to fabricate and operate and they provided no\nperformance advantages. We deemed the extra complexity as making it more susceptible to failure from\ncontamination, which is possible in a biological system such as a space suit. We eliminated screw/roots type pumps\nas they are more suitable for larger applications than this one, and are complex and expensive to fabricate. Various\ntypes of diaphragm pumps were eliminated due to their creation of high pressure pulses and concerns over\ndiaphragm fatigue failures. Other types of pumps, such as reciprocating pumps and scroll pumps, were dismissed\ndue to their complexity and cost for this application.\nC. Detailed Design\nThe flight gear pump design uses an application specific pump head and motor design, operating at a nominal\nspeed of 5600 rpm. The prototype pump uses the pump head and housings from a Honeywell Auxiliary Power Unit\n(APU) fuel pump connected to a motor based on Honeywell\xe2\x80\x99s International Space Station Internal Thermal Control\nSystem Pump Package Assembly (PPA), with the stator rewound for this voltage. The modified PPA motor fits\nwithin the existing APU fuel pump motor housing.\nThe APU fuel pump was designed for a different flow rate range and pressure rise than the PLSS Waterpump.\nThe gear lobes were lengthened and its nominal operating speed lowered to 3560 rpm in order to meet the specified\npressure versus flow rate requirements at the PLSS Waterpump design point.\nThe gear lobe profiles for both flight and prototype pumps are shaped specifically for a pump application, as\nopposed to gear profiles designed for power transmission. Many pumps use power transmission gear lobe profiles\ndue to availability and manufacturing cost. These profiles minimize gear wear under high loads and are more\nefficient for power transmission, but less efficient for pumping. The difference between the two is the clearance or\ngap at the root of the gears when they are mated. Transmission gear profiles have a greater gap, resulting in a\nrelatively large root volume. Incompressible liquid is trapped in the root volume. This trapped liquid is squeezed\nbetween the gears upon mating, increasing the fluid\xe2\x80\x99s pressure, and creating forces acting to separate the gears from\neach other. The energy that goes into increasing the trapped volume\xe2\x80\x99s pressure increases power consumption,\nreducing efficiency. The pump components also have to be larger to handle the side loads generated on the gears.\nThe peak and root of pump application gears are more closely matched, resulting in small root volumes and\nlittle trapped incompressible liquid. The result is lower power consumption, higher efficiency, and smaller pump\ncomponents.\nThe pump cartridge end plates were fabricated from Bearium B-10, a bronze based bearing material, and\nprovide the journals for non-contacting hydrodynamic journal bearings for the gear shafts. The gear\xe2\x80\x99s side surfaces\nalso contact the B-10 bearing material in order to form better seals, to minimize internal leakage that would bypass\nthe gear set..\nD. Motor Design and Controller Selection\nThe motor operating voltage of 28 V DC was specified by NASA. We selected a two pole, brushless,\npermanent magnet motor using a sensorless motor control scheme, eliminating the need for Hall Effect rotor\nposition sensors. Sensorless motor control schemes are standard for the current generation of Honeywell pumps for\ncommercial aircraft, and so were deemed a mature and reliable technology. Sensorless motor control requires\napplication specific control algorithms to achieve maximum motor efficiency and is therefore beyond the funding\nand schedule scope of this program. Low cost commercially available sensorless controllers, such as those used on\nmodel airplanes, were designed to operate at lower voltages, and so were deemed not applicable to this design.\nTherefore, the prototype used conventional Hall Effect rotor position sensors and a commercial Advanced Motion\nControls motor controller. Using the Hall Effect sensors gives NASA the flexibility to use a different test rig\ncontroller during testing.\n3\n\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nThe motor stator is cooled by the working fluid. Motor stator heat is conducted from the stator windings,\nthrough a stationary metallic fluid barrier, to the fluid side of the barrier, where the working fluid removes the heat\nby convection. Working fluid is diverted from the high pressure side of the pump cartridge to the motor area for\ncooling, then exits the motor area via a center passage in the driver gear shaft, and enters the low pressure side of the\npump cartridge creating, the flow necessary for convective heat transfer.\nThe motor rotor is cantilevered off of the driver gear shaft. As a result, no bearings dedicated only to the motor\nwere used.\nE. Pump/Motor Coupling\nThe pump uses a direct shaft to the motor rotor, so no in-line magnetic coupling is used to maintain fluid\nsealing. A stationary fluid barrier encases the entire pump cartridge and rotor shaft, segregating the working fluid\nfrom the stator and Hall Effect sensors. The stationary fluid barrier terminates at the motor end of the assembly\nusing an o-ring seal between the OD of the barrier and the ID of motor housing bore (bore seal). This approach\nprovides semi-hermetic sealing of the working fluid. Magnetic coupling links the stator to the rotor; as in a typical\nmotor, only the magnetic flux passes through the thin metallic fluid barrier. Figure 1 shows the stationary fluid seal\nwithin the pump and contrasts our approach with a conventional design.\nF. As-built Configuration\nDuring fabrication, some changes were made to the design to reduce cost or schedule. These changes included\nchanging the motor stator lamination material and changing the motor stack bonding process. The lamination\nmaterial was changed due to a long raw material lead time on the original 0.006 in thick Carpenter 49 nickel iron\nalloy, which was replaced with a 0.014 in thick M19 silicon iron alloy. The stack bonding process was changed\nfrom laser welding to capillary bonding due to a long vendor lead time on the laser weld process.\n\nFigure 1.

Predicted Performance/Characteristics\nTable 1 summarizes key pump characteristics for the pre-flight prototype and the flight unit. The main\ndifferences between the pre-flight prototype and the flight unit are size, weight, power required, and the motor\ncontroller. The power consumption of the pump and motor are expected to be approximately 8 Watts at the design\npoint. We anticipated a significant difference in total power consumption between the pre-flight prototype and the\nflight unit due to motor controller efficiency. For the pre-flight prototype, we assumed a commercial motor control\nwith an efficiency of 50%, yielding a total predicted power consumption of 16 W at the design point. Actual\nefficiency of the controller turned out to be 85%, so power consumption at the design point was only 9.5 W The\nflight unit will use a 90% efficient sensorless motor controller specifically designed for this application, which\nshould reduce the total predicted power consumption to approximately 9 W at the design point.\nTable 1.

Test Plan and Results\nThe purpose of the testing was to demonstrate the CUP requirements. From the requirements levied by NASA,\nwe identified the following major testing requirements:\n1. 10 hours continuous operation\n2. Surface temp 35 F to 100 F (also startup at that range of water inlet temperatures)\n3. Flow rate and differential pressure\n200 lbm/hr (1.5 L/min) at 5 psid (design point)\n180 lbm/hr (1.35 L/min) at 10 psid (emergency)\nFlow rate controllable from 20-120% of nominal (0.3-1.8 L/min) for all conditions\n4. Inlet water pressure 3.3 \xe2\x80\x93 10 psia\n\nThe independent variables for these tests were water inlet temperature and flow rate. Inlet water pressure was\nvaried over the required range during the test runs. Water loop pressure drop was set to 5 psid for runs 1 through 12\nand 10 psid for runs 13 through 15. The dependent variables were power consumption (15 W +/- 10% at 5 psid and\n1.5 L/min) and surface temperature of the CUP.\nA. Parameter Values\nT is inlet water temperature. Q is flow rate. Primary testing occurred with the water loop pressure drop set at 5\npsid. Secondary testing occurred with the water loop pressure drop set at 10 psid. Inlet pressure was varied from\n3.3 to 10 psia over the set of tests. Testing occurred with the CUP both in ambient air and in vacuum (P<10-4 torr).\nTable 2 defines the values of each level of the main input parameters (temperature and flow rate); 10 psid test flow\nrates were 90% of these values. Table 3 lays out the test sequence with the loop pressure drop set at 5 psid. Table 4\nlists the parameters for the 10 psid test runs.\nTable 2.

Run 16 repeated the state point for Run 5, since Run 5 had a 10\nminute zero flow condition. Run 17 repeated the state point of Run 1, both to give us a continuous 10 hour test at\nthat state point and to verify performance of the pump following the disassembly, inspection, cleaning, and\nreassembly that occurred after the first 15 runs were completed.\nB. Test Water Loop Layout\nFigure 2 is a schematic of the water test loop, showing the piping layout and locations for the instrumentation.\nThe vacuum boundary indicates those parts of the water test loop that were in vacuum; the remainder of the test loop\nwas at ambient conditions. The pressure drop in the water loop was controlled by the setting of the metering valve\nM1, while pump inlet pressure was controlled by the settings on the eductor attached to the accumulator.\nThe loop was set to the conditions specified for a particular run using the gear pump, the metering valve, the\nheating tape, and the cooling coils. Once the test conditions were set, the gear pump was shut off long enough for\nthe water in the loop to stop flowing. The gear pump was then turned on, to demonstrate its ability to start under the\nfull range of environments specified by NASA. The pump inlet pressure varied over time, due to changes in\nbuilding air supplied to the eductor. We tested the entire range of pump inlet pressures between 3.3 and 10 psia.\n\nFigure 2. Water Loop Schematic for CUP Testing\n\n7\n\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nC. Test Run Descriptions\nRuns 1 through 6, 16, and 17 were performed in atmosphere, to allow easier troubleshooting. The only\ndifference between the runs made in atmosphere and those made in vacuum was the considerable condensation that\noccurred during the low temperature tests in atmosphere.\nRuns 7 through 15 were performed in vacuum at external (to the pump) pressures below 1 x 10-4 torr. Power\ninput increased slightly (approximately 0.01 A at 50 V) compared to ambient condition runs; we believe the\ndifference is due to the higher resistance of the controller cable passing through the vacuum chamber feedthroughs.\nRuns 1 and 17 were the nominal operating environment for the pump. Runs 3 and 12 were the extreme\noperating environments. Run 9 was the expected highest temperature condition, due to the minimum fluid cooling\nof the pump. The other long duration runs were at the highest flow rates, which we thought would be the most\nstressful condition.\nD. Power Consumption\nTable 5 shows the power consumption as a function of inlet water temperature and flow rate. Based on our\nanalysis, the contamination of the pump, represented by the time operated, had the largest effect on power\nconsumption. The pump met its design goal of 15 W at nominal conditions by a wide margin.\nTable 5.

When the pump was\nreturned to TEES, we reran the state point for Run 1 as Run 17, both to get a continuous 10 hour run at the nominal\noperating conditions of the pump and to verify that the pump was operating properly following cleaning. Run 17\nhad a flowrate of 1.5 L/min at 70 F; its power consumption was 9.5 +/-0.1 W, so the cleaning process had a\nsubstantial effect on the power consumption of the pump.

Power consumption of run 1 and run17.\nE. Restarts\nPer NASA\xe2\x80\x99s requirements, we demonstrated that the pump could restart over its entire temperature range. The\nonly difficulties encountered were in the cold restarts, where only 2 out of 5 restarts were successful. In the other 3\ncases, the pump restarted after being warmed up slightly (40-45 oF).\nF. Flowrate Versus Head Curves\nFollowing completion of the test plan, we ran a short series of pump curves at 0.75, 1.5, and 1.8 L/min by\nvarying the differential pressure at constant pump speed while increasing differential pressure and at constant flow\nrate while decreasing differential pressure. We ran a truncated test at 0.3 L/min because the flow was not stable at\nthis flow rate for differential pressures less than 5 psid. We did not run the constant flow rate curve at 1.8 L/min\nbecause we were not able to maintain a flow rate of 1.8 L/min at the higher differential pressures. We recorded\npower input via video camera. All of the curves were run at 70 oF. Figure 4 is a compilation of the flow rate versus\ndifferential pressure data for the pump.\n\n9\n\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nFigure 4. Flow rate versus differential pressure compilation.\nG. Bubble/Vapor Testing\nWe expected vapor and gas bubbles to evolve within the water loop as we lowered the pump inlet pressure and\nthey did. We observed the evolution of these bubbles via the transparent sections in the piping. The size and\nquantity of these bubbles indicated that the pump\xe2\x80\x99s ability to operate is not compromised by ingesting small amounts\nof small bubbles.\nBecause of the power anomalies and unexpected shutdowns encountered during testing, we decided to add a\nbubble injection test to the plan. We attached a cylinder containing approximately 100 mL of air to an inlet port on\nthe flow loop. While running at steady state at 1.5 L/min, 70 oF, and 5 psid across the pump, we opened the valve to\nthe cylinder, injecting the 100 mL into the pump in about 1.5 seconds. The air flowed through the loop and the\npump. Figures 5 and 6 show the data traces for the two bubble injection tests we ran. The pump returned to normal\noperation without operator intervention following each of the tests. Based on the results of these tests, we believe\nsome of the power excursions observed in other runs may have been cavitation events.\nWhile not definitive, this bubble ingestion testing establishes the basic ability of the pump to operate through\ngas ingestion, one of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s goals for the CUP.\n\n10\n\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nFigure 5. Flow rate and differential pressure versus time, gas ingestion test.\n\nFigure 6. Pressures versus time, gas ingestion test.\n11\n\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nH. Post Test Examination\nFollowing the completion of run 16, the CUP was returned to Honeywell for disassembly, inspection, and\ncleaning. Gray contaminant material was removed from inside the pump. Light scoring occurred on the pump\ncartridge assembly and gear sets. This scoring is due to the gray contaminant material. Rub marks on the rotor and\nbore seal were caused by contact between the rotor and the bore seal during operation and may have been\nresponsible for the longer duration power excursions noted in several runs.\nFollowing cleaning and reassembly, the CUP was returned to TEES. We then performed run 17 at the normal\noperating conditions. Completion of this run verified that the pump was operating as before. There were no power\nexcursions during run 17 and the pump and controller only consumed 9.5 W at this state point.\nI. Results Summary\nTEES and Honeywell have designed and built a compact, efficient pump suitable for use in the Constellation\nSpace Suit PLSS and future space suits (Figure 7). We tested the pump over the range of operational conditions it\nwill encounter in use in a vacuum environment. By demonstrating that power consumption and pump parameters\nremained within the allowable limits over the entire range of testing, we demonstrated that the CUP meets the\nrequirements of the project.\n\nFluid\n\nFluid\n\nElectrical\n\nFigure 7. TEES/Honeywell Custom Unit Pump\nThe CUP experienced 9 anomalies during testing, 3 of which involved flow stoppage and power fluctuations,\nand 6 of which involved only power fluctuations. In runs 3 and 5 there was some evidence of flow instability at low\nflow rates during startup (pulsing flow behavior). In all cases of flow stoppage, the pump either restarted on its own,\nor restarted when the operators commanded it to do so. There were three instances at low temperature when it took\nseveral attempts before the pump restarted. There were no instances where multiple restarts were required at 70 oF\nor 100 oF. In all cases involving only power fluctuations, all other pump parameters were unchanged.\nTable 21 summarizes the performance of the CUP against its requirements.\n\n12\n\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nTable 21.
