b'Ultraviolet-Blocking Lenses Protect, Enhance Vision\nOriginating Technology/NASA Contribution\n\nI\n\nn the 1980s, Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) scientists James Stephens and Charles Miller were studying\nthe harmful properties of light in space, as well as that\nof artificial radiation produced during laser and welding\nwork. The intense light emitted during welding can harm\nunprotected eyes, leading to a condition called arc eye, in\nwhich ultraviolet light causes inflammation of the cornea\nand long-term retinal damage.\nTo combat this danger, the JPL scientists developed\na welding curtain capable of absorbing, filtering, and\nscattering the dangerous light. The curtain employed a\nlight-filtering/vision-enhancing system based on dyes\nand tiny particles of zinc oxide\xe2\x80\x94unique methods they\ndiscovered by studying birds of prey. The birds require\nnear-perfect vision for hunting and survival, often needing to spot prey from great distances. The birds\xe2\x80\x99 eyes\nproduce tiny droplets of oil that filter out harmful radiation and permit only certain visible wavelengths of light\nthrough, protecting the eye while enhancing eyesight. The\nresearchers replicated this oil droplet process in creating\nthe protective welding curtain.\nThe welding curtain was commercialized, and then\nthe scientists focused attention on another area where\nblocking ultraviolet light would be beneficial to the eyes:\nsunglasses. In 2010, the groundbreaking eyewear technology was inducted into the Space Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s Space\nTechnology Hall of Fame, which honors a select few\nproducts each year that have stemmed from space research\nand improved our lives here on Earth.\n\nPartnership\nSunTiger Inc.\xe2\x80\x94now Eagle Eyes Optics, of Calabasas,\nCalifornia\xe2\x80\x94was formed to market a full line of sunglasses\nbased on the licensed NASA technology that promises\n100-percent elimination of harmful wavelengths and\nenhanced visual clarity. Today, Eagle Eyes sunglasses are\n42\t\n\nHealth and Medicine \t\n\nBased on work done at NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Eagle\nEyes lenses filter out harmful radiation, reduce light scattering,\nand permit vision-enhancing wavelengths of light, protecting\neyesight while also improving visibility.\n\nworn by millions of people around the world who enjoy\nthe protective and vision-enhancing benefits.\n\nProduct Outcome\nMaximum eye protection from the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s harmful\nultraviolet rays is critical to our ability to see clearly. This\nis because when light enters the eye, a series of events\nhappen which can help, hinder, or even destroy our eyesight. First, light passes through the cornea and ultimately\nreaches the retina which contains two types of cells\xe2\x80\x94rods\n(which handle vision in low light) and cones (which\n\nhandle color vision and detail). The retina contains 100\nmillion rods and 7 million cones. The outer segment of\na rod or a cone contains the photosensitive chemical,\nrhodopsin, also called \xe2\x80\x9cvisual purple.\xe2\x80\x9d Rhodopsin is the\nchemical that allows night vision, and is extremely sensitive to light. When exposed to a full spectrum of light,\nrhodopsin immediately bleaches out, and takes about 30\nminutes to fully regenerate, with most of the adaption\noccurring in the dark within 5 to 10 minutes. Rhodopsin\nis less sensitive to the longer red wavelengths of light\nand therefore depleted more slowly (which is why many\npeople use red light to help preserve night vision). When\nour eyes are exposed to the harmful, ultraviolet light rays\nof the Sun (UVA, UVB, and blue-light rays), damage to\nour eyes and their complex vision-enhancing processes\ncan occur and not even be noticed until years later, long\nafter exposure.\nThe most common form of eye damage related to\nultraviolet exposure, cataracts, causes the lens of the eye to\ncloud, losing transparency and leading to reduced vision\nand, if left untreated, blindness. In the United States\nalone, it is estimated that cataracts diminish the eyesight\nof millions of people at an expense of billions of dollars.\nOther forms of eye damage directly attributable to ultraviolet exposure include pterygium, an abnormal mass of\ntissue arising from the conjunctiva of the inner corner of\nthe eye; skin cancer around the eyes; and macular degeneration, which damages the center of the eye and prevents\npeople from seeing fine details.\nAlan Mittleman, president and CEO of Eagle Eyes\nexplains, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen we\xe2\x80\x99re born, our eyes are clear like drops\nof water. Throughout life, we start to destroy those sensitive tissues, causing the yellowing of the eyes and the\ngradual worsening of eyesight. When the eye becomes\nmore and more murky, cataracts form. Simple protection\nof the human eye, from childhood and throughout adulthood could protect the clarity of the eye and extend good\nvision for many years\xe2\x80\x94even our entire lifetime.\nSpinoff 2010\n\nThe Eagle Eyes lens (right) makes scenes more vivid because harmless wavelength colors such as red, orange, yellow, and green are enhanced, and damaging rays in the blue, violet, and ultraviolet (UV)\nwavelengths are blocked.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has only been recently,\xe2\x80\x9d he adds, \xe2\x80\x9cthat people\nstarted to realize the importance of this.\xe2\x80\x9d Sunglass manufacturers are recognizing the importance of eye care, and\nconsumers are becoming more aware of eye health. One\nissue still plaguing the sunglass market, though, is that\nconsumers assume that darker lenses are more protective,\nwhich is not always the case.\nIt may feel more comfortable to wear the dark lenses,\nbut in addition to reducing the field of vision, it relaxes\nthe eye, which allows more blue light to get directly to the\nretina. Blue light, in particular, has long-term implications, because it passes through the cornea and damages\nthe inner retinal area.\nThe Eagle Eyes lens allows wearers to see more clearly\nbecause it protects from ultraviolet light, but more importantly, blocks this blue light, allowing the good visible\nlight while blocking the harmful wavelengths.\nSpinoff 2010\t\n\nAmong their many donations throughout the years\nand goal of spreading good vision and eye protection\nto remote areas of the world, Eagle Eyes Optics had the\nopportunity recently to provide assistance to a group in\nsore need of eye protection: children in Galena, Alaska.\nThe incidence of cataracts is 300 times greater in Alaska\nbecause of the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s reflection off of the snow. Eagle Eyes\ndonated 150 pairs of its sunglasses to a high school in\nGalena, and they were delivered by members of the Space\nFoundation and presented by former NASA astronaut\nLivingston Holder. \xe2\x9d\x96\n\nHealth and Medicine \t 43\n\n'
