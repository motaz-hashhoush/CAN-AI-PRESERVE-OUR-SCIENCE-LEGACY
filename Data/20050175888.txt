The separations\nresult from a lack of acceptable situational awareness over oceans where radar position updates are not\navailable. This study considers the use of Automatic Dependent Surveillance (ADS) data transmitted over\na commercial satellite communications system as an approach to provide ATC with the needed situational\nawareness and thusly allow for reduced aircraft separations. This study uses Federal Aviation\nAdministration data from a single day for the Gulf of Mexico to analyze traffic loading to be used as a\nbenchmark against which to compare several approaches for coordinating data transmissions from the\naircraft to the satellites.\n\nIntroduction\nCurrent procedures mandate that Gulf of Mexico air traffic maintain 50 Nautical Mile (NMi)\nseparations [1]. On the other hand, over Continental United States (CONUS) regions, Federal Aviation\nAdministration (FAA) requires a 5 NMi separation. The difference in separation requirements is a direct\nresult of the lack of surveillance radar coverage. Regularly derived position information from radar allows\nAir Traffic Control (ATC) to regularly monitor aircraft positions and react quickly to any changes. The\nvery lack of surveillance radar over oceanic regions means that ATC does not have current position\ninformation, and therefore, must maintain much stricter separation requirements.\nIn the CONUS case where radar coverage is nearly ubiquitous, ATC radar data is automatically\nreceived at the regional control centers. Aircraft have little, if any, requirement to communicate nominal\nposition information to ATC. Over the oceans, ATC must use High Frequency (HF) radio links to request\nposition updates from each aircraft. HF radio has limitations in clarity and reliability. Additionally, HF\ncommunications are conducted through a third party. Direct controller-pilot communications are not\npossible which adds a time delay. HF radio does not mitigate the burden on ATC to obtain current\nposition knowledge and therefore, the separation requirements cannot be relaxed.\nThis study explores the technical aspects of a satellite-based approach to oceanic aircraft surveillance\nthat would provide ATC with more timely and reliable position information. This then may provide the\nmeans for reducing the current separation requirements and increasing oceanic corridor capacity.\nSpecifically, by all aircraft in the Gulf of Mexico having their Automatic Dependant Surveillance (ADS)\ndata transmitted to an Aeronautical Mobile Satellite System (AMSS) and the AMSS relaying that data to\nATC, the required surveillance information would be available to support reduced separations. The\npotential AMSS that is considered in this study is a Low-Earth Orbiting (LEO) satellite system, but\nanother AMSS in geostationary can fulfill the role as well. The reason for choosing one particular AMSS\nis that it provides needed communication systems data for both the space and air segments.\nThe goal of this study was to gain insight of the improvements possible by relaxing separation\nconstraints. The study, however, did not address the numerous, strict procedures imposed on oceanic\ncrossing aircraft. These aspects are left for future considerations.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942005-213631\n\n1\n\nPreliminary Considerations/Calculations\nLEO Satellite Link:\nAs an example of a LEO satellite system, the Iridium system operates in the L-Band frequency and\nthe link examined uses the Sensor Systems Inc. aircraft mounted antenna, S65-8282-401 [2]. The antenna\nhas a minimum elevation angle of 8\xc2\xba with a gain of 0 dBic. The antenna radiates 60 Watts (W) peak\npower which corresponds to an average power of 42.43 W. This specific antenna was modeled because it\nis representative of Iridium aircraft mounted antennas. Other link budget assumptions for the study are as\nfollows:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n3dB of Additional Losses\nQPSK Modulation [3]\n1E-9 BER\nZenith Distance of 780 km [3]\nHorizon Distance of 2460 km [3]\nFrequency of 1.623 GHz\nIridium Satellite G/T of -16.315 dB/K\nBurst Data Rate of 50 kbps [3]\n\nThe resulting link margins, table 1, for this case are shown below for both the zenith and horizon\ndistances in order to scope the link margin extremes. The horizon distance represents the worst case\nscenario when the satellite is at an elevation angle of 8\xc2\xb0, at the edge of the satellite footprint in the\noutermost spot beam cells.\n\nTABLE 1.\xe2\x80\x94LINK MARGIN RESULTS\nScenario\nZenith\nHorizon\nMargin (dB)\n11.52\n1.55\n\nAs shown in table 1, sufficient margin exists to complete a link, assuming level flight, for the antenna\nabove 8\xc2\xb0 elevation angle.\nPeak Traffic Baseline\nAccording to the FAA data, November 26, 2003 was the heaviest traffic day in the Gulf of Mexico\nthat year. Figure 1 shows that the maximum number of aircraft in the region at any time was 56. It is\nnoted that the graph is multi-modal corresponding to the various surges within the various routes within\nthe Gulf of Mexico.\nThe peak of 56 aircraft shown in figure 1 occurs at 17:20 GMT. Figure 2 depicts the aircraft position\ndistribution throughout the Gulf of Mexico at that specified time.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942005-213631\n\n2\n\nFigure 1.\xe2\x80\x94Number of Aircraft in Gulf of Mexico.\n\nFigure 2.\xe2\x80\x94Aircraft Coordinates\xe2\x80\x94Gulf of Mexico.\nCorridor Capacity\nA set of assumptions was used to compute the geometrical maximum number of aircraft in the\ncorridor, CG.

Notice that by reducing the separation by a factor of 2 (30 to 15 NMi), the corridor\ncapacity nearly doubles (as there is no laterally separated aircraft for most routes).\nBased just on geometric considerations, even the currently mandated 50 NMi separation can\naccommodate more traffic than the peak traffic density of 56 aircraft. The value of 56 aircraft represents\nthe peak instantaneous load for the busiest one-day traffic period in 2003 for the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nTABLE 3.\xe2\x80\x94MAXIMUM GEOMETRICAL CORRIDOR CAPACITY\nSeparation\nGulf of Mexico\n\n50 NMi Separation\n30 NMi Separation\n15 NMi Separation\n\n616\n1016\n1992\n\nFigure 4.\xe2\x80\x94Maximum Geometrical Corridor Capacity.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942005-213631\n\n5\n\nSystem Refresh Period\n\nThe maximum system refresh period is the upper limit of the amount of time between position\ninformation transmissions to ATC. The term \xe2\x80\x9csystem refresh period\xe2\x80\x9d refers to the amount of time that is\nrequired for all of the aircraft in the corridor to transmit their messages one time. For aircraft separation\nreductions to occur safely, all aircraft in the corridor must transmit their position information within the\nmaximum system refresh period for the reduced separations. System refresh period has components in\nlateral and longitudinal separation. System refresh period depends on the following [3] [4] [5]:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAircraft separation\nRequired Navigation Performance (RNP) to aircraft separation ratio\nLatency (delay from transmission on aircraft to reception at ATC to warning message from ATC\ntransmission to reception and pilot and aircraft response delay from warning message reception)\nAverage aircraft speed\nSpeed differential between aircraft\nStandard deviation for Global Positioning System (GPS) reported position\nBank angle in lateral direction\nDeviation angle in lateral direction\nAircraft are not flying on the same path in opposite directions\nAircraft will not arbitrarily change altitudes\n\nAssuming that all the aircraft maintain constant altitude, only lateral and longitudinal deviations are\nan issue. However, the period in between message transmissions represents a time when actual position of\nplanes is uncertain. Therefore, by insisting that the separations remain larger than the distance two aircraft\ncan close on each other during one system refresh period, the possibility of aircraft getting too close to\none another during that time is minimized.\nEquation (2), modified from work in [4], calculates the maximum system refresh period under\nlongitudinal separation requirements.\nTMAX _ LONG ( ASEP ) =\n\nASEP \xe2\x88\x92 4 RNP \xe2\x88\x92 4\xcf\x83 GPS\n\xe2\x88\x92 TLatency \xe2\x88\x92 TMAX _ LONG ( ASEP )'\n| \xe2\x88\x86v Aircraft |\n\n(2)\n\nThe term on the right hand side of equation (2) of the system refresh period (TMAX_LONG(ASEP))\ncorresponds to the difference in time due to consecutively situated aircraft transmitting their position\nreports at time increments of one system refresh period.

This study considers ASEP values of 50, 30, or 15 NMi.\nRNP is the allowable position error from the planned flight path. For purposes of study, an RNP to\nseparation ratio is defined and assumed to have a linear relationship, specifically, RNP = k* ASEP, where k\nis the ratio between RNP and ASEP. The assumption on linearity allows predicting required RNP levels for\nvarious separations. Historical data [5] [6] suggest a value of k = 1/5. Two historical examples and the\nprojected RNP values for the remaining two separations are shown in table 4.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942005-213631\n\n6\n\nTABLE 4.\xe2\x80\x94PROJECTED RNP REQUIREMENTS\nASEP\nRNP\nk\n100 NMi Separation\n20 NMi\n1/5\n50 NMi Separation\n10 NMi\n1/5\n30 NMi Separation\n6 NMi\n1/5\n15 NMi Separation\n3 NMi\n1/5\n\nOther parameters in equation (3) are:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xcf\x83GPS = 60 meter standard deviation for GPS\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x88\x86v Aircraft =\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTLatency = 7 minutes [7]\n\n10 knots\n= relative aircraft to aircraft speed differential in NMi/min [7]\n60 minutes / hr\n\nIt should be noted that due to the value of the total latency, TLatency, it is possible for the maximum\nsystem refresh period to become a negative value. Since this is not allowed, the acceptable range for the\nmaximum system refresh period is all real numbers greater than zero.

The\naircraft will have a distance of 2RNP, i.e., 2\xcf\x83 deviation from planned flight path, to a box edge. A 2\xcf\x83\ndeviation means that the aircraft should remain on its pre-determined route 95% of the time.

Each method consists of the message transmission description, a\nsystem refresh period for the peak traffic in each corridor, and the resulting maximum number of aircraft\nsustained in the corridor for the maximum system refresh period. The two methods are:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nMethod 1\xe2\x80\x94Single Aircraft Transmission at a Time\nMethod 2\xe2\x80\x94Maximum Aircraft Transmission at a Time\n\nEach method will utilize some, if not most, of the following transmission scheme variables. These\nvariables correspond to the Iridium system [3] [9] [10] and the ADS message format used for the analysis.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTWAIT = 0.33, 0.5, and 1 second inter-transmission waiting time between different aircraft\ntransmissions\nTINIT = 20 second initialization time to connect with Iridium (95% probability) [9]\nMCELL = 48 spot beam cells per Iridium satellite (hereafter simply referred to as cell) [3]\nMFCH = 20 frequency channels per Iridium cell [3]\nMTCHF = 4 TDMA channels per frequency channel [3]\n%UCH = 81.25% utilization of Iridium channels (not all Iridium channels are full duplex data\ncompatible; therefore less than 100%) [10]\nRD = System data rate of 2.4 kbps [3]\nTFRAME = Iridium TDMA frame time of 90 milliseconds [3]\nNo loss/re-establishment of link occurs during a transmission\nLADS = ADS message size of 80 bytes including coding [11]\n\nThree values for the inter-transmission waiting time are used as this is an uncertain factor in the analysis.\nThis is a parameter that was added to separate transmissions in time (and thus receptions at ATC). The\nlowest value of 0.33 seconds was determined to be such that initialization time was not a limiting factor in\ncertain calculations. Given that the initialization process takes 20 seconds to complete (95% probability)\nand that 65 active communication channels exist within one cell, the minimum value for the intertransmission waiting time is the initialization time over the number of active channels, which is just under\n0.33 seconds. This means that if a delay of 0.33 seconds is added between transmissions between\ndifferent aircraft, then up to 65 aircraft in a single cell can be in the process of initializing without conflict\nfor initialization. The remaining values were chosen with the intention that they would help increase the\nprobability for lack of conflict during initialization. There has been no risk analysis to determine what the\nprobabilities would be with the two other inter-transmission waiting times.\nADS messages contain the full content of aircraft identification, latitude, longitude, altitude, time\nstamp, velocity, and future intent. The ADS message modeled is a generic message of size 80 bytes [11].\nThis message size includes additional coding to help aid in error prevention in the transmission process.\nMethod 1\n\nIn the single aircraft transmission at a time method, two possibilities were considered. In the first\ncase, the single transmitting aircraft is sending only its own position information. In the second case, the\nsingle transmitting aircraft is sending its own plus some of its neighbors\xe2\x80\x99 position information.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942005-213631\n\n11\n\nCase 1.\xe2\x80\x94In the first case of Method 1, a single aircraft will transmit its own position information,\nwhile others prepare to transmit theirs by initializing their transmitters with the LEO satellite system. An\ninter-transmission waiting time in the range of 0.33 seconds to one second must elapse before another\naircraft in the corridor can transmit. After the completion of the first aircraft\xe2\x80\x99s transmission, one of the\naircraft which has not transmitted during the current refresh period will initialize with the LEO satellite\nsystem. Aircraft will begin to initialize their transmitters 20 seconds prior to their scheduled transmission.\nThe initialization time is not a factor in the calculations because while aircraft n+1 up to aircraft n+65\n(for 0.33 second inter-transmission waiting time; n+40 for 0.5 second inter-transmission waiting time;\nn+20 for 1 second inter-transmission waiting time) are initializing, aircraft n is transmitting so\ninitialization does not contribute a delay to actual operations. This process will continue until all aircraft\nin the corridor transmit their position information during each system refresh period.\nFigure 10 shows an example diagram for Case 1. Note that each aircraft in the corridor has its unique\ntransmission time assignment, represented by {T1, T2, T3,}. These time assignments do not reflect the\nfrequency or time slot that is assigned for the transmission during initialization. It is assumed in the\ndiagram that there are zero conflicts for frequency and time slot assignment.\n\nFigure 10.\xe2\x80\x94Example Diagram for Method 1, Case 1.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942005-213631\n\n12\n\nCase 2.\xe2\x80\x94In the second case of Method 1, the transmitting aircraft has knowledge of the position\ninformation of neighboring aircraft as well as its own, and those aircraft have knowledge, by use of a\nstatus bit, that a particular aircraft will transmit their position information messages. Therefore, those\nsurrounding aircraft will not attempt to initialize and transmit through the LEO satellite system. By\ninsisting that the number of messages that each transmitting aircraft sends be the same, system refresh\ntime can be reduced. The result is fewer transmitting aircraft, fewer messages sent over the LEO satellite\nsystem, and a reduction in recurring cost.\nFigure 11 shows an example diagram for Case 2. Note that each transmitting aircraft in the corridor\nhas its unique transmission time assignment, represented by {T1, T2, T3,}. These time assignments do\nnot reflect the frequency or time slot that is assigned for the transmission during initialization. It is\nassumed in the diagram that there are zero conflicts for frequency and time slot assignment. Also, note the\ntransmission links between aircraft. This represents the sharing of position reports on a different link than\nthe LEO satellite system link. The link for sharing these reports is of Automatic Dependent Surveillance \xe2\x80\x93\nBroadcast (ADS-B).\nThe order for which the aircraft will transmit in Method 1 can be accomplished through coordination\nwith ATC. At the time that aircraft are entering the corridor, they are still within HF range. Therefore,\nusing HF communications, ATC can specify the ADS contracts for an initial transmission time to each\naircraft as they enter the corridor, as well as the amount of time between transmissions (system refresh\nperiod). Since ATC would be monitoring the flow of traffic over the corridor, it would have knowledge of\nwhen aircraft are exiting the corridor, so transmission slots can be reassigned to new aircraft entering the\ncorridor.\n\nFigure 11.\xe2\x80\x94Example Diagram for Method 1, Case 2.\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942005-213631\n\n13\n\nThe required system refresh period for Method 1 is the minimum system refresh period that N number\nof aircraft will require to transmit their position information to ATC once. This minimum system refresh\nperiod, (TMIN1(N,b)), is a function of the number of aircraft in the corridor (N) and the number of messages\nper transmission (b). Equation (6) computes the minimum system refresh period.\n\n\xe2\x8e\x9b\n\xe2\x8e\xa1 b \xe2\x88\x97 8 * L ADS \xe2\x8e\xa4\n\xe2\x8e\x9c TFRAME \xe2\x88\x97 \xe2\x8e\xa2\n\xe2\x8e\xa5 + TWAIT\n\xe2\x8e\x9c\n\xe2\x8e\xa3 R D \xe2\x88\x97 TFRAME \xe2\x8e\xa6\nTMIN1 ( N , b) = \xe2\x8e\x9c\n60 sec/ min\n\xe2\x8e\x9c\n\xe2\x8e\x9c\n\xe2\x8e\x9d\nwhere:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x8e\x9e\n\xe2\x8e\x9f\n\xe2\x8e\x9f \xe2\x8e\x9b\xe2\x8e\xa1 N \xe2\x8e\xa4\xe2\x8e\x9e\n\xe2\x8e\x9f\xe2\x88\x97\xe2\x8e\x9c\xe2\x8e\xa2 b \xe2\x8e\xa5\xe2\x8e\x9f\n\xe2\x8e\x9f\n\xe2\x8e\x9c\n\xe2\x8e\x9f \xe2\x8e\x9d\xe2\x8e\xa3 \xe2\x8e\xa6\xe2\x8e\xa0\n\xe2\x8e\x9f\n\xe2\x8e\xa0\n\n(6)\n\nN = number of aircraft in the corridor\nb = number of messages per transmission\nLADS = length of ADS message of 80 bytes\nTFRAME = Iridium TDMA frame time of 0.090 seconds\nRD = System data rate of 2.4 kbps\nTWAIT = 0.33, 0.5, and 1 second inter-transmission waiting times between different aircraft\ntransmissions\n\nTable 8 shows the minimum system refresh period for the peak traffic load of 56 aircraft for the Gulf\nof Mexico over the three inter-transmission waiting times.

Note that for each case of b, the number of messages per transmission,\nthe resulting graph is a straight line that associates number of aircraft that can be supported at a given\nseparation with the specified maximum system refresh period for that given separation.\nAs separation increases, for a given value of b, the system refresh period also increases. The reason is,\nas aircraft are further apart, there is a less frequent need for position updates to maintain good separation\nknowledge (see fig. 9). Figure 12 shows that for a given value of b, as separation increases, the maximum\nnumber of aircraft also increases. As just stated, separation increases relate directly to increases in\nmaximum system refresh period. In turn, increasing maximum system refresh period will directly increase\nthe number of messages that can be sent. Finally, the number of aircraft that can be supported will\nincrease, by a factor of b, as the number of messages sent increases. Intuitively, as the number of\nmessages per transmission increases, then the time required for a single transmission will increase, which\nwill decrease the number of possible transmission sent during a given time interval. However, as the\nnumber of possible transmissions sent will decrease, the overall number of aircraft that the system can\nhandle will increase due to the larger number of aircraft position reports being sent per transmission.\n\nFigure 12.\xe2\x80\x94Maximum Number of Aircraft\xe2\x80\x940.33 Second\nInter-Transmission Waiting Time.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942005-213631\n\n15\n\nEquation (8) computes the overall maximum number of aircraft in the corridor as the lower bound\nbetween the geometrical capacity and the communication scheme capacity at varying separations.\n\nC1 ( ASEP , b) = MIN (C G ( ASEP ), C C1 ( ASEP , b))\n\n(8)\n\nGiven the maximum system refresh period, the maximum number of aircraft that the corridor can\nsustain for Method 1 is computed for the three inter-transmission waiting times. The results are plotted in\nfigures 13 through 15 for inter-transmission waiting times of 0.33, 0.5, and 1.0 seconds, respectively.\n\nFigure 13.\xe2\x80\x94Maximum Number of Aircraft\xe2\x80\x940.33 Second\nInter-Transmission Waiting Time.\n\nFigure 14: Maximum Number of Aircraft\xe2\x80\x940.5 Second\nInter-Transmission Waiting Time.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942005-213631\n\n16\n\nFigure 15.\xe2\x80\x94Maximum Number of Aircraft\xe2\x80\x94\n1.0 Second Inter-Transmission Waiting Time.\nFigures 13 through 15 show the combined effects of geometric and communications systems limits\nfor the Gulf of Mexico. The right hand boundaries observed in figures 13 through 15 represent the\ngeometric limits for maximum possible number of aircraft, as a function of aircraft separation (see fig. 4),\nwhile the straight lines represent communications limits based on maximum system refresh period, as a\nfunction of aircraft separation (see fig. 12).\nTable 9 lists the results for the three lateral/longitudinal separations versus the number of messages\nper transmission versus the inter-transmission waiting time for the Gulf of Mexico. Note that Method 1\ncan easily accommodate the current peak density of traffic in all cases.\nTABLE 9.\xe2\x80\x94MAXIMUM NUMBER OF AIRCRAFT\xe2\x80\x94METHOD 1\n50 NMi\n30 NMi\nMessages per Transmission\n0.33 sec 0.5 sec\n1.0 sec 0.33 sec 0.5 sec\n1.0 sec 0.33 sec\n\n1\n2\n4\n12\n\n616\n616\n616\n616\n\n616\n616\n616\n616\n\n616\n616\n616\n616\n\n1016\n1016\n1016\n1016\n\n1016\n1016\n1016\n1016\n\n662\n1016\n1016\n1016\n\n511\n704\n868\n1020\n\n15 NMi\n0.5 sec\n398\n588\n776\n972\n\n1.0 sec\n241\n398\n588\n864\n\nFrom these three inter-transmission waiting times, the best results in terms of maximum number of\naircraft in the region occur when the inter-transmission waiting time is 0.33 seconds. This is because the\n0.33 second inter-transmission waiting time results in less time between transmissions which allows more\naircraft to transmit in a given system refresh period. The largest maximum corridor capacity occurs over\nthe 15 NMi separation at 1020 aircraft at 0.33 second inter-transmission waiting time with 12 messages\nper transmission.\nMethod 2\n\nIn the maximum aircraft transmission at a time method, two possibilities were again considered. In\nthe first case, transmitting aircraft send only their own position information. In the second case, the\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942005-213631\n\n17\n\nmaximum number of transmitting aircraft sends their own plus information of its neighbors\xe2\x80\x99 position\ninformation.\nCase 1.\xe2\x80\x94In the first case of Method 2, a maximum number of aircraft in the corridor will transmit\ntheir position information. This maximum number of concurrent transmissions is determined from the\nnumber of available LEO satellite data transmission channels in a cell. However, as the distribution of\naircraft is dynamic over the moving LEO satellite cells, the maximum possible number of concurrent\ntransmissions in the corridor is the maximum number of active data channels in a single cell. Once the\nfirst group of 65 aircraft transmits their position information, an inter-transmission waiting time\nseparation is elapsed before another group of 65 aircraft begins to initialize and transmit to the LEO\nsatellite system. In this method, the initialization time is a factor because group n+1 might be partially, or\nfully, covered within the same cell(s) as group n. This cycle will repeat as necessary for all the aircraft in\nthe corridor to transmit their position information during each system refresh period.\nFigure 16 shows an example diagram for Case 1. Note that each aircraft in the corridor has a\ntransmission time assignment, represented by {T1, T2, T3,}. These time assignments do not reflect the\nfrequency or time slot that is assigned for the transmission during initialization. It should be noted that\nseveral aircraft have the same transmission time assignment {T1, T2,}. For those with the same time\nassignment, transmissions will take place concurrently. It is assumed in the diagram that there are zero\nconflicts for frequency and time slot assignment. Thus, if two aircraft are in the same cell and have the\nsame time assignment, then they will be on a different frequency or time slot from each other.\n\nFigure 16.\xe2\x80\x94Example Diagram for Method 2, Case 1.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942005-213631\n\n18\n\nCase 2.\xe2\x80\x94In the second case of Method 2, the transmitting aircraft have knowledge of the position\ninformation of surrounding aircraft as well as their own, and those aircraft have knowledge that a set of\naircraft will transmit their position information messages. Therefore, those surrounding aircraft will not\nattempt to initialize and transmit through the LEO satellite system. By insisting that the number of\nmessages that each transmitting aircraft sends be the same, system refresh time can be reduced. The result\nis fewer transmitting aircraft, fewer messages sent over the LEO satellite system, and a reduction in\nrecurring cost.\nFigure 17 shows an example diagram for Case 2. Note that each transmitting aircraft in the corridor\nhas a transmission time assignment, represented by {T1, T2, T3,}. These time assignments do not reflect\nthe frequency or time slot that is assigned for the transmission during initialization. Also, note the\ntransmission links between aircraft. This represents the sharing of position reports on a different link than\nthe LEO satellite system link. The link for sharing these reports is ADS-B. For those with the same time\nassignment, transmissions will take place concurrently. It is assumed in the diagram that there are zero\nconflicts for frequency and time slot assignment. Thus, if two aircraft are in the same cell and have the\nsame time assignment, then they will be on a different frequency or time slot from each other.\nThe order for which the aircraft will transmit in Method 2 can be accomplished through coordination\nwith ATC. At the time that aircraft are entering the corridor, they are still within HF range.

This is because the\n0.33 second inter-transmission waiting time results in less time between transmissions which allows more\naircraft to transmit in a given system refresh period. The largest maximum corridor capacity occurs over\nthe 15 NMi separation at any of the three inter-transmission waiting times with at least four messages per\ntransmission.\n\nCorridor Loading Improvement\nHaving shown two methods for which the system of aircraft can transmit their data to ATC within the\nmaximum allowed system refresh period, a traffic loading improvement measure will be considered.\nThe measure compares the maximum number of aircraft of the two transmission methods against the\ncurrent peak traffic density. A single message per transmission (b = 1) represents an aircraft having to\nknow only its own position, which is the worst case scenario for the system. Table 12 shows the percent\ndifferences between the peak traffic of 56 aircraft in the Gulf of Mexico and the number of aircraft\ncalculated previously and shown in table 9 (for Method 1) and table 11 (for Method 2). Table 12 is based\non equation (12), where N represents the number of aircraft that can be placed in the corridor at the\nspecified separations for any of the three inter-transmission waiting times.\n% Increase = 100 *\n\nN \xe2\x88\x92 267\n267\n\n(12)\n\nTABLE 12.\xe2\x80\x94ABSOLUTE PERCENT INCREASE IN MAXIMUM AIRCRAFT\nMethod 1\nMethod 2\nLat/Long\nb\nSeparation\n0.33 sec\n0.5 sec\n1.0 sec\n0.33 sec\n0.5 sec\n1.0 sec\n\n50 NMi\nSeparation\n\n30 NMi\nSeparation\n\n15 NMi\nSeparation\n\n1\n2\n4\n12\n1\n2\n4\n12\n1\n2\n4\n12\n\n1000\n1000\n1000\n1000\n1714\n1714\n1714\n1714\n813\n1157\n1450\n1721\n\n1000\n1000\n1000\n1000\n1714\n1714\n1714\n1714\n611\n950\n1286\n1636\n\n1000\n1000\n1000\n1000\n1082\n1714\n1714\n1714\n330\n611\n950\n1443\n\n1000\n1000\n1000\n1000\n1714\n1714\n1714\n1714\n1627\n3311\n3457\n3457\n\n1000\n1000\n1000\n1000\n1714\n1714\n1714\n1714\n1613\n3282\n3457\n3457\n\n1000\n1000\n1000\n1000\n1714\n1714\n1714\n1714\n1573\n3204\n3457\n3457\n\nTable 12 shows the largest overall percentage increase in traffic over the current peak traffic density\noccurs with the following conditions:\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942005-213631\n\n23\n\n15 NMi separation\nMethod 2\n4 or 12 messages per transmission\nAny of the three inter-transmission waiting times\nIf implementation allows only a single message per transmission, then the largest percentage increase\nin traffic density occurs with the following conditions:\n30 NMi separation\nMethod 1 (0.33 or 0.5 second inter-transmission waiting times) or Method 2\n\nConclusions and Future Work\nThis study is a high level, theoretical effort to understand and analyze oceanic aircraft traffic loading\nover the Gulf of Mexico. Numerous assumptions were made but care was taken to list them all. In a\ntechnical sense, given that the assumptions are correct, then the increases in traffic capacity shown in this\nreport are also correct. The results generally show capacity increases when combining reduced aircraft\nseparation requirements with ADS transmissions to ATC. Such capacity increases suggest that\nintroducing ADS data over satellite communications links will accommodate potential traffic growth. It is\nstrongly cautioned that incorporating procedural requirements could change the results.\nThis study established an analytical methodology to analyze this kind of scenario. Table 4 shows that\nbased only on geometry, the Gulf of Mexico can support 616 aircraft at a separation of 50 NMi. Note that\n50 NMi is the current mandated oceanic separation, and is based on a lack of surveillance data. That being\nso, adding ADS transmissions through an AMSS are of no benefit for 50 NMi separation situations.\nHowever, ADS transmissions can be the enablers for reduced separations. Even though traffic growth as\nhigh as 600 flights is anticipated, any increase in traffic that would be implemented through a separation\nreduction can not be accomplished without the benefits of an ADS/AMSS solution.\nFuture work in this area could include a comparison of other satellite systems with a consideration for\nmore specific corridor loading limitations and predicted future growth. Analysis of newly defined oceanic\nrequirements can be made as they arise. Also, this type of analysis over the Gulf of Mexico can be applied\nto other oceanic regions, (i.e., Western Atlantic Corridor, Polar Corridor), with similar additional\ncomparisons done on those corridors as well.\n\nReferences\n1.

ABSTRACT (Maximum 200 words)\n\nAir traffic control (ATC) mandated, aircraft separations over the oceans impose a limitation on traffic capacity for a\ngiven corridor, given the projected traffic growth over the Gulf of Mexico. The separations result from a lack of\nacceptable situational awareness over oceans where radar position updates are not available. This study considers the\nuse of Automatic Dependent Surveillance (ADS) data transmitted over a commercial satellite communications system\nas an approach to provide ATC with the needed situational awareness and thusly allow for reduced aircraft separations.\nThis study uses Federal Aviation Administration data from a single day for the Gulf of Mexico to analyze traffic loading\nto be used as a benchmark against which to compare several approaches for coordinating data transmissions from the\naircraft to the satellites.\n\n14.
