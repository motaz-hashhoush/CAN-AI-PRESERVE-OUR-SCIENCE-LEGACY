The objective of the experiments is to investigate the physical properties of satellite fragments, including those originated from Multi-Layer Insulation (MLI) and solar panels. The ultimate goal is to use the results to improve the NASA Standard Breakup Model. The targets were two cubic micro-satellites, 20 cm by 20 cm by 20 cm in size, and approximately 1,500 g in mass. The main structure of each micro-satellite was composed of five layers; the top and bottom layers and three internal layers parallel to the top and bottom layers, plus four side panels. The top layer was equipped with solar cells that was mounted to an aluminum honeycomb sandwich panel with CFRP face sheets. The four side panels and the bottom layer are all covered with MLI. The two satellite impact experiments were conducted using the two-stage light gas gun at the Kyushu Institute of Technology in Kitakyusyu, Japan. For the first experiment (labeled Shot F), the satellite was oriented in such a way that the solar panel was facing the incoming projectile, a 39.3 g aluminum alloy solid sphere. For the second experiment (labeled Shot R), the satellite was oriented so that the solar panel was on the opposite side of the impact surface. The projectile used in the second shot was a 39.2 g aluminum alloy solid sphere. The impact speeds of Shot F and Shot R were 1.74 km/s and 1.78 km/s, respectively. The ratio of the impact kinetic energy to satellite mass for the two experiments was about 40 J/g. Both target satellites were completely fragmented, although there were noticeable differences in the characteristics of the fragments. Approximately 1,800 fragments were collected from Shot F but only 1,000 fragments were collected from Shot R. This difference primarily comes from the number of needle-like CFRP and MLI fragments. The difference in CFRP pieces depends on how the CFRP panels were fragmented. Regarding the MLI pieces, a significant difference in size and number can be observed. The largest MLI pieces in Shot F are almost of the same size as the side panels, whereas those in Shot R are larger by about a factor of two. The collected fragments and MLI pieces will be measured and analyzed using the same method as described in the NASA Standard Breakup Model. This paper will present: (1) the area-to-mass ratio, size, and mass distributions of the fragments, and (2) the differences in fragment properties between Shot F and Shot R.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20090007798, "endDate": "2009-04-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "European Space Agency.
