NASA asked\nthat the study also consider how these applications would influence or be\ninfluenced by the Space Shuttle System, the principal space transportation\nsystem of the 1980 1 s. In December 1973, the Academy agreed to perform the\nstudy and assigned the task to the Space Applications Board (SAB).\nIn the summers of 1967 and 1968, the National Academy of Sciences had\nconvened a group of eminent scientists and engineers to determine what research\nand development was necessary to permit the exploitation of useful applications\nof earth-oriented satellites. The SAB concluded that siace the NAS study,\noperational weather and communications satellites and the successful first\nyear of use of the experimental Earth Resources Technology Satellite had demonstrated conclusively a technological capability that could form a foundation\nfor expanding the useful applications of space-derived information and services,\nand that it was now necessary to obtain, from a broad cross-section of potential\nusers, new ideas and needs that might guide the development of future space\nsystems for practical applications.\nAfter discussions with NASA and other interested federal agencies, it\nwas agreed that a major aim of the "summer study" should be to involve, and\nto attempt to understand the needs of, resource managers and other decisionmakers who had as yet only considered space systems as experimental rather\nthan as useful elements of major day-to-day operational information and service\nsystems. Under the general direction of the SAB, then, a representative group\nof users and potential users conducted an intensive two-week study to define\nuser needs that might be met by information or services derived from earthorbiting satellites. This work was done in July 1974 at Snowmass, Colorado.\nFor the study, nine user-oriented panels were formed, comprised of present\nor potential public and private users, including businessmen, state and local\ngovernment officials, resource managers, and other decision-makers. A number\n\n*Effective July 1, 1974, the National Academy of Sciences and the National\nAcademy of Engineering reorganized the National Research Council into eight\nassemblies and commissions. All National Academy of Engineering program units,\nincluding ,he SAB, became the Assembly of Engineering.\niii\n\nof scientists and technologists also participated, functioning essentially\nas expert consultants. The assignment made to the panels included reviewing\nprogress in space applications since the NAS study of 1968* and defining user\nneeds potentially capable of being met by space-system applications.

A substantial amount of interaction with the user panels\nwas designed into the study plan and was found to be both desirable and necessary.\nThe major part of the stud , was accomplished by the panels. The function\nof the SAB was to review the work of the panels, to evaluate their findings,\nand to derive from their work an integrated set of major conclusions and recommendations. The Board\'s findings, which include certain significant recommendations from the panel reports, as well as more general ones arrived at by\nconsidering the work of the study as a whole, are contained in a report prepared by the Board.**\nIt should be emphasized that the study was riot desi.-r.ed to make detailed\nassessments of all of the factors which should be considered in establishing\npriorities.

In some cases, analyses of costs and benefits will be needed.\nIn this connection, specific cost-benefit studies were not conducted as a part\nof the two-week study. Recommendations for certain such analyses, however,\nappear in the Board\'s report, together with recommendations designed to provide\nan improved basis upon which to make cost-benefit assessments.\nIn sum, the study was designed to provide an opportunity for knowledgeable\nand experienced users, expert in their fields, to express their needs for\ninformation or services which might (or might not) be met by space systems,\nand to relate the present and potential capabilities of space systems to their\nneeds. The study did not attempt to examine in detail the scientific, technical, or economic bases for the needs expressed by the users.\nThe SAB was impressed by the quality of the panels\' work and has asked\nthat their reports be made available as supporting documents for the Board\'s\nreport.

The\nPanel was impressed with the existing systems and the degree to which they have\nbecome an integral part of the meteorological program in the United States.\nLow-altitude and geostationary satellites provide timely and essential data to\nthe operational forecasts of the National Meteorological Center; a car;;fully\nconsidered R&D program is directed toward the long-range improvement of the\noperational system. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)\nand the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) are both to\nbe congratulated on the success of the meteorological satellite program.\nIn the field of meteorology, the existing space applications program has\nbeen constructively responsive to national initiatives. One set of goals was\nadvanced by the Panel on Meteorology during the 1967-68 Summer Study on Space\nApplications.* The recommendations prepared during that study follow, together\nwith an indication of the current status of each:\nThe central recommendation of the 1967-68 report called for NASA\n1.\t\nto "...continue to direct its meteorological satellite program to meeting the\nobservational requirements of GARP (Global Atmospheric Research Program) and\nthe World Weather Watch programs...."** To implement this program, and particularly to support the First CARP Global Experiment (FGGF), it was proposed to\ndevelop an integrated space-based system to provide global coverage in the late\n1970\'s for synoptic-scale forecasting.*** There were to be four geostationary\nmeteorological satellites and one or two sun-synchronous near-earth satellites,\nwith associated ground (ocean buoy) and airborne (balloon) platforms to be\ninterrogated from space.\nIt is now planned that there will be five geostationary satellites\nin operation by early 1978, two of which are to be operated by the U.S.\n(the first was successfully put into operation in May 1974), one by Japan,\none by the European Space Agency (ESA), and one by the U.S.S.R. The technical characteristics of these satellites are being coordinated for optimum\n\n*National Research Council.

National Academy of Sciences,\nWashington, U.C., 1969.\n**Report of the Panel on Meteorology, p. 5.\n***See Table I (p. 5) for definition of meteorological scales.\n\ncompatibility of the information produced and for data-relay capabilities.\nTwo sun-s y nchronous near-earth satellites with advanced sounding systems and\nplatform-location and data-relay capabilities are scheduled for launch in late\n1977 and early 1978. Instrumented drifting buoys, constant-level balloons, and\nlarge carrier balloons with wind-finding dropsonde dispensers are under active\ndevelopment; extensive field tests will be carried out in 1974-75 in conjunction\nwith tY^e NIMBUS-F satellite. Costs are anticipated to be within those recommended in the 1967-68 study in order to make these techniques economically viable.\n\nThe first recommendation of the 1967-68 study is nearing fulfillment.\n2.\nA second major recommendation called for the development of a fully\nintegrated meteorological geosynchronous satellite to be available by 1971.\nBoth visible and infrared images were to be displayed in real time, and equipment\nwas called for which would be able to present time-lapse views of the images.*\nThe NASA and NOAA Synchronous Meteorological Satellite (SMS) and\nGeostationar^- Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) series were inaugurated\nin May 1974 with high-resolution visible and medium-resolution infrared (IR)\nimaging capability. The first satellite is performing to specification. A\nlimited operational ground display system has been developed and implemented,\nand equipment for high-resolution display and p i -t.ure production is also operating on an exp,^ \xe2\x80\xa2 imental basis. Various methods of time-lapse display of images\nhave been use\' or are in process of development. This recommendation has been\n\ni.mp lemerted.\nA third recommendation called for IR and microwave vertical temperature\n3.\nsounders to be used on both polar-orbiting and geostationary satellites and to\nbe capable of satisfying known data requirements for synoptic-scale numerical\nweather forecasting.\nThe IR sounders are in operational use on polar-orbiting satellites.\nHowever, the accuracy of temperature measurement is not adequate: errors average\nbetween 2\xc2\xb0C and 3\xc2\xb0C compared with a requirement of 1\xc2\xb0C. A microwave sounder was\nflown successfully on NIMBUS-5 and it is planned to include microwave sounders,\nalong with advanced IR sounders (more channels and higher resolution) on a new\nIR and microoperational series of low-altitude satellites starting in 1977-78. \t\nwave sounders have not yet been flown on geostationary satellites. Thus, the\n\nimplementation of this recommendation is still incomplete.\n4.\nThe final two recommendations of the 1967-08 study dealt with development of light-weight, safe, low-cost meteorological packages for constant-level\nballoons, and for techniques of sounding the atmosphere through clouds by use of\n\nmicrowaves. The required deveZopments are either prcver, or atout to be tested,\nand the outlook is very positive for useful op6raticnaZ systems.\n\n*Report of the Panel on Meteorology, p. 5.\n\n2\n\nIn some other areas the meteorological satellite program has moved more\nrapidly than could have been anticipated in 1967-68. For example, data transmitted by geostationary satellites are now being used operationally by NOAA\nto determine atmospheric winds. This technique, which was not foreseen in 1967,\nhas proven to be valuable in the preparation of weather forecasts.\nIt has already been noted that developments in the meteorological spac_\xe2\x80\xa2\napplications program have been closely coordinated with the objectives of the\nWorld Weather Watch program, especially GARP. Detailed plans for a meteorological Global Observing System are bein\xc2\xa3 readied for FGGE. Much of the current\nhigh-priority R&D in the meteorological space applications program is being\nundertaken to contribute to the success of FGGE.\nIt is important to note, however, that the goals of meteorology are broader\nthan the assessment of the feasibility of extending synoptic-scale forecasting.\nA major statement of these goals was set forth in a report published by the\nCommit t ee on Atmospheric Sciences of the National Academy of Sciences.* These\ngoals were (1) to extend useful forecasting capability, (2) to contribute to the\ndevelopment of the capability to manage and control the concentrations of air\npollutants, (3) to establish mechanisms for the national examinations of deliberate and inadvertent means for modifying weather and climate, and (4) to reduce\nsocial, economic, and human losses caused by weather.\nThe recommendations in the present study deal explicitly with goals (1)\nand (4). They also deal with goals (2) and (3) in areas where the monitoring\nof associated meteorological parameters from space has contributed to the\ndevelopment of useful management or modification techniques.\n\n*Committee on Atmosphezic Sciences, National Research Council.\n\nSciences and Man\'s Needs: Priorities for the Future.\nSciences, Washington, D.C.,\n\n1971.\n\n3\n\nThe Atmospheric\n\nNational Academy of\n\nSPACE APPLICATIONS TO METEOROLOGY\n\nSpace and time scal--s of motion in operational meteorology range over a\nwide spectrum from local, transitory weather phenomena to global, climatic\nchanges, as outlined in Table I.\n\nTable I\t\n\nRange of Meteorological Scales\n\nApproximate Time Scale \t\n\nApproximate Area\nof Influence\n\nLocal present weather\t\n\n0 to 2 hours\t\n\n150 km\n\nShort range (mesoscale) \t\n\n2 to 12 hours\t\n\n1000 km\n\nSynoptic\t\n\n1 day to 1 week\t\n\nHemispheric\n\nLong range and climate\t\n\n2 weeks or more\t\n\nGlcbal\n\nScale\t\n\nThe observational methods and the prediction techniques vary markedly\nthroughout the range from the smallest to the large t scale.\n\nPRESENT-WEATHER DISPLAY\nIn its 1971 report, the Committee on Atmospheric Sciences of the National\nAcademy of Sciences placed a high priority on the development of comprehensive\nsystems for monitoring present weather, wits the information being made continuously available to broad categories of users. Input data might be derived from\nsatellite and radar observations and from a network of low-cost, unmanned\nweather stations interrogated by computer. The combined output could be distributed to the general public and other users by television or other comnwnication systems.\nInformation on localized weather for periods of up to 2 hours is becoming\nincreasingly important to the decision-making processes of a wide variety of\nusers. Additionally, the display of local present weather is vital in alerting\n\n5\n\nPRECEDING PAGE BLANK NOR 71iUM\n\n1\ni\n\nthe public to hazardous weather. Space platforms offer a practical source\nof data for the timely display of present-weather information and a possible\nvehicle for the rapid dissemination of warnings.\nThe wide demand for present-weather Oata has been demonstrated by the\nextensive use of the Automatic Picture Transmission (APT) system, now part of\nthe NOAH satellite series. Over 1,000 users purchased or constructed specialized\nground equipment in order to receive these pictures. This represents a voluntary\nexiendituro of approximately $10 million. Since this weather data is obtained\nfrom low-a.ltitude satellites, it is available only twice daily. The continuous\nflow of data from geostationary satellite systems would increase manyfuld the\nutility of present-weather information.\n\nRECOM ENDATION - The Panel on Weather and Climate recommend:? the development of a Zcw-cast readout system from three-axis-stabilized geostationari,\nsatellites for the display of local present weather in real time. This could\nbe part of a broad present-weather information network. 7o test the e ffectivenesa of such a system, the Panel recommends that a resent-weather pilot\nproject be undertaken in a region that includes both urban and i>uraZ areas.\n\nSHORT-RANGE FORECASTS\nA simple extrapolation of the movement of small-scale weather systems,\nsuch as thunderstorms, will usually provide a successful weather forecast for\nonly a short period of time, generally 1 to 2 hours. Beyond this, it will be\nnecessary for meteorologists to devise forecasting methods to modify extrapolation. The result will be to change in an appropriate way, projec t ions of the\ndirection of motion, the speed, and the rate of development of t: isting weather\nsystems. With the addition of new forecasting techniques, it is probable that\nforecasts can be effectively extended t.; a rsa ge of from 3 to 6 hours.\nIn developing these Forecasting techniques, it will be important to have\ninformation about the vertical structure of the atmosphere in particular local\nareas where short-tern forecasts are to be prepared. An IR-sounding capability\nfrom a geostationary platform would be an effective way of obtaining such \'.1ata.\nThe additional prevision of three-axis-stabilization would improve by one order\nof magnitude the time available for observation and therefore would greatly,\nenhance the capability of the system.\nExtending forecasts into t^:= 6-hour to 12-hour range will he a more\ndifficult problem and will require increasingly sophisticated models and more\nextensive observations, especially in the planetary houndary layer. Various\nexperimental studies on this time scale will need to be undertaken. NOAH has\nrecently begun to develop plans for a Severe Fnvironmental Storm and Mesoscale\nExperiment (SESAME) to be carried out over a 3-year period beginning in 1977\nor 1978. Satellite support of such ex p erimental programs is, of course, highly\ndesirable.\nAECOP\'FNDATION - The Panel recc\xe2\x80\x94vnends that NASA develop I.?-sounding capabi.Z-\n\nity from the geostationary Synchronous Meteorological Satellite in order to\nsupport the development of short-range forecasts of local weather. The development of a three- axis -stabilized geostationary platform ^\xc2\xb1ilZ suhstanti.zlly improve\nthe value of this System.\n\n6\n\nSYNOPTIC FORECASTS\nThe synoptic-scale dynamics of the atmosphere are becoming better understood thruugh international efforts such as CARP. These and similar efforts\nhave made it possible to simulate the general characteristics of the global\ncirculation of the atmosphere by numerical models for periods of 1 week or\nlonger. Hemispheric operational versions of such modus, which have more demanding data requirements, have led over the last 15 years to an extension of the\neffective predictability of synoptic-scale weather from 2 days to 3 days and\nhave permitted the National Weather Service to provide general outlooks of the\nweather 4 and 5 days in advance.\nTo e,:tend synoptic forecasting capabilities to 5 days or beyond within\nthe next decade, a world-wide atmosphere-ocean observing system is an absolute\nnecessity. By the early 1980\'s CARP results should give better insight into\nthe possibilities of extending synoptic-scale forecasts beyond S days and will\nalso provide a critical assessment of the observational requirements necessary\nto support such extended forecasts.\nThe costs associated with operating a global land-ocean-based synoptic\nobservation network are prohibitively high, on the order of $1 billion or more\nper year. It is obvious that a more effective alternative is a mix of existing\nland-ocean-based observations and those from a satellite system; this mixed\nobserving system should be capable of monitoring the atmosphere to measure the\nvertical temperature and humidity structure, the distribution and motion of\nclouds (from which atmospheric winds can be determined), and sea-surface temperature. An extensive data-relay capability for remote, earth-based automatic\nstations is also required.\nRECMENDATION - The PanPZ on Weather and Climate recommends (1) continued\nsupport for GARP in order to assess the possibilities of extending synopticscale forecasts; (2) continued R&D effort to improve temperature and humidity\nsea-surface temperatures, measurements of winds using\nsoundings, measurements\ncloud displacements in order to meet the accuracy and resolution requirements\nset forth for FGGE in 1978-79; and (3) continued R&D efforts toward the use\nspace techniques to provide wind profiles in the equatorial zone With better\nvertical resolution than is now possible by cZoud-tracking methods, inasmuch\nas the mixed balloon and satellite observing subsystem planned for FGGE may\nnot lend itself to operational use.\n\nof\n\nof\n\nLONG-RANGE WEATHER AND (,LI%\\TE PREDICTION\n\nIt now appears that the ability to predict determinately the state of the\natmosphere cannot be extended beyond approximately 2 weeks. Hence, the ability\nto make longer-range forecasts, if possible, may have to be handled iTL a statistical manner. This implies that meteorology will have to develop a different\nset of mathematical and 0-scriptive tools if it is to attack the problem of longrange weather and climate prediction. This effort is now in its infancy.\nA treatise is not undertaken here concerning the vital importance of the\nability to predict weather on the time scales of months, seasons, and years.\nSuffice it to say, the consensus of the Panel is that this capability is desperately needed by a growing civilization that has seriously strained its food\n\n7\n\nsupplies, natural resources, and distribution systems. Substantial efforts in\nlong-range weather and climate prediction must now begin in order to aid man\nin coping with the consequences of climatological vagaries (e.g., failure of\nfood and fiber crops).\nThe development and application of a method of long-range weather and\nclimate prediction require a comprehensive understanding of the interactions\nof the land-air-ocean system. In order to elucidate these interactions, a\ncapability must be developed to observe all important aspects of this complex\nsystem. Fortunately, many of the necessary observations are now or will soon\nbe taken on a routine, operational basis (e.g., atmospheric temperature profiles, water-vapor content, snow-ice cover, and cloud cover). This fortuitous\ncircumstance is a direct result of satellite capabilities developed for GARP.\nHowever, some necessary observations are not now being obta =-d. For instance,\nthere is a need to monitor the energy budget of the earth, for it is the net\nenergy (incoming minus outgoing) that is available to drive the system. For\nthe same reason, the surveillance of the world\'s oceans must be greatly improved, for their great heat capacity and inertia have an importance influence\non the atmosphere. Thus, it is important to know the heat content and field\nof motion of the m.xed layer and of the surface winds.\nThe parameters that characterize the climate of the land-air-ocean system\nmust be observed on a global basis over time periods ranging from years to\ndecades. Such observations are perhaps the key to development and verification\nof predictions of ., mate. Satellites and related systems offer the only costeffective hope of ttraining these data but, because of the requirements for\nlongtime records, stringent demands will be imposed on sensor stability, reliability, and calibration. The huge amount of data to be collected requires a\ndata-management capability that is not now in existence. (See section entitled\n"DATA MANAGEMENT," page 17.) Finally, it must be noted that effective pursuit\nof a climate prediction capability will require an explicit management commitment at the highest level of government.\n\nof\n\nRECOAfENDATIONS - The Panel recommends that (1) a program\nmeasuring\nthe global radiation budget must be instituted as soon as possible; this must\ninclude long-term measurements\nsolar radiation, albedo, and terrestrial IR\nemission; (2) ocean-monitoring capability must be greatly improved; highest\npriority should be given to measurement\nthe heat content and field of motion\nthe mixed Lager and\nsurface wind; and (3) quantitative surveillance\nthe atmospheric constituents that play a role in the global radiation balance\nmust be instituted.\n\nof\n\nof\n\nof\n\nof\n\nof\n\nAPPLICATIONS TO FIELDS OTHER THAN METEOROLOGY\n\nThe close and effective cooperation between NASA and NOAA has been largely\nresponsible for the development during the past several years of an extremely\nsuccessful environmental satellite system. Nevertheless, the Panel recognizes\nthat this cooperation has resulted in an almost exclusive focus of attention on\ndefining sensors and using satellite data for operational synoptic forecasting.\nNOAA is in the unique position of being the collector, the disseminator, the\narchivist, and the principal user of satellite meteorological data. NOAA also\ndefines meteorological requirements for operational satellite systems. This\nsituation has resulted in the efficient use of satellite weather data for forecast purposes, but in minimal use of these data by other users for other purposes.\nDisciplines in which meteorology is an extremely important component (such\nas environmental quality, agricultural meteorology, hydrology, ant oceanography)\ncould benefit from available satellite meteorological data in their research\nand operational programs. In addition, these data could be used effectively by\nindustry and commerce. Indeed, the potential economic benefit of the use of\nmeteorological data for such purposes may equal or exceed their use for forecast\npurposes.\nThere is a substantial need for the development of sensors to measure parameters important to other users; for example, the amount, nature, and intensity\nof precipitation; soil and snow moisture content; and sea-surface temperatures\nand winds. None of these data can be obtained with the required accuracy from\nexisting sensors.\nScientists and engineers in fields in which meteorological and climatological\nfactors are important should also have greater voice in the formulation of\nrequirements for meteorological data and sensors as well as in the mana-ement of\noperational systems. Some appropriate mechanism must be found to focus needed\nattention on such requirements without losing the benefits of the present close\ncooperation between NASA and NOAA.\nRECOMMENDATION - The Panel recommends that formal mechanisms be established\nto broaden the utilitu of the meteorologicaZ satellite program. The broadening\nshould provide for participation in program plr^ming by users of meteorological\ndata in such fields as agriculture, transportation, hydrology, and oceanography.\nThe operational meteoroZogical system should also be responsive to the needs of\nsuch disciplines for real-time data.\n\nHIGH \xe2\x80\x94 PRIORITY NEEDS WITHIN PRESENT SYSTEMS\n\nAn extensive R&D program in support of operational weather satellites is\nalready in existence. This program has been thoughtfully- constructed over a\nperiod of many years by a capable, dedicated group of meteorologists and\nengineers. A substantial group of R&D initiatives is well under way; others\nare under consideration.\nIn these circumstances, it would be surprising indeed if the Panel on\nWeather and Climate should find major deficiencies in the program as a result\nof this comparatively limited review. Many of the following recommendations\nare, therefore, designed to emphasize high-priority need- in areas where work\ni; already under way. It is clearly recognized that many of the recommendations\nwill require an extensive R&D commitment over an extended period of time.\n\nIMPROVED SOUNDING OF THE A71MOSPHERE\n\nThe primary contribution of operational satellites to weather forecasting\nis the determination of the vertical structure of the atmosphere, especially\ntemperature and humidity. Present IR soundings indicate the temperature structure with an accuracy of about 2\xc2\xb0C or 3\xc2\xb0C; an accuracy approaching that of radiosondes (about 1\xc2\xb0C) would be more useful. The resolution of present satellite\nobservations in clear air is approximately 40 km, a figure satisfactory for\nsynoptic forecasts.\nHowever, difficulties are encountered when substantial cloud cover exists.\nThe use of microwave sounders will to a considerable extent overcome these\nproblems. The successful operation of a non-scanning microwave sounder on\nNIMBUS-5 opens the way to development of a combined IR and microwave sounding\nsystem and, indeed, such a system is being developed for operational use.\nNeither the IR nor the microwave sounder, however, locates temperature inversions\nwell, especially the important inversion at the tropopause (the boundary between\nthe troposphere and the stratosphere).\t\nA limb-scanning IR sounder is being\nprepared for launch on NIMBUS-F in late 1974. A test of this instrument on\na balloon flight has proved its ability to locate the height of the tropopause\nand to obtain an accurate temperature profile.\nWith respect to humidity profiles, the total water vapor in a column is\nmeasurable to about 20% accuracy by present vertical sounders, and a future\nsounder will include two channels for water vapor determination. By 1978 it\nshould be possible to construct a crude two-parameter vertical profile with\n\n11\n\nPRECEDING PAGE BLANK NOT FUIM\n\n5\n\nan accuracy of 20% to 30%. The soun d ing, however, will be limited to the middle\nand lower troposphere, since the upper troposphere is too dry to emit adequate\nsignals in this band. A limb-scanning sounder may make it possible to extend\nthe humidity profile upward from the middle troposphere to the stratosphere.\nRECOMMENDATION - The Panel recommends that the vertical temperature sounding\ncapability be improved to approach more closely a 1\xc2\xb0C accuracy requirement.\nThe Panel strongly supports the concept\na combined IR and microwave sounder\nfor future operational systems and recommends that the possibility be kept open\nadding limb-scanning sounders as well.\n\nof\n\nof\n\nIMPROVED GEOSTATIONARY SATELLITES\nGeostationary meteorological satellites will become increasingly important\nin the operational meteorological system. Observational coverage is virtually\ncontinuous. These satellites are ideal for frequent monitoring of such phenomena\nas local severe storms; generally, these platforms are capable of repeated and\ndetailed examination of portions of the earth\'s atmosphere which are of particular interest or concern. Data from geostationary satellites are of key\nimportance to synoptic forecasts; such information will also be valuable in the\ndisplay of present-weather information to a wide variety of users.\nFour important improvements should be made in the geostationary satellite\nsystem:\nIR sounders should be incorporated into the existing satellite\nsystem as soon as possible.\nThree-axis-stabilized geostationary satellites should be used\nto replace the existing spin-stablized operational satellites.\nThis improvement would make it possible to view the earth\ncontinuously, with a gain in viewing efficiency by a factor of\n10 to 20.\nMicrowave sounders should be added to three-axis-stabilized\ngeostationary satellites as soon as possible.\nA low-cost local readout system should be developed to bring\nthe information directly to many users, public agencies and\nprivate organizations.\nRECOMMENDATION - The Panel recommends that high priority be given to a\nZong-term R&D effort to provide a new generation\ngeostationary satellites.\nThese improved satellites should be three-axis-stabilized, have the capability\nto view selectively sectors\nt;.e earth\'s disk, be provided with a low-cost\nlocal readout system, and incorporate advanced capability in temperature and\nhumidity sounding.\n\nof\n\nof\n\n12\n\nM\n\ni\n\nbwe.\xc2\xb5.\xe2\x80\x94_\xe2\x80\x94^.^ \xe2\x80\x94\n\niK\n\n\t\nOPERATIONAL RADIATION-BUDGET OBSERVATIONS\nPreparation of synoptic forecasts and climate predicticns requires substantially improved understanding of the radiation budget of the earth. Budget\ndetermination includes the measurement of solar radiation, the determination of\nthe earth\'s albedo, and the measurement of outgoing IR emissions. These measurements will ultimately be used to establish parameters for the energy budget in\nterms of other measurements of the state of the atmosphere, such as the nature\nand distribution of cloud cover and the vertical structure of temperature and\nhumidity.\nConsiderable work has already been undertaken in the development of the\nnecessary sensors, and experimental determinations of the earth\'s energy budget\nwill be taken from NIMBUS-F. However, accurate measurements from space of the\nearth\'s radiation balance will not be achieved easily. A host of special problems exists, such as the effect of viewing angle on albedo measurements. In\naddition, the use of polar-orbiting sun-synchronous satellites would introduce\nconsistent (diurnal) errors into the energy-budget determination. The elimination of such problems will require particular care.\n\nRECOMMENDATION - The Panel recommends that an operational capability to\nmeasure the radiation budget of the earth be developed as quickly as possible.\nStudies should be undertaken to determine the kind of multiple-satellite,\nmuZtiple-orbit system required to obtain good samplings of local times and of\nreflectance angles, to permit accurate determination of the average planetary\naZbedo. The operational system must provide long-term (that is, over decades)\ncontinuity and consistency of radiation measurements.\n\nMONITORING OCEANS\nThe ability of the oceans to store, redistribute, and release heat makes\nthem a prime factor in climate prediction. It is therefore vital that the seasurface temperature and the heat content of the upper layer of the ocean be\nobserved routinely. Also required are estimates of surface winds over the ocean\nand of near-surface currents. These data are vital to the development of models\nof climate.\nPresent measurements of sea-surface temperature, while encouraging, are not\naccurate enough to be of major use. However, future system improvements promise\nto provide the accuracy required. Considerable effort must be expended to\ndevelop a wind-measuring capability. The estimation of near-surface currents\nposes an even more difficult problem that has yet to be addressed.\n\nRr_COMMENDATION - The Panel recommends that an operational capability be\nundervaken as quickly as possible to measure climatically important oceanic\n\nvariables.\n\n13\n\na\n\nMONITORING ATMOSPHERIC CONSTITUENTS,\nPARTICULATE LOADING, AND AEROSOLS\nTheoretical studies have indicated that changes in the composition of\nthe atmosphere with regard to minor constitutents, particulate loading, and\naerosols can have a major effect on climate. The measured concentration of\ncarbon dioxide has increased about 25% in the last century. Substantial\nvariations in stratospheric ozone concentration are also suspected. Particulate\nloading and aerosol concentration are also believed to be increasing, although\nreliable data are lacking. Clearly, the intelligent management of man\'s\nactivities requires careful monitoring of the atmosphere in order to establish\na baseline, to detect trends, and to detect climatic changes. Satellite remotesensing techniques provide a possible major contribution to such a monitoring\nprogram. A number of promising techniques are to be tested on NIMBUS-G to\ndemonstrate their effectiveness.\nRECOMMENDATION - An operational capability to monitor climatically\nimportant atmospheric constituents, particulate loading, and aerosols should\nbe undertaken as quickly as possible.\n\nACCURATE DETERMINATION OF OCCURRENCE XND INTENSITY OF PRECIPITATION,\nSOIL MOISTURE, AND HATER CONTENT OF SNOW\nMicrowave emission has been used expn rimentally to delineate areas where\nheavy precipitation is occurring. Such observations are most easily made over\nthe ocean where there is substantially lower surface emission at these frequencies. Results have been sufficiently encouraging to warrant the development of\nan R&D program to measure precipitation on a world-wide basis. Such observations\nwould be particularly valuable not only in meteorology but also in a variety of\nother disciplines, such as water resources and agriculture. Soil moisture and\nthe water content of snow may alto be measurable through the use of microwaves.\nThe difficulties of instrumentation are many. Nevertheless, these types of\nobservations, which can best be made from meteorological satellites, would\nprovide invaluable information. An appropriate R&D program should be initiated\nto determine the feasibility of such measurements.\n\nThe Panel recommends an R&D effort to produce sensing\nand processing systems to provide information on the occurrence and intensity\nof precipitation and on the moisture content of soil and snow cover.\nRECOMMENDATION -\n\nIMPROVED DETERMINATION AND EVALUATION OF\nTHE ACCURACY OF EARTH OBSERVATIONS FROM SPACE\nIt is essential that users have access to detailed information concerning\nthe accuracy of meteorological measurements derived from satellite sensor\nsystems. A series of carefully planned ground-air-verification experiments\nwill be needed to compare the satellite-based observations with those obtained\nby the various land-based techniques. Information should also be provided on\nthe horizontal and vertical resolutions of the sensor systems and the derived\nobservations.\n14\n\nRECOMMENDATION - The Panel recommends that observations obtained or derived\nfrom satellite sensors be checked regularly against those from ground-based\nobserving methods with known degrees of accuracy. Results of such verification\ntests should be published and furnished to users along with the data. Information on the effective horizontal and vertical resolutions of the observations\nshould be provided as well.\n\n15\n\nDATA MANAGEMENT\n\nIt is evident that meteorological satellites of the future will necessarily\nprovide information to a much broader category of users than does the present\nsystem. New data-management techniques will have to be implemented to disseminate\nappropriate data to a variety of users on a current basis. In addition, the\ncategorizing and storing of historical data for climate-prediction models and\nother future uses will need to be more comprehensive and flexible. This is by\nno means a trivial problem. The vast amount of raw data transmitted to the\nground by weather satellites makes it mandatory to undertake a substantial amount\nof processing before the data are stored. A great deal of thought must go into\ndetermining the optimum method and system of processing in order to achieve maximum compression of data with a minimum loss of flexibility to potential users.\nIn studying this problem, the needs of fields other than weather forecasting\nmust be fully considered. Finally, in the design of the total system, consideration must also be given to the output of certain standard products such as\naverage-cloud charts, mean temperature, or average IR emission.\nRECOMEND/ TION - The Panel recommends that a comprehensive data-management\nscheme be implemented to utili ze and store more effectiveZy the vast quantities\nof information being obtained by meteorological satellites. The data system\nshould function to (1) provide meteorological information to the broad category\nof users not directly in weather forecasting, (2) catalog and store information:\nfor future use, and (3) design, develop, disseminate, and store sets of information products derived from satellite data.\n\nPRB\'WrNG PAGE BLAN$ N(g\n\n17\n\nUSE OF SPACE SHUTTLE AND SPACELAB\n\nThe space shuttle and spacelab will be useful for three kinds of activity\nimportant to meteorology and climate:\n1.\n\nAs a convenient test bed for very exploratory experiments,\nsuch as high-power laser Raman spectroscopy to determine the\ngas composition of the stratosphere, high-power laser experiments to map stratospheric aerosol layers, and active radar\nexperiments to map precipitation intensity.\n\n2.\n\nAs the only way now contemplated of providing means to obtain\naccurate absolute calibration of radiation sensors observing\nboth incoming solar and out-going terrestrial radiation.\nSecondary or even primary laboratory-type radiation standards\ncan be carried, perhaps once per year, on space-shuttle flights\nto obtain accurate observations against which to calibrate the\nsatellite instruments.\n\n3.\n\nAs a means of conducting zero-g experiments. A series of\nspecialized zero-g cloud-physics experiments has been proposed,\nwhich is the subject of a current feasibility study. These\nexperiments look promising but it is premature to draw any\nfirm conclusions concerning their importance to cloud-physics\nproblems and their desirability for inclusion in the spacelab\nprogram.\n\nIn addition, the space shuttle is expected to have adequate performance\nfor emplacement, servicing and replacement of operational low-altitude weather\nsatellites. Tug service is required for emplacement of geostationary weather\nsatellites. These services will be viable only if means can be provided to\nshare shuttle and tug payload-space and costs so that services are affordable.\n\nly\n\nfJtWED NG VAGE BLANK NOT\n\nFII3LM\n\nFUTURE APPLICATIONS\n\nr\t\n\nThe space applications program in meteorology is a mature effort. In\naddition to the operational system, a well developed R&D program exists. Most\nnovel ideas for meteorological observations from space have at least been discussed. Under the circumstances, it would be surprising indeed if the present\nPanel were able to identify major new opportunities for future development. It\nsiiould be noted, however, that some of the recommendations set forth herein\ninvolve advanced technology and may require two or more decades to implement\nfully.\nThis report would be deficient, however, if additional comments were not\npresented with regard to observational techniques which look promising for the\nfuture but have not been mentioned in the recommendations of the Panel. The\nfirst of these is radar, which might be used effectively in the global measurement of precipitation occurrence and intensity. Problems of background interference and power demand must be overcome. Doppler radar conceivably could be\nused to measure the wind velocity in clouds. A related long-term potential is\nthe use of lasers and the Doppler principle for wind determination in clear air.\nA different kind of possibility is the establishment of an earth-oriented\nmeteorological observatory on the moon. A simple first experiment for such an\nobservatory might be the measurement of the earth\'s albedo.\n\nPRECEDING PAGE BLANK NOT FILMEU\n\n21\n\nSUMMARY\n\nMany of the important recommendations made in the 1967-68 Summer Study on\nSpace Applications* have been implemented and have become or are now becoming\nintegral parts of the U.S. meteorology program. \t\nOther recommended developments\nhave not yet reached matur:.ty. They are still in the research and development\n(R&D) phase, although the outlook is promising that they will be incorporated\ninto the next generation of operational satellite systems. The emergence of\nan international program, the Global Atmospheric Research Program (CARP), with\nspecific observational requirements has helped to stimulate and accelerate much\nof this development. The First CARP Global Experiment (FGGE) will provide in\n1978-79 an intensive programmatic test of the applicability of these systems to\nspecific research and to prototype operational needs on a global\nNew needs are now apparent that are much broader than the CARP observational experiments and also encompass a much broader range of users than the\nweather-forecasting community. The Panel on Weather and Climate has specific\nrecommendations in the following areas:\n\nPRESENT-WEATHER DISFLAY\nCurrent and projected satellite systems provide the possibility of supplying timely, nearly instantaneous monitoring of small to medium weather systems\nwhose occurrence impacts diverse industrial, commercial, and agricultural\ncommunities, as well as the general public.

Projected performance of sensor systems for that period indicates\nthat the FGGE requirements will be met only marginally. The Panel recommends\n\ncontinued R&D efforts on remote-sensing techniques to assure that FGGE requirements will be met.\n\nLONG-RANGE WEATHER AND CLIMATE PREDICTION\nLong-range weather and climate prediction is an important area of activity\nwhich is now receiving much attention and is ripe for scientific investigation.\nSatellite systems will make it possible to observe and monitor on a long-term\nbasis many of the physical factors thought to De critical to establishing the\nmean or statistical state of the atmosphere for seasons, years, or decades.\nMany of these factors are manifested in their effet,ts on the radiation budget\nof the land-air-ocean system. Hence, critical attention must be paid to calibration, intercomparison, and periodic in situ recalibration of radiation sensors\na number\nobservation\non spacecraft. The Panel recommends initiation\n\nof\n\nof\n\nof\n\nthese climatic factors; an i.?:tensive program to investigate the time and space\nsampling needed to produce meaningful average values for large regions, as well\ncomparison and in-flight\nas for the entire globe; and the development\nmake itpossible to identify secular changes\nrecalibration procedures that\nthat mau be related to climatic trends or variations. Among such important long-\n\nof\n\nwill\n\nterm climatic factors are the incoming and outgoing radiation; the planetary\nalbedo; the heat content of the mixed layer in the oceans; the distribut,-)n of\nclouds at low, middle, and high levels; and any significant Chan^es in surface\nfeatures such as vegetation, land use, and snow and ice cover.\n\nOTHER USES OF WEATHER DATA\nMuch of th F information gathered by satellites for meteorological forecasting use can .,,, be processed for use by other gruups. Moreover, there are\nadditional parameters that could be obtained that would be of great use in agriculture and hydrology, to name but two fields. The Panel recommends that addi-\n\nof\n\nsetting\ntional user groups be brought into the decision-making process\npriorities for the development of new observing techniques and for the processing\nand storing of meteorological data, so that as ,aide as possible a spectrum of\nuser groups can Lenefit from the space-based meteorological satellite systems\nof the future.\n24\n\ni\n\nINTERFACE WITH SPACE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM\n\nThe Panel believes that the space shuttle and spacelab can contribute\nuniquely to solution of the radiation calibration problem by permitting secondary\nand (in the future) even prinary standards to be used for in-flight calibration\nof satellite sensor systems. Spacelab can also be used for accelerating R&D\nsensor system development_.\nThe space shuttle is Ca,ected to have adequate performance fo-, emplacement,\nse r, icing, and replacement of operational low-altitude weather satellites.
