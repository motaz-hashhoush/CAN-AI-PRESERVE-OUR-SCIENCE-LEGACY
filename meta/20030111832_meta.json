The variation of the volatility with water vapor partial pressure was consistent with Al(OH)3(g) formation. The enthalpy of reaction to form Al(OH)3(g) from alumina and water vapor was found to be 210 plus or minus 20 kJ/mol. Surface rearrangement of ground sapphire surfaces increased with water vapor partial pressure, temperature and volatility rate. Recession rates of alumina due to volatility were determined as a function of water vapor partial pressure and temperature to evaluate limits for use of alumina in long term applications in combustion environments.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "France", "submissionId": 20030111832, "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Electrochemical Society, Inc.", "location": "United States"}}, "meetingId": "8c5f6062e7bf411690cce92294849db7", "id": "19cb7871a4b24d2eb4fc5d649ccb38cc"}], "name": "Symposium on High Temperature Corrosion and Materials Chemistry, IV", "location": "Paris", "id": "8c5f6062e7bf411690cce92294849db7", "startDate": "2003-05-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20030111832, "id": "4aac82e6eb2341f09a56dccb088a979d", "publicationDate": "2003-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20030111832.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20030111832/downloads/20030111832.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20030111832/downloads/20030111832.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20030111832/downloads/20030111832.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
