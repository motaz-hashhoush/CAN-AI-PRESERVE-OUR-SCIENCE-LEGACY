Using satellite imagery, the company can produce detailed maps that separate coffee cropland from wild vegetation and show information on the health of specific crops. The data can control coffee prices and eventually may be used to optimize application of fertilizers, pesticides and irrigation. This would result in maximal crop yields, minimal pollution and lower production costs. VIP is a mechanism involving NASA funding designed to accelerate the growth of commercial remote sensing by promoting general awareness and basic training in the technology.", "title": "Accelerating Commercial Remote Sensing", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T12:52:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020078406, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020078406, "id": "6dbcdb632a7644daa04b6ec0c61c6da3", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1995", "publicationDate": "1995-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20010075521, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Spinoff 1995", "stiType": "BOOK", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020078406.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020078406/downloads/20020078406.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020078406/downloads/20020078406.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020078406/downloads/20020078406.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
