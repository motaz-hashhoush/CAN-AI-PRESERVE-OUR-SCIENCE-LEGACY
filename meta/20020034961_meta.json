Atmospheric models would suggest that this early period of hydrological activity was associated with the presence of a thick atmosphere and warmer temperatures. It is possible that at some time in the future we might recreate a habitable climate on Mars, returning it to the life-bearing state it may have enjoyed early in its history. Our studies of Mars are still in a preliminary state but everything we have learned suggests that it may be possible to restore Mars to a habitable climate. Mars' current scientific value is indisputable but it is certainly true that extensive exploration followed by a careful and studied program of introducing life would yield an even greater scientific harvest. The scientific knowledge gained by studying the ways in which a biosphere could be introduced on Mars may inform us as to the preservation of the one on Earth.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20020034961, "endDate": "1995-11-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Geological Society of America", "location": "United States"}}, "meetingId": "9431e284df72423fa613c6924dbdfc8e", "id": "59da894b87784b9f8a08772ee727dcaa"}], "name": "Annual Meeting of the Geological Society of America", "location": "New Orleans, LA", "id": "9431e284df72423fa613c6924dbdfc8e", "startDate": "1995-11-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020034961, "id": "f640d894210c4ac9b23b758f54c3400b", "publicationDate": "1995-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
