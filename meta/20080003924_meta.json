In cooperation with a group of engineers at Kennedy Space Center., Tech Traders created Insuladd, a powder additive made up of microscopic, inert gas-filled, ceramic microspheres that can be mixed into ordinary interior or exterior paint, allowing the paint to act like a layer of insulation. When the paint dries, this forms a radiant heat barrier, turning the ordinary house paint into heat-reflecting thermal paint. According to Tech Traders, the product works with all types of paints and coatings and will not change the coverage rate, application, or adhesion of the paint. Other useful applications include feed storage silos to help prevent feed spoilage, poultry hatcheries to reduce the summer heat and winter cold effects, and on military vehicles and ships. Tech Traders has continued its connection to the aerospace community by recently providing Lockheed Martin Corporation with one of its thermal products for use on the F-22 Raptor.", "title": "Additive Transforms Paint into Insulation", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-24T08:13:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20080003924, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20080003924, "id": "004b1197ec024669844880453c835921", "publicationName": "Spinoff 2007", "publicationDate": "2007-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20080003902, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Spinoff 2007", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20080003924.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20080003924/downloads/20080003924.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20080003924/downloads/20080003924.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20080003924/downloads/20080003924.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
