Ransonc\na\nc\n\nSukachev Forest Institute, Krasnoyarsk 660036, Russia; bGIS Chair, Siberian Federal University, Krasnoyarsk 660036, Russia;\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD 20771, USA\n\nDownloaded by [Institute of Biophysics SB RAS] at 21:43 01 May 2014\n\n(Received 7 August 2013; accepted 1 April 2014)\nBirch (Betula pendula Roth) growth within the Western Siberia forest-steppe was analyzed based on long-term (1897\xe2\x80\x932006)\ninventory data (height, diameter at breast height [dbh], and stand volume). Analysis of biometry parameters showed\nincreased growth at the beginning of twenty-first century compared to similar stands (stands age = 40\xe2\x80\x9360 years) at the\nend of nineteenth century. Mean height, dbh, and stem volume increased from 14 to 20 m, from 16 to 22 cm, and from\n\xe2\x88\xbc63 to \xe2\x88\xbc220 m3/ha, respectively. Significant correlations were found between the stands mean height, dbh, and volume\non the one hand, and vegetation period length (rs = 0.71 to 0.74), atmospheric CO2 concentration (rs = 0.71 to 0.76), and\ndrought index (Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index, rs = \xe2\x88\x920.33 to \xe2\x88\x920.51) on the other hand. The results\nobtained have revealed apparent climate-induced impacts (e.g. increase of vegetation period length and birch habitat\ndrying due to drought increase) on the stands growth. Along with this, a high correlation of birch biometric parameters\nand [CO2] in ambient air indicated an effect of CO2 fertilization. Meanwhile, further drought increase may switch birch\nstand growth into decline and greater mortality as has already been observed within the Trans-Baikal forest-steppe\necotone.\nKeywords: birch stands; CO2 fertilization; climate-induced tree growth\n\nIntroduction\nClimate-driven ecotones are most sensitive to changes in\ntemperature and/or precipitation (e.g. Holtmeier 2009).\nThis has been documented by the number of observations within alpine and northern forest-tundra ecotones\n(i.e. in zones of where temperature limits growth).\nIt has been shown that an increase of summer and\nwinter temperatures along with the extension of vegetation period length caused within stand densification, an\nincrease in tree growth increment and treeline advance\ninto the tundra (e.g. Kullman 2007; Kharuk et al. 2010a,\n2010b; K\xc3\xb6rner 2012; Rannow 2013). Meanwhile, in the\nforest-steppe ecotone (i.e. zone of precipitation limitation\non growth), the air temperature increase may lead to\ndieback and mortality of stands. Thus, increasing frequency of drought increases mortality of aspen (Populus\ntremuloides Michx.) stands in Canada (Hogg et al. 2008)\nand birch stands (Betula pendula Roth) in the TransBaikal region of Russia (Kharuk et al. 2013b).\nAlong with the changes of climatic variables, significant increase in CO2 concentration [CO2] in the\natmosphere was observed during the last century. [CO2]\nhas increased in ambient air from 296 to 400 ppm since\n1900 (Etheridge et al. 2012; Tans & Keeling 2013). This\nincrease should have resulted in an acceleration of tree\ngrowth due to the fertilizing effect of the CO2; however,\n\n*Corresponding author. Email: kharuk@ksc.krasn.ru\n\xc2\xa9 2014 Taylor & Francis\n\nit has been reported that ambient [CO2] is still limiting\ntree growth (e.g. Norby et al. 2010). The effect of CO2\nfertilization has been found in a number of \xe2\x80\x9cin-chamber\xe2\x80\x9d\nexperiments (e.g. Ainsworth & Long 2005). The woody\nspecies studied responded to the CO2 increase by a\nconsistent linear growth of plant biomass from preindustrial to ambient concentrations with saturation in the\nrange of 450\xe2\x80\x93550 ppm (Norby et al. 2010; Souza et al.\n2010). A synergy of air temperature and [CO2] on\nloblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) growth was shown by\nWertin et al. (2012). Meanwhile, there were only a few\nin situ studies of the elevated [CO2r] impact on tree\ngrowth. Soule and Knapp (2006) reported that ponderosa\npine\xe2\x80\x99s (Pinus ponderosa Laws.) radial growth increase\nwas caused by elevated [CO2]. An observed significant\nincrease of Scots pine\xe2\x80\x99s (Pinus silvestris L.) stand growth\nin Spain was attributed to CO2 fertilization (Mart\xc3\xadnezVilalta et al. 2008). Radial growth of larch (Larix\nsibirica Ledeb.) within the alpine ecotones in the AltaiSayan Mountains was correlated with rising [CO2]\n(Kharuk et al. 2011). However, the major limitation for\nthis type of research is the lack of long-term in situ\nobservations.\nThis study was based on forest inventory measurements within a forest-steppe ecotone in Western Siberia\nstarting with the end of nineteenth century (Figure 1).\nThe objective of this paper was to analyze long-term\n\n2\n\nV.I. Kharuk et al.\n\nDownloaded by [Institute of Biophysics SB RAS] at 21:43 01 May 2014\n\nchanges in the growth of birch stands and its possible\nrelationships with the main climate variables (air temperature, precipitation, and drought) and CO2 concentration in ambient air. We hypothesize that climate-driven\nchanges in the vegetation growth period and elevated\n[CO2] in ambient air have positively affected birch stand\ngrowth (i.e. tree height, diameter, and stem volume).\nMaterials and methods\nThe study area is a forest-steppe ecotone in Western\nSiberia (Figure 1). This is a plain at elevations about\n100\xe2\x80\x93120 m a.s.l. with the local topography variations\nreaching 2\xe2\x80\x9310 m in height. The tree species recorded\nwere birch (B. pendula Roth; about 85%), aspen\n(Populus tremula L.; about 10%), and pine (P. silvestris\nL.; about 5%). The birch stands within the test sites have\na similar age (\xe2\x88\xbc50 years). The stands are a mosaic\nlandscape with tree stands of areas less than 5 ha\noccupying about 90% of the study area. Soils are mainly\nsoloth type. The water table level was about at 2.5 m.\nThe climate is continental with cold long winters and\nwarm or hot summers. Mean annual air temperature and\nprecipitation are +0.9\xc2\xb0C and 357 mm with mean summer\nand winter temperature and precipitation reaching +18\xc2\xb0C,\n\xe2\x88\x9217\xc2\xb0C, and 158 mm and 52 mm, correspondingly.\nForest inventory data covering the period from 1897\nto 2006 were available for the study. Measured parameters\n\nwere tree height (H), diameter at breast height (dbh), and\nstands density (trees/ha). The applied inventory techniques did not change and were the same throughout the\nwhole period of measurements. Temporary test plots were\nestablished within typical birch stands within the Western\nSiberia forest-steppe ecotone (Figure 1, Box 1). Test plots\nwere established within stands without signs of natural or\nanthropogenic impact.\nThe initial data were composed of 212 test plots with\nsizes varying within the range of 0.2\xe2\x80\x930.4 ha. This data-set\nwas equalized with respect to the stands density and tree\nage. That is, test plots with the following stand density\nwere considered: N = Nm \xc2\xb1 \xcf\x83, where Nm is a mean stem\nnumber for all test plots and \xcf\x83 is a standard deviation.\nSimilarly, with respect to age, the cohort within the age\nrange of 40\xe2\x80\x9360 years was used. The final data-set included\n83 test plots (see Table 1).\nTree stem volume was calculated based on the following equation:\nV \xc2\xbc 1.092 g \xc3\xbe 0.374 gH\n\n\xc3\xb01\xc3\x9e\n\nwhere g \xe2\x80\x93 tree cross-section at breast height, H \xe2\x80\x93 tree\nheight (Igoshin & Kuzmichev 2008).\nThe following ecological variables were considered: air\ntemperature and precipitation (summer, winter, and annual),\nvegetation period length, drought index, and [CO2]. The\nvegetation period length was approximated by the number of\n\nFigure 1. Sketch map of study area location. (1) Filled circle shows Barabinsk Meteorological Station location.

Drought index\nStandardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI;\nVicente-Serrano et al. 2010) was used for water balance\nestimation. Like the Palmer Drought Severity Index (Palmer\n1965), the SPEI can measure drought severity according\nto its intensity and duration and can identify the onset and\nthe end of drought episodes. The SPEI uses monthly\ndifference (Di) data between precipitation (Pi) and potential evapotranspiration (PET).

Summer\nprecipitation and SPEI actually decreased since 1948\n(Figure 3b and 3d).\nAll stands growth parameters (H, dbh, S, and V) were\npositively correlated with the vegetation period length\n(Nt > 0), summer temperatures (Ts), and [CO2]. Negative\ncorrelations were observed with SPEI and summer\nprecipitation (Table 2).\nAn impact of winter temperature was not considered\nbecause birch winter damage was not observed within the\nstudy area. Winter desiccation and snow abrasion were\nsignificant at higher latitudes or within alpine foresttundra ecotone (e.g. Kharuk et al. 2010a). Some climate\nvariables in Table 2 were correlated. Namely, SPEI\ndrought index was calculated based on the summer\ntemperature and precipitation (Equations 2 and 3). Thus,\nthe latter variables were excluded from the following\nanalysis. Relative input of ecological variables was\nestimated based on the multiple regression analysis.\nEquations describing relationships between stands growth\nparameters (dbh, height, and stem volume) and ecological\nvariables (Nt > 0, CO2, and SPEI) are presented in Table 3.\nDiscussion\nLong-term observations within the Western Siberia foreststeppe zone have revealed a steady increase of birch stands\n\nV.I.

The positive\nimpact of the vegetation period length on the tree growth\nwas not unexpected because the significance of length\nof the growth period for tree growth is well-known (e.g.\nFritts 1991). The satellite data record has also showed the\nvegetation period increase within the study area (Xu\net al. 2013).\nA good correlation between birch growth and [CO2]\ndoes not mean, of course, a \xe2\x80\x9ccause\xe2\x80\x93effect\xe2\x80\x9d relationship;\nthus, CO2 fertilization effect should be carefully checked.\nThere were no independent observations of the elevated\n[CO2] impacts on tree growth within the study area.\nMeanwhile, for the other regions, there are some relevant\nreports. For example, Mart\xc3\xadnez-Vilalta et al. (2008)\nattributed Scots pine basal area index increase (about\n84%) during the twentieth century to the elevated\natmospheric [CO2]. The evidences of CO2 fertilization\nwere also described for L. sibirica growth within an alpine\nforest-tundra ecotone in the Altai Mountains (Kharuk\net al. 2011).\nAlong with the CO2 fertilization there are other\npossible impacts on birch stands growth. Namely, \xe2\x80\x9cnatural\nmelioration\xe2\x80\x9d (i.e. birch habitat natural drainage), and\npotential anthropogenic nitrogen fertilization. We found\nsignificant correlations between birch growth and drought\nindex increase (rs = (\xe2\x88\x920.33) to (\xe2\x88\x920.51)). This effect was\ndue to a higher water table within the study area in the\n\n5\n\nbeginning of the twentieth century. Later, increased\ndrought caused reduction in soil moisture content of the\nbirch stands. Negative growth correlation with summer\nprecipitation (Table 2) also supported this conclusion;\nhowever, there are no direct data on the soil drainage\nimpact on the stands growth. Again, indirect data\n(Kurepin 1961) showed an increase of birch growth with\nreduction of the water table. Thus, birch stands within\nmoist boggy areas had heights between 7\xe2\x80\x9313 m, 14\xe2\x80\x9315 m\nwithin wet sites, and 15\xe2\x80\x9320 m within well-drained sites.\nFor Scotch pine decreased soil moisture caused a onethird increase in stem volume (Konstantinov 1999).\nAdditional evidence of climate-driven drought was the\ndecrease of the number of lakes within the study area (and\nadjacent northward territories; Shiklomanov et al. 2012).\nThus, increased drainage was one of the causes of birch\nstand growth increase. On the other hand, the model has\npredicted the increase of tree growth following the\ncombined effect of CO2 and air temperature increases\n(Matala et al. 2005). Thus, Soule and Knapp (2006) found\na significant increase of P. ponderosa growth rates\nespecially during the drought year periods. A similar\neffect was equally probable within the Western Siberia\nforest-steppe, where drought increase has been observed\nsince 1950s (Figure 2d).\nPotential anthropogenic fertilization within the study\narea did not exceed 3\xe2\x80\x9310 kg ha\xe2\x88\x921 yr\xe2\x88\x921, which is far below\ngrowth-stimulating rates (Environmental and health atlas\nof Russia, edited by Feshbach (1995)). Finally, it is\nimportant to note that test sites in this study were selected\n(according to inventory rules) within stands without any\nsigns of anthropogenic impact (e.g. selective cut, pasture,\nor wildfires).\nThus, the potential causes of the birch stand growth\nincrease in the Western Siberian forest-steppe were the\nsynergy of vegetation period increase, CO2 fertilization,\nand reduced soil moisture within birch stands due to\nincreased drought. However, further drought increase in\nthe Western Siberia forest-steppe can switch birch\ngrowth into decline and mortality. Indeed, severe\ndrought resulted in the birch mortality within TransBaikal forest-steppe ecotone (Figure 1, Site 2; Kharuk\net al. 2013b). Similarly, there are evidences of Siberian\npine (Pinus sibirica (Rupr.) Mayr.), fir (Abies sibirica\nLedeb.), and spruce (Picea obovata Ledeb.) decline\nfollowing increased growth period within the Southern\nSiberian Mountains. The likely causes of that phenomenon were drought increase (with severe droughts\nepisodes) in synergy with bark beetles and pathogens\n(Kharuk et al. 2013a).\nAcknowledgment\nThe authors thank Dr P.A.
