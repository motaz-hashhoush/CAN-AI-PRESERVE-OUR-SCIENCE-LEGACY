Recognition of the need for the NTF capabilities were first encountered in military aircraft development. Several tactical aircrafts experienced the after body drag which was higher than predicted by small scale tests, resulting in less than desired transonic acceleration performance. It is necessary to understand the problem because flight efficiency is more important for military aircrafts. Improved cruise performance is required for the whole range of military mission. Factors that make cruise efficiency important include: (1) rapid deployment airlift capability; (2) self-deployment capability for tactical aircraft; (3) reduced tanker dependence for strategic aircraft. It is concluded that the continuing escalating cost of fuel mandates to develop aircraft that are as fuel efficient as possible. Other uses for NTF are outlined.", "title": "NTF and the Department of Defense", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-11T02:38:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19810022591, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Siewert, R.
