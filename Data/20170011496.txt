The dynamic selfassembly assembly results from a competition between\nself-propulsion of particles and an attractive interaction\nbetween the particles. As a result of non-equilibrium driving\nforces, the crystals form, grow, collide, anneal, repair themselves and spontaneously self-destruct, thereby enabling\nreconfiguration and assembly to achieve a desired property.\n18 Claims, 12 Drawing Sheets\n\nUS 9,821,294 B2\nPage 2\n\n(51) Int.

After 8 days the gel\nchanged into a thick reddish sediment which was repeatedly\nwashed in deionized water to reveal the colloidal cubes.\nFrom electron microscopy pictures, an average particle size\nof 600 mu was measured with a typical polydispersity of\n3%. To embed the hematite cubes into larger spherical\nparticles 25 \xc2\xb5L of NH,28% was added to a 30 mL aqueous\nsuspension of hematite particles(-2% wt)followed by 100\n\xc2\xb5L of 3-methacryloxypropyl trimethoxysilane(TPM, >-98%\nfrom Sigma-Aldrich). The reaction mixture was kept under\nvigorous stirring and sampled every 15 minutes to monitor\nthe particles\' growth. The reactor was fed with more TPM\n(100 \xc2\xb5L of TPM for each addition) at intervals of approximately 1 h until the particles reached the desired size.\nFinally 0.5 mg of 2,2\'-azo-bis-isobutyrylnitrile (AIBN,\nSigma-Aldrich) were added and the mixture heated to 80\xc2\xb0 C.\nfor 3 h to harden the particles. After the synthesis the\nparticles were cleaned and separated from secondary nucleation by sedimentation and were finally resuspended in\ndeionized water. The surface zeta potential in water at a pH\nof 9 was measured to be \xe2\x80\x9470 mV.\nPreparation of the Buffer Solution with Hydrogen Peroxide\nAn aqueous solution is prepared with DI water (resistivity\n18.2 MQ, MilliQ) and contains 3:4 mM Sodium Dodecyl\nSurlfate (SDS, Sigma-Aldrich), 5 mM Tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH, Sigma-Aldrich) and 3% w/w\nhydrogen peroxide (Sigma-Aldrich). The TMAH imposes\nthe pH of the solution to pH-8:5(AB 15, Fischer Scientific)\nfor which the bi-material colloids are charge-stabilized.\nThese experimental conditions are an optimal compromise\nfor colloids activity and stability.\nPreparation of the Solution of Colloids\nAfter synthesis, the suspension of colloids is washed and\nresuspended in a 4 mM sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)\nsolution and stored.

The phoretic attraction\nbetween particles were modeled as a pairwise attraction\nbetween nearby particles consistent with the phoretic velocity shown as the red line in FIG.2B.Ifa displacement makes\ntwo disks overlap, the particles are separated by moving\neach one half the overlap distance along their center-to\ncenter axis. Approximations were utilized to account for the\neffect of (hydrodynamic) lubrication forces in the crystals\ne.g. increase of the apparent viscosity and find little qualitative difference. FIG. 3 illustrates the results of simulations\nin which the attractive phoretic effects are taken into\naccount. It reproduces the crystallite formation as well as the\nsize and lifetime for the crystallites remarkably well under\nexperimental conditions (Ds-3-20% and \xe2\x80\x94300-1500 particles.

The formation of clusters which grow and decay\nis recovered at much higher particle concentration,(Ds?3545% (see FIGS. 6A-B) which relate to simulations without\nattractions.\nIt is believed that active particles undergo diffusive\nmotion with a large persistence length when not in "contact"\nbut slow down,translate and diffuse more slowly, when they\nare in contact. This underlies the understanding of living\ncrystals. The slowing down results from the inability of\n\nUS 9,821,294 B2\n11\n\n12\n\nparticles to penetrate their neighbors when encountered.\nSuch density dependent diffusion can lead to giant fluctuations, clustering and phase separation in non-equilibrium\nsystems, however at much larger surface density. The formation of non-crystalline clusters of active particles has\nbeen reported with bacteria coupled through short-range\ndepletion interaction and janus particles with chemical\nattraction. The intermittent formation and breakage of the\nlarge crystals is always observed. This differs from the\nequilibrium nucleation and growth of a crystal of attractive\ncolloids or the asymptotic formation of a single cluster from\nan assembly of self-propelled disks reported by Fily and\nMarchetti. Despite these observations, the effect of the finite\nnumber of activated particles in the experiment cannot be\ndiscarded.\nIn order to investigate the underlying mechanisms, the\nmagnetic properties of the embedded hematite cube can be\nutilized. Under an external magnetic field (B-1 mT), the\nalignment of the hematite slightly tilts the orientation of the\nparticle and the self-propulsion proceeds in a direction\nparallel to the field, suppressing the rotational diffusion. The\nmagnetic interactions with the Earth\'s magnetic field (-50\n\xc2\xb5T) and between the particles are negligible. FIGS. 4D-I\nillustrate two crucial aspects of this scenario regarding\ncrystal breakup and formation. It is believed that crystal\nbreakup depends on the velocity redirection by rotational\ndiffusion of the particles in the crystal. If the direction of all\nthe particles are aligned using an external magnetic field\nthen the crystal will not break up. This is shown in FIGS.\n4D-E. Suppression of the breakup in the magnetically\nsteered crystal was observed. It is also believed that that\ncollisions are required for crystal formation. In FIG. 4F the\nlight is turned off and the crystal dissolves. With the magnetic field off, when the light is turned on, the particles\ncollide and the crystal reforms, FIG. 4G. In FIG. 4H, the\nlight is off and the crystal redissolves. In FIG. 4I, the\nmagnetic field and light are on. The particles all move in the\nsame direction, do not collide and there is no crystallization.\n\nrated by moving each one of them half of the overlap\ndistance along their center-to-center axis.\nNumerical Parameters\nThe problem is made dimensionless, and the values for\nthe dimensionless parameters in the simulations are denoted\nby a tilde.

The\nself-propulsion and docking are reversible and activated by\nvisible light. The docker can be steered either by a weak\nuniform magnetic field or by nanoscale tracks in a textured\nsubstrate. The light-activated motion and docking originate\nfrom osmotic/phoretic particle transport in a concentration\ngradient of fuel, hydrogen peroxide, induced by the photocatalytic activity by the hematite. The docking mechanism is\nversatile and can be applied to various materials and shapes.\nThe hematite dockers are simple single-component particles\nand are synthesized in bulk quantities. This system opens up\nnew possibilities for designing complex micrometer-size\nfactories as well as new biomimetic systems.\nControlled motion and transport of objects are basic\nfunctions that are simple to perform at the macroscale and\nindispensable for manufacturing and robotics. At the\nmicroscale, synthetic agents performing these tasks would\nbe very useful for biomedical applications such as drug\ndelivery, in situ assembly, delivery of microscopic devices,\nand for microfluidics. However, these tasks are difficult at\nsmall length scales where reversible and wireless actuation\nremain a significant challenge. This has fueled a significant\neffort to design populations of artificial microagents capable\nof moving autonomously in a controlled fashion while\nperforming complex tasks.\nOne of the key requirements for building a microrobot is\nthe ability of the system to harvest the free energy from its\nenvironment and convert it into mechanical work. The\nenergy source can be provided by an electromagnetic field or\nby chemical fuels. Different routes and mechanisms have\nbeen explored for the latter: (i) jet propulsion of microtubular engines or (ii) self-phoretic particles. In the first case,\nthe fuel is catalytically transformed into gas bubbles and\nexpelled, propelling particles to ultrafast speeds, e.g. 350\nbody lengths/s. Self-phoretic propulsion relies on an interfacial phenomenon, phoresis, which leads to migration of a\ncolloid in some kind of gradient. Self-electrophoresis was\nfirst used to propel bimetallic nanorods in hydrogen peroxide and has been broadly studied since. Alternatively, many\nrealizations of microrobots are based on self-diffusiophoresis, the autonomous motion of a colloid in a chemical\ngradient produced by the anisotropic chemical activity ofthe\n\nUS 9,821,294 B2\n13\n\n14\n\nparticle.

For cargos significantly larger than the hematite\ncarrier (d>5 \xc2\xb5m), the transport velocity V scales inversely\nwith the cargo diameter, V al/d, consistent with a constant\npulling force exerted by the hematite particle and a Stokes\ndrag proportional to d. For cargos comparable in size to the\nhematite carrier, the velocity saturates.\nThe cargo scenario is readily adapted to other hematite\nparticle shapes. We can dock colloidal particles using hematite cubes, with the minor disadvantage that the direction of\nthe magnetic moment, which is along the body diagonal of\nthe cube, is not apparent by optical observation.\nThe interfacial origin ofthe propulsion mechanism makes\nthe particles sensitive to chemical or physical alterations of\nthe substrate. As a demonstration, we prepared a textured\nsubstrate of parallel stripes obtained by making a polydimethylsiloxane(PDMS)replica of a compact disk (CD). The\npattern consists of stripes that are 0.6 \xc2\xb5m wide, 110 nm deep,\nand separated by 1.2 \xc2\xb5m grooves (see FIG. 9A). The PDMS\nreplica exhibits visible channels (see FIGS. 9B and 9C-9F).\nBefore the light is turned on, the hematite and a 0.5 \xc2\xb5m TPM\nsphere diffuse near the substrate surface, unaffected by the\nshallow pattern. After the light is turned on, the hematite\naligns along a channel and phoretically attracts the TPM\nsphere (see FIG. 9C). The loading of the colloid breaks the\nsymmetry and propels the cargo along the lines ofthe pattern\n(see FIGS. 9E and 9F) showing that the hematite particles\ncan be driven along a predetermined pathway using physical\nalteration of the landscape. The same effect is observed on\na cleaved mica surface where the hematite particles selfpropel along a nanocrack in the material. In both cases, the\ncargo is released by turning off the light.\nWe have introduced a scheme for making microrobots,\nsynthesized in bulk, possessing the ability to be activated by\nlight, and steered by a magnetic field. They can load,\ntransport, and unload colloids made from many different\nmaterials, with sizes up to 20 \xc2\xb5m, many times the size of the\nmicrorobots. These capabilities open up new opportunities\nfor engineering at the microscale and for micro-manufacturing. We demonstrate their ability to act as a colloidal\nshepherd to pick up and gather spheres. This is a step\nforward in making a large scale microscopic factory. Moreover, the ability to autonomously carry the cargo along a\npredetermined pathway drawn on a textured substrate is\nunique and a direct translation of ground rail transportation\nto the microscale. In this sense, the system acts similarly to\nmolecular motors such as myosin, which walk along onedimensional actin filaments. The interaction between myosin and actin is at the core oftransport in cells, cell division,\nor muscle contraction. The ability to produce synthetic\nsystems inspired by motor proteins such as myosin opens up\nnew possibilities for complex biomimetic systems such as\nmicroscopic artificial muscles.\nThe foregoing description ofillustrative embodiments has\nbeen presented for purposes of illustration and of description.
