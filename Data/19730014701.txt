St. Helens, Washington, DCP (#6066)\n\nequipment at its preselected field site, the last of six\nsets, is dependent on satisfactory weather conditions\nnear the summit; installation is anticipated late this\nspring.\nd.\n\nDCP (#6251) was installed on the north slope of\n\nMt. Baker, Washington, near the summit, on February 8,\n1973, and has been operating and transmitting thermistorderived temperature data satisfactorily since then.\nDCP #6066, designated for Mt. St. Helens has been\noperating and transmitting satisfactorily from a laboratory\nenvironment during the winter.\n\nDCP sets #6056 (Surtsey,\n\nIceland), #6020 Bumpass Hell, and #6104 Devil\'s Kitchen,\nLassen Volcanic National Park, California, have all\nyielded good quality temperature data suitable for\ncomputer processing.\ne.\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey IBM 360/65 program designed\n\nfor this experiment records and plots temperature, radiance\nand anomalous heat flow values as a function of time\nutilizing the Stefan-Boltzmann function, where radiance,\nW = C 1.356 x 10o- 1 2 [T4 -To4].\n\nDCP thermistor probes provide\n\ntime-dependent values of T, the ground surface temperature,\nand TO, the air temperature.\n\nAnomalous near-surface\n\nheat flow is analyzed by the empirical relationship\nH = 1.24T 1 5 4 x 10-6 cal/m2 sec, where the T 1 5 values\nwhich are temperatures at 15 cm depth are related to\nsurface, 50 cm, and 100 cm depth temperatures.\nAt Devil\'s Kitchen, Lassen Volcanic National Park,\npreliminary data processing suggests that during the early\nwinter period, temperatures at 15 cm depth in this active\ngeothermal area showed a 68% correlation with fluctuations\nof anomalous surface temperatures; and temperatures at\n50 cm depth showed an 8% correlation with surface\ntemperature fluctuations.\nA preliminary estimate of the anomalous heat flow\nat the Devil\'s Kitchen infrared (thermal) anomaly is\n0.75 x 106 cal-sec\n\n1\n\nover an area of 41,600 M 2.\n\nAt the\n\nBoiling Springs Lake anomaly, controlled by the same\nfault system, thermal radiation from the lake surface\nalone (not considering evaporative heat loss) was\ncalculated to be 0.71 x 106 cal sec\n\nf.\n\nl .\n\nThermal surveillance of Cascade Range volcanoes using\n\nERTS-I multispectral scanner, aircraft imaging systems,\nand ground-based data communication platforms, by Jules D.\nFriedman, David G.
