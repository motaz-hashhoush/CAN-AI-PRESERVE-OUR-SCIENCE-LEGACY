The test program began in September 1982,\nfollowing the launch on June 30, 1982 of the Soviet SAR-equipped\nnavigational satellite Cosmos 1383. Through February, that\nsatellite had assisted in saving 19 lives.\nThe U.S. effort in the SAR program is managed by the\nCommunications Division of NASA\'s Office of Space Science and\nApplications. NASA\'s Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt,\nMd., is responsible for the execution of the program.\nThe objectives of the search and rescue mission are to\ndemonstrate:\n* The ability of a spaceborne system to acquire, track and\nlocate existing Emergency Locator Transmitters (ELTs) and\nEmergency Position Indicating Radio Beacons (EPIRBs) that\ncurrently are being used aboard approximately 200,000 general\naviation and other aircraft in the United States alone; are\naboard approximately 6,000 U.S. ships; and are operating on 121.5\nand 243 Megahertz frequencies.\n\n* The improved capability for detecting and locating\ndistress incidents utilizing new experimental locator\ntransmitters and indicating beacons operating on a 406 Megahertz\nfrequency. This new capability would provide higher probability\nof detection and location, greater location accuracy, and coded\nuser information, and would allow for the necessary growth of an\nincreased number of users.\n\n- more -\n\n_.\n- 3 -\n\nIn addition, this capability will allow for global coverage\nby providing spaceborne processing and storage of the 406 MHz\ndata by equipment aboard the spacecraft.\nNOAH-E, a 1,712 kilogram (3,775 pound) spacecraft will be\nlaunched into an 833-kilometer (450-nautical mile) circular,\nnear-polar orbit with an inclination of 98,7 degree to the\nequator. Total orbital period will be 101.35 minutes (67 minutes\nin sunlight and 34 minutes in the earth\'s shadow). The orbit is\nplanned to be sun-synchronous, rotating eastward about the\nearth\'s polar axis 0.986 degree per day -- the same rate and\ndirection as the earth\'s daily rotation about the sun.\nThis precession keeps the satellite in a constant position\nwith reference to the sun for consistent illumination throughout\nthe year. NOAA-E will be launched so that it will always cross\nthe equator at about 7:30 a.m. southbound and 7:30 p.m.\n\nr\n\nnorthbound local time.\nTo be launched aboard an Air Force Atlas-E launch vehicle,\nNOAA-E will transmit data directly to users around the world for\nlocal weather analysis.\nOperational ground facilities include the Command and Data\nAcquisition stations in Fairbanks, Alaska, and Wallops Island,\nVa.; the Satellite Operations Control Center (SOCC) and data\nprocessing facilities in Suitland, Md.; and a data receiving\nlocation in Lannion, France.\n\n- more -\t\n\n``\n\n\t\n\n- 4 -\n\n}\t\n\nThe TIROS program is a cooperative effort of NASA, National\nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the United Kingdom and\nFrance for providing day and night environmental and associated\ndata for operational purposes on daily basis.

The Astro-Electronics\nDivision of RCA, Princeton, N.J., is the prime contractor for the\nspacecraft. Canada and France are providing the SAR equipment.\nNOAA-E is the fifth in a series of eight satellites developed to give scientists the most comprehensive meteorological and\nenvironmental information since the start of the nation\'s space\nprogram.

The standard Atlas launch vehicle\nconsists of an E-series Atlas missile that has been refurbished\nand modified to a standard configuration for use as a launch\nvehicle for orbital missions. It is capable of launching a\nspacecraft into a variety of low earth orbits. The launch\nvehicle is manufactured by General Dynamics Convair, San Diego.\nThe vehicle stands 78.7 meters (94 feet) tall and is 3 m (10\nft. in diameter. The fairing is 7.4 m (24.3 ft.) long and is 2 m\n(7 ft.) in diameter. At liftoff, it carries 69 kiloliters\n(18.294 gallons) of RP-1 fuel, a highly refined kerosene. Engine\ndata are as follows:\n\nNo. of Engines\nThrust per engine\t (lb)\nThrust per engine\t (N)\nThrust duration\nliftoff to\n\nBooster\n2\n165,000\n633,920\n\nSustainer\n1\n57,000\n253;536\n\nVernier\n2\n1,000\n4,448\n\n+120 sec\n\n+320 sec\n\n+340 sec\n\nFrom liftoff to +60 seconds, airborne autopilot programmer\nin the launch-vehicle flight-control system provides steering and\ndiscrete commands. The General Electric Radio Tracking System\n(GERTS) ground station and guidance computer then perform the\nguidance function in conjunction with the launch vehicle\'s pulse\nbeacon system.\nThe vehicle is powered by one sustainer, two boosters anO\ntwo vernier engines using .liquid oxygen, and liquid hydrocarbon\npropellants. A 0.97-m (38-inch)-diameter attach fitting fastens\nthe NOAA-E spacecraft to the launch vehicle. The fairing\nattached to the forward face of the launch vehicle p rotects the\nspacecraft from aerodynamic heating during the boost flight.\nNOAA-E INSTRUMENTATION\n\nThe instrument systems provide both direct readout (real\ntime) and remote sensing (playback) of environmental data during\nday and night operation. The primary instruments carried by the\nNOAA-E spacecraft are:\n*Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (ITT)\n*High Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder (ITT)\n*Microwave Sounding Unit (JPL)\n*Search and Rescue\n-SAR Repeater (CRC/Canada)\n- more -\n\n...\n\n- 8 -\n\n-SAR Processor (CNES/France)\n*Stratospheric Sounding Unit (U.K.)\n*Space Environment Monitor (FACC)\n*ARGOS Data Collection System (CNES/France)\nFor reasons of weight and balance, mass property dummy\t\ninstruments will be flown on NOAA-E. They are:\n*ERBE-Scan and Non scan (TRW)\n*SBUV (BASD)\nAdvanced Very High -Resolution Radiometer\nThe Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR),\nprovided by ITT, is a radiation-detection instrument used to\nremotely determine the surface temperature. This sc,;.:knning\nradiometer uses four detectors that collect differen\': bands of\nradiation wavelengths. Measuring the same view, this array of\ndiverse wavelengths, after processing, will permit multi-spectral\nanalysis for more precisely defining hydrologic, oceanographic,\nand meteorological parameters. One channel will monitor energy\nin the visible band and another in the near-infrared portion of\nthe electronmagnetic spectrum to observe clouds, lakes,\nshorelines, snow and ice. Comparison of data from these two\nchannels can indicate the onset of ice and snow melting. The\nother two channels operate entirely within the infrared band to\ndetect the heat radiation from and, hence, the temperature of,\nthe land, water, and sea surfaces and the clouds above them.\nSpace Environment Monitor\nThe Space Environment Monitor (SEM), provided by Ford\nAeronautics Communications Corp. (FACC), is a multichannel\ncharged-particle spectrometer. It measures the population of the\nearth\'s radiation belts and the particle precipitation phenomena\nresulting from solar activity (both of which contribute to the\nsolar/terrestrial energy interchange.) The monitor consists of\nthree separate sensor units and a common Data Processing Unit\n(DPU). The sensor units are the Total-Energy Detector (TED) and\nthe Medium-Energy Proton/Electron Detector (MEPED). The lowerenergy sensors (the TED, plus the proton and electron telescopes\nof the MFPED) have pairs of sensors with different orientations\nbecause the direction of the particle fluxes is important in\ncharacterizing the energy interchanges taking place. The\nobjectives of the Space Environment Monitor are to determine the\nenergy deposited by solar particles in the upper atmosphere and\nto provide a solar warning system.\n\n- more -\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n:h\n\n9 -\t\n\nORt^I N" .,COF POOR QUALM\n\nTIROS Operational Vertical Sounder System (TOVS)\nThe TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder system consists of\nthree instruments: the High-Resolution Infrared Radiation\nSounder modification 2 (HIRS/2), the Stratos p heric Soundinv Unit\n(SSU), and the Microwave Sounding Unit (WTJ). All three instru-\n\nments measure radiant energy from\t\n\natmosphere, and the data\n\nare used to determine the atmosphere*s temperature profile from\nthe earth\'s surface to the upper stratosphere.\nHigh-Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder (AIRS/2)\nThis instrument, provided by ITT, detects and measures\nenergy emitted by the atmosphere to construct a vertical\ntemperature profile from the earth\'s surface to an altitude of\nabout 40 kilometers. Measurements are made in 20 spectral\nregions in the infrared band.\t\n(One frequency lies at the high\n\nend of the visible raerge.)\nMicrowave Sounding Unit (MSU)\nThis unit, provided by Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena,\ndetects and measures the energy from the troposphere to construct\na vertical temperature profile to an altitude of about 10 km\n(6.2 mi). Measurements are made by radiometric detection of\nmicrowave energy divided into four frequency channels. Each\nmeasurement is made by comparing the incoming signal from the\ntroposphere with the ambient temperature reference load. Because\nits data are not seriously affected by clouds, it is used in\nconjunction with the High Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder\nmodification 2 to remove measurement ambiguity when clouds are\npresent.\nStratosphereic Sounding Unit (SSU)\n(Provided by the United Kingdom)\nTemperature measurements in the upper stratosphere are\nderived from adi nce mg8surements made in three channels using a\nt-^cJ\npressure-modulate\t gas k2) to aecompTi sh seleeti a bandoass\n11\ne gas is o a pressure\nfiltration of the sampled radiances. \t\nchosen to yield weighting functions peaking in the altitude range\nof 25 to 50 km (15.5 to 31 mi) where atmospheric pressure is 15.5\nand 1.5 millibars.

The coal of\nthis humanitarian project is to demonstrate the effectiveness of\nsatellites in reducing the time required to rescue air and\nmaritime distress victims and increase significantl y the\npossibility of saving lives.\n?Search and rescue instrumentation will he carried on three\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellites, the first of which will be NOAA-F. Demonstration tests\nwill be conducted with the NOAA satellites once they are in\norbit. Canadian agencies are providing three transponders (one\nfor each U.S. satellite), are establishing; ground terminals in\nCanada and are participating in performance tests of the system.\nFrance is providing three onboard receiver/processors (one for\neach U.S. spacecraft), are providing a ground terminal in France\nand conducting performance tests in France. U.S. agencies are\nproviding the spacecraft and integration and launch of the\nspacecraft, and are establishing three ,a.,round stations in the\nUnited States. They also will conduct performance tests. The\nNOAA-E spacecraft will be the first SARSAT e q uipped spacecraft.\nAn agreement with the Soviet Union called for interoperability between the SA.RSAT system and a similar Soviet system\ncalled COSPAS. The understanding established a cooperative\ndemonstration and evaluation program which is more effective than\nwould have been possible with either system alone.\nCanada and France are together investing approximately X24\nmillion in this project. The U.S.. agencies are spending! approximately $29 million (NASA $24 million; Air Force $?.5 million; anti\nCoast Guard $2.5 million). A Soviet spokeman has said that that\nnation\'s expenitures for the project amount to "several million\ndollars."\nThe MSPAS/SARSAT partners originally had hoped for nearly\nsimultaneous launch of SARSAT-equipped NOAA spacecraft and the\nSoviet COSPAS-equipped spacecraft. Hoviever, NOM- I s previously\nlaunched meteorological satellites continued to operate\neffectively beyond their designed life time, and no replacement\nwas necessary. As a result, the planned 1982 launch of NOAH=F\nwas postponed, allowing the Soviets to launch their satellite\nfirst. Several successful rescue operations with the\nCOSPAS/SARSAT system have been carried out saving lives and\ndramatically reducing search times and costs.\n- more -\n\ny\n\n..\n- 15 -\t\n\nGRiCNAL PA^N. GJ\nOF K\' OR QUALI TY\n\nNASA and the Canadian Department of Communications joined?\nforces in defining a joint satellite-aided search and rescue\nsystem demonstration program in the fall of 1975. That nrogrem\nwas expanded into a trilateral effort in T)ecember 1977 when the\nFrench Centre National d\'Etudes Soatiales (rNRS) joined the\nproject.\t\nIn 1980, an agreement was reached with the D^inistry of\n\nMerchant Marine (PIORFLOT) for the Soviet Union to become a\npartner in this search and rescue program.\nA search and rescue satellite system uses multiple satellites in low, near-polar orbits "listening" for distress transmissions. The signals received by the satellites are relaved to\na network of ground stations where the location of the en)ergencv\nbeacon is determined by measuring the Doppler shift between i.ne\nsatellite (with its precisely known orbit) and the distress\nsignal. This information is then relaved to a rescue control\ncenter. The rescue center then begins the actual search and\nrescue operation.\nOn June 30, 1982, the Soviet Union launched (,osmos 1383, the\nfirst CX)SPAS satellite.\nAfter a period of joint technical checkout which all four\nnations began on Sept. 1, a joint demonstration and evaluation\nperiod lasting a minimum of 15 months was started to evaluate the\nsystem\'s effectiveness in locating downed aircraft and distressed\n\nvessels.\nIn addition to the four nations involved in the M.SPAS/\nSARSAT Project, Norway and the United Kingdom will participate in\nthe evaluation of the system, and final negotiations with Finland\nare being worked on concerning its possible participation.\nThe rapid detection and location of downed aircraft or a\nship in distress is of paramount importance to the potential\nsurvivors and to the search and rescue teams responsible for\ntheir rescue. Studies have shown that even those who survive an\ninitial aircraft crash have less than a 10 percent chance of\nIn contrast,\nsurvival if the rescue is delayed beyond two days. \t\nif the rescue can be accomplished within eight hours, their\n\nsurvival rate is better than 50 percent. D4oreover, rapid\nlocation can reduce both search and rescue costs significantly\nand lower the length of ex p osure of search and rescue teams to\nhazardous conditions frequently encountered? during these\noperations.\nIn 1970, the U.S. Congress passed a lavy requiring that\ngeneral aviation aircraft carry an Emergency Locator Transmitter\n(ELT) that can be activated manually or by the typical stresses\n\nof an accident.\n\n- more v.\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n16. \xe2\x80\x94\t\n\nfiar-^. p qn. rt t \'l\n^rfC r r!\'i\n\nT f7\n\nr\n\na\n\nIn 1972, the National Transportation Safetv Roard recommended that the Coast Guard and the Federal Communications\nCommission require ocean-going vessels to carry an Emergency\nPosition Indicating Radio Beacon (EPIRT3) that eoulH be activated\nmanually or automatically when immersed in water.\nThese two types of emer g ency beacons became the TT.S.\naircraft and maritime distress-alertinf r devices. These small,\nlightweight, shock-resistant, self-energizing beacons are canahle\nof 48 hours of continuous broadcasting.They use a distinct\n"wow-wow" modulated tone on one or both of the emergency distress\nIn the\nfrequencies. These frequencies are 121.5 and 243 ^?f?z. \t\nUnited States alone, there are more than 200,000 aircraft and\napproximately 6,000 maritime beacons installed.\nThe use of these automatic radio freouenev distress transmitters offered the possibility of dramatically shortenin g the\ntime required to alert rescue forces and locate `he victims.\nHowever, for a distress transmitter to be successful, its transInternational Civil Aviation\nmitted signal must be received. \t\nOrganization (ICAO) regulations require that aircraft making long,\nflights over water monitor the distress frequencies for possible\ntransmissions from maritime vessels. Unfortunately, no similar\naircraft monitoring regulations govern flights over land.\nThe most significant constraint, however, has to do with\nbasic geometry. Even if a passing aircraft is monitoring for\ndistress signals, it will detect the transmittinc beacons of\ndowned aircraft to distressed vessels onlv if it is in direct\nline of sight to the craft. This means that unless the aircraft\nis within about 300 km (185 mi.) from the distress lccation there\nis little chance of detection. T he effectiveness of these\naircraft and ship distress systems is limited to the chance that\nan overflying aircraft has its distress monitor on and is near\nenough to the distress location to receive the signal.\nSince the mid-1970s, several nations have been interested in\nusing satellites equipped with suitable receivers to detect and\nlocate emergency transmissions from aircraft and ships.\nThe COSPAS/SARSA\'.\xe2\x96\xba,\' system concept uses low-altitude, polar\norbiting satellites and ground-derived Doppler position fixine of\nemergency signals to locate downed aircraft and distressed ships.\nThe system is composed of three main subsystems: the\nemergency beacons, the CnSPAS or SAT?SAT repeater /processor and\nthe ground station. These components will he used in two different coverage modes for the detection and location of the\nemergency beacons operating in three frecuency bands -- 121.5,\n243 and 406 MHz. The two coverage modes are the regional\ncoverage and global coverage mode.\n\n-\n\nmore -\n\nOF POOR\nIn the U.S, spacecraft, a repeater data system will relay\n121.5, 243 and 406 MHz signals and an onboard signal processor\nwill receive the 406 Miz signals, process and record the data for\ntransmission to the ground both in real time and at a later time\nin the playback mode. At the ground station, electronic signal\nprocessing is used to separate the weak distress signals from\nbackground static, recover the Doppler information and determine\nthe distress beacon position. The OOSPAS s y stem does not relay\nthe 243 MHz band.\n\nr\n\nThe 406 MHz distress system was specifically designed for\nthe search and rescue mission based upon technology demonstrated\nby the NASA satellite data collection program. The signal also\ncontains, as part of the transmitted tone, information as to what\ntype aircraft or ship, the registry number and owner. A 406 DlHz\ndata processor will be on both the OOSPAS and SARSA T spacecraft.\nDistiess 406 MHz signals are received by the satellite the\nsame as the 121.5 and 243 MHz signals. The Doppler fre q uenc y is\nmeasured and the identification and status data are recovered.\nThis information is time-tagged, formatted as digital data and\ntransferred to both the Pepeater downlink for real-time transmissions to the ground station and recorded by the spacecraft\ntelemetry computer for storage and later transmission to the\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ground stations\nin the case of SARSAT and to any ground station in the case of\nOOSPAS .\nThe regional coverage mode is used in areas where the\nspacecraft is mutually visible to distress signals and ground\nstations, an area approximately 4,000 km (2,500 mi.) in diameter\ncentered on the ground station location. The regional coverage\ndata processing is performed at the ground station.\nThe global coverage mode provides full-earth coverage by\nstoring data in the spacecraft on a ta p e recorder until it is\ntransmitted down at the next available ground station. This\nenables large maritime areas out of range of ground stations to\nbe covered. This mode only operates with the ex p erimental 406\nMHz distress signal units.\nFrequency of coverage is dependent on the number of satellites in orbit. It is also latitude dependent with.more frequent\ncoverage at higher latitudes. Assuming a sing le satellite in\noperation, the maximum time between successive detections at the\nequator would be 12 hours. If four search and rescue equipped\nsatellites were in operation at the same time, distress signals\nwould be detected within a very few hours.\nA fundamental requirement imposed on this demonstrat31on\nproject was that it work with existing emergency beacons\noperating at 121.5 and 243 NTHz.\n\n- mor e a\n\n...\n\n- 18 OF\nAlthough not designed with satellite detection and location\nin mind, Doppler positioning, using the relative motion between\nthe spacecraft and the ground station, serves as a practical\nmethod to determine beacon location. All that is required of the\nemergency beacon is that it emit a carrier frequencv, with\nreasonable stability, during the duration of visibility. The\ncarrier frequency stability is required for the electronic:\nDoppler information extraction.\nTo optimize Doppler-positioning performance, a low-altitude\npolar orbit was chosen. The low altitude allows for low emergency beacon transmitter power, good Doppler -- shift characteristics and short time delays between successive nasses. The\npolar orbit results in coverage of the whole earth.\nIt is important to note that two distinct experiments are\nbeing conducted which are different both in their imolenentation\nand in their projected effectiveness.\nThe 121.5 and 243 MHz experiment uses the existing family of\nemergency beacons transmitting at one or both or the fregnencies.\nAll of the present beacons were designed and im p lementers without\nconsideration of potential detection by a satellite syste:n.\nBecause of this, the signal characteristics such es output potter,\nfrequency stability and modulation format are far from ideal for\nsatellite detection. This rules out the use of a simple\nspacecraft onboard signal processor.\nFor the existing emergency beacons, the SARSAT ecuinned\nspacecraft are limited to serving as repeaters, for the 121.5 and\n243 MHz beacons, relaying the signals to the ground stations\nwhere sophisticated signal processors can determine the Doppler\nshift and determine the beacon\'s location. The COSPAS satellite\nreceives the 121.5 MHz frequency, but not the 243 d94z signals.\nThis repeater system re q uires mutual visibility of the beacon,\nthe spacecraft and the _around station.\nU.S. and Canadian ground stations are at Kodiak, Alaska;\nPoint Reyes, Calif.; Scott Air Force Base, Ill.; and Ottawa,\nOntario. These four stations provide complete coverage of the\nU.S. inland and coastal regions including Alaska and very\nsubstantial Canadian coverage. France will operate a ground\nstation at Toulouse providing coverage for Furooe\'s inland and\ncoastal regions, parts of North Africa and the Mediterranean.\nThe U.S.S.R. will operate three g round stations, 24oscow,\nArehangelsk and Vladivostok. The ground stations of all nations\ninvolved will track both COSPAS and SARSAT satellites an(,\nmaintain communications through the U.S. Mission Control Center\nat Scott Air Force Base, located at Belleville, about 25 miles\neast of St. Louis, Roo.\n\n- more -\n\n..\n\n- 19 -\n\nORIGINAL PAGE IS\nOF POOR QUALITY,\n\nIn spite of the limitations of the 121.5/243 MHz system, the\nfour QOSPAS/SARSAT partners expect the system will substantially\nimprove the present emergency beacon detection and locations\nsystem by providing regular systematic coverage within the\ngeographic areas described above and by providing location\naccuracies of 10 to 20 km (6 to 12 mi.).\nThe COSPAS/SARSAT demonstration experiment using 406 MHz is\nbased upon technology proven over the past several years with\nmeteorological data collection. The random access measurement\nsystem on the Nimbus spacecraft, the French "Argos," and the data\ncollection system on the TIROS-N spacecraft have been used to\ndemonstrate a sailboat search and rescue experiment. They also\ntracked the manned balloon "Double Eagle" during both the\nunsuccessful and successful trans-Atlantic crossing and tracked a\nnumber of sailships during a European sail race in 1Q79.\nThe 406 MHz experiment relies on beacons specifically\ndesigned to take advantage of the satellite detection system.\nThe higher power and improved frequency stability of the 406 MHz\nunits will have a greater performance capability than the\n121.5/243 MHz system. The probability of detection of normally\ntransmitted signals will be 95 percent greater and the location\naccuracy will be 2 to 5 km (1.2 to 3.1 mi.). The 406 MHz search\nand rescue frequency was approved during the last W)rld Administrative Radio Conference of the International Telecommunications Union, held at Geneva, Switzerland, in 1979.\nOther significant advantages of the 406 MHz system include\ndistinguishing whether the signal is from an aircraft or vessel,\nits country of origin, the nature of the distress or the elapsed\ntime since the accident, the registration of the vessel or\naircraft and even, if known, the location of the emergency as\ndetermined by the vessel. This additional information is of\ngreat value to search and rescce forces in responding to the\nneeds of the victims.\nAnother advantage is that the coherent carrier portion of\nthe transmission can be processed by a spacecraft computer to\naccurately determine its frequency. This frequency information,\nalong with the time of measurement and the decoded message, can\nthen be relayed to ground stations in real time and can also be\nstored in spacecraft memory and transmitted to the next available\nground station. This not only greatly simplifies the ground\nstation equipment, but eliminates the requirement for mutual\nvisibility of the spacecraft and the ground station while the\ndistress transmission is taking place. Full global coverage,\nincluding the Arctic regions, can be achieved with a relatively\nsmall number of low cost ground stations with the 406 MHz system.\nThe 406 MHz system was also designed for the future to\nprovide an even better system which combines the advantages of\nlow-orbiting satellites with the immediate alert provided by\ngeosynchronous satellites over many areas of the earth.\n- mo r e -\n\n.\n20 -\t\n\nORIGINAL E,AG ^\n\n03\n\nOF POOR QUAL ITY\nA demonstration of that combined capability is planned usinv,\nspecial repeaters aboard the NOAA geosynchronous MVS satellite\nsystem in the 1985 - 1986 time frame.\nThe United States\' part of the MSPAS/SARSA T program is\n\nmanaged by the Comnnunications Division of NASA\'s Office of gpaee\nScience and Applications.
