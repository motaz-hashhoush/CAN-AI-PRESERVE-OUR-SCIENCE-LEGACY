Proposed ground systems configurations are presented along with a launch site requirements summary. Prelaunch processing scenarios are described and the required facility modifications and new facility requirements are analyzed. Flight vehicle design recommendations to enhance launch processing are discussed. Processing approaches to integrate LRB with existing STS launch operations are evaluated. The key features and significance of launch site transition to a new STS configuration in parallel with ongoing launch activities are enumerated. This volume is the study summary of the five volume series.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19910020941, "id": "2f55d511d2c7489fab473afcb009f6ba", "publicationDate": "1988-11-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19910020941.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19910020941/downloads/19910020941.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19910020941/downloads/19910020941.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19910020941/downloads/19910020941.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
