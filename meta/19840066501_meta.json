Likely scenarios, ranging from transmission of moderate and high data rates over long distances to low data rates over short distances are examined. A limited parametric tradeoff is performed with system variables such as radiofrequency power, receiver noise temperature, link distance, data rate, and antenna size. Present status is discussed and projections are given for both electron tube and solid state transmitter technologies. Monolithic transmit and receive module technology, already under development at 20 to 30 GHz, is reviewed and its extension to 60 GHz, and possible applicability is discussed.", "title": "A study of 60 GHz intersatellite link applications", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T03:49:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19840066501, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Anzic, G."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Lewis Research Center", "location": "Cleveland, OH, United States"}}, "id": "f035767363944ad59b7b7d6a3300eba1"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19840066501, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Connolly, D.
