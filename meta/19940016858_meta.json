At its inception, all equipment was at the forefront of technology. The system was created to provide the operator with a 'State of the Art' replacement for equipment that was becoming antiquated and virtually impossible to repair because new parts were no longer available. Although the Mini-NOCC provided adequate support to the Network for a number of years, it was quickly becoming ineffectual for higher data rate and non-standard missions. The MOSA will prove to be invaluable in the future as more and more missions require Ground Network support.", "title": "Mission Operations Support Area (MOSA) for ground network support", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T18:57:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19940016858, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Woods, Robert D."}, "organization": {"name": "Allied-Signal Aerospace Co.", "location": "Seabrook, MD, United States"}}, "id": "607d36c2fb0e48b0ba19c7ef3b86983e"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19940016858, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Moser, Susan A."}, "organization": {"name": "Allied-Signal Aerospace Co.", "location": "Seabrook, MD, United States"}}, "id": "0297a9e52b3d41a785e093e8e08cd411"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19940016858, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19940016858, "id": "fd30355b7c7641c2969130a5262e0911", "publicationName": "NASA.
