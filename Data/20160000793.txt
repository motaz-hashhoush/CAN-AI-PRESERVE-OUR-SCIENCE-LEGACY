b'Using Paraffin with -10 oCto 10 \xc2\xb0 C Melting Point for\nPayload Thermal Energy Storage in SpaceX Dragon Trunk\nMichael K. Choi*\n\nNASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD 20771\n\nA concept of using paraffin wax phase change material (PCM) with a melting point\nbetween -tO"C and to"c for payload thermal energy storage in a Space Exploration\nTechnologies (SpaceX) Dragon trunk is presented. It overcomes the problem of limited\nheater power available to a payload with significant radiators when the Dragon is berthed to\nthe International Space Station (ISS). It stores adequate thermal energy to keep a payload\nwarm without power for 6 hours during the transfer from the Dragon to an ExPRESS\nlogistics carrier (ELC) on the ISS.\n\nNomenclature\n\nc\nCCD\nELC\nFPA\nFRAM\nH\nJOB\n\nISS\nLEO\nMLI\nNICER\n01CM\n\nPCM\nSPDM\nTEC\n\ncarbon\ncharge coupled device\nExPRESS Logistics Carriers\nfocal plane assembly\nFlight Releasable Attachment Mechanism\nhydrogen\ninstrument optical bench\nInternational Space Station\nlow Earth orbit\nmultilayer insulation\nNeutron Star Interior Composition Explorer\nORU Tool Changeout Mechanism\nphase change material\nSpecial Purpose Dexterous Manipulator\nthermoelectric cooler\n\nI. Introduction\nhe SpaceX Dragon trunk can accommodate up to three ISS payloads (Fig. 1). 1 The aft end of the unpressurized\ntrunk is open. During the Dragon solo flight, the .thermal environment for the trunk is extreme. When the\nDragon is berthed to the Harmony Module of the ISS, the trunk\'s open aft end points at Earth (Fig. 2). 1 The duration\nof grapple and berthing is 1 to 7 days? The total heater power available to the payloads in the trunk is 200 W. 2 If\nthere are three payloads in flight, the heater power available to each payload is only 67.7 W. If there are only two\npayloads in flight, the heater power available is 100 W each. Figure 3 shows the locations of the Harmony Module\nanci ExPRESS logistics carrier (ELC). During removal of a payload from the Dragon trunk by the Special Purpose\nDexterous Manipulator (SPDM)/ORU Tool Changeout Mechanism (OTCM), as part of the transfer to the ELC,\nthere are up to 6 hours without power for the payload. If the payload has large heat rejection system radiators, it will\nlose a significant amount of heat to space for up to 6 hours with no heater power available. Typically electronics\nboxes have a -30 \xe2\x80\xa2 C non-operating limit. It is necessary to store adequate thermal energy in the payload while it is\nstill in the Dragon trunk. Since heater power is limited and the Dragon trunk aft end is open, it is a challenge to store\nadequate thermal energy in a payload that has large radiators.\n\nT\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Senior Aerospace Engineer, Heat Transfer, AIAA Associate Fellow.\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n\'\n\nFigure 1.

Objective\nThe objective of this paper is to present a thermal concept of using paraffm wax PCM with a melting point\nbetween -10 \xe2\x80\xa2 C and 10 \xe2\x80\xa2 C to store adequate thermal energy in a SpaceX Dragon trunk to keep payload warm without\npower for 6 hours during its transfer from the Dragon to an ELC.\n\nill. Paraffin Wax Phase Change Material\nParaffin wax PCM has a high latent heat of fusion per unit mass, which is in the 155 to 253 kJ/kg range (Fig. 4)4\'\n8\n11:. It also has a range of melting points (Fig. 5)4- , and is well within typical payload temperature limits. PCM\npotentially reduces the mass of the payload since latent heat, instead of sensible heat, is used for thermal energy\nstorage. Paraffm PCM has flight heritage. Figure 6 shows a paraffin pack flown on the MDIS instrument in the\nNASA MESSENGER mission to Mercury. Two packs of Dodecane (C 12H26), which have a melting point of -10 \xe2\x80\xa2 C,\nmaintain the CCD temperature no warmer than -lO"C when the MDIS radiators absorb heat from the planet near\nMESSENGER\'s periapsis. 9\nTypically the ratio of mass of paraffin to mass of shell is 2: 1.7 The technology readiness level (TRL) of paraffm\nPCM for spaceflight is at least 6.\nParaffin waxes, which have a carbon number from 12 to 15, provide a melting point in the -10" C to 10\xc2\xb7 C range\nused in the novel thermal concept presented in this paper.\n\n- 26o\n\n1\n\n- - - \xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7-\xc2\xb7--\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7- ~\n\n-\n\n.. .\n\nI\nI\n\n]I 240\n~\n\n6\n\n220\n\n\xc2\xb7;;;\n:1\n\n:: 200\n0\n\n1a\n\n~ 180\n\n.....\nc\n\n~\n.....\n\n160\n140\n\nI\n\n.\ni\n- - -- --\xc2\xb7--- ---- _j ----- -- _._----- - - \'\n_\n\'\n\n13\n\n\'\n\n~ --- - -- , \xc2\xb7-\n\n-\xe2\x80\xa2 -\xc2\xb7---\n\n15\n16\n17\nCarbon Number, N\n\n14\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n--1 ---- - ~--\xc2\xb7-\n\n12\n\nI\n\nI\n,!_---c\nl\n\ni\n\n19\n\n18\n\nI\n\n-\n\nI\n\n20\n\n\xc2\xb7- - - -\n\nFigure 4.

Technical Description and Novel Features of Thermal Concept\nThe SpaceX Dragon unpressurized trunk has a payload volume of3.6-m diameter and a 2.3-m height. 1 The\nFlight Releasable Attachment Mechanism (FRAM) reference point is 2.146 m from the end ofthe trunk (Fig. 7). 3\n1\nThe height could be extended to 4.3 m, ifneeded. The trunk exterior has a white paint, which has a low\nabsorptance (0.28) and a high emittance (0.87), for thermal control. 3 Its interior is insulated with a 7.62 em thick\nacoustic blanket. The trunk interior an absorptance of0.39 and an emittance of0.79? It can accommodate up to\nthree ISS payloads. The aft end of the trunk is open. During the Dragon solo flight, the thermal environment for the\n2\ntrunk is extreme. The coldest environment is in the Off-Nominal Attitude Possible Extreme Cold during which the\nDragon nose points at sun. When the Dragon is berthed to the Node 2 nadir port of the Harmony Module on the ISS,\nthe Dragon trunk\'s open aft end points at Earth for 1 to 7 days.\n\n\\I\n\n\\\n\nFigure 7.

Example of ISS ELC Payload\nAn example of ISS payload that uses the novel thermal concept presented in this paper is the Neutron Star\nInterior Composition Explorer (NICER). It is proposed by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center for the ISS ELC. It\nwas selected for Phase B implementation in April2013. Figure 8 displays the thermal model for the NICER in the\ndeployed configuration. The electronics boxes are mounted to a thermal sharing plate. The thermal sharing plate is\nthermally isolated from the instrument optical bench (lOB) bottom plate by titanium flexures. The size of the lOB is\nl.B m x 0.87 m x 0.82 m. The total power dissipation of the electronics boxes is 69 W. Most ofthe exterior of the\nelectronics boxes has AZW/LA-11 low absorptance white paint10 to radiate heat to space and minimize the solar or\nalbedo flux absorbed. The detectors are cooled by thermoelectric coolers (TECs). The hot side of the TECs is\nconductively coupled to a detector plate. The total waste heat rejected by the TECs is 33.6 W. The detector radiator\nwraps around the lOB and is an integral part of the detector plate. It also has AZW/LA-11 low absorptance white\npai:lt. The 56 concentrators are mechanically supported by the concentrator plate. Each concentrator aperture has a\nthin aluminized polyimide film. There are 56 sunshades to prevent sunlight from entering the concentrators. They\nare thermally isolated from the concentrator plate. The lOB side plates, bottom plate and detector plate are insulated\nwith multi-layer insulation (MLI) blankets. Figure 9 shows the thermal model for the NICER in the stowed\nconfiguration, and with two other payloads, in the Dragon trunk. Figure 10 displays the on-orbit thermal model\nwhen the Dragon is berthed to the ISS.\n\nDetector\xc2\xb7 Radiator (AZW/LA-11\n\n/oncentrator Aperture Sunshades (56)\n\nMLI\nThermal Sharing Plate with Paraffin Panels\nElectronics Boxes (AZWILA-II White Paint Patch Radiators)\n\nFigure 8.

Reduced Thermal Model for NICER in Dragon Trunk Berthed to ISS.\n\nB. Dragon Berthed t~ ISS\nWhen the Dragon is berthed to the ISS, pre-heaters on the NICER payload are powered by 66.7 W at 106 V-126\nV and controlled by mechanical thermostats. The set point of the thermostats is 30"C so that the heaters utilize all\nthe 66.7 W available power for thermal energy storage. With 67.7 W of heater power, its worst cold case quasisteady state average temperature prediction is 13.2"C. Sunlight and eclipse in the ISS low Earth orbit (LEO) lead to\nquasi-steady state instead of steady state temperatures.\nParaffin selection is strongly dependent on the quasi-steady state temperature prediction of a payload. Both\nDodecane (C 12H26) and Tetradecane (C 14H30) have a high latent heat of fusion per unit mass (217 kJ/kg and 228\nkJ/kg respectively). However it is important to ensure all the paraffin is melted and has adequate margin. Hence\nTetradecane, which has a 6"C melting point (i.e., 7.3"C margin), is not chosen. Tridecane (C 13H28), which has a -5\'C\nmelting point, is also not selected because its latent heat of fusion per unit mass is only 155 kJ/kg. A lower latent\nheat of fusion per unit mass requires more mass. Dodecane, which has a -1 O\'C melting point, is chosen.\nC. Paraffin PCM Locations and Contamination Mitigation\nThe locations of paraffm PCM for the NICER payload are described. For the electronics boxes, paraffin PCM\npanels are attached to the thermal sharing plate which is shown in Fig. 8. A total of four paraffin panels are used.\nEach panel has 0.5 kg of paraffin PCM. The paraffin panels are sandwiched between the Electronics Boxes thermal\nsharing plate and IOB base-plate. The exposed area of these panels is very small. Kevlar is used on this small area to\nincrease protection from micro meteoroid damage. For the lOB, paraffin PCM panels are attached to the side plates\nof the lOB. A total of six paraffin panels irre used to wrap around the side plates. Each panel has 0.38 kg of paraffin\nPCM. These six paraffin panels are internal to the IOB which includes base-plate, detector plate, concentrator plate\nand side plates. For the side-plates, there is a black polyimide/Kevlar layer, under the MLI, to add protection against\nmicrometeoroid damage. A total of 4.28 kg ofDodecane stores 929 kJ of thermal energy as latent heat.\nA 50\'C maximum temperature limit is used for Dodecane in the NASA MESSENGER mission. The same limit\nis being used for the NICER payload. The bakeout temperature for the NICER paraffin panels during ground testing\nwill be limited to 50\' C.\nD. Removal of Payload from Dragon Trunk\nDuring removal of the NICER payload from the Dragon trunk by the SPDM, there are up to 6 hours without\npov.er. The electronics box and detector radiators will continue to radiate heat to space. Also there will be heat leaks\nthrough the MLI blankets and through the concentrator thin aluminized polyimide film aperture covers to space. For\nthe thermal analysis to be conservative, no sunlight is assumed to be incident on the NICER payload during the\ntransfer. Figure 11 presents the NICER temperature predictions during the removal from the Dragon trunk and\ntransfer to the EOTP. When NICER cools down to -lO\' C, the paraffin PCM begins to freeze at its melting point.\n6\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nWhen all the paraffm has changed to solid, its temperature continues to decrease. When it arrives at the EOTP after\n6 hours without power, the temperature prediction is -13 \xc2\xb7c, which has a 17"C margin and is adequate.\n\nDrago\\rthe~ to\n\n. i\n\n20\n\ni\n\n10\n\n~\n..\n\n~\n\n-\n\n20\n\n--.\n\n~roM RemoVes N!ICEf from Trunk\n\nJJI!":"\n\nI\n\n,_1\n- - - :\n\ni\n\nI\n-+---!\n\nlI\n\nI\n\n:\n\nl :\n\ni\nI\n\ni \'\n\nI\n\ni\n\nParaffin.

Conclusion\nThe novel thermal design concept presented in this paper uses paraffin PCM with a -1 0 \xe2\x80\xa2 C and 10 \xe2\x80\xa2C melting\npoint to store thermal energy in a payload with large radiators while in the SpaceX Dragon trunk. It overcomes the\nproblem of not enough heater power to increase the temperatures to higher than the -10 \xe2\x80\xa2 C and 10 \xe2\x80\xa2 C range. If\nparaffin stores enough thermal energy and changes phase at -1 0 \xe2\x80\xa2 C to 10 \xe2\x80\xa2 C during 6-hours without power, the\npayload temperature is above the -30 \xe2\x80\xa2 C survival limit when it arrives at the EOTP at the end of the 6-hour cooldown period.\n\nReferences\n1\n\nhttp ://spacexlaunch.zenfolio. corn/\n\n2\n\nSpaceX IDD, C3-1 Vehicle Interface Definition Document rev 13, dated March 2012.\nFarner, D., Guidelines for Payload Thermal Design and Capability Assessment for Dragon Trunk (Version 2.0, Revision\n1), Sept. 28, 2012, NASA JSC.\n4\nHale, D.
