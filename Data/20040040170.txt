Chamis and Isaiah M. Blankson\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\nGlenn Research Center\nCleveland, Ohio 44135\n\nSummary\nThe exoskeletal engine concept represents a new radical engine technology with the potential to\nsubstantially revolutionize engine design. It is an all-composite drum-rotor engine in which\nconventionally heavy shafts and discs are eliminated and are replaced by rotating casings that support the\nblades in spanwise compression. Thus the rotating blades are in compression rather than tension. The\nresulting open channel at the engine centerline has immense potential for jet noise reduction and can also\naccommodate an inner combined-cycle thruster such as a ramjet. The exoskeletal engine is described in\nsome detail with respect to geometry, components, and potential benefits. Initial evaluations and results\nfor drum rotors, bearings, and weights are summarized. Component configuration, assembly plan, and\npotential fabrication processes are also identified. A finite element model of the assembled engine and its\nmajor components is described. Preliminary results obtained thus far show at least a 30-percent reduction\nof engine weight and about a 10-dB noise reduction, compared with a baseline conventional highbypass-ratio engine. Potential benefits in all aspects of this engine technology are identified and tabulated.\nQuantitative assessments of potential benefits are in progress.\n\nIntroduction\nCurrent gas turbine engines are constructed mostly from heavy metals, have central shafts and discs,\nrequire lubricated bearings, need extensive cooling for hot components, are subject to catastrophic failure\ndue to disc bursts from high tensile loads, require heavy containment devices, are subject to severe\nimbalance (or vibrations) that could wipe out the whole rotor stage, are prone to high- and low-cycle\nfatigue, and are limited for specific vehicle class. A novel engine concept is needed to enable a much\nlighter engine with capabilities such as: (1) much higher efficiency; (2) improved reliability and risk\ncompared with present technology; (3) flexibility for increased thrust growth; and (4) versatility to power\ndifferent types of vehicles with radically different power requirements. The objective of this report is to\ndescribe that novel type of engine\xe2\x80\x94the exoskeletal engine (ESE), which is of the drum-rotor type. It is an\nall-composite engine that consists of four concentric shells (or five for counter rotating stages), each made\nfrom a different type of composite (polymer, metallic, or ceramic) to accommodate different temperature\nregimes. The ESE concept subjects all rotating parts to compression, permitting use of notch-sensitive\nmaterials (such as homogeneous ceramics) that can operate at much higher temperatures in hot sections of\nthe engine than present materials. It substantially reduces the cooling requirements or allows an engine to\noperate at much higher temperatures with the same cooling method. It reduces the rolling-bearing stress\nby permitting multiple rows of bearings, thereby minimizing or even eliminating lubrication and cooling.\nThe ESE allows for progressive engine thrust growth capacity as well as reduces engine size. It is equally\napplicable to subsonic, supersonic, and hypersonic engines (ref. 1). The ESE permits adaptation of\nturbine-based combined-cycle engines. Some quantitative and qualitative benefits include: elimination of\nbore stresses, increased bearing life, increased tip speed, reduced airfoil thickness, increased flutter\nboundaries, elimination of containment requirements, increased blade high-cycle fatigue life, reduced\nparts count, decreased maintenance cost, decreased sealing and cooling requirements, and reduced\nblade-tip and case wear. Preliminary results show that the stresses in the blades, bearings, and back-up\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942004-212621\n\n1\n\nshell are well below those that are allowable for the composites to be used for these components. A\nunitized component fabrication is identified, and an initial assembly model is described. A finite element\nmodel of the entire engine has been developed indicating at least 30-percent weight savings resulting in a\nhigh-thrust-to-weight propulsion system. A video has been made to demonstrate ESE virtual operation. It\nis noted that, to the authors\xe2\x80\x99 knowledge (literature and patent searches) no comparable concept has been\npublished or invented as of this writing.\n\nFundamental Concept\nThe ESE concept eliminates the central heavy discs and shaft that are in conventional gas turbine\nengines (fig. 1). Instead, the ESE utilizes a drum rotor with the blades hanging inward from the outside.\nThe concept has three main features: (1) a drum-rotor configuration that subjects all rotating parts to\ncompressive stress fields, (2) an all-composite engine for light weight and for higher ratios of strength and\nstiffness to density, and (3) unitized components and subassemblies to reduce the part count. The\ndrum-rotor configuration consists of four concentric composite shells: (1) an inner composite shell, which\nis static and provides for flow path through the center cavity; (2) a stator shell, which is static and\nsupports the guide vanes, (3) a drum-rotor shell, which rotates and supports all blades, and (4) an outer or\nbackbone shell, which supports the bearings and is designed with acceptable hoop stresses to constrain the\ndrum-rotor shell to specified or no radial growth. The unitized component subassemblies include the inlet,\nthe fan stage, the low-pressure compressor stages, the high-pressure compressor stages, the high-pressure\nturbine stages, the low-pressure turbine stages, and the exhaust. A longitudinal section of the assembled\nESE is shown in figure 2. A longitudinal section of the inner shell is shown in figure 3; of the stator shell,\nin figure 4; of the drum-rotor shell, in figure 5; and of the exterior or backbone shell, in figure 6.\nA low-pressure turbine is included in figure 2 in case a two-spool arrangement is needed, which may\nbe the case in order to accommodate improved efficiency operations at off-design points. It is also noted\nthat the combustor is assumed to be the same as that of a conventional high-bypass-ratio engine. Some\nhigh-temperature composites may be used in the combustor as the detail design matures. It is also\nenvisioned that a gearbox may be required, which will become evident during detail design of the ESE.\nThe ESE is amenable to several alternative configurations. Those configurations have not gone through\npreliminary evaluations as yet and are planned to be discussed in forthcoming reports. Limitations of the\nESE concept are identified in descriptions of the specific features. It is noted at this point that fabrication\nof the ESE is by far the major challenge.\n\nInitial Evaluations\nProjected benefits were based on preliminary evaluations of the areas of concern (weight, cycle,\nnoise, etc.). An Advanced Subsonic Technology (AST) engine was used as the baseline for these initial\nevaluations. A schematic of the AST engine is shown in figure 7. The evaluations were performed by\nusing an integrated multidisciplinary computer code identified as Engine Structures Technology Benefits\nEstimator (EST/BEST). A block diagram of that computer code is shown in figure 8. The computer code\nis described in detail in reference 2. Initial component information from the AST engine used for each\nevaluation is summarized in table I. Initial weight benefits obtained from the evaluation are shown in\nfigure 9 as percentages in weight reduction from the baseline. In addition to weight evaluations, engine\nthermodynamic cycle evaluations were performed. Results from those evaluations are summarized in\ntable II. Comparable results were obtained for smaller thrust engines and are presented in reference 3.\nInitial evaluations for noise reduction of the ESE concept were also performed in reference 3. It is also\nnoted that the thermodynamic performance of the ESE is similar to the baseline engine, and the results\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942004-212621\n\n2\n\nshow that there are no show stoppers. The results of the noise evaluation are shown in figure 10. As can\nbe observed there is a potential for about a 10-dB noise reduction. This reduction is due to an inverted\nexhaust velocity profile, which results from the free-stream flow through the center cavity in the ESE.\n\nBearings\nBearings are a major engineering challenge for realization of the ESE concept. An example of a\npossible bearing arrangement for the fan stage is shown in figure 11. Though several bearing concepts,\nincluding lightweight ceramic and magnetic bearings, have been proposed as described in reference 4,\nherein we only discuss ball bearings made from graphite-carbon composite. The reason for considering\nball bearings from graphite-carbon fiber composites is their self lubricating features and high heat\nconductivity. These properties have the potential of eliminating all plumbing and lubricants that require\nexpensive operations and maintenance. A preliminary assessment of the loads on the ball bearings (the\nloads transmitted to the backbone shell from the rotor shell) is summarized in table III. It is observed that\nbearing loads are relatively small and easily accommodated. These load values were obtained by\nassuming that the entire radial load from the rotating shell is transferred through the bearings to the outer\nbackbone shell so that the rotating shell can be kept at zero or near-zero radial growth (fig. 11). As can be\nseen in table III, the average bearing load is 11.4 kips per circumferential inch. A multiple row of ball\nbearings is envisioned as shown in figure 12 for the radial bearings and in figure 13 for the thrust\nbearings. It is evident that a number of rows can be selected to reduce the load per bearing as needed. It is\nalso evident that the rotating shell may need to be configured so that the multiple bearing rows are\nuniformly loaded. Both of these are challenges that need to be overcome (or accounted for) in the detail\ndesign of the ESE. It is noted that the state-of-the-art for conventional bearings is a DN (rotor diameter in\nmillimeters times revolutions per minute) of 2.5 million compared to about 9 million for the ESE.\nTherefore, developing working bearing concepts for the ESE constitutes a major challenge.\n\nFinite Element Modeling\nA finite element model of the entire ESE was initiated in order to identify potential fabrication\narrangements and to evaluate (1) the integrated behavior of the engine, (2) the internal loads on the\ncomponents induced by the entire engine, (3) the load transferred from the vehicle to the engine during\nflight, and (4) engine induced loads on the pylon. The finite element model generated thus far includes all\nthe structural elements. A computer plot of the three-dimensional model is shown in figure 14.\nThe estimated weight from the finite element model of the entire engine is about 11 000 lb (table IV)\ncompared to the AST engine of about 22 000 lb (fig. 7). Adding about 4000 lb of other parts that are not\nincluded in the finite element evaluation results in an ESE weight of about 15 000 lb, or a weight\nreduction of about 7000 lb, which is about a 30-percent weight reduction in the engine. The large weight\nreduction will lead to a higher thrust-to-weight propulsion system and improved fuel-burned\nconsumption. The finite element results show that the shell sizes listed in table IV are sufficient to\nwithstand steady state anticipated loads. The shells are currently being evaluated for dynamic loads.\nA video was developed from the finite element model to illustrate that rotating and static components\ndo not interfere with each other. In addition, the model is presently used to evaluate structural responses\nsuch as frequencies, buckling loads, blade and vane stresses, bearing loads, individual shell deformations,\nand foreign object damage (FOD).\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942004-212621\n\n3\n\nPotential Fabrication Plan\nBased on the finite element model and individual (unitized) component simulation, a potential\nfabrication and assembly concept was identified. A schematic of that concept is shown in figure 15. All\nthe ESE components are displayed in this schematic except the combustor, which is assumed to be the\nsame as that used for the AST baseline as mentioned previously, and perhaps the only noncomposite\ncomponent. At this time, it is envisioned that the unitized components can be fabricated by a preform\nprocess. In that process, the components are woven to near-final shape first then infiltrated by a matrix\nthat is suitable for expected component temperatures. The authors consider the fabrication of an allcomposite ESE (made from polymer, metallic, and ceramic composites) to be a major challenge in its\nsuccessful evolution from a concept to a marketable product. The fabrication and assembly schematic\nshown in figure 15 was used to make a rapid prototyping model, a CAD model of which is shown in\nfigure 16.\n\nPotential Benefits\nBased on the preliminary results, the ESE concept can potentially lead to a large weight savings\nbecause the heavy discs and shafts are eliminated, resulting in a higher thrust-to-weight propulsion\nsystem. It also leaves a cavity in centerline that could be exploited in several different ways. In subsonic\napplications, venting the center cavity with a free-stream flow could potentially contribute to a large noise\nreduction in combination with an inverted exhaust velocity profile. In supersonic-hypersonic applications,\nthe centerline cavity might be used to conveniently house a ramjet or scramjet (or other advanced devices\nsuch as a pulse-detonation engine) as part of a turbine-based combined-cycle engine. Such an\narrangement could reduce the overall cross-sectional area of the propulsion system and thereby reduce\nweight and drag significantly.\nThese benefits and numerous others are listed in table V. This list was compiled based on the authors'\naccumulated aeropropulsion experience and potentially impact all aspects of engine technology from\ndesign, to fabrication, to operation, and to maintenance. Most of the benefits are qualitative and still need\nto be quantified. Although technical challenges need to be overcome, the authors believe these benefits\ncan be achieved as ESE technology evolves to maturity.\nThe potential benefits and early progress made were incorporated into a patent application. The patent\nwas issued in May 2002 (see fig. 17).\n\nConcluding Remarks\nThe revolutionary structural concept of the exoskeletal engine (ESE) was described in some detail.\nInitial evaluation results for geometry configuration, bearings, unitized fabrication, and assembly were\npresented. An assembled-engine finite element model was described, and weights of components and the\nengine obtained therefrom were summarized. A rapid prototyping model and projected qualitative\nbenefits were also discussed. Collectively, the progress made to date indicates that ESEs are viable with\nsubstantial benefits in all aspects of engine technology.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942004-212621\n\n4\n\nReferences\n1.

ABSTRACT (Maximum 200 words)\n\nThe exoskeletal engine concept represents a new radical engine technology with the potential to substantially revolutionize engine design. It is an all-composite drum-rotor engine in which conventionally heavy shafts and discs are eliminated\nand are replaced by rotating casings that support the blades in spanwise compression. Thus the rotating blades are in\ncompression rather than tension. The resulting open channel at the engine centerline has immense potential for jet noise\nreduction and can also accommodate an inner combined-cycle thruster such as a ramjet. The exoskeletal engine is\ndescribed in some detail with respect to geometry, components, and potential benefits. Initial evaluations and results for\ndrum rotors, bearings, and weights are summarized. Component configuration, assembly plan, and potential fabrication\nprocesses are also identified. A finite element model of the assembled engine and its major components is described.\nPreliminary results obtained thus far show at least a 30-percent reduction of engine weight and about a 10-dB noise\nreduction, compared with a baseline conventional high-bypass-ratio engine. Potential benefits in all aspects of this\nengine technology are identified and tabulated. Quantitative assessments of potential benefits are in progress.\n14. SUBJECT TERMS\n\n15.
