The use of EVA in payload systems design is discussed. Also discussed is space crew training. The role of EVA in connection with the Large Space Telescope and Skylab are described. The value of EVA in constructing structures in space and orbital assembly is examined. Excellent color illustrations are provided which show the proposed EVA functions that were described.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19760026181, "id": "474f20408c284804a3062d39b63c861d", "publicationDate": "1976-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19760026181.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19760026181/downloads/19760026181.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19760026181/downloads/19760026181.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19760026181/downloads/19760026181.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
