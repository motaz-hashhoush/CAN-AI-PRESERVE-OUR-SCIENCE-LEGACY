Closed loop guidance laws for braking and reverse thrust are derived for rollout, turnoff, and taxi, as functions of the landing speed, the desired taxi speed and the distance to go. Brake limitations for wet runway conditions and reverse thrust limitations are taken into account to provide decision rules to avoid tire skid and to choose an alternate turnoff point, farther down the runway, to accommodate extreme landing conditions.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19810022682, "id": "dbc5c178946b4986845275d1f25e7ea7", "publicationDate": "1981-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19810022682.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19810022682/downloads/19810022682.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19810022682/downloads/19810022682.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19810022682/downloads/19810022682.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
