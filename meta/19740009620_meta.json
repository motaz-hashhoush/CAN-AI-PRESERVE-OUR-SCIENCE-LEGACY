Results obtained in flight on vortex characteristics, such as decay of maximum velocity and vortex drift, are presented for distances behind a generating C-5 aircraft from 0.6 to 13.0 nautical miles. The lateral control activity of a CV-990 aircraft probing the vortices generated by the C-5 aircraft is illustrated and the effect of the C-5 aircraft configuration on this activity is indicated. Results are presented from near-field and far-field studies of accelerated vortex dissipation through the use of various devices such as mass ejection, spoilers, vortex generators, and trailing drag devices.", "title": "Vortex wake research", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-03T11:46:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19740009620, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Zalovcik, J.
