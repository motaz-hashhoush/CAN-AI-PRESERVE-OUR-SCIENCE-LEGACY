The isotopic data plot generally along the region of the mantle array, and the volcanic rocks vary in epsilon(Nd) from -0.9 to 5.7, and in epsilon(Sr) from 14.1 to -16.3. It is found that the volcanic rocks are part of an evolutionary pattern over a time period of 27 Ma, and that the pattern goes from an initially enriched source to that of a very depleted source. A greater-than-15-Ma preopening stage, characterized by an enriched isotopic signature, and a less-than-15-Ma postopening stage, characterized by a depleted signature, are identified. It is suggested that the degree of continental crust involvement is high during the preopening stages of a back-arc basin when it is associated with a rifted continental mass.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"volume": "78", "submissionId": 19860063661, "issue": "2-3", "issn": "0012-821X", "id": "b85079e8ac404946bb1d299e35ad3801", "publicationName": "Earth and Planetary Science Letters", "publicationDate": "1986-06-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
