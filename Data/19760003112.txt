Other EMI measurements Include field intensity from 3 cm- and 10 cm-wavelength\npulse radars, and conducted-emlsslon tests of primary power lines to both onboard radars. This information should be helpful to designers of maritime,\nL-Band Shipboard Terminals.\n\nThe United States Lines 15,690-ton, commercialcontainer ship, "American Alliance," was selected\nas lead ship for\' an EMI survey prior to installation- of experimental, L-Band Shipboard Terminals\non ships of this general class [3]. Such an EMI survey was conducted from June 16-20, 1974, onboard\nthe "American Alliance," while berthed at Port\nElizabeth, New Jersey (USA), and at sea while enroute from Port Elizabeth to intermediate ports along\nthe Eastern Coast of the United States (see map, Fig.\n1). The ship maintained a minimum of 20 miles distance from the shoreline, along its southerly route,\nso that interference from the shore would be beyond\nline-of-sight. A description of the EMI survey is\ngiven as follows, including test results. Additional\nexperimental data and design information is available\ninRef. [5].\n\nIntroduction\nNiW YORK CITY\nPORT ELIZABETH. N.J.\n(START OF VOYAGE)\n\nTwo, geostationary, maritime satellites, one\nover the Pacific and one over the Atlantic Ocean, will\nmake available high-speed communications and navigation services to ships at sea 111. A satellite, LBand Shipboard Terminal [21 - [4], operating within\nthe 1636. 5 - 1645.0MHz maritime band, will allow\nships to transmit voice, teletype, facimile and digital data messages, etc. via relay satellites to shore\nstations with a high degree of reliability. Similarily,\na reverse, shore-to-ship communications link will\ntransmit from satellite-to-ship within the 1535.0 1543. 5MHz maritime band.\n\nATLANTIC OCEAN\n\nThere is an interest in determining the magnitude\nand extent of electromagnetic interference (EMI) in\nterms of its relationship to the successful operation\nof an onboard, L-Band Shipboard Terminal. Sources\nof shipboard EMI include: receiving antenna noise\n(e.g., galactic and tropospheric) from mainlobe and\nsidelobes of the shipboard terminal antenna; nearzone field intensity from onboard 3cm- and 10 cmwavelength, high-power (40kW) pulsed radars; and\nconducted radio-frequency (RF) emissions along shipboard primary power lines.\n\n-1 -\n\nROUTE OF SHIP "AMERICAN\nALLIANCE" (NEW YORK TO\nPHILADELPHIA TO SAVANNAH)\n\nFig. 1. Route of ship along East Coast USA.\n\ncontaining S-Band (10 cm) and X-Band (3 cm) navigation radar cabinets.\n\nShipboard Installation\nVarious subsystems of an operational L-Band\nShipboard Terminal, supplied under a U.S. Maritime\nAdministration contract [2], provided essential equipment for this EMI survey, including a 1.2-m-dia. paraboloidal (dish) reflector, without radome, with 24 dB\ngain above isotropic at 1559MHz. Receiver subsystems resulted in a system noise figure of 5. 9 dB. The\n1.2m antenna contained, a right-hand circularly polarized, prime-focus RF feed for 1535 - 1660MHz\n(transmit and receive) operation.\nA make-shift antenna stand, and tripod mount\nwith azimuth-elevation swivel axes, were used to\nposition the dish antenna centerltne approximately\n2.8m above the deck of the Flying Bridge for antenna\nmainlobe clearance. The above-deck configuration\nfor the vessel, "American Alliance" is given in Fig.\n3. The antenna stand was positioned on the starboard\nside of the ship\'s "Flying Bridge" (Fig. 4), in the\napproximate location selected tentatively for an operational L-Band Shipboard Terminal. A 12-mlength,.low-loss coaxial cable ran from the output\nterminal of the 1.2 m dish antenna to EMI test equipment located in the ship\'s Wheelhouse immediately\nbelow the "Flying Bridge." Additional EMI testequipment was operated also in a below-deck Storage Room\n\nAntenna-Noise Temperature Measurements\nWith the 1.2m antenna positioned on the Flying\nBridge (Fig. 4), antenna-noise temperature at a\ncenter frequency of 1559 MHz was measured using an\nAirborne Instruments Laboratory Type 2392B Radiometer [61, and cold-load reference temperature\n(liquid nitrogen, 77 K) located in the Wheelhouse (Fig.\n5). A continuously-variable precision attenuator\n(ARRA* Type 5614-60 L) was adjusted to obtain an\nequal output reading on the X-Y Recorder for both\nswitch positions A and B.

Two methods\n[7] were necessary: Method 1 was used for computing values of TA less than, or equal to the coldload reference temperature, T ref = 80K; Method 2\nwas used for values of TA > Tief = 80 K. A description of each method follows.\n\nLa = total attenuation power loss ratio for coldload reference arm\nAgain setting T\'A = Ta in (4) and (5), gives a value of\nTA as,\n(6)\n\nNote that when La = Lw, TA = T r e f . Whereas Method\n1 is used only for values of TA < T r c f , Method 2\nis used only for values of TA > T r e f .\nTest Results\n\nMethod 1\n\nAntenna-noise temperature measurements were\nmade both at sea and in the harbor; in general,\nantenna-noise temperatures were lower at sea (Figs.\n6, 7). This is especially true of "hot spot"* noise\ntemperatures resulting from harbor-generated EMI\n(e.g., loading cranes, dock rotating machinery.\netc.). Also, a series of "hot spots" were identified\nas 1559MHz signals from the NASA Applications\nTechnology Satellite (ATS-6), currently in geostationary orbit at 94 W. longitude (Fig. 6).\n\nThe apparent antenna-noise temperature TA,\nmeasured at switch terminal A, is expressed as\nTA = TA w + (1 - w) T0 degs Kelvin (K)\n\n(1)\n\nfor 0 < to <1 (dimensionless). Similarly at switch\nterminal B,\n\'Ta = T r e f a - K l - a ) T 0 d e g s K\n\n.

Exceptions are the\ntwo "hot spot" noise temperatures resulting when\nthe 1.2m antenna mainlobe pointed-toward the radarscanner platform on the mast (65\xc2\xb0 elevation angle,\nFigs. 6 and 7), and when the Sun entered the mainlobe at 75\xc2\xb0 elevation angle (Fig. 7).\nIn general, the measured steady background\nnoise temperature increased sharply below 5\xc2\xb0 elevation angle (Figs. 6, 7). However, at angles greater\nthan 10\xc2\xb0, the steady component remains fairly constant vs. elevation angle from 10\xc2\xb0 - 85\xc2\xb0. - The average\nbackground noise temperature varies, within this\nrange of angles, from 50K to 60 K, at sea; and from\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2Noise temperatures greater than steady background noise temperature.\n\n- 3-\n\nTable 1\nComparison of theoretical vs. measured antennanoise temperature at 1.6 GHz\n\nA\nATS6\n/ SATELLITE\n\n/\n\no\n\nAntenna\xe2\x80\x94Noise\nTemperature (degs K)\n\nO 200\n\nBlake\'s [e]\nTheoretical\nValue\n\nIn-Harbor\nData\n(Fig. 6)\n\n0\xc2\xb0\n\n125 K\n\n150 K\n\n5"\n\n70 K\n\n68 K\n\n68 K\n\n10\xc2\xb0\n\n62 K\n\n90\xc2\xb0\n\n64 K\n65 K*\n\n56 K\n\n55 K\n\n= 160\n\nElevation\nAngle\n\nSTEADY BACKGROUND\nNOISE TEMPERATURE\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n60\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\nAt-Sea\nData\n(Fig. 7)\n,\n\n96K\n\n55 K*\n\nELEVATION ANGLE - DEGREES ABOVE HORIZON\n\n*ActuaUy @ 85\xc2\xb0 elevation angle.\n\nFig. 6. 1.2m (4 ft) dish antenna-noise temperature\nvs. elevation angle In harbor 1559MHz\ndata "American Alliance."\n\na receiving system noise temperature of only 300 K \xe2\x80\x94\na significant Improvement of 5dB in received carrierto-noise spectral density ratio compared to 950 K\n(noise figure = 5.9dB).\n\nSUN\nIN MAINLOBE\n\nField Intensity Measurements\n. Field Intensity measurements were made using\na Singer-Stoddart NM-65T Radio Interference Analyzer, with standard horn antenna for L-Band measurements (1535 - 1660MHz, in band), and a broadband log-spiral conical antenna for the 1-10 GHz frequency range. Measurements were referenced to\nseveral locations: at the RF feed of the 1.2m dish\nantenna positioned on the starboard side of the "Flying\nBridge;" at the radar-scanner platform on the mast;\nand In the be low-deck Storage Room 1m from the\nS-Band and X-Band radar cabinets (Fig. 8).

Each data point (dot), in\ngeneral, represents 18 independent measurements,\'\nobtained at azimuth angles from 0\xc2\xb0 - 360\xc2\xb0, in 20\xc2\xb0 increments. Antenna-noise temperatures not averaged\ninclude all "hot spot\'.\' noise temperatures identified by\ncircled X\'s.\nBlake [8] gives theoretical values of TA for a\nground-based (approximately at sea level) antenna,\nat 1. 6 GHz, as given in Table 1. Steady background .\nnoise temperature data points from Figs. 6 and 7 Indicate close agreement, except at 0\xc2\xb0 elevation angle.\nSince the antenna-noise temperature (Table 1) is\nonly 70K, or less, for elevation angles of 5\xc2\xb0, and\ngreater, it is worthwhile for equipment designers to\nstrive for improving receiving system noise temperature. For example, modern low noise bipolar\ntransistor amplifiers have noise figures as low as\n2.0dBat 1.6GHz. Assuming TA = 70K and 1. OdB\ntransmission loss between the antenna output terminals and the preamplifier input terminals, gives\n\nTable 2 shows the lowest field Intensity, in-band\nwithin 1535 - 1660MHz, as 35dB/MV/m/MHz for the\nFlying Bridge location; higher field intensities exist\nat the radar-scanner platform and Storage Room locations. Therefore, the Flying Bridge is a preferred\nlocation, above deck, from the standpoint of experiencing minimum field Intensity from the S-Band and\nX-Band antenna scanners.\nOn the other hand, field intensity in-band, within\n1535 - 1660MHz, atl-m distance from the radar cabinets in the Storage Room location, are equivalent,\nor greater than above-deck measurements (Table 2).\nThis is attributed primarily to radar cabinet-case\nradiation.\nThe field Intensity measurements in the L-Band,\nS-Band and X-Band regions are severe enough to warrant special attention to shielding requirements for\nL-Band Shipboard Terminal equipment that might be\ninstalled in the Storage Room, or at the radar platform on the mast.\nAlso, a Hewlett Packard Type 14IT (8555A) Spectrum Analyzer was used to measure radar interference\n\n-4 -\n\nTable 2\nBroadband field intensity levels in dB/jiv/m/MHz\nat selected locations\nShip\nLocation\nFlying\nBridge\n(Starboard\nSide, 2.8m\nabove deck)\n\n15351660 MHz\n(In-Band)\n\n3.1 GHz\n(S-Band\nRadar)\n\n9. 4 GHz\n(X-Band\nRadar)\n\n35\n\n125.5\n\n125\n\n53.5\n52.5\n\n136.5\n131.5\n\n162\n157\n\n1m from\nS-Band\nRadar\nCabinet\n\n77.5\n\n104.5\n\n1m from\nX-Band\nRadar\nCabinet\n\n51\n\nRadarScanner\nPlatform:\nAft*\nStarboard*\n\n(a) Field intensity measurement with log-spiral\nconical antenna on starboard side of\nFlying Bridge.\n\nStorage\nRoom:\n\n115\n\n*1.2m outboard, and level with, the radar\nplatform.\n(b) Radar transmitter cabinet field intensity\nmeasurements with horn antenna\n(Storage Room).\n\nemissions were on the order of 50 dB higher on the\nlower bands and 15dB higher on the upper bands.\n\nFig. 8.

The direct-line distances from the 1.2m dish antenna is 9.2m to the\nS-Band radar-scanner, and 7.4m to the X-Band\nscanner. With the mainlobe of the 1.2m dish antenna pointing directly at each respective radar\nscanner, measured received signal power is shown\nin Fig. 9(a), (b). Fig. 9(c) illustrates the extremely\neffective filtering action of a bandpass filter in the\nDuplexer.\n\nThe broadband measurements on each shipboard\npower line to the S-Band and C-Band radar cabinets\nexceeded limits specified in MIL-STD-461A. Therefore, equipment designers should take precautions\nto provide appropriate power line filters for equipment operating from power lines leading to the radar\nsets.\nConducted RF emissions on the radar power\nlines were measured also with a H-P 141T (8555A)\nSpectrum Analyzer, and Stoddart Current Probe.\nSince an IF output is typically 70 MHz, the Fig. 10\nnoise level at 70 MHz is equivalent to 36 dB/^A/MHz\nwhich is well below the MIL-STD-461A limit, extrapolated to 70 MHz.\n\nConducted-Emlssion Tests\n\nInterference to Radars\n\nNarrowband and broadband conducted emissions\nmeasured on the ship\'s power lines at the terminals\nof the radar set cabinets in the Storage Room were\nin almost all instances higher than similar measurements in a typical commercial laboratory in the USA.\nThe comparison was made on an octave-by-octave\nbasis from 150kHz to 32MHz, the frequency range\nof the Singer-Stoddart NM-25T Radio Interference\nand Field Intensity Analyzer and Stoddart clamp-on\nCurrent Probe used.
