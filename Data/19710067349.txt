A divfded shield or a u n i t s h i e l d around the engines was not\nconsidered because of t h e l a r g e i n l e t and exit ducts required to pass the\nengine airflow.\nThe a i r p l a n e s t r u c t u r e is thus n t protected from any\no\npossible deleterious effects of radiation, but no study WBS made o f t h i s\nproblem.

The lead acts to attenuate t h e gamma rays.

This corresponds to a power\nl e v e l of approximately 360 megawatts per engine.\n\nNACA RM E57F17\n\n4\n\nDetaiLed calculations were c a r r i e d o u t t o determine t h e shield thicknessnecessary for shielding against radiation\nfrom two engines. These\ncalculations were then modified for shielding againet radiation from one\nand four engines.\n\n.\n.\n\n- The shield-weightcalculations were\nShield-weight calculations.\ncarried out in two p&s.\nThe f i r s t w s t o determine the shield thickness\na\nThe second was t o modnecessary t o s h i e l d a g a i n s t the d i r e c t r a d i a t i o n .\ni f y t h i s shield thickness t o account f o r the additional dose due t o airscattered radiation.\nFor the direct-dose calculation, the source\nof neutron and gamma-ray\na\nradiation w s divFded i n t o two p a r t s , one corresponding t o t h e r a d i a t i o n\nfrom the f r o n t of the reactor, and the other correspondfng t o r a d i a t i o n\nfrom one-half of the cylindrical side surface\nof the reactor. The value\no f one-half was chosen because t o an observer i n t h e crewcompartment\nonlyone-half of the side surface of the reactor i s v i s i b l e . Core relaxation lengths f o r both neutron and gamma r a y s were evaluated for use i n\nthese direct-dose cslculations.\nBy using these core relaxation lengths\nand the dimensionsof the reactor, equivalent disk sources of radiation\nwere evaluated f o r b o t h t h e f r o n t\nand the side of the reactor.\nThe angle\nbetween t h e normal to. the equivalent side disk and a l i n e drawn t o the\ncrew compsrtment is very Large i n all the aircraft configurations conthe s o m e of radiation f r w\nsidered in these calculations. Therefore,\nt h i s d i s k was modified by a cosine distribution.\nThe angle between t h e\nf r o n t disk and the crew compartment was small i n most of t h e casea considered; s o the correction wa8 not made i n t h e s e c a s e s .\nThe shield thickness for the direct radiation on t h e sides of the\ncrew compartment was calculated only a t t h e position 9\n0 from the top.\n\'\nT h i s i s t h e position on the sides of t h e crew compartment which receives\nt h e maximum direct dose.\nThe thicknesses at the top and the bottom of\nt h e crew compartment were determined, as described later i n this section,\nIt w a s assumed t h a t an e l l i p s e drawn\nby air-scattering considerations.\nthrough the.se thicknesses,\nt o p and sides, would adequately describe the\nv a r i a t i o n i n t h e shield thickness at a l l p o i n t s on the periphery of the\nshield. A f e w calculations were carried out to substantiate t h i s\nassumption.\n\nBy assuming the sources mentioned previously, the direct-dose calculat i o n f o r t h e n e u t r o n r a d i a t i o n w a s performed a t each point of i n t e r e s t .\nA thickness of water was assumed and, with the a i d of Bu- Shield Reactor\ndata (ref. 21, t h e dose rate on the inside of the crew .compartment.&..t e angle of incidence of this radiation was not zero,\nh\nevaluated.Since\nt h i s dose rate was modified by a slant-penetration factor and a f a c t o r\nwhich accounts for the f a c t that t h e crew compartment acts l i k e a directional detector rather than\nan i s o t r q i c d - . -t e c t"o r . - The slant-penetration\n- e\n.. .\nf a c t o r was obtained by f i t t i n g . a n approximate equation t o c m e s by\n"\n\n.\n\n5\n\nNACA RM E57F17\n\nChapman (ref. 3).

Therefore, the actual lead thickness necessary\ngamma-ray shielding i s probably somewhat smaller than that calculated.\nFor the scattered-radiation shield thickness, the reactor\nwas assumed t o be a point source\nof 3 MV g m a rays and 3 MeV neutrons. Since\ne a m\nthe relaxation lengths in\nair, a t t h e a l t i t u d e considered, are very long,\nonly a single scattering\nphenomenon\nwas considered. This calculation\nestablished the shield thickness for the front\nof t h e crew compartment;\nand, since the angle of incidence of the direct radiatFon at t h e t o p and\nt h e bottom of the c r e w compartment is very nearly 90\xc2\xb0, only a small f r a c t i o n of the incident direct radiation would p e n e t r a t e t h e s h i e l d a t t h e s e\npoints. Therefore, the shield thickness\nat these points w a s determined\nby the scattered radiation.\nAirplane\nOn the basis of preliminary calculations, a reference airplane w s\na\ndesigned that w a s expected t o y i e l d good performance at a Mach number of\n4.25 and &n a l t i t u d e of 70,000 f e e t ( s e e table I and f i g . 3 ) .\nThe e f f e c t\nof redesignin@;-the airplane was then investigated as each of t h e following parameters wa6 varied: wipg loading, weight, number and location of\nengines, shield weight,\ndesign a l t i t u d e , and airplane configuration.\n\nThe major assumptions\n\nm a d e for the reference airplane\n\nare as follows.\n\nConfiguration. - A canard configuration is used, with no horfzontal\nt a i l . The center of pressure of t h e canard surface i s 20 f e e t from t h e\nfuselage nose.\nThe canard-surface area and t h e v e r t i c a l - t a i l area a r e\neach equal t o 15 percent of t h e wing area. For stable flight, the canard\nsurface m u s t be a t a higher angle of a t t a c k t h a n t h e wing is; t h e r a t i o\nof angles of attack i s set at 1.5 during cruising.\nA d e l t a plan form i s employed f o r both the w i n g and t h e canard surface, with abiconvex a i r f o i l s e c t i o n .
