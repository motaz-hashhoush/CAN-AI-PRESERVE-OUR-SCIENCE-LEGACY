The vehicle includes left and right drive mechanisms. Each mechanism includes first and second traction elements for engaging the ground surface and transmitting a driving force between the vehicle and ground surface. Each mechanism includes first and second arms coupled to the first and second traction elements for relative rotation about first and second axis respectively. Each mechanism includes a rotor having a third axis, the rotor coupled to the body for rotation about the third axis and coupled to the first and second arms for relative rotation about the third axis. The mechanism includes first and second drive motors for driving the first and second traction elements and first and second transmissions, driven by the first and second motors and engaging the rotor. Driving the first and second traction elements simultaneously rotates the rotor relative to the first and second arms, respectively.", "title": "High mobility vehicle", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-24T08:18:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20080004884, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Wilcox, Brian H."}, "organization": {}}, "id": "d1c739096142435cb8c49ec5ea2e8032"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20080004884, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Nasif, Annette K."}, "organization": {}}, "id": "6c61b3d7936b417d84d293b8133b1c0b"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other - Patent", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20080004884, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20080004884, "id": "b62676c4a80741cba771d294dd5ce97f", "publicationDate": "2001-07-31T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20080004884.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20080004884/downloads/20080004884.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20080004884/downloads/20080004884.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20080004884/downloads/20080004884.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
