KSC is more\nthan just a launching facility, though. KSC houses many different types of labs that focus\nprimarily on technological and biological advancement for space exploration. These labs contain\nan abundant amount of information that can be used for other humanitarian purposes. Likewise,\nthere is information stored in KSC that could potentially be used for malicious purposes. Should\nany of this information ever fall into the wrong hands, the United States could be threatened.\nTherefore, there is a need to protect all of the sensitive information in KSC; this job is done by\nIT security assessors.\nThe need for IT security in government facilities was presented by the Federal\nInformation Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA). FISMA set out a mandate that\nemphasizes the importance of protecting information in federal agencies; however, FISMA does\nnot provide actual explicit guidelines. From this mandate, the National Institute of Standards and\nTechnology (NIST) created guidelines for securing sensitive but unclassified information in\nfederal institutions. While these guidelines are not entirely explicit, NIST provides the main\nguidelines for securing information. These guidelines affect how information is stored,\ntransferred, and secured in NASA, particularly with the management of electronic information\nlocated on computers. My mentor\'s job is to make sure that the standards set by NIST are\nimplemented by Kennedy Space Center\'s NASA Engineering (NE) Directorate lab facilities, as\nwell as the systems being developed by Constellation for the Launch Control System and Ground\nSystems. However, keeping track of every lab\'s security vulnerabilities in KSC can be\noverwhelming. My job is to make it easier for my mentor to organize information for each lab.\nThe NE labs located throughout Kennedy Space Center are assessed by the auditors in the\ndivision that I work with. In each lab, the auditors receive a copy of the current inventory list, a\nlab description document that provides the auditor with basic information about the lab and\ndiagrams of the lab\'s floor plan and network configurations. The auditors have a checklist of\nrequirements that each asset in the lab must meet. The auditor reports findings for the security\nrequirements that are not implemented and assigns a vulnerability level of low, moderate, or high\nto the missing requirement based on NIST\'s standards.\n\nSpeci.i Pubkcabon 800-53\t\n\nRecomniendeo Secorey ControR ire FedeCo infomabm System and Organizations\n\nCM-8 INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPONENT INVENTORY\nThe ongantzazwo devehip& documents, and maintains an iuvenaisy of liformanim tyusem\ncomponents that\na Accurately reflects the current infonnanon systeni.\nb.

CM-6\n\nIn this particular control, NIST provides guidelines for maintaining a system inventory.\n\nThe Lab inventories, vulnerabilities, and other related documents were provided to me by\nmy mentor\'s co-worker, Ross Nordeen. I translated all of the information given to me into an\neasily navigable database. To organize this information, I made a few basic tables, within a\nmaster database, to combine all of the related data together. From those tables, I created queries\nthat show specific information from the tables. From those queries and tables, I created forms\nthat organize the data into a more visually appealing presentation. Aside from showing\ninformation, the forms also run programmable functions for purposes such as navigation. I have\nall of the major forms linked together with navigational, macro-embedded buttons.\nFigure 1\n\n\t\n\nFigure 2\nC.rozd Test ant\n\nLilt Locator: Inseritory\n\'i\'\n\nLIJ\n1[,i1L\n\n.5\n\n-\t\n"Lab Locator" page lists the lab names. \t\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\nClicking on a lab name will open its respective form.\n\nPrior to working at KSC, I was not entirely sure as to what kind of work was done at\nNASA other than what I have seen in the media. I knew that KSC was more than just a place\ndedicated to spacecraft launching, but I had no idea as to what went on inside of the rest of the\ncenter. Throughout this internship, though, I learned how the management in KSC works.\nWhile compiling all of the information provided to me, I learned more about Microsoft Access\nand its various functions. My knowledge of Microsoft Access was also limited prior to\nbeginning my internship. Before my internship, I only knew how to make simple queries, forms\nand reports in Access. Now, I am able to create navigational forms, known as switchboards, and\nprogrammable macros.\n\nAside from learning about STEM related practices and lessons, I have also gained\nknowledge of several life lessons as well; most predominantly, the value of patience. One of the\nfirst things that my mentor told me was that the area that he works in is very busy, and that a\ngood sense of patience was needed. Many times, I found myself frustrated when I found that I\neither had too much or too little to do at work. However, I learned that patience reaped rewards.\nIn other words, I found through my experience that whatever stress I had to deal with presently\npaid off in the end. An example of when I needed to rely on patience is when I began working\nfor my mentor. After sitting through two days of orientation, I was eager to work on whatever\nproject was assigned to me. However, I was not going to receive my work assignments until the\nday after my first workday. In order to be proactive about waiting for my project, I decided to\nspend my free time by refreshing my knowledge of Microsoft Access. Doing this not only\nchanged attitude, but it also prepared me for the next day\'s assignment.\nOn account of the great opportunity presented to me by this internship program, I am glad\nto have been fortunate enough to be a part of a NASA center working environment. This\nsummer, I was able to indirectly work with some of the NASA labs as a part of an IT security\nassessment. I have learned about some of the STEM related disciplines in NASA as well as\nmany life lessons that I will take to heart for the rest of my life. I have also learned about a\ndifferent kind of job at KSC that while it does not contribute to space exploration, it helps protect\nthe center from exposing sensitive information.\nI am grateful that an internship like INSPIRE exists to offer opportunities to students, like\nme, who strive for a career in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics. For this, I\nwould like to thank Mrs. Priscilla Moore, Mr. Jim Gerard, and many others for coordinating the\nINSPIRE experience for KSC. I appreciate all of the help and guidance that I received from my\nmentor, Mr. Robert Van Arsdalen, and his co-workers, Mr. Ross Nordeen and Mr. Clyde Box. I\nam especially grateful for the various tours and other events that I was a part of and the\nindividuals responsible for directing these events, including: Mr. Lynn Svedin, Mrs. Laurie\nGriffin, Mrs. Karen Mendoza, Mr. Eduardo Lopez Del Castillo, and Mr. Rey Diaz. I would also\nlike to thank my family, Rey, Iris, and Angelica Diaz, for being extremely supportive of me. If it\nwere not for everyone\'s collective effort, I would have not been a part of the INSPIRE program\nthis summer.\n\n'
