The existing data sources that have been evaluated have been\nfound to be lacking in two areas: The actual data that was recorded and missing elements to\nthe system architecture. Many previous tests addressing collision avoidance were conducted\nwithout a remote operator. As such, they are missing critical elements that are required to\nassess the CCA functional requirements. Tests such as ERAST were conducted with all of the\nUAS elements. However, ERAST tests were conducted as a demonstration and the data\nrecorded was of end-to-end performance. Many contributing elements of the system were\nnot individually recorded or were recorded at a data rate insufficient for the purposes of\nevaluating the CCA functional requirements.\nStatus:\nSEIT-Approved\n\nLimitations on use: This document represents thoughts and ideas of the Flight IPT work\npackage team. It has not been reviewed or approved as an Access 5 project position on this\nsubject. In addition to SEIT review and comment, the information also needs substantiation\nthrough simulation/flight demonstrations.\nThe CCA work package has elected to use simulation as their primary tool for evaluating\ntheir functional requirements. The simulation will contain all of the required elements for a\nproper evaluation. Likewise, the precise data required will be gathered with sufficient fidelity\nto allow an appropriate evaluation of the functional requirements.\nSimulation data is only as good as the fidelity of the simulator. To validate the CCA\nsimulation requires much of the same type of data that was found lacking in the existing data\nsets. Therefore, flight test will be used to gather data under select conditions to allow\nvalidation of the CCA simulation.\n\nFlight IPT CCA Test Objectives\nAccess 5\n8-31-05\nApproved by:\n\n____________________________________\nJim Evans, Technology Integrated Product Team Lead\n\n_____________________________________\nTony Ginn, Flight Integrated Product Lead\n\nThe following document was prepared by a collaborative team through the noted work package.\nThis was a funded effort under the Access 5 Project.\n\nBackground\nThe CCA WP is responsible for evaluating the CCA functional requirements\ndocument. To perform this, the CCA WP has established the following objectives:\n\nRevised CCA Objectives, 22 Mar 05\nApproved by Jim Evans/Tech IPT and Tony Ginn/Flight IPT on 23 Mar 05\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCGTO-1: Demonstrate the ability to detect cooperative traffic and provide\nsituational awareness to the ROA pilot.\n\xe2\x80\x93 STO-1.1: Determine the detection range and Minimum Detect Time1\nprovided by the CCA subsystem.

[CCA FRD 2.8.2]\n\n1\n\nAccording to the \xe2\x80\x9cSense and Avoid ELOS Definition v9\xe2\x80\x9d, Minimum Detect Time is defined as the time\nfrom detection of an intruder until the completion of an evasion maneuver (functions F2 through F6). In\nother words, the system must provide sufficient time after intruder detection for performance of all\nremaining collision avoidance functions resulting in successful execution of an avoidance maneuver if\nnecessary.\n2\n\nAs referenced against CCA Functional Requirements Document (FRD), Rev 3\n\n1\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCGTO-4: Demonstrate that the CCA subsystem provides information in sufficient\ntime for the ROA pilot to initiate an evasive maneuver to avoid collision.\n\xe2\x80\x93 STO-4.1: Demonstrate that the CCA subsystem alarm is provided in\nsufficient time for the ROA pilot to initiate an evasive maneuver. [CCA\nFRD 2.9.1]\n\xe2\x80\x93 STO-4.2: Demonstrate the utility of a CCA subsystem recommended\nevasive maneuver.

[CCA FRD 2.4]\n\xe2\x80\x93 STO-5.3: Demonstrate that the evasive maneuver resolves the collision\nthreat without creating another collision threat with nearby aircraft. [CCA\nFRD 2.9.6]\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCGTO-6: Demonstrate the ability to assess the adequacy of the maneuver and\ndetermine that the collision potential has been avoided.\n\xe2\x80\x93 STO-6.1: Determine that the evasive maneuver maintains separation\nfrom the threat aircraft. [CCA FRD 2.10.1]\n\xe2\x80\x93 STO-6.2: Demonstrate that the ROA pilot can determine when the ROA is\nclear of conflicting traffic. [CCA FRD 2.10.1]\n\nThree sources have been considered to provide information allowing the\nevaluation of the CCA functional requirements: existing data, simulation, and flight test.\nThe existing data sources that have been evaluated have been found to be lacking in\ntwo areas: The actual data that was recorded and missing elements to the system\narchitecture. Many previous tests addressing collision avoidance were conducted\nwithout a remote operator. As such, they are missing critical elements that are required\nto assess the CCA functional requirements. Tests such as ERAST were conducted with\nall of the UAS elements. However, ERAST tests were conducted as a demonstration\nand the data recorded was of end-to-end performance. Many contributing elements of\nthe system were not individually recorded or were recorded at a data rate insufficient for\nthe purposes of evaluating the CCA functional requirements.\nThe CCA work package has elected to use simulation as their primary tool for\nevaluating their functional requirements. The simulation will contain all of the required\nelements for a proper evaluation. Likewise, the precise data required will be gathered\nwith sufficient fidelity to allow an appropriate evaluation of the functional requirements.\nSimulation data is only as good as the fidelity of the simulator. To validate the\nCCA simulation requires much of the same type of data that was found lacking in the\nexisting data sets. Therefore, flight test will be used to gather data under select\nconditions to allow validation of the CCA simulation.\n\n2\n\nCCA Flight Test Objectives\nThe general test objective for the CCA technology demonstration flight test is to:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFGTO-1: Collect data to validate the CCA simulation.\n\xee\xa0\xba from the threat aircraft.
