b'Polyimide Foams Offer Superior Insulation\nNASA Technology\n\nA\n\nt Langley Research Center, Erik Weiser and\nhis colleagues in the Advanced Materials and\nProcessing Branch were working with a new\nsubstance for fabricating composites for use in supersonic\naircraft. The team, however, was experiencing some frustration. Every time they tried to create a solid composite\nfrom the polyimide (an advanced polymer) material, it\nbubbled and foamed.\nIt seemed like the team had reached a dead end in their\nresearch\xe2\x80\x94until they had another idea.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe said, \xe2\x80\x98This isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to work for composites,\nbut maybe we could make a foam out of it,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Weiser says.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was kind of our eureka moment, to see if we could\ngo in a whole other direction. And it worked.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWeiser and his colleagues invented a new kind of polyimide foam insulation they named TEEK. The innovation\ndisplayed a host of advantages over existing insulation\noptions. Compared to other commercial foams, Weiser\nexplains, polyimide foams perform well across a broad\nrange of temperatures, noting that the NASA TEEK\nfoams provide effective structural insulation up to 600 \xc2\xb0F\nand down to cryogenic temperatures. The foam does not\nburn or off-gas toxic fumes, and even at -423 \xc2\xb0F\xe2\x80\x94the\ntemperature of liquid hydrogen\xe2\x80\x94the material stays flexible. The inventors could produce the TEEK foam at a\nrange of densities, from 0.5 pounds per cubic foot up to\n20 pounds per cubic foot, making the foam ideal for a\nrange of applications, including as insulation for reusable\nlaunch vehicles and for cryogenic tanks and lines. They\nalso developed a unique, friable balloon format for manufacturing the foam, producing it as hollow microspheres\nthat allowed the foam to be molded and then cured into\nany desired shape\xe2\x80\x94perfect for insulating pipes of different sizes and configurations.\nThe team\xe2\x80\x99s originally unplanned invention won\nan \xe2\x80\x9cR&D 100\xe2\x80\x9d award, and a later form of the foam,\ncalled LaRC FPF-44 (Spinoff 2009), was named \xe2\x80\x9cNASA\nInvention of the Year\xe2\x80\x9d in 2007.\n\nPartnership\t\n\nGFT LLC\xe2\x80\x99s highly flexible polyimide foam\xe2\x80\x94seen here during\ntesting at Kennedy Space Center\xe2\x80\x94provides an ideal insulation\nfor pipes in cryogenic and other industrial and marine\napplications.\n\n152\t Industrial Productivity\t\n\nIn 2002, NASA licensed the TEEK family of foams\nto GFT LLC, based in Pennville, Indiana. GFT helped\nLangley manufacture samples of the foam for potential\nspace applications, such as for insulating the external tank\nof the Space Shuttle. The company also optimized the\ntechnology to create the first highly flexible foam from\npolyimide microspheres, allowing for the production of\nintricate pipe covers of different diameters and wall thicknesses. Kennedy Space Center also researched potential\nshuttle and cryogenic test equipment applications of the\nGFT-manufactured foams.\n\nBenefits\nGFT now offers the NASA-derived polyimide\nfoam technologies as its PerForma-H and VersaFlex\nproduct lines. The company produces the foams in\nvarying densities and formats, from sheets to foam-filled\nhoneycombs and panels to hollow microspheres. GFT\xe2\x80\x99s\nVersaFlex foams provide the added capability of extreme\nphysical flexibility over a 1,000-degree temperature range\n(-423 \xc2\xb0F to more than 600 \xc2\xb0F). Customers are taking\nnotice of the foam\xe2\x80\x99s special characteristics, says GFT\nCEO Phil Griffith, who admits to being \xe2\x80\x9cenamored\xe2\x80\x9d with\nthe material himself.\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot only is it an excellent thermal insulator, but\nit\xe2\x80\x99s also nonflammable and nontoxic in a fire,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are a lot of insulating materials out there, but of\nthose that are both fireproof and nontoxic, there are only\na few. You find even less at the density of these materials\nthat display outstanding mechanical properties. In fact,\nyou find only PerForma-H and VersaFlex.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe performance-to-weight ratio of the GFT foams,\nGriffith says, is better than any available alternatives,\nproviding substantial savings for customers: \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\nuse less of the polyimide foam to get the same insulating\nproperties as traditional materials, and it weighs about\none-seventh as much as calcium silicate and is on par\nwith fiberglass.\xe2\x80\x9d Griffith notes that one of GFT\xe2\x80\x99s large\nmarine customers has realized a 90-percent reduction in\nlabor costs from the adoption of PerForma-H as piping\ninsulation, as documented during the customer\xe2\x80\x99s shipboard installations on active duty vessels. The reduction\ncomes as a result of lowered installation and maintenance\ncosts, reusability, and an increased life cycle due to the\nfoam\xe2\x80\x99s high performance in heavy traffic areas and harsh\nenvironments.\nGriffith also points out that the material is\nenvironmentally friendly, manufactured without\nany poisonous halogenated substances and using solvents\nthat are completely recoverable.

NASA technology provides\na number of benefits that small businesses\nshould seriously consider.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x94Phil Griffith, GFT LLC\n\nNASA-developed foams is essentially \xe2\x80\x9ca wasteless process,\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe says.\nProviding pipe insulation that is easily installed on\nmarine vessels is currently the main use for GFT\xe2\x80\x99s foams.\nThe small company recently entered into product deals\nthat Griffith says will keep GFT manufacturing for the\nnext 10 to 15 years\xe2\x80\x94a major accomplishment considering the single significant disadvantage of the polyimide\nfoams is that they are presently somewhat expensive to\nmanufacture.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe foams have been expensive to make for a variety\nof reasons, one being the limited availability of certain\nSpinoff 2011\t\n\ncomponents,\xe2\x80\x9d Griffith explains. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve addressed that\nsupply issue to adequately support a commercial ramp.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe technology\xe2\x80\x99s NASA origin lends immediate credibility to GFT\xe2\x80\x99s products and opens doors for investment,\nGriffith says. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t get the technology NASA offers\nanywhere else. NASA technology provides a number of\nbenefits that small businesses should seriously consider.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWeiser, in the meantime, is working on acoustic\ninsulation applications for polyimide foams, a potentially\nsafer replacement for the more flammable fiberglass insulation used to dampen noise in commercial aircraft. He\nalso notes interest in the technology for safe, ecologically\n\nsound building insulation. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you have a fire, this foam\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t going to burn or produce smoke,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, a boon for\nbuildings from suburban homes to downtown high rises.\nIndustry applications outside of NASA are something\nthat Weiser always keeps in mind. \xe2\x80\x9cWe want to meet\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s goals first,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, \xe2\x80\x9cbut the value of the technology will go up for NASA if industry can use it for other\npurposes.\xe2\x80\x9d v\nPerForma-H\xc2\xae and VersaFlex\xc2\xae are registered trademarks of GFT LLC.\n\nIndustrial Productivity\t 153\n\nIndustrial\nProductivity\n\nGFT\xe2\x80\x99s NASA-derived foams (seen as preformed clamshells in the inset image) find significant use in engine rooms and\nother areas of marine vessels that require highly durable pipe insulation.\n\n'
