The SAFE was a lightweight, flat-fold array that employed a thin polyimide film (Kapton) as a substrate for the solar cells. Extension/retraction, dynamics, electrical and thermal tests, were performed. Of particular interest is the dynamic behavior of such a large lightweight structure in space. Three techniques for measuring and analyzing this behavior were employed. The methodology for performing these tests, gathering data, and data analyses are presented. The report shows that the SAFE solar array technology is ready for application and that new methods are available to assess the dynamics of large structures in space.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19870010947, "id": "84b630b510684eb4846d15f468a5d359", "publicationDate": "1987-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19870010947.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19870010947/downloads/19870010947.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19870010947/downloads/19870010947.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19870010947/downloads/19870010947.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
