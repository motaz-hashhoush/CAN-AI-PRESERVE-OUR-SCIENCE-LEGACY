HDLC is the standard framing technique used by all routers over clock and data serial lines and is also the basic framing used in all Frame Relay services which are widely deployed in national and international communication networks. In late 2003 a presentation was made to CCSDS committees to initiate discussion on including HDLC in the CCSDS recommendations for space systems. This presentation will summarize the differences between variable length HDLC frames and fixed length CCSDS frames. It will also discuss where and how HDLC framing would fit into the overall CCSDS structures.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20040081288, "endDate": "2004-06-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "Space Internet Workshop-4", "location": "Hanover, MD", "id": "255d1c264e114feba17a77498485dced", "startDate": "2004-06-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20040081288, "id": "acaa0239275841de8cd2ac7ea8f7aa3b", "publicationDate": "2004-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
