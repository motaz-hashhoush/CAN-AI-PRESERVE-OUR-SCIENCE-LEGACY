Winkler\nNaval Observatory\nABSTRACT\nPresent applications o f precise time and\nfrequency (T/F) technology can be grouped\nas follows:\n1.\n\nCommunications systems which require\nT/F for time division multiplexing and\nfor using spread spectrum techniques.\n\n2.\n\nNavigation systems which need T/F for\nposition fixing using a timed signal.\n\n3.\n\nScientific-Metrological applications\nwhich use T / F as the most precisely\nreproducible standard o f measurement.\n\n4. Astronomical-Space applications which\ncover a variety of the most denanding\napplications such a s pulsar research,\nVery Long Baseline Interferometry\n(VLBI) and laser/radar ranging. In\nparticular, pulsar time-of-arrival\nmeasurements require submicrosecond\nprecision over a period o f one-half\nyear referred to an extraterrestrial\ninertial system, and constitute the\nmost stringent requirements for uniform timekeeping to date.\nThe standard T/F services which are available to satisfy such requirements are\nbased on an international system of timekeeping coordinated by the Bureau International de 1\'Heure (BIH). The system\nutilizes the contributions from the major\nnational services for standard frequency\nand time (USNO and NBS in the U S A ) , and\nit is implemented through a variety of\nelectonic systems (HF, T/F signals, VLF,\nLoran-C, etc.).\nThe performance o f these\nsystems will be briefly reviewed. Several\n1\n\no f the user systems (such as VLBI) can,\nin turn, be used as contributors to the\nglobal effort of T/F distribution.\n\nMoreover, PTTI is the one common interface\nof all time-ordered electronic systems.\nTime coordination (not necessarily synchronization) is the first necessary step for\nany wide scale integration and mutual backup o f such systems.\nOVERVIEW\nIn this short overview we can only mention the major aspects of time and frequency (T/F) which will be discussed extensively in the papers of the Proceedings. The\nmain concepts are as follows:\n1. Time o f Day -t UT1 (Rotation of Earth)\n2. Clock Time at Standard Meridian + UTC\n3 . Synchronization\n4 . Accurate Frequency\n5. Relativity: Local (Proper) Time, Coordinate Time\n6. Coordination: 1 ms + 10 ~.ls p r o g r e s s during the last\n10 years.\n\nFor economical as well as practical reasons, SYNCHRONIZATION will usually be accomplished via clock time (UTC).\nVery accurate frequency cannot entirely be handled without\nalso considering time. Relativity aspects must be considered if precision of better than a few hundred nanoseconds\nis involved. Lastly, the various international time services are coordinated with the BIH to the order of 1 0 us 100 times better than required by pertinent CCIR recommendat ions.\nT/F has become a very active field during the last 10 years,\ndue largely to the availability of commercial atomic clocks.\nInformation is exchanged at a number of regular conferences, including the following:\n1. Annual Frequency Control Symposium*, Atlantic City\n(U.S. Army), May.\n2. CPEM, next meeting June 1976, Boulder (NBS-IJRSI-IEEE,\nConference Proceedings in IEEE Trans. I )\nN.\n3 . PTTI Planning Meeting*, Washington, December (annually), NASA-DoD.\n4 . URSI Commission 1 (National Meetings).\n\n2\n\n5. URSI Commission 1 (General Assembly ( 3 years), next\nin Lima, August 1975).\n6. IAU, Commission 31, General Assembly ( 3 years) next\nGrenoble, August 1976.\n7 . International Congress f o r Chronometry* (5 years),\nlast September 1974.\n\n*Proceedings available\n\nIn addition there are regular training seminars by various\ngroups, e.g., the NBS T/F seminars.\nLet us consider the uses o f T/F:\n\n1\'. UT1 (mean solar o r sidereal time) which is related\nto angular orientation o f the Earth is needed for navigation, space tracking and geodesy. Essentially this\napplication group is concerned with the orientation of the\nEarth in space and its rotation around its axis.\n2 . Other major uses deal directly with clock time.\nThese applications come from a variety o f time-ordered\nelectronic systems:\n\na.\n\nCommunications Technology\n1) Time division multiplexing - channel packing,\nmany stations on one frequency.\n2 ) Reducing spread spectrum acquisition window.\n\nb.\n\nElectronic Navigation in TOA Mode (Absolute)\n1) For improved geometry of position determination (RHO -RHO)\n2 ) For improved coverage - mixed systems.\n3 ) For integration with communication and identification systems.\n\n.\n\nc.\n\nMetrology\n\nTime and frequency are by far the best controllable parameters and can be used for measurement of length,\nvoltage, pressure, temperature, etc.\nd. Astronomy - Space Technology. This last application has the most stringent requirements - fractions o f\na microsecond over 1/2 year related to an inertial system\n(with relativity corrections for the movement o f the Earth\nin the solar system).\n3\n\nThese requirements f o r precise time are being satisfied in\na variety of ways; with time signals, publications and superpositioning of the timing capability on existing electronic systems.\nWe have available the following time information services:\n1.\n2.\n.\n\n3.\n\nBIH Announcements.\nU.S. Naval Observatory publications, particularly\nTime Service Announcements Series 1 through 17,\nand Almanacs (Ephemerides) (See Appendix)\nNational Bureau of Standards Time 6 Frequency\nBulletins.\n\n.\n\nThese services refer to time as it is disseminated by the\nfollowing systems:\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n\nHF Standard T/F Signals: (WWY, CHU, etc.).\nTimed electronic navigation signals: Loran-Cy\nOMEGA, Transit, and later Global Position System\n(GPS), etc.\nWideband Communication links: Two-way.\nPortable clocks, Precise Time Reference Stations\n(PTRS) .\nSpecial systems, largely under R6D: TV, etc.\n\nThe HF signals provide a global capability (including a\ngreat number of coordinated foreign services) o f 1 ms precision, if propagation and receiver delays ( 3 - 5 ms depending mainly on band width used) are taken into account.\nItem 3 is potentially the most accurate, but portable\nclocks remain our final "authority" to calibrate services.\n\nIn greater detail, we could summarize the distribution\ncapabilities as follows:\n1. HF radio time signals: 1 ms global\n0.5 p s global\n3 . VLF-OMEGA:\n1 - 3 ms phase track (Relative)\n0.5 us Northern Hemisphere\n4. Loran-C/D\n5. Satellites:\n0.1 p s "trunk line11,>\na.

Others:\n\nAs an example o f users who can a l s o help in g l o b a l timekeeping, we can mention VLBI which, as the following sketch\n\nshows, provides both synchronization and UT (also the polas\ncoordinates, x and y).\nPRINCIPLE OF VLBI TIME DETERMINATION\nUT1 VERSUS SYNCHRONIZATION\nA USER AND CONTRIBUTOR\nPlane Parallel\nWave Front Frsm\n\n3\n\n1 m UT Error\ns\n\nns Clock D i f f\nIncl.

With the availability of high performance atomic clocks (cesium beam, rubidium-gas cell and hydrogen-masers), the system designer\ncan allow remote stations to operate with a high degree of\nindependence (e.g. the VLBI receivers need no link, only\ninitial synchronization).\n\n10\n\nAs always, such e x t r a b e n e f i t s e x t r a c t a premium p r i c e of\na d d i t i o n a l complexity and t r a i n i n g o f o p e r a t o r s .
