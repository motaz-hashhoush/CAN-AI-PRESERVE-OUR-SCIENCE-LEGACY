Over the course of the past year, the Psyche team has actively worked to refine and mature the technical design, culminating in a successful completion of the Project Preliminary Design review and approval to proceed to Phase C in mid-2019. Psyche is a deep space mission utilizing solar electric propulsion (SEP), consisting of SPT-140 Hall thrusters which have been successfully employed on multiple commercial spacecraft. When launched, Psyche will carry over 1000 kg of Xenon, and will represent the farthest usage of electric propulsion usage from the Sun \u2013 a distance of over 3.3 AU. The use of solar electric propulsion in deep space has resulted in challenges unique to other missions. Spacecraft designs typically balance margins across two main elements \u2013 mass and power \u2013 that are independent of one another. Utilizing a low thrust trajectory through the application of electric propulsion introduces more elements - namely flight time, missed thrust percentage and thruster duty cycle. Moreover, these elements become connected, presenting additional relationships that must be considered. This paper will present an overview of the margin management process for Psyche, and how it has evolved from the early proposal stage to its current state. It will discuss the elements that are margined, their relationship with one another, and key uncertainties that must be addressed. It discusses challenges and mitigations obtained during the refinement of the Psyche project, culminating in a new margin strategy that enables optimization across many of the system elements, and will serve as a template for future deep space SEP missions.", "title": "2020 IEEE Paper on Psyche margin management, Draft", "stiType": "PREPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20220000879, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Hart, William"}}, "id": "f8e001bf3ca74db2ad8a9ba47fee13aa"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20220000879, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Oh, David"}}, "id": "2ab2dfa1ddc747a5b2eb9fab73fa88c8"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20220000879, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Polanskey, Carol"}}, "id": "e059b244cf524175bd94263600222b4a"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20220000879, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Seal, David"}}, "id": "3cb4f047a60b41d083c8d52a10a56c73"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20220000879, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Snyder, Steve"}}, "id": "fff1a87cd3574a4baa302ba54e270aed"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20220000879, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Stevens, Sarah"}}, "id": "0c450e6767f641969aa51132399da193"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20220000879, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Trofimov, Denis"}}, "id": "297d89745edd4fae9ebdc87f1b10e2e8"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Preprint (Draft being sent to journal)", "technicalReviewType": "NOT_SET", "modified": "2022-09-30T05:44:54.3061750+00:00", "id": 20220000879, "sourceIdentifiers": [{"number": "2014/52371", "type": "HANDLE"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20220000879, "publisher": "Pasadena, CA: Jet Propulsion Laboratory, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 2020", "id": "0fd23b76a909408abd083dc533580637", "publicationDate": "2020-03-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
