The Government may have certain rights in this invention.\n\n10\n\n15\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\nThe present invention generally relates to actuators, and\nmore particularly relates to linear, ball screw actuators that\ninclude a compliant ball screw stop.\n\n20\n\nBACKGROUND\nActuators are used in myriad devices and systems. For\nexample, many vehicles including, for example, aircraft,\nspacecraft, watercraft, and numerous other terrestrial and\nnon-terrestrial vehicles, include one or more actuators to\neffect the movement of various control surfaces or components. Many different types of actuator configurations presently exist. One particular type of actuator is a linear electromechanical actuator (EMA). A typical linear EMA includes a\npower drive unit, an actuation member, and a translation\nmember. The power drive unit, such as a motor, is configured\nto supply a drive torque to the actuation member, which in\nturn causes the translation member to translate.\nOne particular type of linear EMA is a ball screw actuator.\nThis type of actuator includes a ball screw and a ball nut. The\nball nut is mounted on, and is configured to rotate relative to,\nthe ball screw. In some configurations, the ball screw is the\nactuation member, and the ball nut is the translation member.\nWith these configurations, the power drive unit drives the ball\nscrew, which causes the ball nut to translate. In other configurations, the ball nut is the actuation member, and the ball\nscrew is the translation member. With these configurations,\nthe power drive unit drives the ball nut, which causes the ball\nscrew to translate. With either of these configurations, when\nthe power drive unit is an electric motor, a relationship of\nmotor current and force can be desirable for calibration purposes. Unfortunately, presently known actuators do not\nreadily allow this relationship to be determined when a positive position device is not present.\nHence, there is a need for an actuator that readily allows the\nrelationship of motor current and force to be readily determined when a positive position device is not present. The\npresent invention addresses at least this need.\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\nBRIEF SUMMARY\nIn one embodiment, an actuator includes a ball nut, a ball\nscrew, and a ball screw stop. The ball nut is adapted to receive\nan input torque and is configured, upon receipt thereof, to\nrotate and supply a drive force. The ball screw extends\nthrough the ball nut and has a first end and a second end. The\nball screw is coupled to receive the drive force from the ball\nnut and is configured, upon receipt of the drive force, to\nselectively translate between a retract position and a extend\n\nposition. The ball screw stop is mounted on the ball screw\nproximate the first end to translate therewith. The ball screw\nstop is configured to engage the ball nut when the ball screw\nis in the extend position, to translate, with compliance, a\npredetermined distance toward the first end upon engaging\nthe ball nut, and to prevent further rotation of the ball screw\nupon translating the predetermined distance.\nIn another embodiment, an actuator includes a ball nut, a\nmotor, a ball screw, and a ball screw stop. The ball nut is\nadapted to receive an input torque and is configured, upon\nreceipt thereof, to rotate and supply a drive force. The ball nut\nhas a first dog stop formed on an end thereof. The motor is\ncoupled to the ball nut and is configured to selectively supply\nthe drive torque thereto. The ball screw extends through the\nball nut and has a first end and a second end. The ball screw is\ncoupled to receive the drive force from the ball nut and is\nconfigured, upon receipt of the drive force, to selectively\ntranslate between a retract position and a extend position. The\nball screw stop is mounted on the ball screw proximate the\nfirst end to translate therewith. The ball screw stop has a\nsecond dog stop formed on an end thereof and is configured to\nengage the ball nut when the ball screw is in the extend\nposition, to translate, with compliance, a predetermined distance toward the first end upon engaging the ball nut, and to\nprevent further rotation of the ball screw upon translating the\npredetermined distance. The first dog stop and the second dog\nstop mate when the ball screw stop engages the ball nut.\nIn yet another embodiment, a method of establishing a\nrelationship between motor current and reaction force for an\nelectromechanical actuator (EMA) that is driven by a motor\nincludes providing a stop mechanism in the EMA that exhibits a predetermined force versus displacement characteristic.\nCurrent is supplied to the motor so that the stop mechanism is\nengaged and is displaced a predetermined distance thereby\nsupplying a reaction force. Motor current is measured while\nthe stop mechanism is engaged, and the relationship between\nmotor current and reaction force is determined.\nFurthermore, other desirable features and characteristics of\nthe actuator and method will become apparent from the subSequent detailed description and the appended claims, taken\nin conjunction with the accompanying drawings and the preceding background.\n\n60\n\n65\n\nThe present invention will hereinafter be described in conjunction with the drawing figures, wherein like numerals\ndenote like elements, and wherein:\nFIG. 1 depicts a plan view of one embodiment of a ball\nscrew actuator assembly;\nFIG. 2 depicts a close-up cross section view of a ball nut\nand a portion of a ball screw that may be used to implement\nthe actuator assembly of FIG. 1;\nFIGS. 3 and 4 depict two different side views of a ball\nscrew that may be used to implement the actuator of FIG. 1;\nFIG. 5 depicts a cross section view taken along line 5-5 in\nFIG. 3;\nFIGS. 6 and 7 depict plan views of the ball screw of FIGS.\n3 and 4 with a ball nut and ball screw stop mounted thereon;\nFIG. 8 is a close-up plan view of the ball screw stop\nmounted on the ball screw;\nFIG. 9 depicts a plan view of an embodiment of the ball\nscrew stop;\nFIGS. 10-12 depicts side, cross section, and end views,\nrespectively, of the ball screw stop;\nFIG. 13 depicts a close-up view of the end of the ball screw\non which the ball screw stop is mounted;\n\nUS 9,103,422 B2\n3\nFIGS. 14-16 depict various views of the ball screw, ball nut,\nand ball screw stop; and\nFIG. 17 depicts a process, in flowchart form, for determining a relationship between motor current and a known reaction force supplied from a spring member.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION\nThe following detailed description is merely exemplary in\nnature and is not intended to limit the invention or the application and uses of the invention. As used herein, the word\n"exemplary" means "serving as an example, instance, or\nillustration." Thus, any embodiment described herein as\n"exemplary" is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or\nadvantageous over other embodiments. All of the embodiments described herein are exemplary embodiments provided\nto enable persons skilled in the art to make or use the invention and not to limit the scope of the invention which is\ndefined by the claims. Furthermore, there is no intention to be\nbound by any expressed or implied theory presented in the\npreceding technical field, background, brief summary, or the\nfollowing detailed description.\nReferring to FIGS.1 and 2, an exemplary ball screw actuator 100 is depicted. The depicted actuator 100 is a linear\nelectromechanical (EMA) actuator and includes a pair of\nmotors 102 (102-1, 102 -2), a ball nut 104, and a ball screw\n106, all disposed at least partially within or on an actuator\nhousing assembly 112. The motors 102, which are mounted\non the housing assembly 112, may be variously configured\nand implemented. For example, each motor 102 may be\nimplemented using any one of numerous types of hydraulic\nmotors, pneumatic motors, or electric motors. In the depicted\nembodiment, each is implemented using an electric motor,\nwhich may be any one of numerous types of electric motors,\nsuch as an AC motor, a brushed DC motor, or a brushless DC\nmotor, just to name a few. No matter how the motors 102 are\nspecifically implemented, each is coupled to the ball nut 104,\npreferably via a non-illustrated gear set, and each is configured to selectively supply a drive torque to the ball nut 104.\nAlthough two redundant motors 102 are depicted in FIG. 1, it\nwill be appreciated that the actuator 100 could be implemented with more or less than this number of motors.\nBefore proceeding further, it is noted that the depicted\nactuator 100 additionally includes a pair of position sensors\n103 (103-1,103 -2). The position sensors 103, like the motors\n102, are mounted on the housing assembly 112 and may be\nvariously configured and implemented. In the depicted\nembodiment, however, the position sensors 103 are each\nimplemented using a resolver configured to provide an output\nsignal representative of actuator position.\nThe ball nut 104, which is shown more clearly in FIG. 2, is\nrotationally mounted in the housing assembly 112, via a\nplurality of bearing assemblies 202 (202-1, 202-2). The ball\nnut 104 is coupled to receive the input torque supplied from\none or both of the motors 102 and is configured, upon receipt\nthereof, to rotate and supply a drive force to the ball screw\n106. The ball nut 104 may be variously configured and implemented, but includes at least a first end 204, a second end 206,\nan inner surface 208, and an outer surface 212. The ball nut\nfirst end 204 has a first dog stop 214 formed thereon, the\npurpose of which will be described further below. The ball nut\ninner surface 208 defines a passageway 216 that extends\nthrough the ball nut 104 between the first and second ends\n204, 206, and has a plurality of helical ball grooves (or\n"threads") 218 formed thereon. The ball nut outer surface 212\nhas an input gear 222 coupled thereto and extending therefrom. The input gear 222 receives, via the non-illustrated gear\n\n4\nset, the rotational drive torque supplied from one or both of\nthe motors 102, which in turn causes the ball nut 104 to rotate\nand supply the drive force to the ball screw 106.\nThe ball screw 106 is mounted within the housing assem5 bly 112 and extends through the ball nut passageway 216. The\nball screw 106 is configured, upon receipt of the drive force\nsupplied thereto from the ball nut 104, to selectively translate\nbetween a retract position and a extendposition. As illustrated\nmost clearly in FIGS. 3-5, the ball screw 106 includes a first\nl0\nend 302, a second end 304, and an outer surface 306. The ball\nscrew outer surface 306 has a single or a plurality of ball\ngrooves (or "threads") 308 formed thereon. A plurality of\nnon-illustrated recirculating balls are disposed within the ball\n15 nut ball grooves 218, and in selected ones of the ball screw\nball grooves 308. The balls, in combination with the ball\ngrooves 218, 308, convert the rotational movement of the ball\nnut 104 into the translational movement of the ball screw 106.\nIt will be appreciated that the direction in which the ball screw\n20 106 travels will depend on the direction in which the ball nut\n104 rotates.\nAs FIGS. 6-8 further depict, a ball screw stop 120 is\nmounted on the ball screw 106 in a manner that causes the ball\nscrew stop 120 to translate with ball screw 106. The ball screw\n25 stop 120 may be variously implemented, but is configured to\nengage the ball nut 104 when the ball screw 106 is in the\nextend position. The ball screw stop 120 is additionally configured such that, upon engaging the ball nut 104, a portion\nthereof translates, with compliance, a predetermined distance\n30 toward the first end 302 of the ball screw 106 and, upon\ntranslating the predetermined distance, to prevent further\nrotation of the ball nut 104 in one direction, while allowing\nrotation thereof in an opposite direction. It will be appreciated\nthat the ball screw stop 120 may be variously configured to\n35 implement this functionality. One particular embodiment of\ntheball screw stop 120 is depicted more clearly in FIGS. 9-12,\nand with reference thereto will now be described.\nThe depicted ball screw stop 120 includes a guide member\n902, a stop member 904, and a spring member 906. The guide\n40 member 902 is mounted directly on, and surrounds, the first\nend 302 of the ball screw 106. As shown even more clearly in\nFIGS. 8 and 13, the guide member 902 is mounted on the ball\nscrew 106 via a fastener 1302 that extends through the guide\nmember 902 and the ball screw 106, and is held in place via a\n45 nut 1304.\nThe stop member 904 is coupled to the guide member 902\nvia the spring member 906, and also surrounds the ball screw\n106. The stop member 902 includes a first end 908 (see FIG.\n9), a second end 912, an inner surface 914, and an outer\n50 surface 916. The first end 908 is coupled to the spring member\n906, and the second end 912 has a second dog stop 918\nformed thereon. The second dog stop 918 is configured to\nmate with the first dog stop 214 that is formed on the ball nut\n104 when the ball screw stop 120 engages the ball nut 104.\n55 The inner surface 914 defines an opening through which the\nball screw 106 extends. The inner surface 914 also has a\nrotation limit feature 920 formed therein. In particular, a\nportion of the inner surface 914 has an increased diameter\nrelative to the remainder thereof, and thereby forms two\n60 engagement surfaces -a first engagement surface 922 and a\nsecond engagement surface 924. The purpose of the engagement surfaces 922, 924 will be described momentarily.\nThe spring member 906 is coupled between the guide\nmember 902 and the stop member 904, and is what causes the\n65 ball screw stop 120, and more specifically the stop member\n904, to translate with compliance. In the depicted embodiment, the spring member 906 is implemented as a torsion\n\nUS 9,103,422 B2\n5\nspring. It will be appreciated, however, that it may be implemented as a helical spring, a beam spring, or any one of\nnumerous other devices.\nThe first and second dog stops 214, 918, as noted above,\nwill mate and engage each other when the ball screw 106 is s\nmoved to the fully extended position. Because of the spring\nmember 906, when the first and second dog stops 214, 918\nengage, the ball nut 104 will begin rotating the stop member\n904 and to also drive it axially toward the first end of the ball\nscrew 106. However, the rotational and axial movements of io\nthe stop member 904 are limited. This is because when the\nstop member 904 has moved the predetermined distance\ntoward the first end 302 of the ball screw 106, the first engagement surface 922 will engage a stop feature 1306 (see FIG.\n13) formed on the outer surface 306 of the ball screw 106 is\nproximate its first end 302. When the first engagement surface\n922 engages the stop feature 1306, the stop member 904 will\nprevent further rotation of the ball nut 104 in the direction that\ncauses the ball screw 106 to translate toward the extend position. It is noted herein that the depicted spring member 906 20\nhas a helix formed therein that is opposite to the helix that\ndefines the ball screw threads 308. For example, in the\ndepicted embodiment the ball screw threads 308 are defined\nby a right-hand helix, and the helix formed in the spring\nmember 906 is a left-hand helix. As a result, when the first 25\nengagement surface 922 engages the stop feature 1306, the\ndiameter of the spring member 906 will increase.\nTheball screw stop 120 described herein allows one orboth\nof the motors 102 to drive the ball nut 104 into the ball screw\nstop 120 so that a relationship between the motor current and 30\nthe known reaction force supplied from the spring member\n906 can be determined. In particular, and as depicted in flowchart form in FIG. 17, current is supplied to the motor 102 so\nthat the stop member 904 is engaged and displaced the predetermined distance (1702). As a result, the spring member 35\n906 will supply a reaction force. By measuring the motor\ncurrent while the stop member 904 is engaged (1704), the\nrelationship between motor current and reaction force can be\ndetermined (1706). This indicates to the non-illustrated\nactuator controller that the ball screw 106 is in the extend 40\nposition, and sets the resolver(s) 103 to that point. Thus, the\ncontroller now knows actuator position. With the motor current relationship having been determined, the controller, on a\nsubsequent powerup, can establish the full extend position by\ndriving the actuator to the extend position until a predeter- 45\nmined current level is achieved. The controller may then\ncount resolver rotations to determine absolute position.\nIn this document, relational terms such as first and second,\nand the like may be used solely to distinguish one entity or\naction from another entity or action without necessarily so\nrequiring or implying any actual such relationship or order\nbetween such entities or actions. Numerical ordinals such as\n"first," "second," "third," etc. simply denote different singles\nof a plurality and do not imply any order or sequence unless\nspecifically defined by the claim language. The sequence of ss\nthe text in any of the claims does not imply that process steps\nmust be performed in a temporal or logical order according to\nsuch sequence unless it is specifically defined by the language\nof the claim. The process steps may be interchanged in any\norder without departing from the scope of the invention as 60\nlong as such an interchange does not contradict the claim\nlanguage and is not logically nonsensical.\nFurthermore, depending on the context, words such as\n"connect" or "coupled to" used in describing a relationship\nbetween different elements do not imply that a direct physical 65\nconnection must be made between these elements. For\n\n6\nexample, two elements maybe connected to each other physically, electronically, logically, or in any other manner,\nthrough one or more additional elements.\nWhile at least one exemplary embodiment has been presented in the foregoing detailed description of the invention,\nit should be appreciated that a vast number of variations exist.\nIt should also be appreciated that the exemplary embodiment\nor exemplary embodiments are only examples, and are not\nintended to limit the scope, applicability, or configuration of\nthe invention in any way. Rather, the foregoing detailed\ndescription will provide those skilled in the art with a convenient road map for implementing an exemplary embodiment\nof the invention. It being understood that various changes\nmay be made in the function and arrangement of elements\ndescribed in an exemplary embodiment without departing\nfrom the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended\nclaims.\nWhat is claimed is:\n1.
