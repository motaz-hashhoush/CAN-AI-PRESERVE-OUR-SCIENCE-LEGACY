In this\ntime the program has made significant\nprogress. We\nhave defined a Space Station functional requirements\nenvelope as a goal for the capabilities the Station must\nprovide for users. We have initiated a major effort in\nSpace\nStation\ntechnology\ndevelopment.\nWe have\nbegun a competitive Phase B definition and preliminary\ndesign study with eight teams now under contract. We\nhave listened to a variety of advisory panels, such as\nthe Task Force on Scientific\nUses of the Space\nStation chaired by Peter Banks. We have begun the\ndevelopment\nof an operations\nconcept, and directed\nour attention to the analysis of operational\ncosts. In\naddition, we have signed Memoranda of Understanding\nwith Canada, the European\nSpace Agency, and with\nJapan,\nthat provide\na framework\nfor cooperation\nduring Phase B. So the program is well underway and\nwe anticipate continued progress in the months ahead.\nThe Space Station will be a versatile system serving\na diverse\nrange of functions.\nNASA anticipates\nthe\npermanently\nmanned Space Station to be:\na national laboratory\nin space, for the conduct\nof science as well as the development\nof new\ntechnologies\nand related commercial\nproducts;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 a permanent observatory, to look down upon the\nearth and out into the universe;\na servicing\nfacility where payloads and spacecraft are resupplied, maintained,\nupgraded and,\nif necessary,\nrepaired;\na transportation\nnode where\npayloads\nand\nvehicles are stationed, processed and propelled\nto their destinations;\n\nand Robert\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 a manufacturing\nfacility where human resourcefulness\nand the servicing\ncapability\nof the\nStation\ncombine\nto enhance\ncommercial\nopportunities\n\nin space;\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 a storage depot where payloads and parts are\nkept on orbit for subsequent\ndeployment;\nand,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 a staging\nThe Space\n\nbase for future\n\nStation\n\nendeavors\n\nin space.\n\nwill also be:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 a striking\nexample\ncapabilities;\nand,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 a highly visible\nU.S. leadership.\n\nof Free\n\nyet peaceful\n\nWorld\n\nunity\n\nand\n\ndemonstration\n\nof\n\nThe Space Station will be a highly capable,\nmultipurpose\nsystem.\nIt will enable us to meet a wide\nrange of NASA mission requirements,\nas well as the\nmission requirements of other Federal agencies, private\norganizations\nand foreign governments.\nThe Space\nStation\nitself will consist\nof several\nelements.\nThere will be a manned base, where the\ncrew----initially\nsix to eight people----will\nlive and\nwork. There will also be a number of unmanned\nplatforms suitable for scientific\nor commercial\nactivities.\nOne or more ot these platforms may be co-orbiting with\nthe manned base.

In comparison to the "power tower" this configuration\noffers a number of advantages. The laboratory and habitat\nmodules have been moved closerto the center of gravity, more\nspace is provided for attached payloads and greater structural\nstiffness is realized.\n\nStation\n\nThe Space Station will utilize the capabilities\nof the\nSpace Shuttle in several ways.

The Space Station is also\ndifferent\nbecause it is evolutionary\nin character.\nThe\ninitial baseline\nSpace Station will have built-in the\npotential for phased, evolutionary\ndevelopment\nto meet\nfuture requirements.\nThis evolutionary\ncharacter and the permanent nature\nof the Space\nStation\nmake the undertaking\ntruly\nunique. They place a new and difficult\nengineering\nchallenge\nupon NASA and her industrial partners.

Indeed, a system\nsuch as Shuttle underlies the very concept of a Space\nStation, a permanent facility that is predicated upon the\nexistence\nof an efficient,\nman-rated\ntransportation\nsystem.\n\nDelivery\nvarious\nIncluded\nmanned\nStation\nfor the\nStation\n\n- the Space Shuttle will carry aloft the\nSpace Station elements and structure.\nin this will be the components\nfor the\nbase as well as the unmanned\nSpace\nplatforms. The Shuttle will also be used\nassembly\nand checkout\nof the Space\nsystem.\n\nUsers - the Space Station scientific, commercial,\nand technological\nuser communities\nwill employ\nthe Space Shuttle to transport their instruments\nto and from the Station. Materials made in space\naboard the Station will be returned\nto earth\naboard\nthe Shuttle.\nThe\nShuttle\nwill also\ntransport the scientists\nand engineers\nfrom the\nuser communities\nwho will work with their equipment aboard the Station as crew members.\nLogistics\n- supplies\nfor the crew and the\nStation will be brought up by the Space Shuttle.\nFood, fuel, and various items of equipment\nwill\nbe required in substantial quantity. We anticipate\nperiodic logistics flights to the Space Station in\norder to maintain its ongoing operations. We also\nanticipate the availability of an orbiter to respond\n\nORIGINAL\nBLACK AdD.._LHI_E\n\nto a Space Station\nemergency.\nThis can be\naccomplished,\nwe believe, without tying up an\norbiter for this express purpose.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Evolutionary\nStation - the Space Station will be\ndesigned to evolve in capability over time. Space\nShuttle\nflights will be required to launch and\nassemble\nadditional\nmodules,\nstructure,\nand\nequipment\n\nas the Station\n\nevolves.\n\nWe want to emphasize\nthat our estimates\nfor the\nnumber of Shuttle-equivalent\nflights in these categories\nfor the Space Station are very preliminary\nin nature.\nWe have only just begun our definition and preliminary\ndesign activities and our understanding\nof operational\nand user requirements\nis not yet mature.

While it is clear that the Space Station\nProgram\nwill place launch\nrequirements\nupon the\nSpace Shuttle, the exact number and timing of these\nrequirements\nare far from certain at this time.

The Space Station represents a new capability in space. It is an outpost in orbit around\nthe earth for the conduct of science, for the support of commercial enterprises, and for the development of new technologies. As a\npermanent facility, ff represents an extension of mankind\'s ability to create, to produce, and to learn more of our world and ffs\nsurroundings. Like any outpost, it will need to be supplied. As the Europeanssustained their New Worldoutposts during the 17thCentury\nand as we Americans transported men and materials ever westward to outposts beyond the Appalachians, then across the Missouri\nand eventually to the shores of the Pacific Ocean, we will supply our outpost in space. Over time many trips will be required and the\ncosts will not be insignificant. But costs and transportation werepart andparcel of America\'s transcontinental expansionand of Europe\'s\nNew World colonies.
