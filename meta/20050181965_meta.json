Although the company built an antenna that they believed would meet the auto manufacturer's specifications, they were unable to conduct the necessary validation tests in-house. They decided to work with NASA Lewis Research Center's Space Electronics Division, which, as part of its technology development program, evaluates the performance of antennas in its Microwave Systems Lab to assess their capabilities for space communications applications. Data measured in Lewis' Microwave Systems Lab proved that Sterling's antenna performed better than specified by the auto manufacturer.", "title": "Electronics Manufacturer Provided With Testing and Evaluation Data Necessary to Obtain Additional Orders", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-23T00:18:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20050181965, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20050181965, "id": "676f39da8aef409db812442bfcef9694", "publicationName": "Research and Technology 1997", "publicationDate": "1998-04-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
