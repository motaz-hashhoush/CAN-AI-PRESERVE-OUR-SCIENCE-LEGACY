The study of the properties of the conducting mesh material is discussed. To calculate the radiation patterns of antennas with conducting mesh reflectors, the electromagnetic properties of the mesh material must be integrated into an appropriate reflector antenna computer code. Such a code would take into account such factors as the curvature of the reflector surface, the radiation pattern(s) of the feed(s), etc. Many organizations have developed their own codes for these calculations. An excellent example of such a code is the one developed by Rahmat-Samii and Lee.", "title": "Mesh surfaces for reflector applications", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T15:10:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19900009952, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Kauffman, Frank"}, "organization": {"name": "North Carolina State Univ.", "location": "Raleigh, NC, United States"}}, "id": "f55c8c6504d047859e5c4a4042651722"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19900009952, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19900009952, "id": "e0490bc800d749caa0c137d17e6ed619", "publicationName": "NASA, Langley Research Center, Earth Science Geostationary Platform Technology", "publicationDate": "1989-07-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19900009952.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19900009952/downloads/19900009952.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19900009952/downloads/19900009952.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19900009952/downloads/19900009952.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
