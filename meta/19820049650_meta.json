Equilibrium fibril paths in static and moving atmospheres are considered. The provided examples are related to horizontal flows in an atmosphere in which the two anchor points of the arched fibril lie along the flow direction relative to each other. A brief introduction to the subject of the motion of horizontal fibrils in convective rolls is also presented, taking into account some implications for the sun. The equations of motion for a slender, buoyant flux tube extending horizontally along a closed convective roll are solved to illustrate the motion of the flux tube relative to the fluid, and attention is given to theoretical possibilities for the escape of flux tubes from a large horizontal convective roll in the sun.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19820049650, "id": "0a59597b3b1440159ee94ba8c6172f02", "publicationName": "Astrophysical Journal", "publicationDate": "1982-05-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
