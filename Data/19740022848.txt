When the need for\nsuch wrenches is remote from the tool supply and the\nexact size required is not known, a large number of\nwrenches may have to be carried to the worksite. A\nmodified version of the box-end wrench has been\ndeveloped which provides greater flexibility and\nconvenience. One wrench and a set of varying-sized\ninserts are all that need to be carried to the working\narea.\nFigure 1 shows the separate parts, and Figure 2\nshows a composite working-tool assembly. The exterior portions of the steel insert is fabricated to\nfit freely into the wrench opening and has an\nflange diameter large enough to stop on the\nexterior surface of the wrench. The interior of the\ninsert has the wrenching configuration of a corresponding box-end wrench. The wrench and insert\nshown in the illustrations have twelve-point engagements. Four-, six-, and eight-point arrangements can\n\nBase Wrench\n\nTypical Insert\n\nTypical nseexternal\nFigure 1\n\nComposite Tool Assembly\n\nalso be used.\n\nRetention of the insert to the base wrench is made\nby a snap ring engaging a circular groove of the insert.\n\nRemoval of the insert from the base wrench is made\nby pushing on the unflanged end of the insert.\nSource: L.

Tap\nwrenches have handles that are used to apply the\nrotational force necessary to tap the hole. If the\niiUanie caliioI be rotateu, because of restrictions,\ntapping cannot be accomplished. To overcome this\ndifficulty, several techniques have been developed.\nThe figure illustrates a modification of the tap\nwrench which increases the capacity of the tool. A\nsquare hole is machined into the head of the tap\nwrench so that it can be driven by standard socket\nwrenches and appropriate extension bars. The size of\nthe hole must correspond to a socket drive that has\n\nthe needed torque capability, i.e., 0.635-cm (1/4in.), 0.95-cm (3/8-in.), 1.27-cm (1/2-in.), etc.\nIt should be noted that this improvement can be\nused for hand reamers, easy outs, and similar tools\nthat must be rotated to accomplish their intended\nfunctions.\nSource: E.

The insert installation process entails drilling an oversized hole,installing the insert, and securing\nit with epoxy resin. For various reasons, the inserts\nare often tilted and not flush with the faceplate of\nthe honeycomb structure. Mounting equipment to\ninserts that are tilted presents two problems: (1) the\nmounted components are stressed, due to the nonplaner mounting surface,which could result in damage\nto the components, and (2) the components mounted\nto the inserts do not contact the faceplate of the\nhoneycomb structure, preventing good electrical\ncontact.\nPreviously, electrical contact was made either by\nproviding ground straps or by using a pneumatic tool\nwith a cutter. The second method made the inserts\nflush, but it was unsatisfactory because there was no\nprovision for locating or holding the tool parallel to\nthe honeycomb faceplate, and there was no means\nfor applying a constant load on the tool, resulting in\ntool chatter. In general, flushing inserts with a\n\npneumatic tool was "trial and error," the resulting\nsurface was rough, and it varied considerably from\ninsert to insert.\nA better method, utilizing a newly devised hand\ntool (see figure), provides a smooth mounting surface\nthat is parallel to the honeycomb faceplate and\nprovides consistency from insert to insert. The tool\nis secured to the insert, thus accurately locating the\ncutting tool in reference to the insert. The bearing\nsurface on the tool contacts the honeycomb faceplate, which defines the plane of the finished insert. A\nconstant force is applied on the tool by a spring,\nthus alleviating chatter. The cutters of the hand tool\nare adjusted so that the insert is flush to the faceplate of the honeycomb, or they may be adjusted\nfor undercutting.\nSource: W. J. Abernathy and L. G.

Prior to the development of this\ntool, wire harness pins could not be removed from\nthe jig board in confined areas without damaging the\npins. The pin-nail puller reduces manufacturing\ncosts by making it unnecessary to replace damaged\npins.\nThe pin-nail puller consists of a combination of\ntwo standard tools: a standard, auto gear "knockout"\nbar and a standard pair of locking pliers. The locking\n\npliers are adjusted to hold the pin securely. They are\nthen clamped to the pin, with the handle and\nknockout bar lined up with the pin. The knockout\nbar is then operated, and the pin is pulled out of the\njig board without bending. Neither the pin nor the\nboard is damaged by this procedure.\nSource: A.

The\ntool provides the pressure necessary to hold a screwdriver blade in the head of the screw that is to be\nremoved. Previously, seized screws usually had to be\ndrilled out.\nThe feature of this tool is the use of a lever and a\nscrewdriver with lever platform to provide a pressure\nplate. The main body of the tool is fabricated from\ncold-rolled steel bar stock. All other items are\nstandard tools.\n\nIn order to remove a seized screw, remove another\nscrew in the local area and attach the tool by using a\nbolt and washer of appropriate length. Insert the\nscrewdriver blade in the screw, apply force, and back\nthe screw out with breakover handle.\nSource: F.

The use of these adapters\n(see figure) permits common machine screws to\nfunction as precision holddowns at a fraction of the\ncost of alternate methods. Any small industry or shop\ncan have the same precision clamping and holddown\n\nability as the largest corporation, by using a single\ntorque handle and economical machine bolts. The\nlarge industries, with high-volume requirements for\ntooling accessories, can effect major savings by the\napplication of "value engineering" techniques to\ntheir tooling designs.\nThe adapter sets are simple low-cost mechanical\ndevices that can be used at any skill level. Their use\nwill prevent unnecessary damage to honeycomb\npanels and other pressure-sensitive components when\nusing clamping devices. Prior methods depended on\nexperience, personal opinion, and the variations of\n"feel", all of which can differ widely among personnel.\nHoneycomb sandwich panels, in particular, are light\nand strong, yet they are easily damaged by excessive\npressure in local areas. Only a one-half "extra" turn\nof the tightening clamp can crush the material.\nSource: R. L.

Previously, a design layout of\nthe individual lens had to be made to calculate the\ndiameter of a standard O-ring to be used and to\nestablish a clearance angle, so that the metallic part of\na positioning tool never made contact with the\ncritical surface of the lens. This was a time-consuming\nprocedure.\nWasher\n\nMolded\nsilicone\n\nThe vacuum lens-holder tool consists of a copper\ntube, flared at one end, with a washer soldered to the\nflared end. The tube-and-washer assembly is positioned away from a spherical blank of slightly smaller\nradius than the prime lens by a removable plug\nplaced in the tube opening. The tube, washer, and\nspherical blank are then held centrally within a\ntubular sleeve (smaller in diameter than the prime\ntube that the tool must enter), which is then filled\nwith silicone rubber. When the molded silicone rubber\nis set, the tool can be used as a lens holder.\nSource: A. A.

Interchangeable plastic\nheads for 3/16-in.(0.48-cm) through 3/8-in.(0.95-cm)\nouter diameter tubing are provided. The tool combination can be used for low-angle, in-place bend\ncorrections during the final assembly fitment of\nfluid system lines.\nPresently available commercial benders for small\ntubing are designed for bench bending up to 180-\n\n11\n\ndegree turns. They are much larger and heavier than\nthe new tool. The new ratchet-positioned bender can\nreach into previously inaccessible areas and make\nmany in-place corrections.\nSource: D. R.

Conventional twist\ndrills, as used for drilling metal and wood, are not\nsatisfactory for drilling plastics if close tolerances\nand a smooth-walled bore are required. When conventional drills are used in plastic, the chips (the\nmaterial removed by the drill) accumulate between\n1/4-Inch Drill\n\nthe body of the drill and the side of the hole, binding\nthe drill and causing additional material to be\nremoved from the wall. The result is a hole with a\nlarger diameter at one end than at the other end and\na rough surface. Also, tool life is fairly short. In\nsome instances, such as drilling plastics to be used\nfor optical purposes, such conditions are very undesirable and detrimental.\n\nThe point of the new drill is essentially identical\nto that of the conventional straight flute drills, but\nthe shank of the drill has a reduced diameter (see\n\nLoad\n\n0.220-Inch\n\nfigure), so that chips are not pressed against the side\n\nof the hole.\nThe drill should be useful in machine shops\nbecause of the higher degree of accuracy obtainable\nand the increased tool life.\nSource: C.

A series of Belleville springs provides predetermined jaw pressure to grip plates up to 0.6-cm\n(0.25-in.) thick or tubes up to 1.27-cm (0.5-in.)\nin diameter.\nPreviously available devices lock positively by\nmeans of a screw adjustment or by wedge action.\nBoth types are undesirable because the jaw pressure\nmust be varied by the operator. The new lock-grip\npliers provide self-locking action, which adjusts to\nvarious thicknesses without requiring a two-handed\nscrew-type operation. By the use of Belleville springs\n\nto form the pivot point, the tension rate of the\nsprings controls the jaw pressure, and the deflection\nof the springs provides automatic compensation for\nvarious openings.\nSource: N.

The roller comprises a series of sharply\npointed star wheels, each independently rotatable\nabout a common axis. Because the star-wheel axle is\nrigidly secured to the handle, force applied on the\nhandle causes the wheel points to be collectively\npressed into the surface to be treated.

The roving tool\ncan be used for winding filament (e.g.,wire, fiberglass,\nteflon) over an object which cannot be rotated.\nSuch a tool may be useful in fabricating containers or\nfor wrapping fragile parcels for shipping. The use of\nthis tool will enable rapid uniform application of the\nfilament.\nThe roving tool consists of two parts: (1) a\nstationary subassembly which clamps onto the workpiece and provides a bearing for the rotating member\nand (2) a rotating subassembly which carries a\nwinding spool. A small gear is attached to the\n\nRotating Member, Carrying\nRoving Spool\n\nstationary member, which engages with a larger gear\nmounted to the rotating part; and is turned by a\nhandle, thereby turning the rotating member. The\ntension of the filament is controlled by adjustable\nfriction buttons.\nSource: I.

Saber Saw and Adapter Fixture.\n\nIn small shops where circular cutters or other\nspecialized machines are not available for cutting\ncircular holes in metal plates of varying thicknesses,\nsabre saws are used. This is accomplished by drawing\na circle of the required size and inserting the sabre\nsaw in a pilot hole and following the contour of the\ncircle. Upon completion, a half-round file is used to\nclean up the circle. Circle cutting guides may be\npurchased from manufacturers for some sabre saw\n\nmodels; however, these are usually flimsy and more\nsuitable for cutting holes in wood rather than in\nmetal. The suggested circle cutting adapter (see\nfigures) is rigid and may be fabricated easily to fit\nany sabre saw and used to cut precisely circular holes\nrapidly and accurately in relatively thick metal plates.\nThe circle cutting adapter shown in the photographs was fabricated from 1/8-in. (3.2-mm) thick\naluminum sheet. The two sides of the base were bent\n\nFigure 2. Saber Saw Mounted to Adapter Fixture.\n\nTOOLS FOR MATERIAL FINISHING\n\nup to fit the sabre saw. A slot was cut in the base to\naccommodate the saw blade, and a clamping device\nwas attached for locking the sabre saw in place. Two\nmetal 1/4-in. (6.4-mm) diameter guide bars were\nthreaded and secured to the base with spacers and\nnuts. A structural aluminum angle, 1 x 1 x 1/8-in.\n(25.4 x 25.4 x 3.2 mm) thick and 6-in. (152 mm)\nlong was clearance drilled to fit the guide bars,\nand a 1/4-in. (6.4-mm) diameter guide hole was\ndrilled in the structural angle. To cut a circular\nhole, a 1/4-in. (6.4-mm) diameter pilot center hole\nand a starting hole are drilled in the plate to be\nsawed. The angle is attached to the plate with a nut\nand bolt and secured over the guide bars with lock\n\n19\n\nnuts to form the desired radius. The sabre saw is\nsecured in the base, and the circular hole is cut.\nDetailed dimensions are not shown since the adapter\ncan be fabricated to fit a specifically shaped sabre\nsaw. For cutting holes with larger radii, longer guide\nbars may be used.\nSource: D. C. Hopkins and R. M.

After positioning, the tool is rotated manually\nto gradually reduce the diameter of the duct to a preselected dimension. A resulting restriction is accurate\nto within \xc2\xb1 0.13 mm (\xc2\xb1 0.005 in.) of the preselected diameter. The compact size of this tool\nmakes it ideal for use in confined areas.\nThe tool consists of two interlocking jaws pivoting\nabout a pin near the outer surface. Diametrically\nopposite, they are interlocked by a capscrew which\nprovides a means of compressing the jaws. The upper\njaw houses a machined roller which forms the actual\ncrimp. It is free-rolling, suspended longitudinally\nwithin the upper jaw on a pin. Two rollers are housed\nwithin the lower jaw: one a flat roller and the other a\nbeveled roller. These assist the forming roller in\ngradually deforming the material. They, too, are freerolling and suspended in the identical manner as the\nforming roller.\nPeck, F. A. Miller, and\nSource: D.

The replacement of panel access\nscrews that have been burred by repeated use, during\nfinal assembly and test operations, can be eliminated.\nThe previous method was to remove and replace a\nburred mounting screw on panels or other assemblies,\nHundreds of screws are required to complete installations of panel assemblies. This tool will remove\nburrs that are on the heads of the screws, eliminating\nthe need to remove and replace the screws having\ncosmetic defects. This process reduces the time lost in\nremoving and replacing the superficially damaged\nscrews and it has the following additional advantages:\n\n(1) elimination of the cost of screw replacements, and\n(2) reduction of the overall impact on production\nschedules.\nThe tool shank is fabricated of CRES 303 steel.\nThe tip or working end is a diamond-resinoid\nand vitrified-bond abrasive wheel. This cutting and\npolishing end is shaped to the radius of the screw\nhead.\nSource: T. A. Tome and C. E.

Adapters\n\nSimple shop techniques have been developed to\nmake low-cost sets of miniature sanding disc tools,\nfor use in removing anodizing (or polishing) on\nareas around existing holes. The tools (see figures)\nconsist of special adapters, backing elements, and\ndouble-faced adhesive tape that are used with standard\ncounterbore pilots. They are primarily intended for\nuse with a drill motor, but a hand adapter is\nincluded.\nPiloted, miniature abrasive disc tools can be used\nin most any industry, for cleaning, polishing, and\ndeburring in counterbores or other special areas. In\nmany cases, it is desired to remove paint or anodizing\nor to improve surface finish in the area around an\nexisting hole in a part. Such an operation has been\nrequired to remove anodizing to insure a good\nelectrical grounding connection.\n\nPilot-Hole Punch\nFigure 2\n\nThe four adapter models shown (in Figure 1)\ninclude the threaded shank type, for angle motors in\nclose areas and the hand model, for use when power\ntools are not available or desired. The sanding discs\nare cut from emery paper with double-faced tape\napplied to the back side. The first-step arc punch\nand the pilot-hole punch, with centering template\nwasher (Figure 2). are available in many sizes.\nSource: R. L.

This tool was\nmodified from a commercial punch. A hardened steel\nplate was fixed in place and used as a die. A new shaft\nwas manufactured, and a new 1-in. (2.54-cm) diameter punch was affixed by capscrews. A brass stripper\nplate was attached so that it would not interfere with\noperation. A spring-loaded plunger was installed in\nthe die so that the sample would remain in the tool,\nuntil the operator had taken the sample and removed\nboth tool and sample from the moving material.\n\nPreviously, the only samples that could be taken\nwere cut in a V from the outside edge, and the\namount of material acquired was not of the same\narea. This present method enables the operator to\npunch a known area from any portion of the plaque.\nThe quality and tolerances of plaque may be determined immediately, instead of waiting until the run\nhas been completed.\nSource: B.

The vials\nare loaded and unloaded one at a time. This is a timeconsuming procedure which presents chances of error,\nA multiple-scissor, vial-handling device (see figure)\nmakes it possible to load or unload up to ten vials\nsimultaneously, thus saving time and reducing the\nchance of an error. The tool is a stainless scissor\nclamp with a strip of silicone rubber cushioning and\na series of ten half circles bonded to both sides of\n\nthe clamps. The vials are placed in the numbered (1\nthrough 10) plastic vial holders. Then the vials are\npicked up by the multiple-scissor instrument and\neither loaded or unloaded in groups of ten, in proper\nsequence.\nSource: M. E. Colbum and B.
