Subsequently, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) established the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD) to develop a constellation of new capabilities, supporting technologies, and foundational research that allows for the sustained and affordable exploration of space. Then, ESMD specified the primary mission for the Constellation Program to carry out a series of human expeditions, ranging from Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to the surface of Moon, Mars, and beyond for the purposes of conducting human exploration of space. Thus, the Constellation Program was established at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center (JSC) to manage the development of the flight and ground infrastructure and systems that can enable continued and extended human access to space. Constellation Program's \"Design Objectives\" call for an early attention to the program's life cycle costs management through the Program's Need, Goals, and Objectives (NGO) document, which provides the vision, scope, and key areas of focus for the Program. One general policy of the Constellation Program, found in the Constellation Architecture Requirements Document (CARD), states: \"A sustainable program hinges on how effectively total life cycle costs are managed. Developmental costs are a key consideration, but total life cycle costs related to the production, processing, and operation of the entire architecture must be accounted for in design decisions sufficiently to ensure future resources are available for ever more ambitious missions into the solar system....It is the intent of the Constellation Program to aggressively manage this aspect of the program using the design policies and simplicity.\" To respond to the Program's strong desire to manage the program life cycle costs, special efforts were established to identify operability requirements to influence flight vehicle and ground infrastructure design in order to impact the life cycle operations costs, and stretch goal requirements were introduced to the Program. This paper will describe how these stretch goal requirements were identified, developed, refined, matured, approved, and infused into the CARD. The paper will also document several challenges encountered when infusing the stretch goal requirements into the Constellation Program.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "Germany", "submissionId": 20150014722, "endDate": "2008-05-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "European Space Agency", "location": "Toulouse, France"}}, "meetingId": "21e2ac49fc2b48fb972849bda6fa7da2", "id": "19cbc9abdf564fbeb12022b067f14bd0"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites", "location": "Darmstadt, Germany"}}, "meetingId": "21e2ac49fc2b48fb972849bda6fa7da2", "id": "6eee916be2b94a3793904ed7afe01288"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "Reston, VA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "21e2ac49fc2b48fb972849bda6fa7da2", "id": "e624ecb89fad4c6496a47dc891d1cbaa"}], "name": "SpaceOps 2008", "location": "Heidelberg", "id": "21e2ac49fc2b48fb972849bda6fa7da2", "startDate": "2008-05-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20150014722, "id": "19cbb192315147e9a3935cd4c92e2831", "publicationDate": "2008-05-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
