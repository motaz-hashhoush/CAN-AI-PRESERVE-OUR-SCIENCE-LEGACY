This includes integrating and enhancing existing services such as access to telemetry, payload commanding, payload planning and internet voice distribution as well as the addition of services such as video conferencing, collaborative design, modeling or visualization, text messaging, application sharing, and access to existing compute or data grids. Grid technology addresses some of the greatest challenges and opportunities presented by the current trends in technology, i.e. how to take advantage of ever increasing bandwidth, how to manage virtual organizations and how to deal with the increasing threats to information technology security. We will discuss the pros and cons of using grid technology in space-based operations and share current plans for the prototype. It is hoped that early on the prototype can incorporate many of the existing as well as future services that are discussed in the first paragraph above to cooperating International Space Station Principle Investigators both nationally and internationally.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20030068235, "endDate": "2003-08-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "Mission Systems 2003: Control Center Technologies in the Third International Conference for Tech Operations", "location": "Houston, TX", "id": "d4b5a8d9d0bb439eaba47efddb4e065d", "startDate": "2003-08-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20030068235, "id": "3678ff1e8f054baa944b11826142f130", "publicationDate": "2003-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
