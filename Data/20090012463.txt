INTRODUCTION\nThe Constellation architecture that is being developed by\nNASA for crewed human lunar missions involves two\nindependent launches from the Earth with a rendezvous in\nlow Earth orbit (LEO). The Ares I vehicle launches the\nOrion crew vehicle into LEO, and the Ares V launches the\nEarth Departure Stage (EDS) and the Altair lunar lander\ninto orbit. The Orion vehicle and the EDS-Altair stack\nrendezvous in LEO before performing a Trans-Lunar\nInjection (TLI) burn. This launch architecture is referred to\nas a \xe2\x80\x9c1\xc2\xbd-launch\xe2\x80\x9d solution because of the relative size of the\nAres I to the Ares V.\n\nThe options that were evaluated are depicted as a trade tree\nin Figure 1. Two options were considered for launch order:\nlaunching Ares I first, followed by Ares V, identified as \xe2\x80\x9cIV\xe2\x80\x9d; and launching Ares V first, followed by Ares I,\nidentified as \xe2\x80\x9cV-I\xe2\x80\x9d. In addition, two types of LEO loiter\nduration were considered. The first loiter option was to\nsupport only a single TLI window. The second loiter option\nwas to support multiple TLI windows. Because of the\nlimited loiter duration of the Orion crew module in LEO,\nthe option to support multiple TLI windows is applicable\nonly to a V-I launch order. Finally, options for the planned\nseparation between the two launches of 90-minutes and 24hours were evaluated. The baseline established after the\nExploration System Architecture Study (ESAS) of a V-I\nlaunch order, a loiter duration that supports multiple TLI\nwindows, and a launch separation of 24-hours is identified\nin Figure 1.\n\nThe 1\xc2\xbd-launch solution imposes additional constraints on\nhuman lunar missions over a single launch scenario. The\nprimary constraint involves the requirement for a LEO\nrendezvous between the two vehicles and the lifetimes of\nthe elements in LEO. The Orion has a capability to loiter in\nLEO for a maximum of four days, limited by consumables.\nThe EDS will have a maximum LEO loiter duration that is\nset by the amount of excess liquid oxygen and liquid\nhydrogen propellant that is available to account for the boiloff that occurs during LEO loiter. These maximum loiter\ndurations for the Orion and EDS require that the two\nlaunches will have to occur within some discrete time\nperiod in order to support rendezvous and a successful lunar\nmission.\n\nThe selection of a point-of-departure does not represent the\nfinal determination of a launch option for the Constellation\narchitecture. Rather, the point-of-departure represents a\nbaseline from which on going lunar mission studies will be\nconducted. The baseline architecture may be changed in the\nfuture as further studies or revised data warrant.\n\nThree factors will have a major impact on the probability of\nsuccess of conducting both launches in the available time\nperiod: the order that the vehicles are launched in, the\nmaximum LEO loiter duration of the Orion and the EDS,\nand the separation time between the two launches.\n\n2. BACKGROUND\nThe basic Constellation transportation architecture was\ninitially defined as part of the ESAS [1] and in efforts\nimmediately following that study [2]. As part of the baseline\noption developed at that time, it was assumed that the Ares\n\nNASA completed a study to address the operational issues\nsurrounding the 1\xc2\xbd-launch solution and to compare various\noptions for launch operations. The ultimate goal was to\n\n2\n\nV heavy launch vehicle would launch first, with a capability\nto loiter for up to 95 days in LEO. The Ares I and Orion\nwould then nominally launch 24 hours later and rendezvous\nwith the EDS and lunar lander. If the Ares I failed to launch\n24 hours later, multiple relaunches could be attempted over\nthe remainder of the 95-day loiter period, covering multiple\nTLI opportunities. The 95-day loiter period was selected to\nensure that the crew could launch before the EDS\noperational lifetime expired.\n\ntype of technology may be required to support future\nexploration activities.\nOther issues regarding the operational concept for the 1\xc2\xbdlaunch solution were also raised in the design iterations that\nfollowed ESAS. The time separation between the two\nlaunches was also identified as an important parameter.\nAnalysis showed the probability of no second launch\n(PnSL) increased significantly as the period between\nlaunches increased, whereas a lower PnSL is desirable. This\nincrease is primarily due to the possibility of weather or sea\nstate change to unfavorable conditions in the interim period\nbut is also impacted by possibility of a failure on the second\nvehicle during the separation period. The 24-hour launch\nseparation that was identified as part of the initial\narchitecture could result in a relatively high probability of\nno second launch.\n\nDuring subsequent design iterations of the transportation\nelements, a number of factors were identified that called the\ninitial baseline launch option assumptions into question.\nThe primary issue revolved around the ability of the EDS to\nprovide for a 95-day LEO loiter. As the EDS orbits the\nEarth and is heated by the sun, the cryogenic fuel within the\nEDS tanks boils off at a rate of approximately 40 kg per\nday. In order to reserve a sufficient amount of fuel for the\nlunar mission, either the boil-off gasses must be reliquefied\nand returned to the tanks, or the boil-off must be vented and\nan additional amount of fuel carried to account for lost\npropellant.\n\nThe final issue that was identified concerned the launch\norder of the Ares V and the Ares I and the difference in the\nconsequences of a missed launch between the launch orders.\nFor the baseline option, with the Ares V launching first,\nreferred to as V-I in the analysis, a failure to launch the\nAres I within the LEO duration of the EDS would result in\nthe loss of the EDS and the Altair lander. Each of those\nelements would have to be replaced to re-fly the mission.\nThe Ares V and the Altair are the most expensive elements\nin the transportation system. This type of loss would\nrepresent a large fraction of the total transportation element\ncost. In addition, concerns were voiced that the loss of an\nAres V and Altair could impose substantial delays in\nestablishing a permanently crewed lunar outpost.\n\nHowever, both of these solutions would have severe adverse\nimpacts to the overall transportation architecture. With no\nre-liquefaction, the mass of extra propellant required to\nachieve a 95-day loiter capability would be at least 3,800\nkg. In addition, added mass penalties would be incurred for\nextra tank volume to hold the additional propellant. Because\nthe total launch capability of the Ares V to LEO is limited,\nlaunching additional EDS propellant directly reduces the\neffective cargo at LEO. This, in turn, will limit the total\nlander mass, and the mass delivery capacity to the lunar\nsurface.\n\nAn alternate option, reversing the launch order, with the\ncrewed Ares I launching first and the Ares V launching\nsecond, is referred to as I-V in this analysis. If the Ares V\nwas not launched in time, the crew would be forced to\nreturn directly to Earth. In this case, an Ares I and an Orion\nservice module would have to be replaced, and the Orion\ncrew module would have to be refurbished in order to re-fly\na mission. This type of loss would carry significantly less\nreplacement cost than in the V-I option.\n\nIn addition, long loiter periods would result in a substantial\nincrease in the complexity and dry mass of the EDS.\nPhotovoltaic arrays would be required for power generation,\nreboost\nwould\nbe\nrequired,\nand\nadditional\nmicrometeoroid/orbital debris (MMOD) protection might be\nneeded. None of the selected Ares V launch vehicle options\ncould support an EDS with a 95-day loiter and a viable\nlunar lander.\n\nThe difference in consequence between the two options\nbrought into question the baseline launch order. Although\nthere is a strong initial reaction that it is most appropriate to\nlaunch the Ares V first so as not to risk the crew until the\nEDS and the lander are safely in orbit, the stark difference\nin consequence for these two options indicated that it might\nbe preferable to reverse the launch order, launching the\ncrew in the Ares I first and then launching the Ares V. In\nthis case, the Ares V/EDS/Altair stack would not be lost if\nthe Ares I could not be launched in time. Of course, in this\ncase, the crew would be exposed to additional risk if the\nmission has to be repeated due to a missed second launch.\n\nReliquefaction of the boil-off would significantly reduce the\nneed to carry additional propellant. However, the\nreliquefaction equipment would add additional mass to the\nEDS, similarly limiting lunar lander performance. Initial\nestimates for a reliquefaction system indicated that the mass\ncould be similar to or greater than that of the additional 95\ndays of propellant. In addition, the technology readiness\nlevel (TRL) of this technology is relatively low, and a major\ndevelopment effort would be required to include such a\nsystem on the EDS. For these reasons, reliquefaction was\nnot investigated as a final solution. However, note that\ndesign reference missions for Constellation-based crewed\nMars missions require a significant number of Ares V\nlaunches over an extended time period. So, ultimately, this\n\nThe study that is described in this paper was intended to\naddress the operational issues surrounding the 1\xc2\xbd-launch\n3\n\nsolution and to compare various options for launch\noperations. The goal of the effort was to develop an updated\nconcept for 1\xc2\xbd-launch operations that would balance the\nPnSL, the consequence of no second launch, and any added\nrisk to the crew. The operational concept would include the\norder of vehicle launch, the planned separation between the\nlaunches, and the loiter periods for the Orion and the EDS.\nOrion loiter periods were limited to four days, as dictated by\nthe current Orion design.\n\nOptions for alternate Ares V loiter capability in the V-I\norder are dependent on the 10-day TLI interval. The lowest\npossible Ares V loiter that would be viable, with a 24-hour\nseparation between launches, would be five days. That\nseparation would provide for four Ares I launch attempts for\na single TLI opportunity. Viable loiter durations would then\nincrease in increments of 10 days, with each increment\nproviding an additional four Ares I launch attempts. If the\nlaunch separation is decreased to 90 minutes, then each of\nthe loiter periods would be deceased by one day, with a 4day minimum and added increments of 10 days.\n\nNote that the updated operational concept for the 1\xc2\xbd-launch\noption that was developed as a result of this effort is used\nonly as a current reference. NASA is still leaving open the\noption to change the operational concept as more data\nbecome available or to develop a system that is capable of\nsupporting multiple operational concepts, including launch\norder.\n\nIn a I-V option, the loiter duration of the Orion limits the\nlaunch attempts. In this option, the Ares I would always\nlaunch four days prior to the TLI opportunity. With a 90minute separation between launches, the Ares V would\nattempt to launch on the next orbit. If that launch did not\noccur, then the Ares V could attempt to launch on additional\nthree opportunities at 24-hour intervals prior to the TLI\nopportunity, for a total of four possible attempts. If the\nlaunch separation was 24 hours, then three possible launch\nattempts would occur for the Ares V. In either case, if the\nAres V could not launch by the TLI opportunity, then the\ncrew would have to return to Earth. Utilizing more than a\nsingle TLI opportunity is not possible in the I-V option. The\nspacing of launch opportunities for the I-V launch order\nwith 90-minute and 24-hour separation is further described\nin Figures 4 and 5, respectively.\n\n3. LAUNCH OPPORTUNITIES AND TLI WINDOWS\nThe baseline separation between the launch of the two\nvehicles was originally set at 24 hours. This separation\nallows the second vehicle to launch as the first passes over\non the same approximate launch orbit one day later. Other\nlaunch options include a 90-minute separation, where the\nsecond vehicle would launch to meet the first after it has\ncompleted its first orbit, and any increment of 24 hours. For\nthe purposes of this effort, only planned launch separations\nof 24 hours and 90 minutes were investigated. Separations\nof greater than 24 hours would only compound issues\nregarding weather and sea state change.\n\nA loiter period of less than four days is also possible for\neither launch order. As part of this analysis, for the V-I\nlaunch order, EDS loiter periods of 1-4, 14, and 24 days\nwere considered for the 90-minute launch separation, and 25, 15, and 25 days were considered for the 24-hour\nseparation. For the I-V launch order, a 4-day loiter was used\nfor Orion, which corresponds to a 4-day EDS loiter at 90minutes separation and a 3-day EDS loiter at 24-hours\nseparation. Table 1 details the full set of launch variables\nthat were investigated as part of this study.\n\nThe options available for the two-launch operational\nconcept are limited by the timing of opportunities for TLI.\nThe TLI opportunities for a particular lunar site occur at\naverage intervals of approximately 9-10 days. The\ncombined EDS/Altair/Orion stack must depart within a\nlimited time window at TLI. The actual intervals vary\nsomewhat from this average based on orbital mechanics.\nHowever a limited number of TLI opportunities occur at\nspacings greater than 10 days.\nThe spacing of TLI opportunities limits the set of loiter\nperiods that would be effective for both the Ares V and the\nOrion. In the baseline V-I option, the Ares V would be\nlaunched five days before a TLI opportunity. The Ares I\nlaunch would then be initially planned for 24 hours later,\nfour days before the TLI opportunity. If that launch failed to\noccur, three more Ares I launch opportunities would occur\nat 24-hour intervals before the TLI opportunity. If the Ares I\nfailed to launch on any of those attempts, additional 4-day\nlaunch opportunities would be available prior to each TLI\nopportunity. These Ares I launch opportunities would be\navailable for the duration of the Ares V loiter capability.\nThe spacing of launch opportunities for the V-I launch\norder with 90-minute and 24-hour separation are further\ndescribed in Figures 2 and 3, respectively.\n4\n\n5\n\ndelays. These points include management reviews at two\ndays prior to launch and one day prior to launch, at a\ndecision point on whether or not to commit to loading the\ncryogenic propellants, at the propellant loading phase, at\npost-propellant loading operations including crew insertion,\nat the final management decision to commit to launch, and\nat terminal countdown operations.\n\nTable 1. 1\xc2\xbd-Launch Options\nLaunch\nOrder\n\nLaunch\nSeparation\n\n24-Hour\n\nV-I\n\n90-Minute\n\n24-Hour\nI-V\n90-Minute\n\nOrion\nLEO\nLoiter\n\nEDS\nLEO\nLoiter\n\nLaunch\nOpportunities\nfor Second\nVehicle\n\n1 Day\n2 Days\n3 Days\n4 Days\n4 Days\n4 Days\n1 Day\n2 Days\n3 Days\n4 Days\n4 Days\n4 Days\n2 Days\n3 Days\n4 Days\n1 Day\n2 Days\n3 Days\n4 Days\n\n2 Days\n3 Days\n4 Days\n5 Days\n15 Days\n25 Days\n1 Day\n2 Days\n3 Days\n4 Days\n14 Days\n24 Days\n1 Day\n2 Days\n3 Days\n1 Day\n2 Days\n3 Days\n4 Days\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n8\n12\n1\n2\n3\n4\n8\n12\n1\n2\n3\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\nThe probabilities of a launch delay occurring at these\ndiscrete points was determined after reviewing space shuttle\nand Delta II historical data and then filtering that data based\non the differences between those launch vehicles and the\nConstellation vehicles. Sources of potential delays include\nvehicle malfunctions, weather, and sea state. Subject matter\nexperts provided information that was also considered in\ndeveloping the delay probabilities. The duration of a delay\nis modeled as a probability distribution by using a\ncombination of space shuttle and Delta II historical data.\nSeparate distributions were created to correspond to the type\nof delay. For example, weather delays tend to be one day in\nduration, whereas flight hardware delays tend to be longer.\nTable 2 shows the PnSL values for the V-I launch order\nwith 90-minute and 24-hour separation for 4, 5, 14, and 15\ndays of EDS LEO loiter capacity, respectively. Maximum\nOrion loiter capacity was assumed to be fixed at\napproximately four days.\n\nFor all of the cases that were evaluated as part of this study,\nthe assumption was made that both launch vehicles would\nbe fully prepped and ready to fly on separate launch pads\nbefore the first vehicle would be launched. In addition, the\nassumption was made that the weather and sea state\nforecasts would support the launch of both vehicles. If\neither vehicle suffered a technical problem or if weather or\nsea state forecasts did not support the launch of both\nvehicles, then the entire launch process would be delayed\nuntil a later opportunity.\n\nTable 2.

PREDICTION OF PNSL\n90-Minute\n\nPnSL was determined by using a discrete event simulation\nmodel called Constellation-Requirement Assessment\nSimulation Technique (C-RAST), which was built using\nRockwell Automation\xe2\x80\x99s Arena simulation software. CRAST models the launch countdown for the integrated Ares\nI\xe2\x80\x93Orion vehicle and the integrated Ares V\xe2\x80\x93Altair vehicle.\nC-RAST is an updated version of the ConstellationManifest Assessment Simulation Technique [3].\n\nOrion LEO\nLoiter\n\nEDS LEO\nLoiter\n\nPnSL\n\n1 Day\n2 Days\n3 Days\n4 Days\n4 Days\n4 Days\n1 Day\n2 Days\n3 Days\n4 Days\n4 Days\n4 Days\n\n2 Days\n3 Days\n4 Days\n5 Days\n15 Days\n25 Days\n1 Day\n2 Days\n3 Days\n4 Days\n14 Days\n24 Days\n\n26.9%\n22.9%\n16.9%\n14.1%\n5.5%\n4.0%\n8.7%\n6.8%\n5.9%\n4.7%\n1.9%\n1.2%\n\nSimilarly, Table 3 shows the PnSL data for the I-V launch\norder with 90-minute and 24-hour separation. Due to the 4day loiter limitation of the Orion, cases with greater loiter\nduration for the EDS are not applicable because the Orion is\nplaced in orbit first.\n\nThe C-RAST model begins at the point in time at which\nboth vehicles are ready to begin launch countdown on their\nrespective launch pads. C-RAST progresses through an\napproximate two to three day countdown with the\npossibility of launch delays occurring at discrete points\nalong the countdown. These discrete points were identified\nbased on the points at which launch vehicles such as the\nspace shuttle and the Delta II experience launch countdown\n6\n\nwith the marginal cost only representing the low end and the\nfull cost representing the high end.\n\nTable 3.

Actual\ncost estimates were used in the comparison of options for\nthe decision makers. However, because the primary cost\nissue reflects the relative difference in cost between the\nAres I and the Ares V stacks, the normalization of the cost\ndata does not impact the analysis or the results presented in\nthis paper. All costs were normalized by the cost of an Ares\nI stack, which included the cost of the Ares I crew launch\nvehicle, the Orion service module, the Launch Escape\nSystem, and the refurbishment of the Orion crew module.\nAll costs are, therefore, presented as Ares I stack\nequivalents, or AI. These figures reflect the relative cost of\neach transportation element as compared with the cost of an\nAres I stack. Table 4 details the cost data used for this\nanalysis.\n\n5. VEHICLE AND ELEMENT COSTS\nA major factor that was considered in the analysis of the\n1\xc2\xbd-launch operational concepts is the relative cost of the\ntransportation elements. If a significant disparity exists\nbetween the costs of an Ares I stack and an Ares V stack,\nthen the total risks should be evaluated rather than just\nfocusing on the probability of failure.\n\nTable 4. Replacement Cost Estimates for Transportation\nElements\nElement\nPer Unit Cost\n(Ares I Stack\nEquiv.)\n\nCosts estimates were developed for each of the relevant\ntransportation elements based on data provided from the\nproject offices. For the Ares I, the Ares V, and the Orion\nservice module, the marginal unit costs were used as an\nestimate for the per-unit replacement cost. Because a large\nnumber of these elements will be used over the course of\nthe ISS and lunar programs, these elements were assumed to\nbe assembly-line-type items. If a replacement unit were\nneeded, the next unit off of the line could be used. No\nsignificant added fixed costs were assumed for acquiring an\nadditional unit. For the Ares V, cost estimates were\ndeveloped for two different options. The baseline\narchitecture assumes that the 51.0.48 option [4] is used for\nthe Ares V. This option represents the current baseline Ares\nV configuration for the Constellation Program. However,\nthis option is limited to a 71.1 t capability to LEO. Certain\nlaunch options may require increased Ares V capability,\nwhich would dictate an upgrade to the 51.0.47 option with a\ncapability of 74.7 t to LEO.\n\nAres I \xe2\x80\x93 Marginal Cost\nOrion SM & CM Refurbishment \xe2\x80\x93\nMarginal Cost\n\n0.40 AI\n0.60 AI\n\nAres V (51.0.48) \xe2\x80\x93 Marginal Cost\nAres V (51.0.47) \xe2\x80\x93 Marginal Cost\n\n0.90 AI\n1.13 AI\n\nAltair \xe2\x80\x93 Fixed Cost\nAltair - Marginal Cost\nAltair - Total\n\n1.19 AI\n0.79 AI\n1.98 AI\n\n6. PROBABILITY OF LOSS OF CREW\nThe initial selection of a V-I launch order was predicated on\ntwo factors. The first was the ability to add substantial loiter\ntime to the EDS if the Ares V was launched first. The other\nfactor, which is also potentially significant, is the added risk\nto the crew if the Ares I were to be launched first. In that\noption, the crew would be placed into LEO prior to the\nlaunch attempt of the Ares V. If the Ares V were not able to\nlaunch in the available four-day window, then the crew\nwould have to return to Earth. If the mission were to be reattempted later, then a crew would again have to be placed\nin LEO. This, in effect, exposes a crew to an additional\nlaunch, LEO operations, and entry, descent, and landing\n(EDL).\n\nFor the Orion crew module, the marginal cost of\nrefurbishment was used. Again, no added fixed costs were\nassumed to be necessary to refurbish an additional unit.\nFor the Altair lunar lander, both fixed and marginal costs\nper unit were used for the analysis. Because the number of\nAltair landers is expected to be relatively limited and many\ncomponents may be procured as fixed unit purchases up\nfront, the production of an additional lander may require a\nsubstantial fraction of the fixed costs to be incurred in order\nto resume production. However, the total fraction of the\nfixed costs that would be incurred is unclear. For the\npurposes of comparing the 1\xc2\xbd-launch options, the full fixed\nand marginal costs were used. However, a sensitivity\nanalysis was also completed over a range of Altair costs\n\nFor the V-I launch order, no additional risk to the crew\nwould result from the 1\xc2\xbd-launch operations. However, with\n90-minute separation, other potential risks to the crew for a\n7\n\nUsing the PnSL of 5.4% for the I-V launch order with a 90minute separation and four days of loiter, the added risk to\nthe crew per mission is equal to 0.000164, or 1 in 6,092.\n\nV-I launch order must be considered. In this case, NASA\nhas determined that inserting the Orion crew into the\ncapsule and preparing for launch in the 90-minutes between\nlaunches would be difficult. Therefore, the crew would\nmost likely have to be on the pad, in the capsule, when the\nAres V launches. If an incident were to occur on the pad or\nin the initial stages of launch that resulted in a catastrophic\nloss of the Ares V, then the crew would be in some potential\ndanger. This represents an added crew risk for the V-I\nlaunch order if a 90-minute separation were used. In the 24hour case, the crew would not be exposed to this type of\nrisk.\n\nAdded crew risk for I-V launch order = 0.00253 *\n(0.054 + 0.946 * 0.0115) = 0.000164\n\n(2)\n\nQuantitatively assessing the risks that the crew faces\nbecause the are within the Flight Hazard Area for the V-I\nlaunch order with a 90-minute separation is not currently\npossible. However, based on the opinion of subject-matter\nexperts, this risk is not considered to be insignificant. The\ncrew faces no significant added risk for a V-I launch order\nwith a 24-hour separation because they would not be loaded\ninto the Orion until after the launch of the Ares V.\n\nIn order to accurately compare the risks to the crew due to\nlaunch order between cases, both the added launch risk for\nI-V options and the range safety issues for V-I options need\nto be considered.\n\n7. FIGURES OF MERIT\n\nFor an Ares I flight that is forced to return to Earth with no\nTLI, the total PLOC for the crew is the sum of the risks of\nthe Ares I launch, four days of Orion LEO operations, and\nan EDL from LEO. Based upon the current risk estimates\nfor the Ares I and Orion designs, the PLOC for a LEO\nmission is estimated to be approximately 0.00253 or 1 in\n396. As the designs for the Ares I and the Orion mature and\nrisk is \xe2\x80\x9cbought out\xe2\x80\x9d of the systems, these risk estimates are\nlikely to improve. For reference, the requirement for crew\nrisk for the orbital mission, derived from the Constellation\nArchitecture Requirements Document (CARD) is 0.00036,\nor 1 in 2,793. However, in order to be as conservative as\npossible in relation to crew safety, the current risk value\nwas used. Table 5 details the breakdown of the PLOC for\nboth the current and CARD estimates.\n\nThe goal of the launch order analysis was to evaluate the\nidentified operational concepts and then produce a series of\nrelevant figures of merit (FOM) for each one. The most\nbasic metric that was considered was the probability that\neach concept would result in a failure to launch the second\nvehicle. The FOMs for the study had to cover a number of\nareas that were significant to decision makers on selecting a\nconcept.\nProbability of No Second Launch\nThis metric not only contributes to expected losses but also\nstands alone as an important measurement of success or\nfailure. Because any failure to launch the second flight in a\ntimely manner will result in the loss of a vehicle and would\nforce the flight to be reflown, some adverse public and\npolitical reaction is likely, even if such a loss is anticipated\nby NASA.\n\nTable 5. PLOC Estimates for 4-Day Orion LEO Mission\nPhase\nCurrent\nCARD\nPLOC\nRequirement\nAres I Launch\n0.00077 (1/1300) 0.00011 (1/9168)\nLEO Loiter (4-Days) 0.00071 (1/1400) 0.00010 (1/9873)\nEDL from LEO\n0.00104 (1/960) 0.00015 (1/6770)\nTotal\n0.00253 (1/396) 0.00036 (1/2793)\n\nCost of Failure\nThe primary direct impact on NASA of a failed second\nlaunch would be the cost to replace hardware and attempt to\nrefly the mission. Although other options may ultimately be\npursued by NASA if such an event did occur, such as\ncancelling the mission, the replacement cost remains an\nindicator of the value of the hardware that is lost.\n\nThe added risk to the crew in the I-V option can be\ncalculated as the total Probability of loss of Crew (PLOC)\nfor an orbital mission multiplied by the probability that the\ncrew will be required to refly the flight for a given mission,\nwhich is equal to the probability that the Ares V does not\nlaunch at all (PnSL) plus the probability that the Ares V\nlaunches (Probability of Second Launch (PSL)) but fails to\nreach LEO.\n\nIn this analysis, the metric that was selected is the expected\ncost of replacement hardware. The expected cost is\ncalculated as the product of the PnSL for each option and\nthe cost of the hardware that is lost for that option. This\nvalue is not the actual replacement cost per mission if a\nsecond launch failure did occur. It is a probabilistic\namortization of those costs. These costs would effectively\nbe imposed on every human lunar mission resulting in a\nlarge added cost over the program.\n\nAdded crew risk for I-V launch order = PLOCLEO *\n(PnSL + PSL * PAres V Ascent Failure)\nwhere\n(1)\nPSL = 1 \xe2\x80\x93 PnSL\nPAres V Ascent Failure = 0.0115.\n\nIn the case of the V-I launch order, the cost of lost hardware\nis the sum of the costs for the Ares V booster, the EDS, and\n8\n\nthe Altair lander. In reality, some cost would also be\nincurred to replace lost cargo on the lander. However, for\nthis study these costs were considered to be negligible.\n\nTable 6. Comparison of PnSL for 90-Minute and\n24-Hour Separation Cases\n90-Minute\nPnSL\n24-Hour\nPnSL\nSeparation\nSeparation\nI-V\nI-V\n4-Day Orion\n5.4%\n4-Day Orion\n13.0%\n4-Day EDS\n3-Day EDS\nV-I\nV-I\n4-Day Orion\n4.7%\n4-Day Orion\n14.1%\n4-Day EDS\n5-Day EDS\nV-I\nV-I\n4-Day Orion\n1.9%\n4-Day Orion\n5.5%\n14-Day EDS\n15-Day EDS\n\nFor the I-V launch order, the cost of lost hardware is the\nsum of the costs for replacement of the Ares I and the Orion\nservice module, as well as the cost of refurbishment for the\nOrion command module.\nLoss of Delivery Capability to the Surface\nThis metric captures the negative impacts of increasing the\nloiter period for the Ares V. In the V-I launch order, as the\nloiter period is increased, the total cargo delivery capacity\nof the transportation system to the lunar surface decreases.\nThis penalty, unlike the replacement cost, is not\nprobabilistic but is incurred on every lunar mission.\n\nThe PnSL for the 24-hour cases are significantly worse than\nthose for the respective 90-minute counterparts. A number\nof factors cause the 24-hour PnSL results to be so relatively\npoor. First, the 24-hour separation allows one less launch\nattempt than for the 90-minute case. Second, the 24-hour\nseparation introduces a greater probability that the weather\nor sea state could change and fall outside the limits between\nlaunches. Finally, the increased time between launches\nincreases the probability that a failure will occur in the\nsecond launch vehicle as a result of the longer period for\nsuch a failure to manifest.\n\nAdditional Risk to the Crew\nThe additional risk to the crew for each option was\nconsidered as a primary metric by decision makers. As\ndescribed, the quantitative added risk for the I-V launch\noption was calculated as a metric. For the V-I 90-minute\noption, the added risk was treated qualitatively.\nAdditional Costs or Complexities\nAside from the four basic FOMs described above,\nadditional complexities had to be considered for certain\nlaunch options. The most significant of these complexities\nwas the total launch vehicle capability. In certain cases, the\nadditional EDS propellant load was so great that, with the\nbaseline Ares V option, there would not be enough cargo\ndelivery capacity to LEO to support a viable lunar lander. In\nthese cases, the application of that launch option would\nrequire an upgrade to the capacity of the Ares V. This\nwould lead to a significant increase in both Design,\nDevelopment, Test, and Evaluation (DDT&E) costs and\nproduction costs for every flight.\n\nCertain operational complexities would be incurred for a\n90-minute launch separation, as compared with the baseline\n24-hour separation. Final countdown for both vehicles\nwould overlap and, as described earlier, in a I-V launch\norder, the crew would be in the flight hazard area of the\nAres V. However, NASA has investigated operational\nconcepts for a 90-minute separation and has found no major\nbarriers.\nBased upon this PnSL data, it was determined that the\nadded probability of mission failure for a 24-hour\nseparation for any given launch option was simply too large\nto be tolerated. The added launch complexity and flight\nhazard risk of the 90-minute case did not justify the added\nprobability of mission failure. The political and public\nperception of these types of failures, especially multiple\nsimilar failures, is likely to be poor. In the case of a V-I\nlaunch order, a high-cost asset (2.88\xe2\x80\x933.11 AI) is being lost.\nIn the case of a I-V launch order, the appearance would be\nthat the crew was launched for no reason, in addition to an\nAres I stack loss.\n\n8. SELECTION OF FINAL LAUNCH OPTIONS\nAn initial evaluation of the full set of 1\xc2\xbd-launch options\nwas evaluated across the described FOMs. The goal of this\ninitial analysis was to select a subset of options for final\nanalysis and comparison that would represent the best\nperformance across all of the FOMs.\n90-Minute versus 24-Hour Separation\n\nFor these reasons, the decision was made to not investigate\nfurther the 24-hour separation cases. Therefore, the pointof-departure architecture was changed to a 90-minute\nseparation.\n\nBefore investigating launch order or loiter duration in detail,\nbasic results comparing the PnSL for 90-minute and 24hour launch separation were provided to decision makers.\nTable 6 summarizes the PnSL values for each of these\ncases.\n\nLoiter Duration\nFor each of the 1\xc2\xbd-launch order options, cases were\nevaluated with varying loiter durations in LEO in order to\n9\n\nselect loiter periods that would be optimal for each launch\nsequence.\n\nTable 7.

For the 4-, 14-, and 24day EDS loiter periods, an Orion loiter of 4 days (the design\nmaximum) was used. For the 1-, 2-, and 3-day EDS loiter\ncases, the Orion loiter period would match the EDS loiter,\nalthough no mass changes were made to the Orion design.\nTable 7 shows the PnSL and cost results for each V-I case.\n\ncalculated as part of this study for the added EDS\ncomplexity.\nA 24-day loiter period, which would require an additional\n439 kg of propellant beyond the 14-day case and additional\ntankage mass, was not considered to be a viable option even\nwith the 51.0.47 Ares V. The reduction in PnSL between 14\nand 24 days was relatively small (0.019 and 0.012,\nrespectively) compared with the added mass that would be\nrequired.\n\nIn these results shown in Table 7, the cost of No Second\nLaunch was 2.88 AI for each of the cases up to a 4-day EDS\nloiter. This replacement cost estimate corresponds to the\n51.0.48 Ares V design. For the 14-day loiter case, the\namount of excess propellant that is required for boil-off\nincreases by 395 kg from the 4-day baseline amount. An\nadditional mass increase would also be required to account\nfor the additional required tankage, photovoltaic arrays,\nMMOD protection, and reboost. The 51.0.48 Ares V design\nwould not be viable with that amount of additional mass.\nFor a 14-day loiter period, in order to produce a viable\narchitecture, the Ares V would have to be switched to the\n51.0.47 design option, which includes composite solid\nrocket booster (SRB) casings and hydroxyl-terminated\npolybutadiene (HTPB) SRB propellant. The 51.0.47 has a\ngreater marginal cost than the 51.0.48, which increases the\ncost of No Second Launch from 2.88 to 3.11 AI. In\naddition, there would be added costs that were not\n\nThe 4-day EDS loiter case provides 1000 kg delivery\ncapability to the lunar surface. Reducing the loiter period\nbelow four days would only provide a small marginal\nincrease in surface delivery capability. Because the PnSL\nand the expected vehicle replacement costs grow\nsubstantially worse as the loiter period is reduced below\nfour days, the 1-, 2-, and 3-day loiter periods were\ndetermined to be suboptimal. For the V-I launch order, the\n4-day EDS loiter with the 51.0.48 Ares V and the 14-day\nEDS loiter with the 51.0.47 Ares V were selected as\ncandidate cases for final comparison.\nFor the I-V launch order, the EDS and Orion loiter periods\nof one, two, three, and four days were considered. Again,\nthe Orion mass was not varied for shorter LEO durations.\n10\n\nTable 8 shows the PnSL, cost, and PLOC data for each of\nthese options.\n\nI-V 4-Day\nLoiter\nV-I 4-Day\nLoiter\nV-I 14Day Loiter\n\nAs can be seen from the data in Table 8, both the PnSL and\nthe expected vehicle replacement cost increase rapidly as\nthe loiter period decreases below 4 days. In addition,\nbecause the PnSL increases, the added PLOC also increases\nsubstantially as the loiter duration is shortened. As with the\nV-I case, the reduction in loiter mass that can be achieved\nby shortening the loiter period below 4 days is relatively\nsmall. For the I-V launch order, loiter periods for the EDS\nand Orion of less than 4 days were considered to be suboptimal. Only the four-day loiter period was considered for\nthe I-V launch order in the final comparison of cases.\n\n5.4%\n\n1.00 AI\n\n0.05 AI\n\n4.7%\n\n2.88 AI\n\n0.14 AI\n\n1.9%\n\n3.11+ AI\n\n0.06 AI\n\nAdded Probability of Loss of Crew\nIt is not possible to quantitatively compare the added\nprobability of loss of crew as a result of the 1\xc2\xbd-launch\noperations between the I-V and V-I launch orders. While\nthe PLOC that is added due the possibility of reflying a\nmission can be determined for the I-V order, it is not\npossible at this time to determine the added PLOC for the\ncrew in the Ares V flight hazard area in the V-I order.\nHowever, the cases can be compared subjectively, to\ndetermine if added PLOC supports the selection of one\noption over another. Table 11 summarizes the added PLOC\nfor each case.\n\n9. COMPARISON OF LAUNCH OPTIONS\nBased on the results that are described earlier, three cases\nwere evaluated and compared in the final definition of a\n1\xc2\xbd-launch point operational concept. Table 9 describes the\nthree cases.\n\nTable 11.

The option(s) that maximized performance for each\nFOM were identified. Finally, the results were subjectively\ncompared across all of the FOMs.\n\nOther Considerations\nAside from the primary metrics described above, several\nother issues were taken into consideration for these cases.\nTable 12 summarizes these issues for each option.\n\nPnSL and Cost of Failure\nThe primary consideration was the additional requirements\nthat are imposed by a 14-day loiter. In order to support a 14day loiter, the EDS is essentially transformed from a stage\nto an independent vehicle. This transformation would\nrequire significant added mass for increased MMOD\nprotection, photovoltaic arrays, and additional propellant,\nbeyond the boil-off, for reboost and attitude control. The net\neffect is a substantial increase in both the mass and\ncomplexity for the EDS. As discussed previously, this mass\nincrease, along with the added mass for boil-off, results in\nthe 51.0.48 Ares V option not being viable. The 51.0.47\nAres V option would, therefore, be required to support an\nEDS with a 14-day loiter. The change in the Ares V and\nEDS designs not only increases the unit cost of the vehicle,\nas described above, but will also increase the DDT&E costs\nof the elements by a minimum estimated value of $1B. The\ntotal increase could be substantially greater.\n\nTable 10 summarizes the PnSL and replacement cost\nmetrics for each of the three final options.\nThe data in Table 10 shows that a V-I launch order with a\n14-day loiter provides the lowest possible PnSL at 1.9%.\nThe 4-day loiter cases for the V-I and I-V launch order are\nsimilar at 4.7% and 5.4%, respectively. For the expected\nvehicle replacement cost, the I-V 4-day case provides the\nlowest cost, at 0.05 AI per mission. The V-I 14-day loiter,\neven with its small PnSL, has a larger expected cost of 0.06\nAI. The expected vehicle replacement cost of the 4-day V-I\ncase is significantly higher at 0.14 AI because of the higher\nstack replacement cost.\nTable 10. Comparison of PnSL and Cost of Failure\nCase\nPnSL Cost of No\nExpected Vehicle\nSecond\nReplacement Cost,\nLaunch\nper Crewed Mission\n(Ares I Stack (Ares I Stack Equiv.)\nEquiv.)\n\nTwo other considerations apply to both of the V-I cases.\nThe first issue involves Ares I flight rules. In a V-I launch\n11\n\norder, where the Ares V and the Altair have been placed in\nLEO prior to the crew launch, as the launch opportunities\nexpires, pressure could be placed on launch controllers to\nrelax the Ares I launch rules in order to avoid the loss of the\nAres V stack in orbit.\n\nCase\nI-V 4-Day Loiter\nV-I 4-Day Loiter\n\nV-I 14-Day Loiter\n\nCase\n\nPnSL\n\nI-V\n4-Day\nLoiter\nV-I\n4-Day\nLoiter\n\n5.4%\n\nV-I\n14-Day\nLoiter\n\n1.9%\n\n4.7%\n\nTable 12.

Ares I and Orion flight rates\ncould be relatively high to support ISS and lunar missions.\nReplacing one of these stacks would be a matter of\naccelerating the next launch vehicle in the pipeline. For the\nAres V and Altair, however, the replacement could involve\nmore significant delays. The Ares V itself would be a more\nexpensive and more complex vehicle to replace. The Altair\nlander presents the greatest complexities. A limited number\nof landers will be produced for the lunar campaign.\nAcquiring an additional replacement lander could involve\nthe reopening of production lines. In addition, each Altair\nwill be unique to some degree because of the mission\nobjectives and the cargo that it carries. Finally, the cargo\nitself would need to be replaced in the event of a loss.\n\nadded. Although these are one-time DDT&E costs rather\nthan recurring costs, they occur in a phase of the program\nwhere the budget is most restricted.\nIn addition, the 51.0.47 design for the Ares V has been\nreserved as an option in case it is needed because of mass\ngrowth or performance uncertainty for the transportation\nsystem. If the upgraded design is adopted in the baseline to\nsupport a 14-day loiter and a more complex EDS, then no\ncurrent options are available to provide a hedge against\nmass growth or performance uncertainty in the\ntransportation system. While further upgrades to the EDS\nare possible, these upgrades were not considered desirable\nwhen the 51.0.48 and 51.0.47 options were down-selected\nfor further consideration by the Constellation Program.\nBecause of the requirement to upgrade the Ares V to the\n51.0.47 option, as well as the added complexity of the EDS\nstage, the V-I 14-day loiter case was removed from\nconsideration for the 1\xc2\xbd-launch launch operational concept.\nWhile this option offers a significantly lesser PnSL than the\nother two options at 1.9% versus 4.7% - 5.4%, the added\ncosts and risks associated with this option, particularly costs\nduring the crucial DDT&E period, were determined to be\nunacceptable. This opinion was reinforced by the results for\ntotal expected replacement cost. While the V-I 14-day loiter\ncase has a low PnSL, because of the high consequence of\nfailure, the total expected replacement cost was actually\nsomewhat greater than for the I-V 4-day loiter case.\n\nSummary Comparison\nTable 13 summarizes the comparison of the three launch\noptions. In this table, the cells that indicate potential\nnegative aspects for each case are highlighted.\nI-V 4-Day EDS Loiter 4-Day Orion Loiter\xe2\x80\x94The I-V launch\norder case resulted in the highest PnSL of the three final\ncases, with a probability of a missed second launch of 5.4%\nper mission. However, because of the low cost of failure for\nthis case, it also had the lowest expected vehicle\nreplacement cost at 0.05 AI per mission.\nV-I 4-Day EDS Loiter 4-Day Orion Loiter\xe2\x80\x94The V-I option\nwith 4-day EDS and Orion loiter has a PnSL that is similar\nto that for the I-V option at 4.7%. The PnSL for this case\nwas somewhat lower due to the lower complexity of the\nsecond launch vehicle. This case, however, resulted in the\ngreatest expected cost of failure at 0.14 AI. In addition, the\nV-I launch order includes the additional considerations that\ninvolve the pressure to relax flight rules and the difficulty in\nreplacing an Ares V stack.\n\n10. SELECTION OF 11/2-LAUNCH POINT-OFDEPARTURE OPERATIONAL CONCEPT\nAs described previously, the V-I 14-day loiter case was\ndetermined by decision makers to involve too much added\ncost and risk to justify the resultant improvement in PnSL.\nThe decision was reinforced by the fact that the second\nprimary metric, the expected cost of failure, was not\nimproved by the V-I case with a longer loiter period.\n\nV-I 14-Day EDS Loiter 4-Day Orion Loiter\xe2\x80\x94 Of the three\noptions, the V-I 14-day EDS loiter case presented the best\nPnSL value. The 1.9% PnSL was less than half the PnSL for\neither of the 4-day loiter cases. However, because of the\nhigh cost of failure, the overall expected vehicle\nreplacement cost per mission was similar to that of the I-V\n4-day case.\n\nThe two final cases, the I-V 4-day loiter and the V-I 4-day\nloiter, were compared; the I-V launch order was selected for\nthe baseline point-of-departure architecture.\nThe PnSL values, which represent the probability of a\nfailure event during the dual launch phase, were similar for\nthe I-V and V-I cases, at 5.4% and 4.7%, respectively. The\nexpected replacement cost per mission was significantly\nlower for the I-V case, however. Even with the cost\nuncertainty, the I-V case clearly would likely always result\nin a lower total cost.\n\nIn evaluating this case, the primary concern, however, was\nover the other required costs. Because of the added boil-off\npropellant and other described EDS complexities required\nto support this duration, the baseline 51.0.48 Ares V option\nwas no longer viable. The 51.0.47 Ares V option, with an\nupgraded capacity, would be required. The DDT&E costs\nfor this upgrade would be large. The cost difference for the\nAres V upgrade alone is estimated to be greater than $1B. In\naddition, the costs to upgrade the EDS, including\nphotovoltaic arrays and MMOD protection, would be\n\nCrew safety was a major consideration in selecting between\nthe two cases. A clear, quantifiable added risk to the crew\nexists in selecting the I-V launch order. The crew would be\nrequired to endure an additional set of launch, loiter, and\nEDL events in the case of a missed second launch.\n13\n\nHowever, because the probability of loss of crew is\nconditional to the PnSL, the overall added risk of 1 in 6,092\nis considered to be quite small. This is particularly true\nwhen the added risk is compared with the overall risks to\nthe crew that are anticipated for a human lunar mission.\n\nreliability for the Ares V over a number of missions. If the\ninitial reliability is low, then the desire would be to launch\nthe Ares V first so that the crew is not launched\nunnecessarily. Because the values used in this analysis\nrepresent the mature steady-state estimates, the PnSL for the\nI-V options could be worse than predicted in this analysis\nfor some number of early missions. If the initial reliability is\nsignificantly lower, then it may be desirable to launch initial\nmissions in a V-I order and then switch to I-V as reliability\nimproves.\n\nIn addition, although they could not be quantified at this\npoint in time, additional crew risks are associated with the\nV-I launch order. Although no determination can be made at\nthis point whether these range safety risks may be similar in\nmagnitude to the added risks in the I-V case, they certainly\ncannot be totally discounted.\n\nTo address this uncertainty, an additional set of analyses\nwas completed. In this uncertainty analysis, calculations\nwere made to determine how much each major input\nparameter would have to change in order to cause the\nlaunch option decision to change, if that decision were made\non expected replacement cost alone. The analysis was\nconducted by comparing the final two options: the I-V 4day loiter and the V-I 4-day loiter cases.\n\nThe selected I-V case with a 4-day loiter and 90-minute\nseparation offered the most balanced results across the\nFOMs that were used in this study. The PnSL of 5.4% was\nlarger than other cases but similar to the PnSL that could be\nachieved in any case if the Ares V was limited to the\n51.0.48 option. The consequence of failure in this case was\nmuch less than for the V-I case, which resulted in an\nexpected cost of less than half of that for the V-I launch\norder.\n\nThe results of the uncertainty analysis are shown in Table\n14. In this table, the current estimate used for each major\nparameter is listed. Then, the value for each parameter at\nwhich the launch order decision (based on the expected cost\nof failure) would switch is listed. Generally, the required\nshifts are large, although the required changes in Table 14\nare for single variables only. Simultaneous changes of\nmultiple parameters that are lower in magnitude could also\ncause a change in the launch order decision.\n\nIn addition, the other complexities that were associated with\nthe V-I launch order\xe2\x80\x93potential pressure to relax flight rules\nand the disruptions caused by having to replace an Ares V\xe2\x80\x93\nalso trended toward the selection of the I-V launch order.\n\n11. POINT-OF-DEPARTURE AND UNCERTAINTY\n\nThe greatest level of uncertainty in the current analysis\ninvolves the transportation element replacement costs.\nBecause of the uncertainty involving fixed and marginal\ncosts for Altair and because of the uncertain nature of cost\nestimates in early design large shifts could potentially occur\nin the cost data for all elements as the designs mature.\n\nNote that the selected 1\xc2\xbd-launch operational concept\nrepresents only a point-of-departure architecture to be used\nas a baseline for ongoing lunar architecture studies. It does\nnot represent a final selection of launch order, separation, or\nloiter period, and NASA is taking no steps to preclude a\nchange in the operational concept in the future.\n\nTable 14.

Because\nthe Ares V is still in the early stages of design, large amount\nof uncertainty still exists as to the launch reliability for the\nvehicle. As the design matures and more accurate estimates\nof reliability become available, the operations concept could\nalso be reconsidered.\nIn fact, it may ultimately be desirable to develop a 1\xc2\xbdlaunch system that allows for launch in either order. For the\npurposes of this study, the Ares V reliability and, therefore,\nthe PnSL were treated as constant values. Because there is a\nlimited test program for the Ares V before the crewed lunar\nmission begins, there is liable to be significant growth in\n\nIn order to represent the impact of uncertainty in the cost\ndata, a \xe2\x80\x9cbreakeven\xe2\x80\x9d cost ratio was determined. The\nimportant factor in comparing expected costs for the I-V\n14\n\nFigure 6 \xe2\x80\x93 Relative Ares I and Ares V Stack Costs\nand V-I launch orders is not the absolute costs of the Ares I\nand Ares V stacks but rather the relative costs between the\ntwo. Given the predicted PnSL values for the I-V and V-I\ncases, any set of cost data in which the cost of the Ares V is\ngreater than 115% of the cost of the Ares I will result in the\nexpected replacement cost per mission for the I-V option\nbeing lower. This relationship is depicted graphically in\nFigure 6.\n\nAcross the range of current cost estimates, a large margin\nstill exists before the break-even point is reached. Even with\nno fixed costs included for the Ares V, the Ares V cost\nwould have to decrease by 32%, or the Ares I cost would\nhave to increase by 47% for the cost of failure to be equal\nfor the two cases. These changes seem to be outside the\ncurrent range of cost uncertainty.\nThe Constellation Program has initiated an action to\nmonitor the key parameters identified in this analysis as the\ntransportation element designs continue to mature. If the\ndesigns reach a state at which the selected point-ofdeparture operational concept is called into question, then\nthis baseline may be updated.\n\nFigure 6 can be used to determine the resultant optimal\nlaunch order for any set of Ares I and Ares V stack\nreplacement costs, based on minimizing the expected cost of\nfailure. The cost of the Ares V stack is specified on the\nhorizontal axis, and the cost of the Ares I stack is specified\non the vertical axis. The sloping red line in the center of the\nfigure represents the break-even cost boundary. If the set of\ncosts is below this line in the light-blue region, then the I-V\nlaunch order is preferable. If the set of costs are above the\nred line in the light-green region, then the V-I launch order\nis preferable.\n\n12. SUMMARY\nThe initial specification of an operational concept for the\n1\xc2\xbd-launch solution was largely based on three assumptions.\nFirst, there was a \xe2\x80\x9cgut reaction\xe2\x80\x9d that one would not want to\nrisk launching a crew until the EDS and lander were safely\nin orbit. Second, the assumption was made that the\nprobability of missing the second launch could be\nsubstantially reduced by providing a long loiter period for\nthe EDS. Finally, with long EDS loiter periods, the\nassumption was made that a 24-hour launch separation\nwould have no significant impact on mission success.\n\nThe intent of Figure 6 is to provide a visual indication of\nhow much change could occur in the cost estimates before\nthe launch order decision would be reconsidered. The\ncurrent cost estimates are represented as a vertical bar on\nthe chart. The Ares I cost is fixed at 1.00 AI. The Ares V\ncost is represented as a range of 1.65 to 2.88 AI, which\nrepresents the full range that is produced by the possible\ninclusion of fixed costs.\n15\n\nMore detailed analysis indicated that all three of these\nassumptions were not entirely accurate. The added risk to\nthe crew, dictated by the conditional probability of enduring\na second launch and encountering a loss-of-crew event, was\nquite small, especially as compared with the total risk for a\nhuman lunar mission.\n\nthe large difference in relative costs is that the expected cost\nof failure is substantially lower for the I-V launch order.\nThe results of the study allowed decision makers to select a\nI-V launch order, with a 90-minute separation and a 4-day\nEDS/Orion LEO loiter period as the point-of-departure\noperational concept. This concept will serve as the baseline\nfor ongoing lunar mission development. However, as\ndesigns mature and the major parameters used in this\nanalysis are refined, the operational concept for the 1\xc2\xbdlaunch solution will be further evaluated.\n\nThe ability to use added loiter to reduce PnSL was largely\nlimited by the Ares V capabilities. Loiter periods of more\nthan four days would require a change to the selected Ares\nV option (significantly increasing DDT&E and unit cost)\nand would substantially increase the complexity of the EDS.\nFinally, with shorter loiter periods, the 24-hour launch\nseparation significantly increased the probability of no\nsecond launch. The increase in PnSL outweighed the\nadvantages of having a long separation between the\nlaunches.\n\nREFERENCES\n[1] \xe2\x80\x9cExploration Systems Architecture Study -- Final Report\xe2\x80\x9d,\nNASA-TM-2005-214062,\nNovember\n2005.\nurl:\nhttp://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/constellation/news/E\nSAS_report.html.\n\nTaking these limitations into account, the assumed launch\norder, launch separation, and loiter duration were called into\nquestion. A structured methodology to evaluate the\nprobability of failure, the cost of failure, and the risk to the\ncrew allowed NASA decision makers to methodically\ncompare the options and to select a point-of-departure for\n1\xc2\xbd-launch operations that would result in the best expected\nmission performance.\n\n[2] Doug Cooke, \xe2\x80\x9cLunar Architecture Update\xe2\x80\x9d, National\nAeronautics and Space Administration, 2007. url:\nhttp://www.nasa.gov/pdf/190083main_AIAA_ESMD_fin\nalSPACE2007.pdf.\n[3] Grant Cates, William Cirillo, and Chel Stromgren, \xe2\x80\x9cLow\nearth orbit rendezvous strategy for lunar missions,\xe2\x80\x9d\nProceedings of the IEEE 2006 Winter Simulation\nConference, ed.

The added cost and complexity of the Ares\nV and the EDS, particularly during the DDT&E period,\nwould impose significant affordability issues.

With a 4-day\nloiter, both launch orders resulted in similar values for\nPnSL. The I-V order would result in some added crew risk\nin the event of a missed launch, but the magnitude of the\nadded risk was determined to be quite small, especially\nbecause the crew would face some indeterminate added\nflight hazard risk in the V-I option as well. The major\ndiscriminator between launch orders was in the expected\ncost of failure. Because a 1\xc2\xbd-launch failure in the V-I order\nwould result in the loss of an Ares V, the EDS, and the\nAltair lander, the consequence of failure is quite high. A\nfailure in the I-V launch order would result in substantially\nlower costs to replace the Ares I and an Orion service\nmodule and refurbish an Orion crew module.
