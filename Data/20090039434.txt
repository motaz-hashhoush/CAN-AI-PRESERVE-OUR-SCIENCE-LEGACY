b'Tensile Fabrics Enhance Architecture Around the World\nOriginating Technology/NASA Contribution\n\nO\n\nn a Friday night in March 2008, fans at a college basketball game at Atlanta\xe2\x80\x99s Georgia Dome\nnoticed the stadium\xe2\x80\x99s scoreboard begin to sway.\nOutside, winds howled through the city. Unknown to\nthose in the stadium, a tornado was ripping through\ndowntown. The safety of the more than 18,000 people\nwould depend in large part on the integrity of the stadium\xe2\x80\x99s domed roof\xe2\x80\x94built using a material originally\ndeveloped to protect NASA astronauts. \t\nOver 40 years earlier, NASA\xe2\x80\x99s effort to achieve the\nfirst manned Moon landing nearly derailed when a fire\nbroke out on the Apollo 1 command module during a test\nexercise, resulting in the destruction of the module and\nthe deaths of the three astronauts onboard. In the wake\nof the tragedy, NASA engineers redesigned the Apollo\nmodule and searched for ways to enhance the safety\nperformance of the nylon space suits. The suits required\nan outer layer component that would be durable, strong,\nlightweight, flexible, and noncombustible. OwensCorning Fiberglass, of Toledo, Ohio\xe2\x80\x94working with\nDuPont, of Wilmington, Delaware\xe2\x80\x94proposed a fabric\nknown as \xe2\x80\x9cBeta cloth.\xe2\x80\x9d The primary component of this\nfabric was ultrafine glass filaments, which were twisted\ninto yarns and then woven into the fabric. The manufacturers then coated it with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE,\nmore commonly known as Teflon), a DuPont invention.\nThe fabric proved noncombustible (with a melting point\nover 650 \xc2\xb0F) and durable enough for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s needs. The\nAgency incorporated the PTFE fiberglass fabric into\nthe outer protective layers of the Integrated Thermal\nMicrometeoroid Garment (ITMG) of the A7L space\nsuit worn for the Apollo missions and Skylab program.\nThe PTFE fiberglass fabric layer provided both thermal\nprotection as well as shielding from abrasive lunar dust\nduring Moon landings.\nWhile the current NASA space suit used on the space\nshuttle and International Space Station employs Ortho128\t Industrial Productivity \t\n\nFabric (a blend of GORE-TEX, Kevlar, and Nomex\xe2\x80\x94all\nprivate industry inventions) in its ITMG instead of the\nPTFE fiberglass fabric, that original innovation has gone\non to become a unique component of an unrelated,\nterrestrial field: architecture.\n\nBirdair\xe2\x80\x99s roof structures, using fabric originally developed\nfor the Apollo space suits, now adorn buildings such as\n(clockwise from top left) the original Birdair \xe2\x80\x9cSuper Tents\xe2\x80\x9d\nstructure at the University of La Verne in La Verne, California;\nNavy Pier in Chicago, and Palm Springs International Airport\nin Palm Springs, California.\n\nSpinoff 2009\n\nPartnership\nIn 1956, aeronautical engineer Walter Bird founded\nBirdair Structures Inc. in the kitchen of his home in\nBuffalo, New York. Birdair initially focused on airsupported, neoprene-coated nylon fabric structures, building upon its founder\xe2\x80\x99s experience crafting such structures\nfor use by the U.S. military.\nBirdair\xe2\x80\x99s work developing the air-supported, vinylcoated fiberglass fabric roof (the first of its kind) of the\nU.S. Pavilion at Expo 1970 in Osaka, Japan, led the\ncompany to explore improved fiberglass fabric options\nfor architectural use. The company collaborated with\nOwens-Corning, DuPont, and Chemical Fabrics\nCorporation (Chemfab), of Merrimack, New Hampshire\non a modified, stronger version of the PTFE glass fiber\nfabric developed for NASA. The resulting fabric (later\ncalled Sheerfill Architectural Membrane, manufactured\nby Chemfab), expanded the market for Birdair in the field\nof lightweight, tensile membrane roof structures for roofs,\nskylights, and canopies.\n\nProduct Outcome\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen there are so many architectural materials out\nthere, fabric is not something architects usually think\nof offhand,\xe2\x80\x9d says William Barden, Birdair\xe2\x80\x99s director of\narchitectural development. \xe2\x80\x9cWalter Bird\xe2\x80\x99s pioneering role\nin the tensile structure industry was to take a technology\nthat was perceived by people as \xe2\x80\x98pie in the sky\xe2\x80\x99 and create\na market for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn 1973, Birdair engineered, fabricated, and installed\nthe world\xe2\x80\x99s first permanent tensile membrane roof system\nutilizing PTFE fiberglass membrane for the Sports Science\nand Athletics Pavilion at the University of La Verne in\nLa Verne, California. Thirty-six years later, that original\nstructure remains in excellent condition. Birdair, now a\nspecialty contractor based in Amherst, New York, has\ngrown into a multimillion-dollar company with nearly\n900 landmark tensile structures to its name, most of which\nSpinoff 2009\t\n\nemploy the original PTFE fiberglass fabric developed for\nNASA. Major transportation hubs, sports facilities, and\nconvention centers are among the buildings around the\nworld that feature Birdair\xe2\x80\x99s signature PTFE fiberglass\nmembrane roofing. These include Denver International\nAirport\xe2\x80\x99s Jeppesen Terminal; the 105-acre Hajj Terminal\nin Saudi Arabia; Reliant Stadium in Houston (the first\nretractable roof in the NFL); the O2/Millennium Dome\nin London, England (22 acres of fabric roof); the Sony\nCenter in Berlin, Germany; and many others. Barden\nestimates the company has fabricated and installed over\n30 million square feet of the PTFE fiberglass membrane\nin its various projects.\nThe same qualities that made the PTFE fiberglass\nfabric appealing to NASA also make it ideal for largescale, permanent tensile membrane roofs. The material\nis pound-for-pound stronger than steel while weighing less\nthan 5 ounces per square foot. It offers up to 24 percent\nsolar translucency while providing as much as 75 percent\nsolar reflectance, meaning the fabric lets in natural light\nwhile keeping out heat, making it an energy-efficient roofing alternative. It is also cost-effective due to its durability\nand low maintenance characteristics. Barden estimates\na properly maintained Birdair roof could provide\n30\xe2\x80\x9335 years or more of useful service life, as opposed\n\nHouston\xe2\x80\x99s Reliant Stadium features a retractable, PTFE\nfiberglass fabric roof crafted by Birdair.\n\nto the 20\xe2\x80\x9325 years offered by conventional roofing\nmaterials like asphalt shingles or single-ply rubber. As a nonflammable fabric, the PTFE fiberglass material is safer\nthan many roofing options, as well, and allows for the\ncreation of swooping, eye-catching architectural forms.\nBirdair\xe2\x80\x99s PTFE fiberglass membrane, still manufactured for Birdair by Chemfab (now called Saint-Gobain\nPerformance Plastics), entered the Space Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s\nSpace Technology Hall of Fame in 1989. The material\xe2\x80\x99s\ncapabilities\xe2\x80\x94and possibilities\xe2\x80\x94have yet to be exhausted,\nhowever. In 2008, Sheerfill Architectural Membrane\nwas approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection\nAgency as an ENERGY STAR qualified roof product\nand recognized by the Cool Roof Rating Council, based\non the fabric\xe2\x80\x99s high solar reflectance and thermal emittance. Birdair also introduced its Tensotherm insulated\nfabric roofing product, which allows natural light to pass\nthrough while providing enhanced thermal resistance and\nacoustical qualities.\nThe company continues to work on new structures\xe2\x80\x94\nincluding three out of the four primary stadiums for the\n2010 World Cup in South Africa and the new Dallas\nCowboys Stadium\xe2\x80\x94while celebrating the enduring quality of its existing creations. Among those is the Georgia\nDome, which came out of the March 2008 Atlanta\ntornado with only slight damage to its roof and not a\nsingle injury to its occupants, though winds ranged up to\n135 miles per hour and caused significant destruction in\nthe city. The stadium roof\xe2\x80\x99s PTFE fiberglass membrane, the\nsame material that once protected astronauts in the harsh\nenvirons of the Moon, required only minor repairs. v\nTeflon\xc2\xae, Kevlar\xc2\xae, and Nomex\xc2\xae are registered trademarks of E.
