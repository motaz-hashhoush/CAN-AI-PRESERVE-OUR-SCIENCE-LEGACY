However, this formalism contains several approximations whose applicability has not been thoroughly justified. One of them is that lines of interest are well isolated. When these authors developed the formalism, they have relied on this assumption twice. First, in calculating the spectral density F(\u03c9), they have only considered the diagonal matrix elements of the relaxation operator. Due to this simplification, effects from the line mixing are ignored. Second, when they applied the linked cluster theorem to remove the cutoff, they have assumed the matrix elements of the operator exp(-iS(sub 1) - S(sub 2)) can be replaced by the exponential of the matrix elements of -iS(sub 1) - S(sub 2). With this replacement, effects from the line coupling are also ignored. Although both these two simplifications relied on the same approximation, their validity criteria are completely different and the latter is more stringent than the former. As a result, in many cases where the line mixing becomes negligible, significant effects from the line coupling have been completely missed. In the present study, we have developed a new method to evaluate the matrix elements of exp(-iS(sub 1) - S(sub 2)) and have refined the RB formalism such that line coupling can be taken into account. Our numerical calculations of the half-widths for Raman Q lines of the N(sub 2)-N(sub 2) pair have demonstrated that effects from the line coupling are important. In comparison with values derived from the RB formalism, new calculated values for these lines are significantly reduced. A recent study has shown that in comparison with the measurements and the most accurate close coupling calculations, the RB formalism overestimates the half-widths by a large amount. As a result, the refinement of the RB formalism goes in the right direction and these new calculated half-widths become closer to the \"true\" values.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"volume": "139", "submissionId": 20150020910, "issue": "3", "publisher": "AIP Publishing", "id": "66b7d090a47b4ba6aa89b5c65162804c", "publicationName": "Journal of Chemical Physics", "publicationDate": "2013-07-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
