The module can be lifted by a dockside crane or helicopter and placed on the deck of a patrol boat or cutter for transportation to the scene of the fire. At the fire the module can be set up and put in operation by a crew of two in approximately fifteen minutes. Once in operation the module will deliver water to two fire nozzles at a pressure of 150 psi and a flow rate of 2000 gpm. Sufficient fuel is carried in the module for three hours of continuous operation. A record of the development of the fire fighting module is also presented.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19800023160, "id": "59dae89d5a8b4bbab7f64a190b85ea6e", "publicationDate": "1980-05-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19800023160.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19800023160/downloads/19800023160.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19800023160/downloads/19800023160.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19800023160/downloads/19800023160.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
