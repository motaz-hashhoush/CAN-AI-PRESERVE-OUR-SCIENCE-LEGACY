Prior to the transformation, OODT CAS (also alternatively denoted, simply, 'CAS') [wherein 'OODT' signifies 'Object-Oriented Data Technology' and 'CAS' signifies 'Catalog and Archive Service'] was a proven software component used to manage scientific data from spaceflight missions. In the transformation, CAS was split into two separate components representing its canonical capabilities: file management and workflow management. In addition, CAS was augmented by addition of a resource-management component. This third component enables CAS to manage heterogeneous computing by use of diverse resources, including high-performance clusters of computers, commodity computing hardware, and grid computing infrastructures. CAS is now more easily maintainable, evolvable, and reusable. These components can be used separately or, taking advantage of synergies, can be used together. Other elements of the transformation included addition of a separate Web presentation layer that supports distribution of data products via Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feeds, and provision for full Resource Description Framework (RDF) exports of metadata.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20090016266, "id": "6b540a2e67cd4d2e9a43a3d7ea37f81a", "publicationName": "NASA Tech Briefs, June 2008", "publicationDate": "2008-06-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20090016241, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "NASA Tech Briefs, June 2008", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20090016266.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20090016266/downloads/20090016266.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20090016266/downloads/20090016266.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20090016266/downloads/20090016266.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
