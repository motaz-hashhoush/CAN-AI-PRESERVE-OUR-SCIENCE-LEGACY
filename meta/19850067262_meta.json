While some form of bound water and/or OH has been known on Mars for many years, a new result presented is the identification of structural OH in a dilute or poorly crystalline magnesian clay. The detection of water ice in the residual north polar cap is noted. Also considered is the role that reflectance spectroscopy will play in the future, from earth and as an important part of the NASA Mars Geosciences/Climatology Orbiter mission.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"volume": "5", "submissionId": 19850067262, "issue": "8 19", "issn": "0273-1177", "id": "4bcd4a248ff44fa7a3f67ca3ad8d578b", "publicationName": "Advances in Space Research", "publicationDate": "1985-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
