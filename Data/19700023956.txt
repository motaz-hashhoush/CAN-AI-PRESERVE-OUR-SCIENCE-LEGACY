A suitable accelerator has many\nimportant, potential applications, including use as a source\nof high-speed flow for aerodynamic testing, as a source\nof high-speed plasma for research in magnetoplasmady- 25\nnamics, and as a propulsive system for space vehicles.\nAn especially pertinent area of interest in the ultilization\nof a steady flow accelerator lies in the laboratory reproduction or simulation, for test and study, of as many as\npossible of the atmospheric reentry conditions of velocity, 30\ntemperature, and density, to which space vehicles are exposed.\nIt has previously been proposed to utilize the prior art\nelectrostatic force principle, as in ion guns and ion engines,\nin the design of the desired accelerator. However, it has 35\nbeen found that the density of charged particles produced\nin a device of this type is many orders of magnitude too\nsmall for the uses contemplated. It has been further suggested that, if a beam of ions of the necessary density cannot be produced in this manner, the required density could\nbe obtained by putting a relatively small percentage of\nions in some gas, accelerating these charged particles\nelectrostatically, and letting them collide with and thereby\naccelerate the neutral molecules of gas. However, this 45\noperation is also found to be unworkable for any reasonable density of gas, such as that existing at 100,000 feet,\nbecause of the space charge effect. The space charge due\nto the ion density required in the accelerating section is\nestimated to be in the billion-volt class.\n50\nThe obvious way to overcome space charge effects is to\nbuild up essentially equal number densities of positive ions\nand negative electrons in the accelerator; but if this condition is had initially, application of an electric field to\nthe accelerator will separate the oppositely charged par- 55\nticles until a sufficient space charge is again built up to\nprevent further separation of the particles, and no net\nincrease in momentum can be obtained.\nAccordingly, it is an object of #e present invention\nto provide a novel plasma accelerator.\nen\nAnother object of the instant invention ipto provied-ar\nhigh-density plasma accelerator capable of steady flow\noperation.\nA further object of this invention is to provide a plasma\naccelerator wherein neutralization of positive ions through 65\ncontact with the accelerator wall is largely eliminated.\n,\nThe foregoing and other significant objects are attained\nin the instant invention by the provision of an accelerating\nchannel having crossed electric and magnetic fields. The\nfields are oriented normally to each other, and the charged 70\nparticles of the plasma flowing through the channel are\naccelerated by a force calculable from the korentz equa-\n\n"1\n\nI\n\n*\n\ntion. In addition to applying the electric field in a plane\nnormal to #at of the magnetic field, the electric field is\nalso slanted in an axial, downstream direction so as to\ncause the positive ions of the plasma to flow nearly parallel to the channel a i s ; thereby reducing neutralizing contact of the ions with the channel wall. The slanted electric\nfield is provided by a plurality of axially spaced, Segmented electrodea which comprise opposing channel Walls.\nThe cathodes of the segmented electrodes also serve as\nthermionic emitters which, when heated by the plasma\nflow, emit an electron current. The electron current\npasses through the plasma flow and is collected by the\nsegmented anodes of the opposite channel wall. The driving force on the plasma is dependent upon both the density\nof the electron current passing therethrough, and the induction of the imposed magnetic field.\nA more complete appreciation of the invention and\nmany of the attendant advantages thereof will be readily\napparent as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings\nwherein:\nFIG. 1 is a vertical sectional view of the accelerator,\ntaken along a psarke normal to the channel longitudinal\naxis;\nFIG. 2 is a longitudinal sectional view of the accelerator, taken along lines 22 of FIG. 1;\nFIG. 3 is a schematic wiring diagram illustrating a manner of connecting the plurality of electrodes of the instant\ninvention to unidirectional sources of potential, to provide both a vertical and a horizontal potential gradient;\nand\nFIG. 4 is a schematic diagram illustrating the orientation of the electro-magnetic field relative to the accelerator\nchannel.\nReferring now to the drawings, wherein like reference\nnumerals designate identical or corresponding parts\nthroughout the several views, the accelerator 11 of the\npresent invention is illustrated, in FIGS. 1 and 2, as comprising a plurality of axially spaced pairs of electrodes\n1213, positioned so as to form an axial flow channel 14\nbetween the confronting surhces thereof. It will be\nnoted that the electrode 12 serves as the positive electrode,\nor anode, and the electrode 93 as the negative electrode,\nor cathode. It will also be obvious that the anode\nmuch thicker than the cathode 13; the cathode 13\nmounted upon a conductive element 16, the combined\nthickness of cathode 13 and mounting element 16 approximating that of anode 12. This thickness of material is desirable to enable the electrical connections to\nthe electrodes to be made at relatively cool locations. A\nsatisfactory high-temperature material which may be\nutilized for the anode 12 and the mounting member 1\ngraphite. The oathode material 13 must be selected with\nregard both to its melting point and to its thermal emission rate. Several cathode materials have been suitably\nemployed; three of such materials being: lanthanum hexaboride, pure tungsten, and 2 percent thoriated tungsten.\nThe 2 mrcent thoriated tungsten has been found to best\ncombine the properties of high melting point and electron\nemissivity. It may be observed that the accelerator 11,\nas shown, consists of seven pair of electrodes. However,\nthe number of electrode pairs may be more or less than\nthe seven shown, the number being dependent upon the\ndegree of electric field uniformity desired, and upon the\nlength of awlerator desired.\nThe plurality of electrode segments P2,13 are separated\nby elongated rectangular insulating strips 17; the strips\nforming the sidewalls of channel 1 . An insulating\n4\nspacer member 1 , FIG. 2, is positioned between each of\nthe axially spaced electrodes 82,%3. A preferred material\n\na, 171,060\n\n4\nurements at the entrance and exit of the accelerator channel. The above parameters are merely illustrative of\none embodiment of the instant invention; and the enlargement or reduction in scale of accelerator physical\n5 dimensions and field strengths, or the substitution of other\nsuitable materials for those employed, are contemplated\nby the inventors thereof.\nThe principle of operation of the disclosed accelerator\n11 is based on the Lorentz equation, F = j X B . The term\n10 F of the equation may be defined as the driving force\nper unit volume exerted on the plasma to be accelerated;\nj as the density of electron current flow through the\nplasma; and B the magnetic induction of the accelerator\nfield. The electron current flow through the plasma is\n15 produced by the electric field created between p*\nof\nelectrodes 12, 13. Electrons are emitted from cathodes\n13, pass through the plasma, and are collected by anodes\n12. The magnetic field is set up perpendicular to both the\ndirection of plasma flow and of electron current flow by\n20 poles 36,37. The charged particles of the plasma introduced into the crossed-fields of the accelerator 1 expe1\nrience a driving force, normal to both the magnetic and\nthe electric fields, which accelerates the particles in an\naxial, downstream direction. The positive ions Of the\n25 plasma, in turn, collide with and propel neutral gaseous\nmolecules along the accelerator channel.\nIn FIG. 4, the various factors set forth above are shown\noriented with respect to the accelerator flow channel 14.\nThe magnetic field B is applied across the channel per30 pendicular to and into the paper. The electric field E\nis applied across channel perpendicular to the magnetic\nfield, but slanted with respect to the channel longitudinal\naxis. Electric field E produces an electric current whose\ndensity is 1, and the plasma experiences an accelerating\n35 force j x B per unit volume.\nTo provide a clearer understanding of the instant invention, the operation of the disclosed plasma accelerator will\nnow be described. A plasma flow is introduced into the\nleft hand side, FIG. 2, of accelerator 11. The source of\n40 the plasma may be a plasma producing apparatus as is\ndescribed in the co-pending application of Arlen F. Carter,\nSerial NO.178,215, filed Marah 7, 1962, NASA Case NO.\n147. n e cross electrical and magnetic fields have been\nactivated prior to introduction of the plasma into channel\n45 14. The plasma upon entry into channel 14, at a temperature of approximately 5,500" K.,heats up the cathodes 13 to a temperature at which thermionic emission\ntakes place. The electron current emitted from the cathodes 13 passes through the plasma to be accelerated, and\n50 is collected by anodes 12. The charged particles Of the\naxis.\nplasma flow experience m driving force, calculable from\na\nIn laboratory experiments, with one embodiment of\nthe Lorentz equation set forth above, which accelerates\nthe particles along downstream, cycloidal paths. The\nthe above described accelerator, the following parameters\nwere used. The accelerator 11 was housed in a test\nhorizontal, or axial, potential gradient set up between the\nchamber, not shown, constructed of nonmagnetic stain- 55 axially spaced electrode pairs 12, 13, serves to slant the\nelectric field with respect to the accelerator axis; the elecless steel, 8 inches square and 24 inches long. The chamtric field thereby being tailored to direct the Lorentz force\nber was evacuated to a pressure of 80 mm. Hg. Magsubstantially parallel to the channel axis. Therefore, the\nnetic poles 36, 37 passed through the walls of the test\nchamber and formed a gap of 1% inches with an area oi\nslanted electric field produced by the axially spaced, seg2% X 4% inches. A magnetic field of 1.2 webers/m.z 60 mented electrodes, prevents loss of positive ions through\nneutralizing collisions with the channel Walls by directing\nwas produced in the gap. The flow channel was 1 cm.\nsquare, and the accelerator was 3% inches long, with\nthe ions away from the walls, in an axial, downstream\nseven electrodes % inch in length separated by l/s inch\ndirection. The positive ions, being accelerated through\nchannel 14 by the crossed fields, in turn propel neutral\ninsulators made of boron nitride. The cathodes 93 were\nmade from thoriated tungsten,\ninch thick, and the 65 gaseous molecules along the length of the accelerator\nchannel through collision processes. The accelerated\nanodes 12 from graphite, 1 % inches thick. The electrode\nassembly was housed in nonmagnetic stainlew-steel walls,\nplasma then emerges from the right hand side of the\naccelerator, FIG. 2, for utilization in the various test, exinch thick lining of boron nitride between the\nwith a\nperimental, and propulsion applications previously set\nelectrodes and the walls. A potential gradient of 48\nvolts/cm. i a vertical direction and 4 volts/cm. in an 70 forth.\nn\naxial direction was applied to the accelerator. This gave\nObviously many modifications and variations of the\na current density across the flow channel of 16 ampresent invention are possible in the light of the above\nperes/cm.2. Acceleration of the plasma was verified by\nteachings. It is therefore to be understood that within\nPitot tube measurement of the change in stagnation presthe scope of the appended claims the invention may be\nsure at the accelerator exit, and by static pressure meas- 75 practiced otherwise than as specifically described.\n\nfor the insulating member 7, 18, possessing excellent\nhigh temperature insulating properties, is boron nitride.\nElectrical contact to the electrodes 12, 13 is made\nthrough individual L-shaped brass plates 19;the electrical\ncontacts 19 being pressed into engagement with the outer\nsurfaces of anode 12 and the cathode mounting member\n14. Pressure is applied to the electrical contacts and\nelectrode assembly through screws 21, the screws being\nfrom electrical contact plates 19 by members\nscrews 21 are threaded through cantilevered\nwhich extend laterally from upper and lower\nwall members 24,26, to exert the desired pressure.\nThe electrode assembly is housed in a nonmagnetic,\nstainless-steel casing consisting of upper and lower wall\nmembers 24, 26, and side walls 27, 28. A liner 29 of\ninsulating material, such as boron nitride, is positioned\nbetween the side walls and the electrodes to prevent shorting. The ends of the electrode assembly are enclosed by\nrelatively thick insulating members 31, 32, FIG. 2. The\nelectrode assembly and wall members are secured together\ninto an integral unit by clamps or bands, not shown,\nfastened to the outer, metallic wall members.\nAlternatively, it is contemplated that the accelerator\ncasing may be formed from a cast ceramic block; rather\nthan individual wall members surrounding the electrode\nassembly and secured together. Individual holes to receive the electrodes would then be cut in one wall of the\nblock, and a flow channel formed through the ceramic\nblock. If desired, the emitting cathodes can be mounted\non a movable pedestal, for movement away from the flow\nchannel. This construction enables the emitting wall to\nbe lowered away from the accelerator to permit activating of the thermionic emitters by heating means other\nthan the plasma flow, without heating of the whole accelerator during the period required to activate the emitters.\nThe electrical circuit for accelerator 11 is schematically\nillustrated in FIG. 3. A shown, a vertical electric field\nS\niS established between each anode 12 and cathode 13 by\nan individual direct current potential source 33. An additional Potential source 34 is arranged between each\naxially spaced electrode pair 12, 13, to set up an axial\nOr horizontal electric field in the downstream direction.\nThe net effect of these two potential gradients is to create\na slanted electric field which accelerates and directs, in\nconjunction with an imposed magnetic field, the charged\nparticles supplied to flow channel 14.\nThe accelerator magnetic field is applied by an electromagnet; the poles 36, 37 of which are shown in FIG. 1.\nThe magentic field is applied across channel 14, Perpendicillar to the slanted electric field and to the channel\n\na\n\n,\nB\n\nI\n\n\\\n\n3,1~1,060\n\nWhat is claimed as new and desired to be secured by\nLetters Patent of the United States is:\n1.
