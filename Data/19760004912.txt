b'Chapter II\nGENERAL AVIATIOPI\nENVIRONMENT\nGeneral aviation does not exist in a\nvacuum independent of other influences. It is\ncontrolled by Congressional action and extensive mandatory regulation. The system compostatutory\nnents interface in compliance ~ i t h\nprovisions and operating rules.\nEconomic factors influence airport administration and finance. Vehicle airworthiness\ncertification costs are becoming increasingly\nburdensome. Rising costs of nearly all goods\nand services necessitate close scrutiny of expenditures. General aviation is no exception.\nCertain groups are taking hard looks at competitive modes and travel substitutions,\nespecially for intercity and business trips.\nSubstitution-a change in mobility patterns and communicalive behaviors-may lead\nto profound changes in our interaction patterns.\nProtection of the environment, such as\nlowering of noise levels, natural resource\ndepletion prevention, and the preservation of\nclean and fresh water are all concerns of\ngeneral aviation.\nThe following discussion examines some\nof the background, development, and relationships between and among these issues.\n\nTHE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT\nRegulatory Scope\nThe four major areas of concern pertaining\nto the role of government regulation in general\naviation are: (1) airports, (2) air agencies, (3)\naircraft, and (4) airrren. Some regulation of\ngeneral aviation as weli ds other transportation\nand public services is undertaken at every level\nof government.\nThe Federal Government under its\nauthority to regulate interstate commerce. has\nplayed an almost exclusively predominant role\nin the regulatory control of aircraft and air\nagencies. Airport regulation, however, has\nbeen predominantly ~lnderlocal control. This\nsituation is rapidly changing as Federal ossistance to local alrports increases. States still\nplay an important role in approving the allocation of Federal airport improvement funds.\n\nthrough the final approval or disapproval of the\nrequired matching funds to meet the Federal\ngrants for airport improvement. Physical control of the airport environment also remains in\nlocal hands through their znning jurisdiction,\nconstraining ordinances, and through local\ncourt decisions. Different areas of regulatory\nconsern are cross-classifi& in Figure 2-1, by\nboth the level of government and the area of\nregulatory concern.\n\nLegislative and\nRegulatory History\nThe people of the United States gave Congress the right to regulate interstate commerce\nfcr the good of the nation. It was natural,\ntherefore, that the first direct implementation of\naviation control came through the Air Commerce Act of 1926.\nThe Air Commerce Act d 1926\nThis act undertook regulation by licensing\npilots, aircraft, and agencies, and by introducing conditions pertaining to the issuance and\nrenewal of appropriate licenses and certificates. These conait~onsincluded demonstration of knowledge and proficiency by pilots\na.rd agencies and minimum safety requirements relating to aircraft. Compliance with\nthese rules was made mandatory by the Act,\nwhich also mandated the promotion of air commerce and the creation and operation of an airways system. The Bureau of Air Commerce,\nwhich was created by the Act, was charged with\nthis responsibility and thus became the forerunner of the former Civil Aeronautics Agency\nl\n(CAA) and the C i v ~Aeronautics Board (CAB)\nand the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)\nas we know them today today.\nThe Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938\nThe Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938 created\nthe Civil Aeronautics Authority (CAA) to regulate aviation with respect to both safety and\neconomics. The 1940 amendment gave the Civil\nAeronautics Board (CAB) the authority for both\neconomic and safety regulation and for determination of "probable cause" in aircraft accidents. The safety regulatiorl was to be implemented by the CAB which was crea!ed by the\n1940 amendment to the Act.\nThe 1940 amendment not only gave the\nCAB the authority to regulate air carriers by establishing fares and authorizing routes, but\nclearly entrusted the CAA with the responSI bi llty of promoting air commerce by developing the federal airways system. This responsibility led to the Federal Airport Act of 1946\nand the subsequent Federal Alrport and Airway\n\nORIGINAZ PAGE I\nS\nOF POOR &u.ALm\n\n60\n\nDevelopment Act of 1970 and the concurrent\nAirport and Airway Revenue Act. The latter provided funds for the support of programs initiated under the former. The main sources of\nthese funds are airline ticket and aviation fuel\ntaxes.\nThat Federal Aviation Act d 1958\nFollowing several mid-air collisions in the\n19501s,Congress passed the Federal Aviation\nAct in order to better define and to isolate air\n;B\nsafety responsibility. Under the Act, CA retained economic jurisdiction and the responsibility for determining probable "cause of accidents," while FAA acquired the responsibility\nand authority to promulgate safety regulations.\nAlthough this system seemed to be functioning\nsuccessfully (the domestic air carriers hit a zero\nfatality year in i970), Congress placed the control of air transportation under the jurisdiction\nof a newly cleated Departr,ient of Transportation in that year.\nThe Department of Traneportation Act of 1970\nThis act transferred the responsibility for\nthe promulgation of safety rules to the Secretary of Transportation and established the National Transportation Safety Board which now\ndetermines probable cause of accidents. It also\ndirected that safety r u l x be placed under the\njurisdiction of the FAA, leaving the CAB with\nthe responsibilityfor economic regulation of air\ntransportation.\nThus, the CAB presently regulates all common carriage by air inchding route agthoriza:ion, fares, and preservation of the financial\nwell-being of the zarriers to assl;re continued\nexistence and service to the public. FAA regulates aircraft, pilot. and air agency certification\nand operation as well as airway and airport\ndevelopment and funding.\n\nAirports\nSeveral states have stepptd in to fill the\nvoids in aviation regulation or control in the\narea least affected by Federal legislation-the\nairport.\nMany states license airporu for commercial reasons, including tax regulation and control of fees and charges. Ths Federal government has recently undertaken to license all air\ncarrier airports for safety requirements (FAR\nPart 139), and continues to establish minimums\n1\nfor safety specifications at 8 1 airports accepting Federal funds for Improvement.\nSubdivisions of the states have passed ordinances restricting the use of airports, some of\nwhich have been upheld by the courts, while\nothers were declared "an undue burden on in-\n\nterstate commerce." Zoning, however, remains\nthe chief regulatory arerl open to the states and\nmany have passed en\' sling legislation for local\nzoning laws and atl.riorized condemnation for\nairport purposes.\nThe FAA is charged with the responsibility\nof developing an airport system for the United\nStates. It does so throuyh a National Airport\nSystems Plan (NASP). Of the approximately\n13,000 landing strips in the country, about 3,040\nare in the NASP. Inclusion of an airport in the\nplan provides it with basic eligibility for\ndevelopment funding, given that all other\nqualifications are met. Development funds are\nderived from the Airport and Airways Trust\nFund created under the 1970 act. The FAA\nreviews the following main requirements as\nconditions to application for development funding: (1) submission of an airport master plan, (2)\nsubmission of cost estimates, (3) information\nregarding the environmental impact of proposed improvements, and (4) a clear indication\ncf the source and availability of matching\nfunds.\nFunds are then allocated on a priority basis\naccording to the then existing policy of the administration. Upon acceptance of funds, the airport must enter into an agreement to construct\nand operate the airport according to the pertinent Technical Standard Orders (TSOs), Adviscry Circulars (ACs), and Federal Aviation\nRegulations FARs) issued by the FAA. Thr\nagreement also required public operation of the\nairport and prohibits discrimination.\nRegardless of whether or not federal funds\nare involved, airports serving certificated carTiers must comply with FAR--Part 139. This\nregulation controls the safety characteristics of\nthe airport and facilities, as well as their day-today operation.\nMost states have passed enabling legislation permitting tneir political cubdivisions to\npromulgate zoning ordinances and !o institute\ncondemnation proceedings for development or\ncontrol purposes. Some states also undertake\nto license airports not controlled by the Federal\ngovernment while others merely license them\nfor commercial or taxing purposes, thereby\navoiding conflict with federal regulations.\nStates usually exert some control on airport development, through the provision of\nmatching funds. In some states, such as Connecticut, the entire state airport system is omrated by the state. In others, the State Avia~\non\nDepartment exercises varying degrees of control over the approval ot requests for federal\nfunds.\n\nLegal lmplicationr of Airport Planning\nand L a d Use\nFew types of transportation facilities\ngenerate more controversy regarding their\ncompatibility with neighboring land uses than\ndo airports. General aviation airports, particularly those accommodating corporate aircraft,\nare no exception. As a community\'s demand for\ngeneral aviation services increases in response\nto its populatior! growth and economic\ndevelo~ment, availability of open space in\nthe\nwhich to construct or operate an airport shrinks\nat an squally rapid rate in response to similar\npressures. As a result, hcrneown.jrs living uncomfortably close to an existing or planned\nfacility frequently resort to the courts for protection from any actual or anticipated encroachments on their right to use and enjoy their property, regardless of who was there first-the\nairport or the property owner. At the same tlme,\nlocal officials typically attempt to devise\nwhatever constitutionally permissible regulations are available to minimize this friction between the airport and its ne~ghbors. It is\nthenfore from these two perspectives-that of\nthe neighboring homeowners and that of the\nmunicipality as a whole-that the airport planner should evaluate the legal implications of\nany land use plan he formulates for a general\naviat~o~\nsirport.\nIdeally, a community p!anning a new airport should acquire sufficient acreage of land\nsurrounding the facility so as to insure that the\n~ s\nairport could In no way interfere w ~ t h t ne~ghboring property owners. By leastng back most\nof this buffer area to various ~ndustr~es ~ t the\n(w h\nnecessary restrict~onson use) it could then\nreduce some of the acquisition costs and provide for future expansion of the airport as well.\nHowever, the initial ifivestment cost alone\nfor\nwould still make this approach ~mpract~cal\nmany communltles. Moreover, any such attempt becomes even more difficult if,as in most\ncases, the airport is already there when the city\nor county finally recognizes the need for\nregulat~ngadjacent land use. If the airport IS\nprivately ow,~ed, local governing board will\nthe\nalsc, lack any author~ty initlate such a plan.\nto\nConsequently, many airports todav-both\nowned-find themselves\npublicly and pr~vately\nof\nin the m~dst time consuming and expenslve\nlegal tangles with their ne~ghbors.\nThrasher v Atlanta 178 G a 862 But See Swefland v Curtrss Atrporls Corp 55 F 26 201\n\n\' Anderson v Souza 38 Cal ;2 825\n\' Reaber v Martfn Theatres of Flortda\n\nlnc\n\n\' Vandcrslfce v Shawn. 26 Del Ch 225\n\n. 52 So\n\n24 682\n\nAlthough actions in common law nuisance\nand trespass seldom succeed, they can\nbecome potent weapons against airports that\nfail to observe proper operating procedures. In\ngeneral, it has been held that, if properly located, constructed, and operated, airports are\nnot a nuisance unless it can be shown that they\nin some significant way endanger the health\nand safety of neighboring citizens. \' Contiguous property owners must yield their privacy to a reasonable degree, so that legitimate\nbusinesses such as airports, which presumably\ncontribute to the general welfare, may opelate\nfor the benefit of all. \' Similarly, the operator of\nan airplane has been held privileged to enter\nthe airspace above land in the possession of\nanother as long as he does so in a "reasonable" manner, at such a height as is in conforlegislative requirements, and without\nmity w ~ t h\ninterfering urireasonably with the possessor\'s\nenjoyment of the surface and the airspace\nabove it. Only when the flights are so low and\nfrequent as to be dangerous to the safety of\nlandowners or as to substantially interfere with\ntheir enjoyment of their property will an injunction issue in a nuisacce or trespass action. \'\nA more serious problem arises, however.\nwhere localities have failed to acquire through\neminent domain the necessary easements for\napproach lanes over property surrounding\npublic airports. Although the ancient docrrine\nof Cujus est solurr est usque ad coelum ("the\nowner of the soil owns to the heavens") is no\nlonger relevant in this moderr -.-2 of air travel.\nand even though the federal Vovernment has\ndeclared itself to be possessed of complete and\nexclusive national sovere~gntyover airspace\nneeded for takecffs and landings (49 USC Sec.\n15081, courts have nevertheless consistently\nhelci that property owners are ent~tled comto\npensation should overflights Interfere substant~ally\nwith the use and enjoyment of the~r\npropl~ r\nerty. Of course, no artif~c~al n e a y be drawn\nto determine at wh~chaltitude an overflight\nbecomes a "taking." since each case depends\nupon the nature of the interference and the kind\nput.\nof use to which the property is be~ng\nIn the lanc\'mark case of United States v.\nCaus:y, 328 U.S. 256 (1946). the Sup:ome Court\nheld that inverse condemnation or taking had\noccurred where low and frequent flights by military a~rcraftover pla~ntiff\'sproperty had\nd~m~nished value ?* d severely limited ~ t s\nits\nutility. The court reached a sim~lardec~s~on\nin\nGriggs v. Alegheny County, 369 U.S. 84 (1962).\nnoting in particular that. in accepting federal\nfunds for the airport, the county had also\n\nagreed to acquire all necessary easements\ntherefor.\nHowever. an ~rcportantdistinction has\narisen, in the federal courts at least, as to those\ncases where an actual physical invasion of the\nairspace over the property in question has occurred and those where the interference did not\ninvolve a direct overflight. Although the former\nmay be compensable as an unconstitutional\ntaking, the latter is frequently considered\nmerely "consequential" damage for which the\nU.S. Constitution provides no remedy Thus, in\nBatten v. U.S., 306 F. 2d 580 (\'962). the circuit\ncourt of appeals denied compensation when\nthe noise, vibration, and smoke that harassed\nresidents was not accompanied by physical invasion by the Air Force jets of the airspace\ndirectly above State courts are spl~ton the\nIssue of whether an overflight is necessary for\ncompensation, but many have now rejected the\ntaking,\'damqes distinction and considzr instead whether the flights are an "unreasmable\nburden" 3n the complaining property owners.\nThere ale also a number of other limitatlcrls to rcove;). for a taking. By definition, of\n;\ncourse, a takir.1 requires puulic ownership o\ncontrol of the alrpoe. Even then. if the market\nvalue of the property has actually increa~cd\nbecausc of the airport\'s proximity. no compen\nsation IS pcrmlssible regardless of tbe noise or\nother annoyances. \' Oependlng on the relevant\nstature of limitations. failure to contest an\nencroachment can cause the easement to ripen\ninto a prescriptive right. In some instances.\nsubsequent buyers . d i n purchase with notice of\nthe adjoinirtg irlrport and its flight patterns may\nbe held !o have azsumed the risk of noic;. and\nother damage when they purchased their land.\nFlnally, co~;rts reluctant to grant ccmpens&are\nt ~ o nwithout a showing of substantial InterTerence with ti IF! use and enjoyment of the property.

Conceptually, zonirlg seeks to segregate incompatible uses into\ntheir own largely homogenous districts,\nthereby eliminating the friction between certain\nusers of land. protecting the health and safety\nof the general public, and insuring orderly\ngrowth and development of the community. Yet\nthe effectiveness of zoning depends entirely on\nthe forethought of the original planners and the\nwillingness of administrative officials to strictly\nenforce the provisions of the ordinance. The\ncheckered histor;. of raning in most states indicates that it has been. in many instances, a less\nthan successful method r i land use control.\nHowever, zoning still rer,ains one of the best\ntools available today for balancing the rights of\nindividual property owners with the interests of\ntbe community in orderly land development.\nOne of the in~tial\nsteps both in locating the\nalrport and zonlng the area around it is determining the types of use that would be compatlble with ~ t s\noperatian. Schools. hospitals. and\nresidences appear the least desirable, whereas\nopen space, agriculture. recreation. and commercial and industrial development represent\n,he mcst likely possibilltles. Once having identlfied the proper uses. the task then becomes to\ndevlse a large enough buffer zone, particularly\nunder the approaol lanes. so as to exclude ali\nbut these enumerated uses.

Other communities, for example, may hwe statutory\nauthority tc condemn land within tha~r\nneighbor\'s boundaries for use as an airport\nregardless of any prohibition in the latter\'s zoning ordinance. In regard to excluding private\nairports. the test of validity developed by the\ncourts IS simply whether the prohibition has a\nreasonable relation to the health, morals, and\ngeneral welfare of the community in light of the\nexisting uses and characteristics of land in :he\nvarious districts into which it has been zoned,\nwith reasonable forethought for its future\ndevelopment. Using this srandard, a number\nof courts have found insufficient justification\nfor the exclusion in some ordinances of privately owned airports.22\nMoratoria on devel-op\nment in general have encountered similar problems, although temporary restrictions necassary to give the milncipality time to pravlde\nsewer and other facilities have been upheld in\nSome circumstance^.^^\nAlthough obviously no panacea for the\nmany land use problems involved wi!h alrport\ndevelopment, zoning can nevertheless be an\neffestive regulatory tooi once its areas of\nusefulness eve recognized and its constitutlonal and practical limitations carefully delineated Moreover, although not determinative of\nthe issue, zoning classifications do Influence\ncourts in resolving nuisance and other private\nactions by landowners against airport operators. Of course, previously existing nonconforrnir .q uses and the necessity of variances will\nalways disrupt the uniformity zoning seeks to\npromots. but they need not undern;ire the over-\n\nall scheme. For it is only through comprehensive planning that a general aviation airport and\nits neighbors can peacefully coexist.\n\nAir Agencies\nAir agencies are subject to federal\neconomic control through the CAB and safety\nand operation control through the FAA Air carriers engaged in interstate commerce as common carriers usually require a Certificate of\nConventence and Necessity which is issued by\nthe CAB. In addition, all carriers are reql~ired\nto\nobtain operating certificates from the FAA. The\nnames of those certificates vary according to\nthe function authorized. Some common carriers\nare exempt from CAB certification, and would\nthus fall in the general aviation category.\nSome air agency certificates ralate to\nground operations only. Examples are ground\nschools, aircraft maintenance stations, service\nand repair stations, and others. Each must meet\ncertain minimum requirements in equipment,\npersonnel. and general facilities.\nMost prominent are the air-agencies involved irl transporting "persons or property. . .\nfor compnsation or hire,\'\' and further, !hose\ndesignated as air carriers which meet the\nfurther distinction "as a common carrier." all\ndefined in the Federal Aviation Act of 1958.\nThe classifications are somewhat complex\nand in some ins.ances overlapping. but are also\nexacting for the purpose of regulatory jurisdiction. Figure 2-2 summarizes the characteristics\nof the different types of aviation activities discussed below.\nInternational, domesrc trunk, and local\nservice air carriers are similar and overlappir~g\nin regulatory characteristics. The main distinction is in their area of service. International carriers obviously function across international\nboundaries; domestic trunk carriers serve\nroute.. genaralfy within the U.S. with average\nstage lengths of between 700 and 900 miles\n(797 miles in 1973). Most domestic trunk carriers also coriduct internationsl operations.\nLocal service carriers operate over routes of\naverage stage length of between 250 and 350\nmiles (303 miles in 1973). 2\' These three types of\nair carriers are regulated by the CAB which: (1)\nissues certificates of public convenience and\nnecessi\'y; (2) designates routes to be served;\n(3) designates type of sewlce authorized; (4)\nsets ratzs and fares to be charged; (51 ieqbires\nextensive statistical and financ~al\nrepc.r;s; and\n(6) looks dfter the financial well-being of\n-\n\n" Air Transpori :974.

The FAA regulates every phase of\nair carrier operation through the use of app r ~ v e dmanuals and extensive operating\nregulations. Regulations, manuals, and operation specifications prescribe departmental\norganizations; allocation of responsibility;\naircraft and equipment; maintenance organization and procedures; flight operations, training\nand proficiency check procedures; as well as\nmany other details relating directly or indirectly\nto safety.\nSuppkmental air carriers provide supptemental seats during peak demand periods.\nThey are limited, in that they may solicit affinity\ngroups or tour charters only, and may not operate on a scheduled basis W e e n points.\nAll Cargo carriers may operate as\nscheduled or non-scheduledand may "hold out\nto the public" for cargo carrying purposes only.\nThev *cay. with special authorization, carry\nlim\'t r ssengers on a charter basis. In coni\ntrast. iommercial Operators o Large Arcraft\nmay not hold out to the public at all. They operats oy contract only and with a limited namber\nof different users. If the number of users\nbecomes sufficiently high (9 or 10). they are\ndeemed to be holding out to the public and required to obtain a supplemental carrier\'s certificate.\nSchedule4 carriers. supplernentals. all\ncargo and commercinl operators operate under\nthe appropriate sections of Part 121 of the\nFARs. They all operate, or are authorized to\noperate, a~rcrafthaving certificated gross\ntakeoff weight in excess of 12.500 pounds.\nAir Taxi and Commercial Operators of\nSmall Aircraft (ATCO) are considered to be\ncarriers engaged in air transportation when\npenormlng air taxi services, but are deemed to\nbe merely engaged in air commerce when acting as a small commercial operator involved In\ncontrac\' flying. The two types of service were\ncombined in one csrtificate for convenience.\nsince they are both exempt from certification by\nthe CAB under section 298 of the Board\'s\neconomic regulations. The exemption is pledicated on their use of small aircraft. on the theory that their possible Impact on interstate commerce is limited, and thus does not, at this time,\nrequire re~ulation the public interest.\nin\nfor cortiparison purposes anscheduled air\ntaxis Carl best be compared to supplementa!\n\n.\n\n-\n\nL\nU\n\nQ)\n\ns\n\'\n3:\n\nL\n\ns\n\nZ E\nU\n\nx\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nO\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nO\n\nX\n\nX\n\nO\n\nO\n\nO\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\n..\n\nX\n\ncarriers, while wheduled air taxi operators\nknown as "commuters" are similar to the\nscheduled air carriers.

Exemptions\nb-sently cover all operators using aircraft with\na maximum certificated gross weight of 12.500\npounds or a carrying capacity of 30 passengers\nor less with a gross payload not exceeding\n7.500 pounds. The Board has indicated a\nlimited i;lclination to grant waivers to permit\nA T m s to operate aircraft in excess of these\nlimi!ations upon the presentation of proper evidence showing public need and convenience;\nATCOs operate under the regulations contained in Part 135 of the FARs, under close\nsupervision of FAA inspectors. as do the large\ncarriers under Part 121.\n\nHelicopter Operators have been involved\nin all phases of the above air agency descriptions with the exception of trunk line operations. Their certificates and regulations (Part\n127) differ with respect only to givirig proper\nacknowledgement of the unique char:~cteristics\nof rotary-wing aircraft.\n1n:rastate Air Carriers do not !all within the\njurisdtciion of the CAB since they are not, by\ndefinition, engaged directly in interstate air\ntransportation. They are, however, indirectly\nengaged in interstate air transportation by\ncarrying goods and persons who are in the\ncourse of interstate commerce, in prssumably\nsifficient volume to justify CAB regulation, if\nthe Board chooses to do so. These carriers\noperate large aircraft as the certificatedcarriers\ndo. For the most part, the states have attempted\nto fill this regulatory void through the regulation of intrastate carriers by state public utilities\ncommission or other equivalent agencies.\nSome states are ako attempting 10 regulate\nscheduled air taxi 3perators on the grounds\nhas\nthat a regulatory vo~d been created by the\nCAB.\nWhether or not the courts will decree the\nexemption process implemented by the CAB to\nbe a sufficient abdication of its regulatory\nresponsibility to leave a void justifying state intervention is still to be seen. Preliminary court\ndecisions seem to indicate a tendency to\npreserve federal control. The fact that the\nfederal government elected to grant exemptions is construed to be an affirmative assertion\nof its control in that area of interstate air\ntransportation. The courts are likely to recognize this posture in view of its long-stqnding\nunchallenged acceptance.\nThere are currently no attempts or, the part\nof local governments to regulate interstate or\n\nintrzstate air transportation.\n\nAirworthiness\nQesponaibility for assuring the airworthiness of aircraft and their components is\nassumed by the federal government on the\ntheory that aircraft are instruments of interstate\ncommerce. As with airmen and agencies, the\nresponsibility is discharged by writing regulations setting minimum safety standards for the\ncharacteristics of the product, prescribing certification requirements and procedures, and\nsetting limits on operations.\nIn figure 2-1 the Federal Aviation Regulations bearing directly on the characteristics of\n5\nthe product are Parts 23 through 3 .known colRegulations; Part\nlectively as the Airworth~ness\n36. concerning noise; Part 37, concerning certain components; and, Part 39, concerning\nmandatory actions to increase specific product\nairworthiness. Parts 91 through 135 cover certification andlor operations, and Part 21 sets\nforth the procedures for certification. Parts 91,\n121, and 135 influence the design characteristics of aircraft. as well as operations.\n\nPhilosophy\nThe Federal Aviation Administration IS\ncharged with promoting the safety of aviation.\nThe following zre the gersral concepts observed explicitly or implicitly in writing regulations which help discharge their responsibility\nin regard to airworthiness:\n(1) The FAA takes no view of "mission\nperformance." The top speed, range, and carrying capacity can be anything the airframe\nmanufacturer chooses. the takeoff and landing\nfield length requiremeqts can be selected by\nthe mmuracturer, and so on.\n(2) Certain items of performance,\nhowever, do impinge directly on the safety of\nfl\'ght. For these items the Administrator will set\nwhat are considered to be minimum safe\neither\nvalues, writing these into the reg~lations,\nas definite ncnbers or as algebraic expressions utilizing parameters whlch are themselves set by the manufacturer, are prescribed,\nor are representative of an observable or\nidealized environmeqt.\n(3) As far as is practicable, the FAA sets\nstandards on what an airplane muat do, rather\nthan on what it is. An airplane when stalled\nmust pitch down, for example, and within certain limits it is known how to configure it so that\nit will do so. The FAA will not prescribe the configuration, but contents itwif by Implying that a\nfull stall is characterized by uncontrollable\npitch down.\n\n(4) On the other hand, prior art is recognized as having given the airplane certain\ndefinitive configuration and pertormance\ncharacteristics-it has wings. a tail, one of a\nsmall number of engine types, and so on; the\ncockpit controls and instrumentation are all of\nfamiliar sorts. When in order to set a standard of\nsafety it is necessary to refer to such items, the\nFAA does not hesitate to do so. It prescribes the\nlocation of the primary flight instruments on the\npanel. the shapes of some of the control knobs.\nthe positions, angles of visibility, and color and\nbrightness of the red, green, and white position\nlights, and so on.\n(5) Maintenance of an acceptable level of\nsafety demands that the entire process of\nfabrication be monitored and controlled. The\nregulations, therefore, cover every aspect from\nthe properties of materials chosen through to\nthe manufacturer\'s production certificate and\nthe certificates held by the opewtor and his individual employees.\n(6; The regulations are the product of\nmany years of experiences which have served\nto indicate what an airplane should (and should\nnot) do and be to be safe. To assure that those\nexperiences are utilized, the regulations are\nupdated continually.\n(7) The regulat\'ons are intended to be as\nexplicit zT possible. The words "each" and\n"mua" appear time after time to insure that the\nmanufacturer has no doubt about t-,e extent\nand degree of his responsibility.\n(8) There\nan implicit recognition.\nhowever, cf the fact that there are limits to what\ncan be done and still keep the airplane a viable\ntransportation device. The rsgulations surrounding the structur?l design for example, do\nnot prescribe the high safety factors often seen\nin the design of ground structures. Instead, the\nloads to De applied to the structure in the\ncourse of normal flying are estimated as accurately as can be done, and the structural\ncomponents are designed to resist these loads\nwhile developing almost the highest stresses\nthey can without failing, thus producing an\nairframe of minimum weight.\n(9) There is also an implicit assumption\nthat knowledge of the degree of risk somehow\npermits that degree to be higher. The argument\ngoes that passengers on an air-carrier airplane\ndeserve greater protection than do those of a\ngeneral aviation airplane. since the transport\npassengers presumably are unable to assess\nthe risk thzy are assuming when they board,\nwhile the general aviation passengers somehow\nare able to do so. The logic of this is elusive and\n\nthere may be other "public interest" type points\nin support to be made instead, but the fact remains that the provisions of Part 25 are more\ndetailed than those of Pa* 23.\nContent\nThe Federal Airworthiness Regulations\nplace definite technological constraints on\nwhat the manufacturers do. Below, for illustration, is a condensed outline of the contents of\nPart 25; other airworthiness regulations are\nsimilar:\nSubpart A - General\nSubpart 6 - Flight\nPerformance\nStability, Control. Trim and\nStalls\nGround an6 Water Handling\nCharacteristics\nSubpart C Structure\nFlight, Ground and Water\nLoads\nFatigue Evaluatior!\nLightning Protection\nSubpart D - Design and Construction\nSystems. Control Surfaces.\nLanding Gear\nAccommodations\nEnvironmental\nEmergency, Fire Protection\nSubpart E - Powerplant\nFuel, Oil, Cooling, Reduction and Exhaust Systems\nControls and Accessories\nFire Protection\nSubpart F Equipment\nInstruments\nLights\nSa\'ety\nMiscellaneous\nSubpart G Operating Limitations and\nInformation\nLimitations\nMarking and Placards\nAirplane Flight Manual\nAppendices\nCertification of Aircraft and Components\nThe following means of obtaining a~proval\nfor aeronautical equipment exist:\n(1) Type Certificate: airframe, its engine,\nand its propeller are Type Certificated.\n(2) Technical Standard Order: A component which has been "TSO\'d" may be installed\non any airplane for which it is suited, without\nseparate approval.\n(3) Approval: A new component may be\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\ntested and approved for instaliation an a new\nairplane receiving its Type Certificate. This\nmeets the regulatory requirement for the\naircraft that certain items of its equipment be\n"approved." Howevor, unless the component is\nsubsequently "TSO\'d" it is not in general eligible for use on another airplane, since in theory\nit is part of the airplane that was Type Certificated.\nChanging Airworthiness Regulations\nThere are three means by which Airworthiness regulations may be augmented, altered, or\nadapted to specific occasions:\n(1) Amedments are actual changes in\nthe body of the regulations. They are typically\npromulgated by the FAA itself in response to\nwhat appears to be a need being experierlced\nby the entire manufacturing industry. The FAA\nfollows the standard procedure In fvhich\nNotices of Proposed Rille Making ("NPRM\'s")\nare published in the Federal Register (somstimes "Advance NPRM\'s" are circulated), co:respondence invited, and a date and place for\npublic hearings set. Anyoqe interested can reti?\nspond, b u ~ practice those who do so are\nmostly the manufacturers who will be affected\nby the proposed 9tange. At the close of the\nhearings the FAA sets forth, again in the\nFederal Register, a summary of the comments\nreceived, FAA\'s conclusions with regard to\nthem, and the exact wording of the regulatory\nchange. The subscribers to the applicable\nregulation receive Notices of Amendment, with\npublication and effectiveness dates, plus\nrevised pages for the regulation itse:f. The\nNotlce of Amsndment again summarizes the\nreasons \'?r it and !rle industry response, for\nbackground reference.\n(2) Special Regulations are similar to\nAmendments in general handling, but do not\naffect the basic Airworthiness regulations since\ntheir applicability is limited. For example. CAR\n4 (the predecessor of FAR Part 25) was ~ound\nto\nbe inadequate in dealing with the determination\nof the takeoff field length requirements of turbine airplanes. Special regulations were\ntherefore written.\n(3) Special Conditions are a concession\nto the f ~ cthat manufacturers will (contrary to\nt\nsome ycople\'s opinions) pustl the frontiers of\nthe design art forward. and will produce\ndeslgns of t\\lpes with which the existing regulations slmply cannot deal. Nevertheless the FAA\nmust in some way approve the safety of a new\nproduct by amending the basic regulation for\nthat product only.\nSpecial conditions are established through\n\na series of arguments between the manufacturer\'s representatives and those of tire responsible FAA Regional office, and frequently those\nof the FAA in Washington. Proposals are made\nby both sides and discussed in committees. The\nresult is usually a compromise of some sort,\nbecause in the last analysis the FAA will not\nregulate the new type out of existence since the\nmanufacturer has legal recourse.\nThe basic regulations can also be\n"clarified" by the issuance of Advisory Circulars. The Advisory Circulars can be commentaries on anything at all, but when used for this\npurpose they will specify what tests or criteria\ncan be applisd to meet the provisions of the\nbasic regulation. The typical language is:\n"This circu!ar sets forth a means, but\nno! the only means, whereby comFAR 25 Par. 25.xxx may\npliance w~th\nbe demonstrated.\'\'\nSince the manufacturer desires clarity in\nthe regulations with which he must comply, he\nis very likely to standardize on what is set forth\nin the Circular, thereby in effect (though not in\nlaw) making it a part of the regulation.\n\nDemonstrating Compliance\nUnlike criminal law, wherein the burden of\nprocf is on the accuser, in many regulatory\nareas the burden is on the manufacturer actively to demonstrate his compliance with the\nprovisions of the regulations. This applies to\nthe Federal Aviation Regulations, and in airworthiness work it is reasonable and economical\nof time and effort. The manufacturer developing\na new type airplane is assumed normally to\nhave the facilities and equipment for\ndemonstrating the airworthiness of his product.\nThe FAA in t u ~ n relieved of the necessity of\nis\nspending public m o n q for large amounts of\ncomplex equipment. aitk2:lgh it does h a ~ e\nsomesmall items such as phototheodolites\nand trailing airspeed bombs-which it will lend\nor bail to the manufacturer.\nThe process of demonstrating compliance\nis conti~lual throuqhout the development\nprogram. The evidence that the demonstrations\nhave been made !akes the forms of:\n(1) Drawings of the aircraft and its parts, a\ncomplete set of which must be submitted to the\nFAA Regional Office. The demonstration\nairplanes, or components therecf which aie\nused to demonstrate compliance, must be certificated by the manufacturer to be "in comformity with the type design" of which the drawings are representations.\n(2) Reports of analyses and tests. An ex-\n\nanple of analytical reports is the "Basic\nLoads" report, which sets forth the computations of the external aerodynamic, ground and\nwater loads generated on the aircraft in operation. A typical tsst report is that of a structural\ntest of a component. Conformity statements\nmust be written for each tested component, and\nall analyses and tests must be witnessed and\nsigned by a representative of the FAA.\nIn mbst cases the means of demonstrating\ncompliznce are well known and used countrywide. 1;i cases where they are not, they must be\ndecided by negotiation, which the manufacturer initiates by writing proposals for the\ndemonstra!ion methods.\nAirworthiness Directives\nThe FAA keeps watch over the condition of\nindividual aircraft of every type. It can extract\nportions of aircraft log books to show where additional inspections, modifications or parts\nreplacements need to be made because of inadequacies in design which can be shown only\nwhen the type aircraft has been in operation\nand developed "bugsu--cracks in structure,\npossibilities for faulty system operation, frequent system failures. The manufacturer keeps\nwatch too, through his Customer Service\nDepartment, and whenever such a defect appears. an evaluation is made of the various\nmeans of eliminating it. This results in the issuance of Service Bulletins\'inviting the owners\nto take action, sometimes accompanied by\nr~trofit to help with the job.\nkits\nAs long as the manufacturer keeps ahead\nof the situation the FAA will take no action. If he\ndoes not in any particular case, the FAA will\nissue an Airworthiness Directive (AD) which\nprescribes the action to be taken, gives the\nconstructor numbers of the affected aircraft.\nand sets the deadline for accomplishment i f applicable. An AD can prescribe anything irom\nmore frequent inspect~onsto grcunding the\nof\ntype until the prov~sions the AD are complied\nwith. Manufacturers are typically alert to and\nanxious about defects which may lead to AD\'S,\nespecially on airplanes in current or recent production. and are usually reasonably quick to\nforestall an issuance by publishing servlce\nbulletins. sending out retrofit kits. and issuing\neng~neering\nchanges for production. The FAA\nknows thls, and in any case which can result in\nan AD. it informs the manufacturer ahead of\ntime in order to allow him to take action on his\nown. This system ma/ sound too permissive.\nbut Ir. practice it work:; well. though of course.\nnot perfectly The rarity ol aircraft acc~dents\ndue to hardware fa~lure\nattests to this.\n\nLegal Status of Regulations\nUntil a very few years ago, the issuance of\nthe aircraft type certificate, manufacturer\'s production certificate. and airworthiness certificates for individual airplanes was sufficient to\nlay to rest any questions of airworthiness arising from incidents or accidents. However, recent product liability cases are destroying the\nprotection afforded by the regulative structure,\nin a few cases revealing unsuspected flaws.\nContributory negligence of the operator is no\nlonger a defense for the manufacturer, nor is\nthe existence of type certificate, current airworthiness certificate, or any other documentary evidence. "Reasonable care" in design or\nmanufacture is collapsing. and the "implied\nguarantee" of the manufacturer in marketing\nthe aircraft is interpreted quite all-inclusively.\nAn illustrativecase (rather an extreme one)\nis that in which a twin-engined airplane\nsuffered an engine stoppage on takeoff, after\nhaving made a high-speedtaxiing turn onto the\nactive runway. It was shown by tests that if the\nspeed were high enough and the turn short\nenough the fuel line from a tank would unport.\ncausing a loss of fuel supply and subsequent\nengine stoppage. High speed turns onto the\nrunway just prior to takeoff are considered\nfoolhardy by the aviation community and are\nnot generally practiced; the certification procedures normally do not contain tests of this\nnature, and the manufacturer had performed\nnone. This did not protect the manufacturer.\nhowever.\nThe tl.end of such cases is to put on the\nmanufacturer the burden of making his product\nboth airworthy and foolproof. Since there is a\nlarge, if not limitlsss, nurrbei o! ways to get in\ntrouble witn an airplane, as well as to attack the\ncredibility of the manufacturer in court, these\nsuits are becoming a burden to\nproduct liab~lity\nwill\nmanufacturers, and the eventuai 6\' C ~ S be\nto make the process of aircraft development\nslow and overexpensive, and the price of the\nproduct everl higher than it is now.\n\nOperation\nUnited States civil a~rcraft\noperated w~thin\nthe bordew of the country, and air carriers\noperated botn within the Ghited States and in\n,\n:\ninternational commerce, da s under the provisions of the General Operating and Flight Rules\n(FAR Part 91) or the Certification an3 Operations reyulations for air carriers and commercial operators of large aircraft (FAR Part 12:)\nAir Taxi operators are under a separate regulaon (FAR Part 135).\n\nPart 91 has no material pertaining to certification. The sections dealing with operations,\nhowever, have much in common. To display\nboth the certification and the operation content,\nthe topics dealt with in FAR 121 are presented\nbelow in condensed form:\nSubpart A General\nSubparts 6, C, D Certification Rules for\nAir Carriers\nSubparts E, F Approval of Routes\nSubpart G Manual Requirements\nSubpart H Aircraft Requirements\nAirplane Performance\nSubpart I\nOperating Limitations\nTakeoff\nWeight\nEn route\nDestination\nSubparts J.

The Airworthiness regulations are the\ndevice by which tha FAA seeks to insure safety\nin design and constructicn. However, the FAA\nalso seeks to insure safety in operations, and to\nthis end they write !he Certificationand Operating Regulations. These have their impact on\naircraft design (particularly or! trle design of\nlarge commercial aircrr~ft) in the following\nways:\n\n(1) A certificatea air carrier cannot operate his aircraft unless he carrias on board certain items which are not items of required\n\nequipment in the airworthiness regulations. For\nexamole, a manufacturer can certificate an\nairplane without supplemental oxygen equipment under Part 25, and that Part will tell him\nwhat the tecnnical requirements for a supplemental oxygen system are. But the actual requirement for such a system is spelled out\nunder Part 121.\n(2) The Airworthiness Regulations are\nnot concerned with the range of the aircraft, so\nthey make no statement about total fuel\ncapacity. But the operating rules are concerned with it, and the concern is expressed as\na fuel requirement in this typical form (91.23):\nNo person may operate a civil aircraft in\nIFR conditions unless it carries enough\nfuel. . .to:\n(a) complete the flight to the first airport\nof intended landing;\n(b) fly from that airport to the alternate\nairport; and,\n(c) fly thereafter for 45 minutes at normal cruising speed.\n(Some qualifying statements follow the\nstatement above.)\n(3) Part 91, i n a section for large\nairplanes, and Part 121, prescribe the composition of the flight crew.\n(4) Part 121 makes provisions for limiting\nthe weight of an aircraft at takeoff and landing.\nThe provision for landing dates that no person\nshall take off an airplane, ifits weight on arrival\nat its destination will be more than the weight\nallow in^ it to stop within the first 60 percent of\nthe runway. The takeoff weight provisions are\nmore complicated.\nThe effect of these rules is simply that the\nmanufacturer looks in both directions when\ngenerating a new design. !Vhen the provisions\nof both regulations impact in the same area,\nsuch as those for takeoff, the manufacturer includes in the Airplane Flight Manual-an airworthiness document-such operating informatirn as will enable the pilot to comply with\nboth regulations simultaneously. The so-called\nFAR takeoff field length charts (which are actually weight-limit determination means) are\nexamples of the technique.\nThe fuel reserve provision and the equipment provision are met by establishing the\nairplane weight and fuel capacity at which the\ndesired range may be ~rret,considering the\nreserves and extra equipment as dead weight.\nThe same is done with the flight crew requirements: the additic? of a flight attendant requirement simply increases the weight and seating\ncapacity of the airplane.\n\nComment\nSome persons have been critical of the Airworthiness regulations from the viewpoint that\nthey stifle the design proceLs. They cite the 61\nknot stalling speed of Part 23 as a prime illustration, and perhaps go on to other things,\nsuch as the requirement that an airplane pitch\ndown when it stalls, and so forth.\nIt should be pointed out in this record that\nthere are two means of "bending" the regulations to accommodate advanced designs: (1)\nSpecial Conditions and (2) Demonstrations of\n"Equivalent Safety." When a manufacturer\nfeels that his product cannot meet a provision\nof the regulations as written, he may demonstrate that the airplane is just as safe with what\nit can do. Equivalent safety demonstrations can\nbe expensive and long-drawn out, because\nsafety levels are hard to rank-order.\nIt should be remembered that regulations\nare the equivalent of case law-they reflect\nwhat has been done wrong in the past. Since\nthe future pres.lmably will be different and the\nmistakes different, the regulations can apply\nonly to present art-not to future art. If airplanes\nare always built within the regulations, they will\nalways be built within the present art or very\nof\nminor extensi~ns it. But the art as actually\npracticed will progress in some direction, and\nthe future will generate its own regulations responding to what is done wrong then. Meanwhiie the present regulations prevent us from\nrepeating our past mistakes, and the means of\nbending them to the demands of the future are\ntliere.\n\nPilot Qualifications\nand Certification\nThe Federal Aviation Act of 1958 placed\nthe responsibility of certifying pilots, airplanes,\nflight schools, ground personnel, etc., with the\nFederal Aviation Administration. The FAA\nmeets this responsibility by establishing and\npublishing the requirements for certification in\na series of directives or mandates called\nFederal Aviation Regulations (FARs) which are\nrevised and updated from time to time. The FAA\nalso issues licenses to individuals, the basic\nauthorizations to fly an airplane.\nTwo sections oi the Federal Aviation\nRegulations (Part 61 and Part 141) deal with the\nrequirements for certification of pilots. A person ?:!empting to qualify for a private pilot\'s\ncertification may do so by satisfying either set\nof requirements. Part 141 deals with the kind of\ntraining received when a student is enrolled in\nflight school while Part 61 deals with\na cert~fied\n\nthe kind of traini;rg received when a student is\nplaced in the hands of an individual certified\nflight instructor.\nFlight certifications are issued at 5 levels:\n(1) student, (2) private, (3) commercial !required\nof any pilot who receives compensation for flying), (4) airline transport. and (5) flight instructor.\nSince the bulk of the nation\'s general avialion fliers are either students, or hold private or\ncommercial licenses, this discussion will be\nlimited to those certificate levels.\nWithin dach certificate level there are three\ndiffereni kinds of ratings which an individual\nmust receive in order to fly. For a student, ratings are added by his flight instructor, while\nholders of Private and Commercial certificates\nhave ratings added by the FAA or by the FAA\'s\ndesignated examiner. The three kinds of ratings are: (a) category ratings, (b) class ratings,\nand (c) type ratings.\nA category rating deals with the kind of\naircraft and is for either: (1) lighter than air\n(balloons), (2) gliders, (3) airplanes, or (4)\nrotorcraft (helicopters).\nWithin the category rating "Airplanes"\n(above) there are four class ratings: (1) single\nengine, land planes: (2) single engine.\nseaplanes; (3) multi-engine, land planes; and\n(4) multi-engine, seaplat-,as.\nType ratings apply to any turbo-jet\npowered aircraft and to all airplanes over\n12,500 pounds takeoff weight. An individual\nwishing to fly a light jet airplane or a plane\nheavier than 12,500 pounds must have a rating\nfor that particular aircraft; however, a person\nwho wishes to fly any model of light plane may\ndo so with a private pilot\'s license provided he\nhaye proper class and category ratings described above and that he flies alone. To carry\npassengers, the regulations become more demanding; he must have made 3 takeoffs and\nlandings within the last 90 days.\nIn addition to the above ratings, there is a\nspecial rating which must be azhieved to fly on\ninstruments. Table 11-1 sets out age. medical.\nknowledge, skills, and experience requirements for a private pilot\'s certificats t s designated by FARs of October 1, 1974. In p,;lctica,\nthe average student obtaining a priva?,~\npilot\nlicense under FAR 61 receives about 65 total\nflight hours extended over a period of approximately one year while the student certifying\nunder FAR 141 in a concentrated study at a\nflight school usually totals about 55 hours flying time in a shorter time.\n\n-\n\nTABLE I I\n1\nFEDERAL AVIATION REGULATIONS FOR CERTIFICATION AS A\nPRNATE PILOT, AIRPLANE CATEGORY1\nMinimum Age\n\n17 years old\n\nMedical Examination\n\nminimum: 3rd class medical certificate\n1.

For example,\nprivate pilots are required to have physical examinations every 2 years, commercial pilots every yea,, and airline transport pilots every 6\nmonths.\nFAR 91 deals with operating rules. In theory, a pilot\'s certificate may be removed for\nviolatian of these regulations or with violation\nof tho certification rules in Part 61. Because the\nhighest priority of the FAA revolves around\n\ncommercial flight operations, FAA observers\nare spread out too thin in practice to moaitor\nthe bulk of private pilot behavior.Thus, the FAA\nis a relatively weak enforcer i~ general aviation.\nMost monitoring is done by the pilots themselves and peer pressure is an effective enforcer. When a violation is reported to the FAA,\nthat agency usually writ+s to the pilot involved\nstating that he may have been in violation and\nasking for his statement. The pilot may support\nhis behavior or he may confess to the violation\nand surrender his pilot\'s certification for\nsuspension up to one year. Commercial pilots\n\nfound in violation of FAR regulations are frequently given civil penalities such as fines.\n\nAIRPORT ADMINISTRATION\nAND FINANCE\nIntroduction\nAirport administration and finance are\nhighly interdependent.The governmental level\nof the sponsor of the airport, e.g., federal, state,\nor local, bean heavily on both the structure of\nthe administration and the financing\npossibilities of airports. The two subjects will\nbe treatad separately below, but with necessary\ncross referencing.\nMan] airpcrts in the United States grew\nfrom grass strips, privately owned, on what was\nthen the edge of town. Population growth\nbrought traffic, revenue, and increased local\ndemand for airport facilities. This demand was\noriginally based as much on civic pride as on\neconomic feasibility. The airport was considered to be a governmental function, and not\nexpected to break-even and certainly not make\na profit. Local citizens in the communities with\nsufficient wealth voted approval of bond issues\nto origina!e and improve small airports.\nSome communities, not so well endowed,\ncame intc a windfall when the Surplus Airports\nAct authorized the transfer of World War II military training fields to local communities. Many\nwhich would not otherwise have been able to\nafford an airport suddenly owned me. Assisted\nto some extent by the airport, the loss sustained\nin operations was minimized and the local\ntaxes made up the difference.\nThe depression, although it set all development back to a large extent. provided another\nw~ndfallto p~;blic airports through the Works\nProject Administration (WPA). This "make\nwork" program expended millions of dollars on\nairport improvenlent and construction.\nThe Federal Airport Act of 1546 authorized\nexpenditure of up to $100 million anfiually over\nseven years on eligible projects at local airports. This Act was replacea with the more extensive Airport and Airways Development Act of\n1970, providing considerably more funds and\neas~ngthe financial problems of airports to\nsnme extent.\n\nAdministration\nThe classification of airports by function\nwas discussed in the previous chapter. The administrative structure of an airport is, however,\nmore dependent on its size than it is on its func-\n\ntion. Thus, a small air carrier airport may have a\nsimilar administrative structure and the same\nnumber of employees as does a large general\n- aviation airpoi, ifthey both have approximately\nthe same number of operations. An airport\'s\nlsvel of activity seems also to be related to the\nlevel of government owning and operating the\nfacility. The higher the level of government, the\nlarger the airport tends to be.\n\nOwners and Sponsors\nInasmuch as the size of an airport determines the governmental level of sponsorship,\nthe size of the political subdivision may also be\na significant factor limiting the size of the airport. This is especially true since capital expenditures for improvements are limited by the total\nassessed valuation of the taxing authority involved. However, airports are frequently owned\nby towns located near large metropolitan areas\nand may draw substantial traffic from the\npopulation hub. Such airports may generate\nsufficient surplus funds to support capital improvements independent of tax support. It is\nthus difficult to generalize a relationship between the sizes of airports and the political subdivisions they serve.\nMany cities own and sponsor airports,\nwhich are thus financially supported by public\nfunds raised mainly !hrough property taxes.\nThis may frequently lead to problems of conflict\nof opinion as to need for airport improvements.\nI n large cities, such as Baltimore or\nPhiladelphia, where the more affluent have\nmoved to the suburbs, the remaining population may see little need for frequent use of cn\nairport. In fact some may never expect to see it,\nand therefore alrite naturallv are not interested\nin approving c i h bond issues to support airport\nimprovements. In some instances this has led\nto state ownership of the airpcits. State ownership, as it now exists in Baltimore and has existed in Connecticut for some time, has the advaqtage of spreading the tax investment over a\nmuch larger base. It also enhances the probability of obtaining matching funds to qualify\nfor federal grants for airport impro vements.\nAside from the question of desirability,\nlocally owned airports are usually operated by\nlocally oriented political bodies such as town\nboards, city councils, and boards of supervisors. Frequently the airport serves a much\nlarger community and airport needs are not\nnecessarily consistent with the desires of the\ncitizens of the community in which it is located.\nIn fact, quite frequently the opposite is trueeveryone wants the airport in someorte else\'s\nbackyard. Since the local governing body will\n\nbe depe~dent local support, it may be more\non\nresponsive to the local sympathies than to the\nneeds for airport improvemerit. If, on the other\nhand, the airport is owned by the state, the state\nrepresentatives from the local airport community may oppose or support improvements\naccording to the dictates of the local electorate.\nThis could occur without adequate consideration of whether or not the improvement is\nneeded for the benefit of the larger community\nor the entire state. The opposite might also\nmay not\nhold, and a diversified state leg~slature\nbe responsive to local airport needs. State\naeronautics departments usually tend to support airport development and keep the\nlegislature appropriately informed to assure\nproper attention to the overall state airport\nsystem.\nWhere an airport\'s community of interest\nextends over several political subdivisions,\neach subdivision may have its say in the airport\noperation through 3n independent authority as\nexpressed by its representatives who are appointed to the airport board. The authority may\nown t1.e airport or merely operate it. It may also\nhave t~axingauthority for airport development\npurposes, sometimes with limited time spans\nand almost always with a ceiling placed on the\npercentage of total assessed valuations. The\nauthority may also enjoy political independence, as is the case with state operared airports. This may result in its becoming insensitive to the desires cf the local community.\nThis code of sponsorship is frequently\ndesirable from the tenants\' point of view,\nespecially since the total revenue is retained by\nthe authority and generally expended for airport\npurposes only. While some of these revenues\nmay be spent on such facilities as roads.\nbridges, subways, or even office buildings, this\nis often preferred to the possible loss of\nrevenue to the general funds of a city\'s, town\'s.\ncounty\'s, or state\'s. At most airports operated\nby municipal or county governments all airport\nrevsnuss must by law be paid to the general\ngovernment fund, and thus made available for\nby\nappropriation for non-airport functio~~s the\nlocal governing body. This often tends to frustrate efforts at airport improvements.\nThe determination of who will operate zn\n\' funcairport is dependent on both its size\ntion. Generally there are four .najor\nposs~b~\nlities:\n(1) At very small airports there is frequently insufficier,t revenue to generate funds\nto cover an airport manager\'s salary and an tncome for a fixed base operator (FBO). Some\n\ncommunities have overcome this problem by\nappointing s combined manager and FBO, thus\nproviding a salary or partial salary only, yet permitting the manager to receive the proceeds of\nthe normal FBO functions. At a new very small\nairport, the revenue is seldom sufficient to support a fixed base operator so this model might\nbe the only alternative to sponsoring an unattended airport.\nIt is usually necessary for the small\nmunicipally operated airport to depend on\nvarious municipal departments for support\nfunctions such as runway maintenance., lawn\nmowing, snow removal, and legal aid. These\nairports might also have to depend on air traffic\ncontrol facilities at nearby airports, because\nthey usually have either unmanned towers or no\ntowers at all.\n(2) Many medium-to-large size general\naviation airports generate sufficient rever,ue to\nniake the employment of an airport manager\nfeasible and still leave adequate revenue for an\nlocal air\nFBO. Such airports often have l~mited\ncarrier service, and are thus able to afford a\nlimited staff.\n(3) Large arrports, both air carrier and\ngeneral aviation, have professional a~rport\nmanagers with staffs of specialists in such\nareas as operations, administration, and maintenance. The tenants of such airports usually\ninclude FBOs who bid for rental rights and for\nthe right to serve aviation needs at the fields.\nMany FBOs at that level are highly specialized\nand provide a single service such as fuel, flight\ninstruction, or avionics maintenance.\n(4) The airport authoriry approach usually\nsim~lar\nto\ninvolves an administratwe structfpre\nthat of a municipally operated f, :ility, with an\nin-house staff for handling specialized functions.\n\nFinance\nBecause airports are commonly operated\nby public bodies they are often not conceived of\nas monopolies. This, however, is true since the\nuser has little choice in selecting an airport\nonce he has chosen his ultimate destination.\nGeneral aviation and scheduled air carrier\npilots are usually captive clients. who do not\nhave the choice to taxi down the street to\nanother gas station where the fuel might be\ncheaper, except in some instances of preferential refueling.\nMonopolies are normaily regulated to prevent abuses in the levels of rates and services.\nWhile the market has h~storicallybeen in the\nbuyers\' favor, many alrports are presently ser\'j-\n\ning more than or close to the volume of traffic\nnecessary for an economically feasible operation. With this financial maturity come both the\nopportunity for innovations in airport finance,\nand the necessity for governmental regulation,\nas witnessed by the introduction of airport certification through FAR Part 139. Although\nrestricted in its applicability to airports served\nby certificated air carriers, it was the first exercise of major governmental control beyond\nprescribing prerequisites to obtaining fderal\nfunds and grants for airport development. In addition, regulation necessitated by essential\nsecurity measures added to the momentum\nof\ntoward the federal t~gulation airports. Will\nthe authority to approve rates and charges for\nrentals and landing fees be among the future\nareas of control as a result of this momentum?\nIt appears that the authority is indeed present\nand re( ognized by the FAA as is clear from its\nrequirement that airports charge only reasonable and non-discriminatins fees.\nModels of Airport Finance\nThere are four common models on which\nairport financial policy can be based. These\nafe: ( I ) the general benefit model, (2) the breakeven model, (3) the public utility model, and (4)\nthe industrial model.\nThe general benefit model applies to small\naiipoots\nand is thus perhaps the most common.\nThese airports do not generate sufficient\nrevenue to cover their operating costs and the\ndebt service on improvements (or depreciation\nif the improvements are already paid for). This\nsituation requires partial funding from the\npolitical subdivision sbonsoring the airport.\nThe subsidy is justified on tnc basis of the need\nfor supporting public facilities from which all\ncitizens derive either a direct or indirect benefit.\nThe social and economic benefit of airports to\ncommunities by way of creating employment\nand promoting commerce and tourism have\nbeen suggested in a number of studies and will\nbe the subject of other parts of this report.\nThe break-even model is the most widely\naccepted by both airport operators, users, and\ngovernmental bodies. In this model the airport\nis expected to generate sufficient revenues to\ncover the costs of ~perations\nand amortization\nand/or depreciat.on, as appropriate.\nAt this point th6 "single cash register" airport or the airport with an independent financial structure, warrants some discussion. Under\nthis concept all revenue is retained in a fund\nseparate from other governmental accounts,\nand all revenue is applied to the cost of operations, amortization of debt, or other airport\n\ncosts. None of the funds are diverted to other\ngovernmental use. Surplus revenue (profit),\nalthough inconsistent with the true break-even\nmodel, if invested in airport capital improvements does not disqualify the airport from this\nclassification. The reinvestment of surplus\nrevenue in capital improvements, tends to be\ntreated as prepayment of, or payments in lieu\nof, future amortization.\nIt seervs that tenants and users are not disturbed by ieasonable surplus generated by the\nfees they pay, so long as they are comforted\nwith the knowledge that the surplus will be\n"plowed back" into the airport.\nDulles International Airport, operated by\nthe FAA, is a good example of the break-even\nconcept. Airline "use agreements" or leases\nbreak down the original payoff period into three\n10-year spans. The first is an operating loss\nperiod, the second a braak-even, and the third\nis a profit period where the initial losses are\nrecovergd.\nThis approach is extremely well adapted to\nthe ability of users to pay the required fees.\nTraffic builds up with time and the base over\nwhich the charges must be spread is constantly\nincreasing. It is therefore possible to have increasing gross revenues without appreciable\nrate increases. Rate increases would only be\nnecessary in orde: to accommodate rises in\ncosts associated with the provision of services\nwhich cannot be covered by increased\nrevenues.\nThe public utility model is most frequently\nproposed by those communities which own\nsuccessful airports in highly popu;;cied areas\ndrawing their revenue from diversely originating passengers. The profit is therefore at\nleast r:artially from residents of other communities. Under this model the airport sponsor\nis assured of generating sufficient revenues to\nmeet ths airport\'s operating costs, debt service,\nand/or depreciation, and to generate an acceptable fair rate of return on his investment, similar to the situation in other public utilities. It\nmust be observed, however, that other public\nutilities are both recognized and regulated as\nmonopolies. As such their rates, efficiency, performance, and accounting procedures are subject to scrutiny and review. This is presently not\nthe case with airports, bu. the possibility for\ntaking such action in the future exists.\nThe industrial model which allows airports\nto generate profits in the same sense that industry does, has not r~\\ceived\nwide acceptance\nIt is not appealing to most airport operators\nbecause they recognize the public role of air-\n\nport service; they prefer the assured income approach that avoids the highly fluctuating industrial return. and do not care to undertakethe\nmore complicated financing procedures\nnecessary to accommodate wide fluctuation in\nprofit and loss. Most do not want to give up the\ncomfort of assured income not available to the\npurely market-oriented operation.\nAirport Bonding and Sources of Capital\nAirport bonds are usually municipal bonds\nand take the same familiar forms: general\nobligation bonds or full faith and credit bonds;\nand revenue bonds. The latter fall in two\ng%,eral categories: bonds supported by the\nrevenue of the airport only, and special purpose\nbonds issued against a single segment or function of the airport\'s revenue.\nGeneral obligation bonds are bonds\nissued against the general obligation of the\ncommunity issuing the bond. In other words\nthey pledge the full faith and credit of the city,\ntown, or state issuing them. Since the israting\nbody has authority to levy taxes on local c ~ p erty to provide amortization funds. the bonds\nare generally csnsidered a good risk by financial institutions. The tax free interest also acts\nas an additional incentive to those wishing to\ninvest in them.\nMost political jurisdictions are, however,\nlimited in the total amount of bone, they can\nissue, relatitre to the total assessed valuation of\nreal property in the community. Because many\ncitizens, towns, and counties have already\nreached the limits of their authority to tax. and\nsince many are in poor financial condition\nbecause of the exoous to the suburbs, some\ncity-owned airport bonds no longer enjoy their\nprevious appeal.\nBecause general obligation bonds usually\nrequire the voters\' consent as expressed in a\nreferendum, airport operators and sponsors\noften turn to revenue bonds in order to avoid a\ndefeat at the polls. Revenue bonds pledge the\nrevenue of the airport against their amortization. Naturally the rates are higher on revenue\nbonds, but they still enjoy t:ie tax-free benefit of\nmunicipal bonds and enjoy considerable\npopularity with financial institutions.\nSpecial purpose bonds are frequently\nissued by airport sponsors to construct specific\nprojects such as cargo facilities, fuel facilities.\nor hangars. The special bonds may in that case\nbe issued against the revenue from that specific\nproject only. The popularity of these bonds is\nsomewhat less than that of the other types for\nobvious reasons. The success of such a bond\nissue is more dependent on the probable suc-\n\ncess of the particular project and on the credit\nof the parties obligating rental or royalty\nrevenue by lease or contract.\nBuild and lease back agmmmb may be\nused either as pledge revenue to support\nrevenue bond issues or against mortgages on\nfacilities constructedfor a particular tenant. For\nexample. an FBO may want hangar space at an\nairport and may be willing to sign a twenty-year\nlease. The airport may borrow the money,\npledging the lease proceeds as a security, and\ngranting conditional possession to the lending\ninstitution if the proposed tenant defaults. The\ninstitution may then sublease the facility to\nanother tenant. thus continuing the revenJe\nflow till the expiration of the debt.\nRanks and other lending institutions have\nhistorically avoided financing tenant construction at airports because the title to the land is\nvested in the airport sponsor. The tenant merely\nhas a leasehold. In the event of default and subsequent foreclosure, the bank has only the\nleasehold as security, most leaseholdsbeing of\nthe non-assignable or extremely restricted\ntype. They do not present a readily marketable\nprivilege and are therefore not the most desirable security.\nIncreasing sophistication of many of the\nmedium and large airport sponsors has led to\nthe design of lease clauses containing clearly\ndefined limitations on the assignment or attachment of the leasehold, while simultaneously\nleaving sufficient flexibility to permit a lending\ninstitution to replace the tenant with an\nequivalent tenant for the remainder of the term.\nBecause of the financial distress of many\ncities today and the reluctance of others to\ndevote scarce capital to projects with restricted\nbenefit, many projects such as hangar construction, cargo facility construction, and fuel\ndistribution facilities are being financed In this\nmanner.\nGovernment Assistance\nMost people are oi the impression that the\nfederal aid programs provide the bulk of the\nfunds necessary for airport development. They\nare also of the impression that the general taxpayers\' money goes into the fund. Neither concept is accurate.\nUnder the previous Federal Airport Act of\n1946, funding for airport improvements was\nderived from airline tax and other aviation\nsources. These taxes were, however, paid into\nthe general fund and were not actually earmarked for airport or airways improvements.\nThe Airport and Airways Development Act\n\nof 1970 incorporated many of the features of the\nprevious act but also introduced many innovations. The concurrent legislation, the Airport\nand Airway Development Act of 1970 provided\nthe funds to carry out the propamd develop\nment. Taxes were imposedon airline passenger\nfares. airline freight or cargo waybills, aviation\nfuel and related products. aircraft registration,\netc. Thus the c s of development was brought\not\nhome to the user as directed in the act. As protection for the user against the diversion of\nfunds extracted from his contribution, the trust\nfund concept was imposed and the use of the\nfunds restricted.\nThe development of the airways system.\nwhich was previously supported from general\ngovernment fvlnds. became eligible for receiving $250 million per year for the five-year duration of the act.\nAirport planning is of course essential to\ntire orderly development of the national aviation\ns;stem. Therefore. $2 million were designated\nfor developing a National Airport Systems Plan\n(NASP) and provision was made for making individual grants to airports for master planning\ntheir own development consistent with the role\nassigned to them by the NASP.\nThe funds made available for airport\ndevelopment are divided into two main categories: air carrier airports and general aviation\nairports. The former are to receive $310 million\nper year (by 1573 amendment) and the latter are\nallocated $30 million per year.\nOne-third of the funds is allocated on a\nstatewide basis considering both the population and area of the state. Another third is allocated nn the basis of enplaned airline\npassengers, which represents the main source\nof the revenue constituting the fund. The rest is\nleft to the discretion vf the administration.\nGeneral aviation has a similar allocation with\ndifferent percentage distribut~ons.\nThe restrictions on eligible projects are\nnumerous. The airport must be in the NASP.\nThe project itsclf must be completed according\nto FAA specifications. Another signifcant\nrestriction is that stipulated by section 20 (b) of\nthe act, which prohibits the use of the funds for\nany building used for other than safety purposes such as crash and fire facilities. This provision prohibits the expenditure on needed\nhangars, terminal facilities, roads. and other\npublic facilities on the airport. The recognized\nrule of thumb in the industry states that for every dollar spent on eligible projects an equal\namount will eventually be required on the terminal side to accommodate the additional\n\ntraffic generated by the improvement.\nThe act was permitted to expire on July 1,\n1975. As this document went to p m , Congressional committees were studying the\npossibility of extending the act and expanding\nthe list of eligible projects to include public\nareas of terminals such as waiting rooms, lobbies. corridors. concourses and hold rooms,\npeople-movers. baggage claiming devices. and\nmany others logically related to accommodating the passenger who is the main source of Ute\nfunds. The percentage of federal participation\nunder the expired act was 50 percent of eligible\nprojects at large hub airports. 75 percent at\nsmaller airports. and 82 percent for certification\nor security. The percentage limitations are also\nundergoing review. The case of 90 percent\nfederal participation in interstate highway\nfacilities is frequently cited to support the argument for changing this formula.\nsourcet of Revenue\nThe successful offering of revenue bonds\nis dependent on demonstrating the availability\nof sources of revenue with a high degree of certainty in order to assure sufficient cash flow to\namortize the debt. Airports look primarily to\nairlines, concessions. and general aviation\nfees, in that order, to generate that revenue. As\ncan be seen, strictly general aviation airports\nare hard-pressed to produce revenue with the\ncertainty necessary for revenue bond funding.\nWhereas the airline must serve the airport and\nis somewhat a captive tenant and user, general\naviation aircraft may or may not fly. when and\nwhere they choose. By their nature, they are not\nsubject to contractual obligations to assure\nfunds.\nThe airlines negotiate ieases and useagreements with the airports they serve. The\nleases usually provide for set rates of squarefeet rentals to cover such areas as private\noffices, ticket counter space, baggage make-up\nspace and many other areas too numerous to\nmention. Most accept the policy of rentals for\nexclusive use areas in terminals, but some dispute still rages regarding the extraction of rentals for areas not under the exclusive control of\nthe airlines.\nThe rates and charges are generally\nnegotiated and ar- thus acceptable to both parties, even if reluctantly so. Nevertheless, as a\nresuIt of the airport\'s monopoly, the airlines\nreally have no choice to reject rates and fees required by the airport. The airport has the\nauthority to establish the rates and charges by\nordinance without the consent of the airlines.\nOne must then ask if federal regulation of\n\nthis monopolistic ratesetting capability would\nnot be consistent with the anti-trust philosophy\nof our government. Some feel such affirmative\nregulation is necessary while others feel that\nthe carriers\' protection is provided for:\n(1) in fact that without the signature of the\nairline on lease agreements the airport\'s ability\nto issue revenue bonds is greatly reduced;\n(2) in the fact that upon acceptance of\nfederal funds for improvement, the airport must\nenter a "grant agreement" with the FAA which\nprohibits charging unreasonable or dis,\ncriminating band.\n(3) in the fact that generally the airline\nagreements to a break-even philosophy obligate the airlines sewing the airport to review\nand adjust their landing feesannually so as to\nassure a loss-free operation of the airport.\nThe greatest area of dispute centers\naround proposed improvements to be amort i z ~as part of the costs underwritten by the\nj\ncarriers. The carriers frequently believe that the\nimprovements may be unnecessary, excessive\nor, too extravagant. Several airports are presently in court with the airlines over disputes\nconcerning the reasonablenessof the rates and\nfees. Recent economic conditions have made\nthe airlines more cost conscious and less likely\nto accept unnecessary improvementsor expansion.\nThe landing fees charged to both airlines\nand general aviation are usualiy based on the\nmaximum gross certificated landing weight of\nthe aircraft, regardless of the actual weight on\nlanding. They range from a few cents per thousand at smaller airports to over $1 per thousand\nai some large hubs. The airlines and general\naviation frequently pay fuel flow charges of set\nrates per gallon of enplaned fuel. Airports have\nalso generally imposed security charges on the\nairlines to help cover the cost of additional improvements and operating costs occasioned by\nfederal requirements relating to security\nmeasures on airports. The CAB allowed the\nairlines temporary fare surcharges to meet this\ncontingency, so the cost has been passed on to\nthe user.\nTwo categories d concessions usually\ncover the concession revenues at an airport;\naeronautically related and public supported\nconcessions. Aeronautical concessions include a percentage of gross FSO contracts;\nfuel flow charges; aircraft parking fees; maintenance fees; clearing or turn-around fees, etc.\nP u b l i c support concessions include\nrestaurants at 10 percent to 25 percent of gross;\nauto parking at 25 percent to 95 percent; and\n\nmany others such as barbers, drug stores, gift\nshops. and taxi and bus stands.\nThe general rule of thumb is to estimate\nfuture income from concessions on the basis of\na per passenger average income of $1 to $2.\nThis source, at large hub airports, frequently\naccounts for over 50 percent of the gross\nrevenue and at others is the most significant\nsingle factor. Unfortunately at the small general\naviation airport there is insufficient passenger\nflow to generate adequate returns.\nIn addition to landing fees, fuel flow\ncharges. and percentage of gross on aviation\nservice. such as repairs and maintenance.\nsome general aviation elements pay squarefoot rentals. Corporate based aircraft usually\ngenerate demand for office space and frequently lounge space as well. Many airports are\nsolely general aviation and yet are profitable.\nThe volume of revenue may well be there, but\nbecause of its relative uncertainty, it is difficult\nto rely on it as a basis for long-term financing.\nAdditional financial benefits for the airport\nmay be reaped if the sponsor retains the land\nsurrounding the airport and promotes the\ndevelopment of an industrial park in the area.\nThe "build and lease back" arrangements can\nbe profitable here, and the airport can benefit\nby an appreciation in the land value.\nIt is frequently difficult to tell whether an\nairport is or is not generating surplus revenue,\nor to make meaningful comparisons of airport\nfiscal policies. This is due to the lack of standardization in airport accounting systems. All\nefforts by the federal government, the Air\nTransport Association (ATA), and others have\nfailed to establish an acceptable standard accounting procedure for airports. The reasons\ndo not necessarily stem from the desire of the\nairport to hide its financial status, nor from a\nrefusal to cooperate. The problem is a derivative from the more general problem resulting\nfrom the fact that each town, city, council, or independently created authority. has by law, certain prescribed accounting procedures to\nwhich it must conform. These vary by state and\nby locality within the state. This is compounded\nby the demands made by bond indenture agreements and other special situations.\nConclusion\nThe large hub airport is generally capable\nof supporting its own improvements and of\nfunctioning on a break-even basis. Airport\nsponsors proposing the public utility model for\nairport financing usually meet with formidable\noppos~tion\nfrom airlines and the federal government. The break-even model therefore seems\n\nlikely to prevail and the trend toward independent authorities will most likely continue.\nMedium and small hub airports will continue their stnrggle uphill to fiscal independence. More realistic federal airport support\npolicies should help these airports become\nmore independent of the local tax base.\nThe small general aviation airport appears\nto be most vulnerable in the temporary\neconomic set back and is likely to suffer most in\nthe cost conscious era to follow. Unless it is located in a hub area which is sewed by air carrier (not necessarily at the same airport), the\nairport has little chance of becoming self-sup\nporting and must depend upon continued local\ntax subsidy. Such airports are becoming less\nlikely candidates for public support as the\npopulation perceives a diminished opportunity\nto use them. Since their revenues are minimal.\nthe possibilities for successful bonding are low.\nTheir continued success will depend on a\nrealistic evaluation of community need and on\nthe use of cost conscious approaches in both\ncapital planning and daily operational policies.\n\nPHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT\nIntroduction\nNoise pollution, air quality, water quality,\nand land use around jeneral aviation airports\nare important partsof tne physical environment.\nThe planning and construction of public\nfacilities such as general aviation airports\nshould be guided by a desire to achieve the\nhighest possible level of social benefits, with a\nminimum expenditure of human, physical. economic, and environmental resources. Large\nscale physical facilities are usually accompanied by undersirable environmental side-\n\neffects.\nIn an attempt to minimize possible environmental damage resulting from major public undertakings, the National Erivironmental Policy\nAct of 1969 (Public Law 91 1Qtl)was enacted to\nrequire that for any project which involves major Federal funding, and which significantly\naffects the quality of the human environment,\nan environmental impact statement must be\nfiled with the Council on Environmental Quality\n\n-\n\n" P.

The discussion will\nfocus on the regulation of noise, pollution, and\nwater quality.\n\nEnvironmental Legislation\nEnvironmental legislation which has\nemerged within the last five or six years may\neventually influence the utilization of general\naviation airports. One of the primary objectives\nof the Noise Control Act of 1972 (Public Law\n92-574) is to control noise from aircraft and\naircraft operations. The FAA is authorized to\ndevelop regulations to control aircraft noise\nemissions, as well as to impose curfews, flight\npath modifications, or other procedures\ndeemed necessary to protect the public.\nAmong the states with environmental regulations, the State of California has establishad\nstate-wide controls for noise around airports. 26\nAirport authorities may also control noise: the\nPort of New York Authority imposes noise standards on the airlines and operators who use its\nairports. ~7 The right of the operator to control\nnoise through the imposition of a curfew has\nbeen upheld in the California courts. 28 But at\nleast one decision severely limited the power of\n\n'
