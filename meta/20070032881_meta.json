Due to lack of spectrum at X-band (8.41 GHz) NASA is switching to Ka-band (32 GHz) for its Deep Space Missions. This is 50 MHz bandwidth at X-band vs. 500 MHz at Ka-band. Weather events cause a greater degradation for the Ka-band link. Therefore, the Ka-band needs to be operated in a different manner than the X-band. The Ka-band achieves a maximum average capacity at a lower weather reliability than X-band (80 to 90% for Ka-band vs. 95% for X-band). Studies have been done to suggest different methods of operation for Ka-band. The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) will allow us to evaluate the proposed methods of operations for the Ka-band The MRO is the first spacecraft to have a fully functioning independent Ka-band downlink stream.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20070032881, "name": "Ground System Architectures Workshop", "location": "Manhattan Beach, CA", "id": "f6718b9dbbc84d3982603af3cd69ff91", "startDate": "2006-03-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20070032881, "id": "61efa3770c5d41c0b865dec2799519a3", "publicationDate": "2006-03-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
