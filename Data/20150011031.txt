They also serve a crucial role in the\nnatural environment.\nA six-month project to repair protective sand dunes along the\nshoreline of Kennedy Space Center recently was completed.\nThe effort was celebrated with a ceremony at the site of the\nrestoration effort.\n\nFrequent pounding from storms, especially Hurricane Sandy\nin October 2012, along with other weather systems, such as\nhigher than usual tides, destroyed the sand dunes protecting\nimportant infrastructure at the spaceport.\nWith the additional effects of climate change showing\nup from Miami to Alaska, two University of Florida (UF)\ngeologists are focusing their attention on the shores of the\ncenter.\nNancy Bray, center operations director for Kennedy, said\nNASA is taking the situation seriously and has plans for\ndealing with it. A similar plan has been prepared for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s\nWallops Island Flight Facility in Virginia, though Wallops has\nnot yet seen the effects that have shown up at Kennedy.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe do consider sea-level rise and climate change to be\nurgent,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWithout that secondary dune line, we\ncould have saltwater intrusion at the launch pad.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAccording to Don Dankert, a biological scientist in the NASA\n\n8\n\nEnvironmental Management Branch of Center Operations,\nthe work completed a reconstruction effort that began in\nOctober 2013.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe built a 1.2 mile dune,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all donated sand\nfrom our (U.S. Air Force) friends over on Cape Canaveral Air\nForce Station. They provided us with 90,000 cubic yards of\nbeach quality sand.\xe2\x80\x9d\nGlenn Semmel, chief within the Environmental Management\nBranch of Center Operations, pointed out that vegetation was\nplanted along the new dune to prevent erosion.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll totaled, 180,000 plants were placed along the restored\nstretch of beach,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAs they take root and grow, the\nvines and shrubs should hold the sand in place.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe May 2 ceremony included Burton Summerfield, a\nsenior advisor for Institutional Management in the office of\nthe Kennedy associate director, and Becky Bolt, a wildlife\necologist with InoMedic Health Applications Inc. (IHA), joining\nDankert in planting the final palmetto palm at the base of the\nmound.\nAssistant professor Peter Adams of the UF Geological\nSciences department and associate professor of geology\nJohn Jaeger, along with Kennedy officials, began developing\na strategy for restoration of the space center shoreline in\n2009.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt started about five years ago with the formation of the\nDune Vulnerability Team to assess the condition of our\nshoreline and develop a strategy to provide long-term\nprotection,\xe2\x80\x9d Dankert said. \xe2\x80\x9cOur partners with IHA, the\nUniversity of Florida, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and\nthe U.S. Geological Survey, helped us develop a plan for\npreserving our diminishing shoreline.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHe added that this is just one small part of an overall project\nto reconstruct the dunes along the Kennedy shoreline.\nOver the years, tropical weather has continually battered the\nshoreline. Some systems pass by, but there have been a few\ndirect hits. Even though it did not make landfall, one of the\nmost destructive storms ever to hit the United States was\n\nHurricane Sandy, which pounded the beaches of Brevard\nCounty in Florida, including those at Kennedy. The storm\ncontinued up the coastline damaging the Southeastern and\nMid-Atlantic states before delivering a devastating blow to\nthe Northeast.\n\npads ~ a costly and complex possibility.\nIn addition to rebuilding the dunes, the team\xe2\x80\x99s efforts\nincluded planting native vegetation on newly created dunes\nto provide soil stabilization and to benefit native wildlife.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe planted grasses, sunflowers, vines, sea grapes and\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a constant battle to restore the dunes that hold off the\nweather-induced erosion,\xe2\x80\x9d Dankert said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe new dune\nis going to provide protection for our launch infrastructure\nalong our most critically eroded stretch of shoreline.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe new stretch of reconstructed sand dunes is near two\nkey spaceport facilities -- Launch Pads 39A and 39B. NASA\nofficials recently announced a 20-year property agreement\nwith SpaceX for operation of Pad 39A for the Falcon Heavy\nrocket. At nearby Pad 39B, work is underway to support the\nagency\xe2\x80\x99s heavy-lift Space Launch System rocket and Orion\nspacecraft.\nLooking further into the future, the agency is taking an\napproach it calls \xe2\x80\x9cmanaged retreat.\xe2\x80\x9d That means if sea-level\nrise becomes insurmountable, Bray said, NASA eventually\nmay have to move roads, utilities and perhaps even launch\n\npalmettos,\xe2\x80\x9d Dankert said.\nThe space center\xe2\x80\x99s shoreline also is an important habitat\nfor wildlife, including several endangered species such as\nthe Southeastern beach mouse, indigo snakes and gopher\ntortoises.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve done some great things working with our friends\nover at the (Merritt Island National Wildlife) Refuge to\nenhance the beach habitat, especially for our nestling and\nhatchling sea turtles,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\nDankert expressed pride in how well the sand dune project\nhad progressed.\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur beaches had been slowly eroding for years,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe got it all done pretty quickly, starting in October and we\nfinished a little ahead of schedule.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n9\n\nElectric Vehicles\nand Chargers\nFive new electric cars joined Kennedy Space Center\xe2\x80\x99s fleet vehicles through a General Services Administration Electric\nVehicle Pilot Program.\nOne of the new vehicles is a Chevy Volt. Another, the Ford C-MAX, is a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle, or PHEV. The remaining\nthree are Ford Focus battery electric vehicles, or BEVs. The vehicles are in use throughout the center, supporting a variety of\nprograms and facilities.\nEV chargers have been installed in order to support the program and ensure power is available to these specialized cars.\nElectric vehicles boast economic and environmental considerations compared to conventional gasoline-powered vehicles.\n\n10\n\nECYCLE\nR\n\nHOW MUCH POWER IS SAVED BY RECYCLING ?\nCommodity\n\nAmount Recycled Appliance Powered\n\nHours of Use\n\nAluminum can\n\n10\n\nAir Conditioner\n\n1.7 hours\n\nAluminum can\n\n10\n\nHair Dryer\n\n1.7 hours\n\nAluminum can\n\n10\n\nLaptop Computer\n\n51.9 hours\n\nAluminum can\n\n10\n\n60 W CFL Bulb\n\n199.5 hours\n\nGlass Bottle\n\n10\n\nAir Conditioner\n\n.07 hours\n\nGlass Bottle\n\n10\n\nHair Dryer\n\n.07 hours\n\nGlass Bottle\n\n10\n\nLaptop Computer\n\n20.9 hours\n\nGlass Bottle\n\n10\n\n60 W CFL Bulb\n\n80.2 hours\n\nPlastic Bottle\n\n10\n\nAir Conditioner\n\n.8 hours\n\nPlastic Bottle\n\n10\n\nHair Dryer\n\n.8 hours\n\nPlastic Bottle\n\n10\n\nLaptop Computer\n\n25.4\n\nPlastic Bottle\n\n10\n\n60 W CFL Bulb\n\n97.8\n\nSource EPA\n\nREC\n\nCARLTON HALL\nKENNEDY SPACE CENTER SCIENTIST OF THE YEAR\nEcologist Carlton Hall is on a different kind of mission at\nKennedy Space Center \xe2\x80\x93 a mission to take care of and\nprotect the center\xe2\x80\x99s land and resources for current and future\ngenerations of spaceport workers. To recognize his efforts in\nclimate change research related to Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s future launch\ncapabilities, Hall, with InoMedic Health Applications Inc.,\nreceived the KSC Scientist of the Year Award during the 2014\nNASA Kennedy Space Center Honor Awards ceremony.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was shocked and speechless,\xe2\x80\x9d Hall said. \xe2\x80\x9cEverything we\ndo here is a team effort.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHall has worked at Kennedy for 31 years. He is the Ecological\nProgram manager and a scientist under the Medical and\nEnvironmental Support Contract. He also was one of\nthe founding scientists on the space shuttle and center\noperations ecological monitoring and research project in the\nearly 1980s.\nAt that time, extensive testing was conducted to assess and\ndocument environmental impacts of space shuttle launches,\nand the results were summarized in a recently-published\nNASA technical publication, \xe2\x80\x9cEcological Impacts of the Space\nShuttle Program at John F. Kennedy Space Center.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHall and his team work closely with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife\nService at the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge. The\nrefuge recently was selected by the U.S. Department of\nthe Interior as one of three test sites nationwide to conduct\nresearch on how to enhance scrub jay habitats. Florida scrub\njays have been on the threatened species list since 1987.\n\xe2\x80\x9cCarlton always strives to put Kennedy at the forefront\nof ecological research and find ways to showcase what\nan incredible place the center is,\xe2\x80\x9d said John Shaffer,\nenvironmental planning lead in the Center Operations\nDirectorate. \xe2\x80\x9cHe and his group of scientists and researchers\nhave showcased Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s unique environment and ensured\nNASA continues to succeed with its mission.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWorking together they have made significant progress in\ndetermining how controlled burns are conducted for land\nmanagement, proposing smaller patches of burns rather\nthan burning huge swathes at the same time.\nThey also work closely with the U.S. Air Force, the\n\n12\n\nNational Park Service and university partners\nto collect information and develop knowledge\nfor environmental compliance and natural resource\nmanagement needs in east central Florida.\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur goal is to ensure that NASA operates the center in a\nsustainable and environmentally-friendly way,\xe2\x80\x9d Hall said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are situated in an ideal place to study climate change.\nKSC is in the transition region between the subtropical and\ntemperate climatic zones. As temperatures rise, we expect\nto see a shift in the species of plants and animals present in\nour ecosystem.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHall and his group are working on a Climate Adaptation\nScience Investigators program to assess the risks associated\nwith multiple climate change scenarios at Kennedy. Areas of\nconcern include infrastructure, workforce health and safety,\ncritical assets and natural resources. The investigation looks\nat how climate change and sea-level rise could affect the\ncenter\xe2\x80\x99s current facilities, assets and workforce, and what\nit could mean for the construction of new facilities in the\nfuture.\n\xe2\x80\x9cLong-term tide gauge, weather station and satellite data\nindicate temperatures and sea level have been rising for\nthe last century, and the rates appear to be accelerating.\nThough for the last three years, this area has been in a water\ndeficit,\xe2\x80\x9d Hall said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut that could change, and it\xe2\x80\x99s important\nto identify Kennedy roads or facilities that could be flooded if\nwater levels rise due to more intense storms.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAnother concern with rise of water level is underground\ncontaminants from past activities. Hall said a rising water\ntable has the potential to carry undesirable chemicals to the\nsurface, possibly impacting human and ecosystem health.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is still so much to learn about how our ecosystem\nresponds to hydrologic conditions, fire and man-made\nchange, and Kennedy represents a unique and amazing\n\xe2\x80\x98outdoor living laboratory\xe2\x80\x99 where this type of research can be\nconducted,\xe2\x80\x9d Hall said.\nHall analyzed sea-level rise projections in various areas\naround the center and compared them to projected facility\nlife cycles. The data he and his group produced recently was\n\nincorporated into the Kennedy Master Plan and\nthe KSC Future Development Concept document.\nHall said beach erosion already is a real problem along\nKennedy\xe2\x80\x99s coastline. A sand dune restoration project\nwas completed in 2014 along a mile of the Atlantic\nOcean shoreline between Launch Pads 39A and 39B in\nan attempt to protect those facilities from storm surges\nand rising tides. Construction workers removed a section\nof the railroad west of the dunes, along with the gravel\nbeneath, to recycle the materials and ensure sea turtles\ncan continue to nest successfully in the area after the dune\nis restored.\nHall has a bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s and master\xe2\x80\x99s of science degree in\nwildlife and fishery science from Texas A&M University in\nCollege Station, and holds a doctorate in environmental\nscience from the College of Engineering at Florida Tech\nin Melbourne.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur goal is to\nensure that NASA\noperates the center\nin a sustainable and\nenvironmentallyfriendly way.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nArtifacts Program\n\nBy donating priceless space artifacts, NASA does more than share its past successes with the world -- it also prevents these\nitems from landing in landfills.\nIn keeping with NASA\xe2\x80\x99s policy of educating and informing the public through exhibits, the agency encourages the donation\nof appropriate artifacts to eligible museums, schools, universities, libraries and planetariums. Sharing these artifacts helps\nto preserve evidence of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s activities, successes and discoveries, and makes this space history tangible -- which in turn\nadvances initiatives promoting science, technology, engineering and math.\nThe artifacts program has spared many donated items that otherwise would be sent to landfills due to their sensitive\nnature, export control or demilitarization requirements. The center\xe2\x80\x99s property disposal officer coordinates with the NASA\nHeadquarters Logistics Management Division and the NASA Artifact Working Group to ensure artifacts are properly screened.\nWhen an item loses its technical ability or is no longer needed, it\xe2\x80\x99s a team effort to ensure these items are identified.\nA Web-based Artifact Screening Module, hosted and maintained by the General Services Administration, makes it possible for\neligible organizations to screen, request and receive NASA artifacts.\nThis effort began in 2009 and remains active today.\n\n14\n\nEvery ton of paper recycled can\nsave the energy equivalent to\n165 gallons of gasoline\n\nOutreach Activities\nKennedy employees participated in special events designed to give them more opportunities to take an active role in living\nsustainably, both at work and at home.\nThe Environmental Management Branch held an Earth Day Sustainability Fair beside the Pathfinder Fitness Trail on April 22.\nMore than 500 employees attended the fair, which showcased home, garden, transportation, nature and recycling products\nand services from 18 local and state vendors.\nWorkers had the chance to clear space in their homes and divert usable materials from the landfill at the 2014 KSC America\nRecycles Day events on Nov. 13-14. More than 200 people donated 12 bins of personal electronics, 11 pallets of televisions,\n2,000 pounds of clothing and 27 bicycles.\nThe clothing and bicycles were given to the North Brevard Charities Sharing Center in Titusville, Florida. The bicycles were to\nbe refurbished by inmates at the Brevard County Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Farm, then given to low-income children, homeless adults\nand veterans.\n\n16\n\nAccording to the United States\nEnvironmental Protection Agency, the\nair inside of a home is two to five times\nmore polluted than the air outside,\nmainly because of household cleaners\nand pesticides.\n\n17\n\nThey only come out at night. And if the timing is right, you\nmay catch a glimpse of a sea turtle lumbering onto the\nshoreline along Florida\xe2\x80\x99s space coast in search of a place to\nlay its precious cargo of eggs.\nThere currently are only seven different species of sea turtles\nin the world, varying in size from the small Kemp\xe2\x80\x99s Ridley to\nthe very large Leatherback that can weigh more than 1,000\npounds and reach eight feet in length. Along with these, the\nmost prevalent sea turtles that appear in Florida include the\nLoggerhead and Green. All are on the endangered species\nlist except for the Loggerhead, which is listed as threatened.\nSea turtle nesting and hatching season in Florida generally\nruns from May to November. These gentle creatures need\ndark skies and that means lights out in the evening, not just\nat Kennedy Space Center but all along the eastern seaboard\nof Florida.\nMore than 5,000 turtles nest on Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s protected beach,\n\n18\n\nas well as on a portion of the Canaveral National Seashore\nnext to the center.\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor sea turtles, the beach is the most important factor in\nthe reproductive phase of their life history. They need nearshore access and sand that\xe2\x80\x99s in good shape for constructing\ntheir nests,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jane Provancha, a wildlife ecologist with\nInoMedic Health Applications (IHA). \xe2\x80\x9cAnd they have to have\ndarkness.\xe2\x80\x9d\nTo help employees become more aware of sea turtle nesting\nhabits and Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to achieve lights out at night,\nthe Environmental Management Branch of the Center\nOperations Directorate held a Dark Skies workshop.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe mission of the International Dark Sky Association (IDA)\nis to preserve and protect the nighttime environment and our\nheritage of dark skies through environmentally responsible\noutdoor lighting,\xe2\x80\x9d said Taylor Pitcock, a NASA environmental\nspecialist. \xe2\x80\x9cThe purpose of the Dark Skies workshop is to\n\nimprove awareness and make positive changes in Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s\nlighting.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cKennedy strives to minimize light pollution in any way\npossible,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nancy Bray, director of Center Operations.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe incorporate appropriate turtle-friendly lighting into the\nplanning and execution of all our construction projects, and\nwe strive to identify opportunities to update existing lights to\nmeet the federal and state mandates.\xe2\x80\x9d\nLighting can interfere with females finding their way back\nto the water. Disoriented female turtles have ended up in\nhomeowners\xe2\x80\x99 pools, on back porches, and unfortunately,\nsometimes they end up in the road.\nBright lights also can have a negative effect on turtle\nhatchlings. They rely on multiple visual cues to make their\nway from the nest to the water. They search for the brightest\nopen horizon, which usually is the water illuminated by\nthe moon. Any delay on the beach can result in increased\ndehydration, exhaustion, predators and death.\nKennedy\xe2\x80\x99s external lighting guidelines\nare not new, according to\nLynne Phillips, in the center\xe2\x80\x99s\nEnvironmental Branch. In fact,\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ve been around since 1995\nin various forms. The center\xe2\x80\x99s\nupdated lighting plan focuses on light trespass\n(interior lighting that can be seen from the exterior).\nRemember these three Golden Rules for lighting.\nFirst, keep the light source\xe2\x80\x99s height low to\nminimize light trespass, and use only the\nlumens output needed. Lighting sources\nthat are lower to the ground make it\neasier to direct the light to where it is\nmost needed.\nSecond, the light source should be\nshielded. Full cutoff or fully recessed\nfixtures are recommended. The key is\nto shield the light so it is not visible from\nthe beach.\nThird, the light source should produce light\nwith a long wavelength, because sea turtles\nare attracted to short wavelength lights. In\nother words, use \xe2\x80\x9cwildlife-friendly\xe2\x80\x9d bulbs with\nwavelengths greater than 560 nanometers. Amber, orange\nand red LED lights produce shine in these wavelength\n\nregions.\nFixtures not recommended are lights categorized as\ndecorative, water feature, pond, private balcony, dune crossover, fountain and tree strap-down if they can be seen from\nthe beach. Some ways to correct or retrofit existing problems\ninclude disconnecting and turning off lights; changing lamps\nto red, orange or amber LEDs; installing 180-degree shields\nto block light visible from the beach; and installing a fixture\nthat directs light down and away from the beach.\nShannon Gann, a wildlife ecologist with (IHA), talked about\nhow workers at the center can improve lighting and make a\nlasting impact and difference in the life history of all wildlife,\nincluding sea turtles.\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne hatchling in a thousand will make it to the reproductive\nstage,\xe2\x80\x9d Gann said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Kennedy beaches must be preserved\nto help the sea turtle species to survive. Before you leave the\noffice in the afternoon, flip off the lights or draw the shades.\nThis actually will make\na\n\ndifference in the\namount of\nlight that\n\nshines\nout to the\nbeach.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n19\n\nNeil Armstrong Operations\n& Checkout Building LEED\nSilver Certification\nOne of the spaceport\xe2\x80\x99s most iconic facilities earned a prestigious certification following a major upgrade that provided\nsustainability improvements from the inside out.\nOn June 6, the U.S. Green Building Council officially awarded its Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)\nSilver Certification to the Neil Armstrong Operations and Checkout (O&C) Revitalization project.\nThe approximately 255,000-square-foot O&C north building is used by several NASA programs at Kennedy. The facility first\nopened in 1964 for the assembly and testing of the Apollo spacecraft, and continues to play a vital role\nin spaceflight history as the agency prepares to embark on\nthe next giant leap in\n\nspace exploration.\nRenovations began in May 2005 and concluded in June 2013, incorporating modular offices and modernized conference\nrooms, energy-efficient lighting, and new communications, data networks, fire sprinkler system and heating ventilation and\nair-conditioning (HVAC) systems.\nSince the upgrade, potable water use has been reduced by a third, and connected lighting power density has been reduced\nby 15 percent. More than 89 percent of construction waste during the project was diverted from the landfill, and 95 percent\nof furnishings were redistributed throughout the center or repurposed. Energy star-rated equipment and appliances are\ninstalled throughout the facility, and 12 percent of the total building material content, by value, was manufactured using\nrecycled materials.\n\n20\n\nThe United States uses an\nestimated 13 billion pounds of\npaper towels a year.\nIf everyone used one less paper\ntowel a day we would save\n5,710,230 pounds of paper a year\n(that is more than 7,000 trees).\n\nEnergy Improvements\nto Operations Support\nBuilding II\nThe Operations Support Building II in Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s Launch Complex 39 area received several modifications designed to improve\nenergy use.\nKnown as OSB II, the 189,000-square-foot facility opened in 2006. The project aimed to improve the five-story building\xe2\x80\x99s\noverall energy efficiency and ensure a sustainable and effective work environment for employees. A variety of heating\nventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) and building control system upgrades made the improvements a reality.\nCenter Operations led the effort with the design-build company SGM Engineering of Orlando, Florida. The project was\nawarded in September 2011 and modifications were substantially complete in April 2014.\nA year of energy and water data collection will end in May 2015, paving the way for Center Operations to apply to the U.S.\nGreen Building Council for LEED certification.\n\n22\n\nAccording to the Environmental\nProtection Agency, you can save\nenough energy to operate a laptop\ncomputer for 52 hours or a 60W CFL\nlight bulb for 200 hours by recycling\njust ten aluminum cans.\n\n23\n\nFor every million smart phones recycled,\nwe can recover 35,274 pounds of copper,\n772 pounds of silver, and 75 pounds\nof gold and 33 pounds of palladium.\nTo conserve on these precious natural\nresources and help protect our planet,\nplease consider donating, selling or\nrecycling your phone.\n\n24\n\nLiquid-free\nPrecision Cleaning\nTwo newly developed liquid-free, precision cleaning methods offer all the benefits of a solvent \xe2\x80\x93 without the environmental\nrisks.\nCleaning solvents have a history of polluting groundwater, destroying Earth\xe2\x80\x99s ozone layer and potentially contributing\nto climate change. In the past, solvents would be phased out due to new environmental regulations, but because the\nreplacement solvents typically were not much better, they also would be phased out over time.\nWith support from the agency\xe2\x80\x99s Ground Systems Development and Operations Program, a team of NASA civil servants, NASA\npostdoctoral fellows, and contractors sought to develop truly sustainable precision cleaning technologies that would comply\nwith regulations for the long term.\nOne technology relies on a plasma, while the other cleans with supercritical carbon dioxide. But both are used in the same\nmanner: parts are placed inside the cleaning vessel, and when the process is complete, the cleaned, dry parts can be\nremoved. These technologies have been demonstrated to effectively clean greases and oils on a small scale in the laboratory\nsetting, and the team currently is evaluating their performance on larger-scale valves, pipes and tubing. If the new cleaners\nare proven to work, they\xe2\x80\x99ll be ready to use across Kennedy Space Center.\n\nKennedy Space Center continues to transform into a multiuser spaceport of the future, and many of the center\xe2\x80\x99s\nfacilities are undergoing upgrades and modifications to\nsupport processing and launch of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Space Launch\nSystem and Orion capsule in 2018 and beyond.\nThe Technology Evaluation for Environmental Risk Mitigation\n(TEERM) Principal Center in NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Environmental\nManagement Division has partnered with the Ground\nSystems Development and Operations Program (GSDO) to\ninvestigate alternative coatings that could serve as an option\nto replace the current hexavalent chromium coatings, also\ncalled hex-chrome, on aluminum structures, including large\nenclosures that house electronics throughout the center.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is rewarding to partner with the TEERM team as they\ncontinue to successfully research alternatives that benefit\nthe environment and reduce corrosion control costs at the\ncenter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bill Simmonds, GSDO project manager for\nEnvironment and Infrastructure.\nThe center has used hex-chrome coatings on aluminum\nstructures because of its self-healing and corrosion resistant\nproperties. Kennedy is looking for environmentally-friendly\nalternative coatings that will meet performance requirements\nin corrosion protection, cost, operability, health and safety,\nas well as conform to Occupational Safety and Health\nAdministration requirements.\xc2\xa0\n\xe2\x80\x9cNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Technical Standard (NASA-STD-5008B) includes\na list of approved primers and topcoats for carbon steel,\nstainless steel and aluminum on launch structures, facilities\nand ground support equipment,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joni Richards, TEERM\nprogram manager. \xe2\x80\x9cOne of our goals is to update several\nsections of the standard in order to correct or improve the\nuse of these specified coatings based on Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s test\nresults thus far.\xe2\x80\x9d\nKurt Kessel, a project manager with ITB Inc. is overseeing\nthe testing of alternative coating samples at the Corrosion\nTechnology Lab in the Operations and Checkout Building\n\n26\n\nand the Beachside Atmospheric Test Facility. The project\nis a continuation of work begun during the Space Shuttle\nProgram.\xc2\xa0\nPhase I testing began in March 2013 and focused on\nconversion coatings. Aluminum test panels were immersed\nin two alternative trivalent chromate conversion coatings,\nand tested in the corrosion lab for salt spray resistance at the\nbeachside facility. Direct Current resistance measurements\nalso were taken at the beach during specified intervals.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoth alternative conversion coatings passed both tests,\xe2\x80\x9d\nKessel said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey performed as well as, and in some cases,\nbetter than hex-chrome.\xe2\x80\x9d\nDuring Phase II, which began in late August 2013, Kessel\ninvestigated how well a primer coating would perform\nwhen added on top of the trivalent chromate conversion\ncoating. Three different coating systems, selected from the\n\nNASA Standard of primers and coatings, were tested in the\ncorrosion lab for 2,000 hours in October and November\n2013, and at the Beachside Test Facility for 10 months so far.\nThe tests were performed to determine which of the three\nwould be deselected and not move on to Phase III testing. \xc2\xa0\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are many variables that need to be considered when\nlooking at primers and coatings for flight or ground support\nequipment,\xe2\x80\x9d Kessel said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are gathering test results and\nsharing them with GSDO on a monthly basis.\xe2\x80\x9d\nDuring Phase III testing, which began in April 2014, one\ncoating product was selected for the test. The conversion\ncoating was eliminated, and the test product was sprayed\ndirectly onto the aluminum in what is called a single step\ndirect-to-metal application.\nKessel said the coating passed the adhesion test and\n\nperformed very well. Salt spray tests in the corrosion lab are\nin progress. Corrosion tests at the Beachside Test Facility will\nbe completed in the fall.\nThe TEERM project office is preparing to test four more\ndirect-to-metal coatings in August. Kessel said three of the\nselected coatings are on the approved NASA Standards list\nbut in the past have been used in tandem with a conversion\ncoating.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese results could lead to significant cost savings if the\ndirect-to-metal, single coat process, meets performance\nrequirements,\xe2\x80\x9d Kessel said.\nResults of the alternative coating tests will be shared with\nother NASA centers, the U.S. Air Force and other government\nagencies, and the European Space Agency.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese results could lead to significant cost\nsavings if the direct-to-metal, single coat\nprocess, meets performance requirements.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOnly 15% of plastic water bottles\nare recycled while 66 million\nbottles end up in landfills or in\nthe ocean every day.\n\n28\n\nHeadquarters HVAC\nRetrocommissioning\nKennedy\xe2\x80\x99s Headquarters Building has served as the administrative backbone of the Florida spaceport for nearly 40 years.\nThrough retrocommissioning, the facility\xe2\x80\x99s heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system now is being optimized for\nimproved energy efficiency.\nThe Headquarters Building\xe2\x80\x99s HVAC energy consumption had been high due to excessive cooling and heating.\nRetrocommissioning improves the function of existing equipment and systems to enhance performance.\nRetrocommissioning efforts at the facility began in 2014 with a focus on tuning and optimizing air handling unit fan speeds,\ncooling and heating temperature set points, and system control programs. The ISC Energy Office and HVAC shop is leading\nthe effort, along with ISC and Center Operations system maintenance engineers.\nThe building\xe2\x80\x99s monthly rate of energy consumption is expected to decrease further as optimization continues.\nRetrocommissioning efforts eventually will be expanded to other facilities across Kennedy.\n\n29\n\nEach year the United States uses\n30 billion plastic and 10 billion\npaper grocery bags, requiring\napproximately 14 million trees\nand 12 million barrels of oil.\n\n30\n\nCoolant Recovery Project\nInnovations at Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s Launch Equipment Shop (LES) have\ndramatically reduced the amount of controlled waste while\nmaking the shop a healthier work environment.\nThe combination of a reusable coolant and a new coolant\nrecovery system resulted in a 90 percent drop in controlled\nwaste sent out for disposal.\nHistorically, the LES produces 1,100 gallons of coolant waste\nper year. The coolant recovery system installed in September\n2014 transfers used fluid to a recovery unit that uses a\ncentrifuge to clean it. After the fluid is cleaned, 90 percent of\nit is recovered and automatically mixed with de-mineralized\nwater, making it ready to use once again. The remaining 10\n\npercent contains solids and is discarded as controlled waste.\nThe LES also switched to CIMFree, a reusable and\nbiodegradable coolant that meets all environmental and\nindustrial requirements. The LES has replaced the coolant\non seven of the 15 machines that will use CIMFree, which\neventually will be cleaned and reused indefinitely.\nLed by TOSC Asset Management, this project has not\nonly reduced controlled waste, but has made the machine\nshop a better workplace by eliminating noxious odors and\nairborne biohazards present in used coolant.\n\n31\n\nE-motorcycle conversion\n\nEver wish you could get to work for only a few pennies?\nFor Otis Deal, who works in the Prototype Lab at Kennedy\nSpace Center, it\xe2\x80\x99s only that much.\nDeal, an engineering technician, grew tired of the cost of\ngasoline and converted a gas-burning internal combustion\nengine 1993 Kawasaki Vulcan 500 into a fully electric\nmotorcycle, which he named Shocker.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have always been into motorcycles and thought an electric\nmotorcycle would be a great platform to try this on,\xe2\x80\x9d Deal\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cI also did it because I thought it\xe2\x80\x99d be a cool thing to\ndo.\xe2\x80\x9d\nDeal took out the engine and replaced it with 24 battery\ncells, creating a 72-volt system. The only major change Deal\n\n32\n\nmade was replacing the forks, which was necessary to fit/\nsupport the batteries.\n\xe2\x80\x9cOtis Deal did a great job on building his e-motorcycle,\xe2\x80\x9d\nNASA transportation officer Bruce Chesson said. \xe2\x80\x9cI applaud\nhim for his spirit and wanting to reduce petroleum and save\nmoney on energy as well as challenging himself to take on\nsuch a project.\xe2\x80\x9d\nGreen initiatives are important to the center as they are to\nemployees. Kennedy operates 78 low-speed electric vehicles\non the center and at the visitor complex.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have driven electric vehicle conversions on center for\nfive years. They were a Smart Car and a PT Cruiser and\nfrom time to time we have had additional (electric vehicles)\n\nsaves worker gas money\nsuch as the Smart convertible and a Mini Cooper,\xe2\x80\x9d Chesson\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cNASA Transportation has demonstrated almost every\nelectric vehicle, low-speed and high-speed that has been\navailable to the market, including Hydrogen Fuel Cell vehicles\nwhich are electric vehicles which use hydrogen as its energy\nsource instead of battery packs.\xe2\x80\x9d\nDeal, who spent $7,500 to build Shocker, said a smart\ncharger came with the battery system. There are two ports\nthat plug into the bike from a standard 110-volt outlet. When\nthe batteries get to 50 percent depth of discharge, it takes\n\nactually does better in the city than the highway.\nWhile Deal was inspired by the lower cost of fuel, he also\nwelcomed the zero emissions from an electric motorcycle.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey say every little bit helps and I figure I\xe2\x80\x99m doing a very\nsmall part,\xe2\x80\x9d Deal said.\nChesson added that Kennedy is scheduled to receive some\nelectric vehicles as replacement GSA lease vehicles that\ninclude a mix of GM Volts, Ford C-Max Plug-in Hybrids and\n\nThe biggest drawback\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t do\nwheelies.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nabout two to three hours to charge them. Once the charge is\ncomplete, the charger turns off automatically.\nOne might think that Deal has a degree in electrical\nengineering or, at the very least, is very knowledgeable about\nelectronics. But, he claims, he\xe2\x80\x99s not even close to being an\nexpert.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never been good with electronics and I previously had\nno knowledge of electronics,\xe2\x80\x9d Deal said, \xe2\x80\x9cso I thought this\nwould be a great way to learn.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAccording to Deal an average Joe can build one a bit\ncheaper depending on set up, battery selection, chassis\nselection, the look, etc. Deal said there are several ways to\nset up an electric motorcycle. It depends on requirements for\nthe build: how far one may need to travel; and what speed\none wants to go; and how often one can charge, among\nother smaller factors.\nShocker, which weighs 400 pounds, can go up to 65 mph\nand travel 40 to 50 miles on a single charge depending on\nconditions.\nDeal did a comparison by cost per mile. It costs 27 cents\nand 24 cents a mile to drive his gas-powered car and truck,\nrespectively, to work; and less than a penny a mile to drive\nShocker to work. And believe it or not, Deal\xe2\x80\x99s motorcycle\n\nthe Ford Focuses.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe continue to strive to green our fleet as well as work\ntoward a solution that will allow charging for government\nand public on center as well as for our guest that come to\nthe visitor complex,\xe2\x80\x9d Chesson said.\nDeal hopes to inspire the center to support workers who\nwant to ride or drive to work using electricity.\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe someday we will be allowed to plug in out here on\ncenter,\xe2\x80\x9d Deal said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf employees know we can plug in EVs\n(electric vehicles) out here, maybe it will inspire other people\nto buy or build their own EVs.\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome people commute from too far away to buy an EV that\ncould make it to work and back home without charging it\nhere. When we can charge up out here, maybe others will be\ninspired to buy or build something that can be a little greener\nfor our environment.\xe2\x80\x9d\nDeal hopes someday he can build an electric car on a rail\nbuggy platform.\nThe biggest drawback for Deal? He said,\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t do wheelies.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n33\n\nAccording to the EPA if every\nhome replaced one standard\nbulb with an Energy Star bulb,\nwe\xe2\x80\x99d save enough energy to\nlight 2 million homes for a year.\n\n34\n\nFlorida\nCommuter\nCycle\n\nJohn H. Jones\xe2\x80\x99 bright-yellow ride may\nturn heads with its appearance \xe2\x80\x93 but its\nfuel-efficient performance is even more\nnoteworthy.\nThe custom-built single-seater gets 150\nmiles per gallon at 55 mph and can travel\nmore than 600 miles per fill-up. Weighing\nin at only 288.4 pounds, the three-wheeled\ncycle comprises an epoxy resin/fiberglass\ncloth aerodynamic fairing on a MIG-welded\nsteel tube frame. Jones rides in a reclined\ndriving position, using joystick-interlinked\nmotorcycle controls for steering, braking\nand signaling. The spoked front wheel sets\ncame from 1978 Honda Express mopeds,\nand the rear wheel set from a 1971 Honda\nScrambler.\nDouglas Malewicki of\nIrvine, California,\ndesigned the\ncycle to meet\nthe strict\nCalifornia\nstate\ntransportation\nlaws for freewaylegal vehicles. Its\nconstruction satisfies the requirements\nof Florida state statutes pertaining to\nmotorcycles.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s also a past record-holder. For many\nyears, Jones\xe2\x80\x99 commuter cycle took the\nrecord for highest gas mileage for a\nfreeway-legal vehicle in the \xe2\x80\x9cGuinness\nBook of World Records.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n35\n\nAn estimated 12 million barrels\nof oil is required to make the 380\nbillion plastic bags that are used\nin the U.S. every year.\n\nNew, Power-efficient\nData Center\nMultiple data centers at Kennedy now are consolidated into a single new, power-efficient Data Center, demonstrating more\nefficient use of power and space.\nAt only 16,000 square feet, the Data Center replaces approximately 49,000 square feet previously dedicated to data centers\nand IT support areas. Server removals have thus far resulted in an $800,000 annual power savings. The new facility not only\nadds to that savings, but represents a reduction in the Kennedy footprint by allowing the demolition of the 136,000-squarefoot Central Instrumentation Facility, an Apollo-era building that for decades was the hub of instrumentation and data\nprocessing operations.\nThis consolidation is a part of a focused effort to meet the center\xe2\x80\x99s environmental sustainability and energy reduction\ngoals. Work on the new facility began in November 2013 and construction is nearly complete. It is expected to be ready for\noccupancy in May 2015.\nThe project is on target to receive Silver certification under the U.S. Green Building Council\xe2\x80\x99s LEED rating system.\n\n37\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\nJohn F.
