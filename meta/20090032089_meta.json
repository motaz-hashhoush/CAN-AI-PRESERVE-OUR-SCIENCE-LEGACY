The goal of the effort is not only to help the human supervisor monitor and control the state of the robot, but also to improve the efficiency of the robot by allowing the supervisor to \"work ahead\". The intelligent assistant is an integrated combination of an artificial-intelligence planner and a monitor of states of both the human supervisor and the remote robot. The novelty of the system lies in the way it uses the planner to reason about the states at both ends of the time delay. The purpose served by the assistant is to provide advice to the human supervisor about current and future activities, derived from a sequence of high-level goals to be achieved.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20090032089, "id": "196e23416ab44eee816230912523de36", "publicationName": "NASA Tech Briefs, September 2009", "publicationDate": "2009-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20090032070, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "NASA Tech Briefs, September 2009", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20090032089.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20090032089/downloads/20090032089.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20090032089/downloads/20090032089.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20090032089/downloads/20090032089.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
