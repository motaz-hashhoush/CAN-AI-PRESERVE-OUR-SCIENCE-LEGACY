The word "laser" often brings to mind\nthe ray-guns and other fantastic apparatus of outdated science fiction. However, the laser\'s sometimes spectacular capabilities and its adaptability to new\naspects of old technologies relate more to the future than to the past. Laser\ntechnology is very much in the present. Practical applications are now in use\nfor industry, government, the military, and research of all kinds; and additional\nuses are being discovered. This survey provides a background and introduction\nto the laser of today and suggests applications for tomorrow which may benefit\neveryone.\nThe most important attribute of the laser is its ability to amplify. With it,\nthe frequency limit for coherent electronic amplification can be increased\nten thousandfold-from 120 to 1 200 000 GHz. The laser is also an oscillator,\nand has its own built-in antenna. A laser beam is characterized by its coherent\nlight, which is emitted over a very narrow frequency range and can be directed\nwith extremely high precision.\nBecause of the almost unlimited frequency domain that has been opened\nfor exploitation, communication engineers consider the advent of lasers\nequivalent to a new technology. This vast quantitative advance has led to\ncorresponding qualitative advances in scientific knowledge and the resulting\ntechnologies. An immensely promising field is holography, which is based on\nthe phenomenon of the optical harmonics that are generated when laser light\ntraverses piezoelectric crystals.\n\nBACKGROUND OF LASER DEVELOPMENT\nThe nature of laser light and how it is produced can be explained through\na review of the physical principles involved.\nAll light is emitted by atoms. The atoms in the filament of an electric bulb\nabsorb energy from electricity and re-emit it in the form of heat and light.\nSimilarly, if electricity is discharged through hydrogen gas, the hydrogen atoms\nabsorb energy from the stream of electrons (cathode rays) and re-emit it in the\nform of light and other electromagnetic waves.\n1\n\n2\n\nLASER TECHNOLOGY: A SURVEY\n\nThe way in which an atom absorbs and re-emits energy is governed by the\nenergy level that represents the stable state of each type of atom. When an\natom is struck by an electron of energy greater than that of its normal or\nground state, it may absorb some of that energy (depending on the energy level\nand the characteristics of that type of atom) and reach one of several possible\nexcited states.\nAn atom in an excited state may be compared to a stepped, compressed\nspring in which energy is stored, whereas an atom in its ground state is like a\nspring at its natural length.* Whenever an atom jumps from a high energy level\nto a lower one (as when a stepped, compressed spring is partially released), the\nenergy it loses is given up as a packet of radiation. This radiation consists of\nelectromagnetic waves with a frequency proportional to the difference between\nthe two energy levels. A hydrogen atom emits ultraviolet radiation when it\nfalls from its first excited state to the ground state. Visible light is produced\nwhen the atom descends from the second or higher excited state to the first,\nwhereas transitions that end on the second excited state produce infrared\nradiation.\nAlthough both radio waves and light waves are forms of electromagnetic\nradiation (differing only in their wavelengths), they are produced in different\nways. Light is produced in short bursts, each one called a wave packet or\nphoton. A radio wave is a continuous flow of energy. Although the light from\nan ordinary light bulb seems to provide steady illumination, it consists of billions\nof discontinuous photons.\nIn 1917, Albert Einstein proved in theory a fact of great technological\nsignificance. It was known then that an atom in an excited state would eventually decay to a state of lower energy and emit a photon of energy; this\ncontinuous process is called spontaneous emission. Einstein showed that\nemission could be stimulated to occur sooner if the atom in its excited state is\nstruck by an outside photon of exactly the same energy as the photon that is to\nbe emitted. This action causes two photons of the same energy to leave the\natom-the original photon and the stimulated one. Einstein also showed that\nthese two photons would leave together and travel in the same direction in\nphase with each other.\nThe process that Einstein described is the stimulated emission of radiation;\nthe fact that one photon enters the atom and two photons exit is a basis for\namplifying light waves. Until quite recently this possibility aroused little\ninterest because of the seemingly remote chances of controlling the process\n(which often occurs in less than 1/100 000 000 of a second). Then in 1954,\nthree American scientists, James P. Gordon, H. J. Zeiger, and Charles H. Townes,\nput the idea to practical use for the first time. They succeeded in amplifying\nmicrowaves, which are electromagnetic waves produced by transitions between\n*The comparison shows that whereas the spring changes from one energy state to another\ncontinuously, the atom changes in discrete jumps.\n\n3\n\nINTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY\n\nthe energy levels of the molecules in the same way that light is produced by\natoms. This new amplifying device was called the maser.\nIn 1958, Townes and Arthur L. Schawlow theorized that stimulated emissions could be used for amplifying light waves as well as microwaves. Two years\nlater Theodore H. Maiman constructed the first "optical maser," a ruby laser.\nAlthough several other types have since been developed (as discussed in\nchapter 2), the ruby laser is described below to illustrate laser operation.\nPRINCIPLES OF LASER OPERATION\nThe heart of the ruby laser is the pink ruby crystal; its chemical composition\nis aluminum oxide and chromium. Only the chromium ions participate in laser\naction; aluminum and oxygen are not active.\nFigure 1 illustrates a typical ruby laser. The cylindrical ruby crystal is\nsurrounded by a helical lamp (flashtube) that is flashed by discharging a\ncapacitor through it. The operation of this lamp is similar to that of the\nelectronic flash that photographers use except that greater energy is discharged.\nBoth ends of the ruby cylinder are polished flat and parallel. Its diameter may\nvary between 0.1 and 2 cm, and its length can range from 2 to 23 cm. Silver\ncoating is applied to make one end fully reflective and the other end partially\nreflective so that some laser light can escape (10 to 25 percent transmission is\ntypical). The degree of reflectivity, which depends on the length of the laser,\nthe intended application, and the excitation (flash) rate, determines the total\noutput obtainable.\nMost of the energy entering the flash lamp is dissipated as heat, but a fraction\nof it is emitted as blue and green radiation in the absorption band of the ruby.\nOUARTZ\nFLASHTUBE\n\nBEAM\n\nTRIGGER\nELECTRODE\n\nRUBY\nIPAR\nCOMPLETELY\nEND\nSILVERED\n\nFIGURE l.-The ruby laser\n\n525-862 0 - 73 - 2\n\nTIALLY\nEND\nSILVERED\n\n4\n\nLASER TECHNOLOGY: A SURVEY\n\nThe ruby absorbs this energy over a broad spectral region and funnels it into a\nnarrow emission line that is determined by the chromium ions. Radiation then\nemerges coherently through the partially reflecting end of the ruby at a wavelength that is dependent on the temperature. Because efficiency increases at\nlower temperatures, the ruby is often cooled to cryogenic temperatures to\ncounteract heat generated by the flash lamp.\nOperation of the ruby laser requires that the number of chromium atoms\n(population) in the excited state be greater than the number in the ground\nstate. This is referred to as population inversion because the normal situation\nis reversed. Supplying energy to achieve population inversion ("pumping") is\nthus accomplished by the flash lamp.\nThe ruby laser produces light in pulses, but a continuous laser beam is often\nmore desirable than a series of pulses. Continuous pumping energy is required\nto maintain a population inversion, which is difficult because of the large\namounts of energy pumped into the ruby crystal that cause overheating.\nTherefore lasers that use other types of active material, with differing energylevel characteristics, have been developed for continuous operation. These are\ndiscussed in chapter 2.\n\nCHARACTERISTICS OF LASER LIGHT\nThe beam from a laser is superior to light from a more conventional source\nin four respects: intensity, directivity, coherence, and narrowness of bandwidth. These characteristics are not independent because directivity and bandwidth are actually the latitudinal and longitudinal aspects of coherence. However, their practical consequences can be discussed separately.\nIntensity\nAlthough the total energy in the pulse from a ruby laser focused by a lens is\nnot very great, it is highly concentrated due to the nature of the stimulated\nemission process. Each atom is synchronized to add its contribution to the\nlaser beam at precisely the right moment, each photon is in phase with the rest\nof the beam, and the amplitude of the beam is increased as much as possible.\nIn a light bulb, the individual atoms produce their energy with random\ntiming. An atom of the tungsten filament is excited by electric heating, decays\nspontaneously emitting a photon, and then must be re-excited. This may\nhappen almost immediately, or it may take a long time. Meanwhile other\natoms are sending out photons in the same way. If the light produced by this\nprocess is focused on a steel plate, an irregular stream of photons will hit the\nplate one after the other not at precisely the same spot but over a relatively\nlarge area. The energy is spread over too long a time and too great an area to\nproduce much effect. A laser beam is so narrow and intense that several\nmillion photons strike a tiny point on the steel almost instantaneously.\n\nINTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY\n\n5\n\nDirectivity\nLaser beams used in eye operations are focused to spots only 1/10 mm in\ndiameter. Directivity of the laser beam is controlled by the mirrors at the ends\nof the optical cavity (which in the case of the ruby laser is the ruby crystal\nitself). A beam can easily originate from a direction not parallel to the crystal\naxis, and it may trigger off photons from atoms in its path, but eventually it\nwill pass out of the laser system. This may happen before it has reached either\nof the end mirrors or after one or two reflections; it will be only slightly\namplified because it will not have spent enough time in the crystal or cavity.\nOnly when the beam originates parallel with the crystal axis will the mirrors\nkeep it inside the cavity long enough to produce directivity as well as\namplification.\nCoherence\nThe term coherence as used here means that the separate light waves in the\nbeam are exactly in step with one another; i.e., they have the same phase. The\ndifference between coherent laser light waves and incoherent light waves that\nare emitted by a light bulb is shown in figure 2.\nLaser light is coherent because stimulated emission always produces a\nphoton that is in phase with the original light beam. The quality of coherence\nis important because it allows observation of the interference effects that occur\nwhen two or more wave trains from different directions overlap and interact.\n\nCOHERENT\n\nINCOHERENT\n\nFIGURE 2.-Coherent and incoherent waves\n\n6\n\nLASER TECHNOLOGY: A SURVEY\n\nThis phenomenon has many technological applications that could not be\nexploited until the advent of the laser (e.g., holographic interferometry).\nBandwidth\nThe last characteristic of laser light is its narrow bandwidth. All conventional\nlight sources produce light of more than one wavelength. A hydrogen lamp\nproduces a series of spectral lines which, if closely examined, are not sharp but\nspread over a band of wavelengths (hence the word bandwidth). This is a\nfunction of the energy-level characteristics of hydrogen atoms.\nLaser light from certain kinds of lasers is much more uniform in its wavelength content than any other kind of light, and this, too, has significant\ntechnological consequences. The narrow spread of wavelengths in the laser\nbeam, like its intensity and coherence, results from the special nature of the\ngenerating process. Energy-level characteristics of the chromium atoms in a\nruby, for example, cause an incident photon to stimulate another photon of the\nsame wavelength much more readily than one of slightly different wavelength.\nThus one wavelength from the band of possible wavelengths is built up to the\nexclusion of others.\nPRACTICAL USES OF LASER LIGHT\nThe usefulness of the laser can be seen in the variety of its applications.\nMany applications developed by NASA and others are discussed in chapter 2.\nIn chapter 3 possible future applications and the course that present research is\ntaking are discussed. Typical examples of the areas in which the laser has been\nused include ranging and altimetry, information transmission, biology and\nmedicine (molecular studies, surgery, and experimental pathology), metallurgy,\nand the garment industry.\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nApplication of Lasers\nThe phenomena and characteristics of lasers can be intellectually fascinating\nand reveal much to the scientist about the structures of atoms and molecules as\nwell as the nature of light. Lasers also offer solutions to problems in production\nand measurement that reduce costs as well as lead to new knowledge. Laser\ntechnology is commercial-today for some fields and in the foreseeable future\nfor others.\nIn this chapter current laser applications are described in relation to the\ntechnologies in which they are used. Two types of applications are omitted:\nlaser holography and optical data processing. These are to be treated in other\npublications.\n\nLASERS IN METEOROLOGY\nAmong the first and still major uses of lasers are range finding and altimetry.\nThe representative system described below was developed by the Manned\nSpacecraft Center for the Apollo Program. In the remainder of this section we\nwill survey laser measuring systems other than ranging.\nRange Finding and Altimetry\nThe laser device illustrated in figures 3 and 4 has been used as a low-altitude\naircraft altimeter and terrain contour mapper. Range is determined by measuring the time required for a laser pulse to travel to a target and return. After\nreflection from the target, a portion of each pulse is collected by a telescope\nand detected by a photomultiplier. Then a time interval meter measures the\nelapsed time between transmission and detection, and this time is visually displayed and recorded on magnetic tape for later computer processing.\nThe range finder was originally developed as an airborne terrain profilometer.\nBy continuously measuring the altitude (above ground level) of an aircraft in\nlevel flight, the profile (height and shape of hills and valleys) of the terrain\nbelow can be supplied. Up to 1000 range measurements are obtained each\nsecond, resulting in a nearly continuous terrain profile when the range finder\nis flown at a low speed and altitude.\n7\n\n8\n\nLASER TECHNOLOGY: A SURVEY\nTRANSMITTER\n\nRECEIVER\n\nFILTER\n\nPHOTOMULTIPLIER\n\nFIGURE 3.-Optical range finder and receiver\n\nDRIVER\n\nTRANSMITTER\n\nTMETER\n\nRECORDER\n\nFIGURE 4.-Operation of a range finder system\n\nThis system can operate with passive targets, measure the distance to the\ntarget with an accuracy of \xc2\xb130.5 cm (\xc2\xb11 ft), and has a maximum range in\nbright sunlight of about 76.2 m (250 ft). A 20-element gallium arsenide\n(semiconductor) laser diode array generates 50 nsec, 140-W pulses at rates up\nto 1000.\nFigures 5 and 6 are profiles of a field of lava rock and a dry lake bed measured during aircraft tests of the range finder at the White Sands Missile Range.\nThey illustrate how well the device operates over surfaces that vary widely in\nreflectivity. Reflectivity of the lava field was approximately 3 percent,\nwhereas the dry lake bed\'s reflectivity was greater than 50 percent. Both\ncontours were taken in bright sunlight.\nThe maximum range of this system (76.2 m) is by no means a present upper\nlimit. A laser range finder on Apollo 15 measured the distance from the spacecraft to the moon-a distance of approximately 111 km (60 n.mi.). Furthermore, a special reflector that was left on the moon by Apollo 15 allowed\nmeasurement of the distance from the earth to the moon-more than 370 000\nkm (200 000 n.mi.).\n\n9\n\nAPPLICATION OF LASERS\n\n+10\n\n-10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n600\n\n00\n\n70\n\n90\n\n100\n\n110\n\n120\n\n130\n\n140\n\n150\n\n160\n\n170\n\n180\n\n190\n\n200\n\n(FEET)\nLINEAR DISTANCE\n\nFIGURE 5.-Lava field profile\n\n-10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n60\n\n50\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n110\n\n120\n\n130\n\n140\n\n150\n\n160\n\n170\n\n180\n\n190\n\n200\n\n(FEET)\nLINEARDISTANCE\n\nFIGURE 6.-Dry lake bed profile\n\nLaser Doppler Flowmeter\nAnother meteorological application of lasers is the determination of the\nmotion and relative velocity of fluids by measuring the Doppler shift in the\nfrequency of laser light scattered from the fluid. This measurement is simple\nand precise; instantaneous velocities can be measured, and no mechanical\nVelocities\ncoupling is required between the flowmeter and the flowing fluid.\nas low as 0.01 cm/sec and as high as 1 km/sec have been measured. Figure 7\nillustrates a laser Doppler flowmeter developed at Lewis Research Center. Many\nvariations of this system are possible.\nThe flowmeter works as follows: Light from a helium-neon, continuousOne of\nwave, 632.8 n.mi. laser is divided into two beams by beam splitter B.\npasses through the beam splitter to mirror M1 where it is reflected\nthe beams\nto lens L1.

This beam passes straight through the flow chamber\nto the photomultiplier tube and serves as a reference beam. The photomultiplier\ntube detects, by optical heterodyning, the difference in frequency between\nthe two beams (Doppler shift), and this serves as a measure of the fluid\'s\nvelocity. The frequency difference can vary from a few hertz to a gigahertz\nand can be detected and processed with conventional electronics.\nSignificant advantages of the laser Doppler flowmeter are as follows:\n(1) No mechanical device in the moving field is needed;\n(2) The fluid flow is undisturbed;\n(3) Velocity can be measured at an easily controlled and very small point\n(about 10 pm long);\n(4) No calibration is required;\n(5) The method does not require physical contact; and\n(6) Measurements in physically inaccessible or hazardous locations are feasible.\nLaser Absolute Gravimeter\nA new and highly accurate measuring system, the laser absolute gravimeter,\nwas developed at the George C. Marshall Space Flight Center to measure the\nearth\'s gravity field.* The gravimeter uses a free-falling mass called a "bird"\nin a vacuum environment. The distance fallen and the time required for the\nbird\'s fall are both determined through use of a laser. From these data gravitational force can be computed.\n*This system is the invention of Dr. O. K. Hudson at Marshall Space Flight Center. Patent\nNo. 3 500 688 has been assigned to NASA (ref. 1).\n\nAPPLICATION OF LASERS\n\n11\n\nFigure 8 shows how the laser gravimeter operates. The laser beam is first\nprojected through a beam splitter. One beam is directed to a mirror in the falling bird from which it is reflected back to the beam splitter; the other beam is\ndirected to a stationary mirror and returned to the beam splitter. The two reflected beams are then combined by the beam splitter and directed to a photodetector that detects interference fringes between the two reflected beams and\nproduces an electronic pulse for each fringe. These pulses are automatically\ncounted and timed by an electronic counter and a high-precision stable oscillator; thus the rate at which the bird falls and the gravitational force are calculated.\nThe free-fall path is 66.9 cm and generates more than 2 million interference\nfringes.\nThe light beam originates from a helium-neon, continuous-wave laser that\nemits radiation at a wavelength of 633 n.mi. This monochromatic light is highly\ncollimated and has a beam divergence of 10 mrad; a collimating lens is also\nmounted on the laser to decrease further the beam divergence. A polarizing\nfilter can be adjusted for best fringe contrast. The laser unit has a power of\n100 AW and can maintain a frequency stability of +1 kHz per day.\nGas Temperature Measurement by Laser-Raman Scattering\nAnother application of the laser\'s unique properties is its use as a remote\nsensing probe. Some of these applications exploit the laser as an optical radar\ndevice (lidar) whose return signal results from the backscattering of laser light\nby gas molecules. Investigators have used backscattered light from a laser beam\n\nCORNER\nCUBE\nREFLECTOR\n15MM\nAPERTURE\n1 SECON\nOFARC\nPRECISION\n\nPRISM\nBEAM\nSPLITTER.\n25MM\nDOUBLE\nPRISM\n\nPHOTO0DETECTOR\n\nFIGURE 8.-Principle of operation of laser gravimeter\n525-862 0\n\n-\n\n73\n\n-\n\n5\n\n12\n\nLASER TECHNOLOGY: A SURVEY\n\nto observe remotely such meteorological variables as aerosol or particulate\nconcentration levels (refs. 2 and 3) in the air.\nThese experiments suggest that lidar techniques using Raman scattered light\ncould provide additional data on weather parameters. Such a system could remotely measure a local atmospheric temperature by simultaneously monitoring\nat least two portions of the Raman return signal from a major atmospheric\nconstituent and by examining the ratios of their intensities. The attractive\nfeature of this method is that if the frequencies of the measured Raman signals\nare relatively close, the effects of all extraneous variables (such as intervening\natmospheric phenomena) are essentially eliminated.\nAn instrument system constructed at Lewis Research Center demonstrated\nthe feasibility of using Raman return in a lidar system for measuring gas\ntemperature (ref. 4). It can measure the Raman spectrum of gaseous nitrogen\nover a temperature range of 2530 to 3130 K (-4O to 1040 F) at pressures ranging\nfrom 506.6 to 5066 N/cm 2 (English). The exciting light source is a continuouswave, argon-ion laser, tunable to a number of wavelengths by use of an\nintracavity Littrow prism. For the feasibility demonstration, it was operated at\na wavelength of 488 n.mi. and yielded about 200-mW power (fig. 9).\nAtmospheric Pollutant Detection by Laser\nTwo basic laser systems can sense certain molecular constituents in the\natmosphere. Both have potential usefulness as monitors of air pollution. One\nsystem involves visible or, preferably, ultraviolet radiation that interacts with\nelectronic transitions. The other uses infrared radiation that interacts with\ninternuclear vibration-rotation resonances.\nLidar systems that have been developed so far have used mostly visible or\nultraviolet radiation. They are usually confined to observing Raman scattering\nPHOTOMULTIPLIER IMAGING\nTUBE\nLENS\n\n4\n\n0\n\nE)\n\nTEST\nCELL\n\nCZERNY-TURNER\nGRATING\nMONOC MATOR\nHRO\n\nBEAM\nOPTICS\n\nCONTINUOUS-WAVE\nARGON-ION\nLASER\n\nI\n2\n3\n4\n\nCOLLECTION\nOPTICS\n\nIRECTING\nMIRROR\n5 COLLECTING\nMIBBOR\nPOLARIZATION\nROTATOR 6\nCOLLECTING\nLENS\nCONDENSING\nLENS\nIMAGING S\nLENS\nRETURN\nMIRROR\n8\nDOVE\nPRISM\nDEPOLARIZER\nO\n\nFIGURE 9.-Schematic of Raman spectrophotometer\n\n13\n\nAPPLICATION OF LASERS\n\n(a relatively weak interaction effect), although resonant Raman scattering,\nabsorption, or fluorescence could be observed if strong sources of ultraviolet\nradiation were developed with frequencies matching the strong excitation frequencies of the molecules. This has not yet been accomplished for many of the\nmajor pollutant molecules.\nInfrared lasers cover a broad region of the spectrum, and many of the laser\nemissions overlap absorption lines of various molecules (ref. 5). Pollutant\nmolecules could be detected in some substances by noting selective absorption\nof certain laser lines that pass through a path of interest in a double-ended\nsystem, or, in the case of monitoring smokestack effluents, by observing thermal emission lines with a remote heterodyne radiometer. For other applications\na single-ended system recording fluorescence from a pulsed infrared laser transmitter would be valuable for remote monitoring, because fluorescence provides\na more efficient return signal than Raman scattering.

Atmospheric turbulence will\nreduce the receiver\'s efficiency; however, receivers operating at a 5-pm wavelength with apertures as large as a meter in diameter have shown very little :loss\nin heterodyne efficiency over a range of kilometers.\nHeavy background concentration of a particular pollutant can hamper this\nreceiver\'s effectiveness in remotely monitoring emissions from a stack. This\n\n14\n\nLASER TECHNOLOGY: A SURVEY\nBEAM\nSPLITTER\n\nOR\nOSCAL\n\nPHOTODETECTOR\n\nAPERTURE\n\n:FIELD\n\nCOLLECTION\nAPERTURE\n\nLegend: D - diameter of the collection aperture\n- focal length of the lens\n\nFIGURE 11.-A heterodyne receiver system\n\noccurs largely because of thermal radiation absorption along the path from the\nstack to the receiver. However, the amount of absorption can be determined if\nthe receiver is first pointed away from the stack toward the background sky.\nThe type of remote detection system described here requires only a lowpower laser, producing a continuous-wave output of only a few milliwatts; it\nis a relatively simple remote laser sensing system. Infrared lasers can also detect\ncertain hydrocarbons in the atmosphere. Their sensitivities compare favorably\nwith Raman scattering lidar systems that require more laser power. The thermal\nemission heterodyne radiometer appears useful in remotely monitoring smokestack effluents, whereas a lidar system based on fluorescence could measure\nambient atmospheric concentrations and auto exhausts.\nPlasma Diagnostics by Laser\nInformation about plasma composition can be gained through standard\nemission spectroscopy, if the plasma sample is in a space enclosed by a thermionic diode. Ordinarily these techniques are limited to plasmas in local thermodynamic equilibrium, but the gas laser interferometer offers new possibilities\nfor probing the interelectrode space of the diode. It provides spatial resolution\nas good as emission spectroscopy and can measure electron density down to\n100 billion electrons per square centimeter or lower without relying on the\nexistence of local thermodynamic equilibrium.\nThe refractive index of the plasma is the parameter that is measured. Not\nonly free electrons but also ground-state and excited-state neutral atoms can\ncontribute to the index; however, application has been generally limited to\ninert gas plasmas in which the free electrons are the. chief contributors to the\nindex at the laser wavelengths used. The index comprises the sum of the\nindividual contributions of the plasma species and can be described in a dispersion equation involving the characteristic absorption frequencies of the atom.\nThe relationship between the plasma refractive index and particle densities for\ncesium is given in reference 6. Thus particle density may be obtained from the\n\nAPPLICATION OF LASERS\n\n15\n\nmeasured value of the refractive index. Such measurements were made by\nLewis Research Center by use of an apparatus described in reference 7.\nLaser Applicationin an Electro-Optical Plumb Line\nA highly successful application of the laser has been in the precise alignment\nof large structures, e.g., airframes, accelerators, pipelines, and machinery. Here\nthe laser\'s properties of straight-line propagation, small divergence, and coherence have come into play.\nIf it is necessary to lay a base line at a precise angle relative to the local\ngravitational horizontal, it can be done by mounting a laser in a surveyor\'s\ntransit and carefully directing the beam relative to the horizontal as defined by\nthe bubble level. However, if a vertical structure must be aligned, the problem\ngrows more complex. One solution is a gimbal-mounted, 900 prism that retroreflects the Fresnel reflections of its input and output faces back to the laser,\nforming a vertical output laser beam. A simpler and more accurate technique is\nillustrated in figure 12. Although it shows a planar laser cavity, any standard\nconfiguration can be used.\nThe distinctive feature of this device is the use of mercury as one cavity\nmirror. Cavity losses are high unless the two mirror planes are closely parallel.\nThus only when the output mirror and the mercury surface are parallel will\nlasing occur; and, in general, this will be along the true gravitational vertical.\nIn its simplest form, then, the azimuthal angle of the optical rail that supports\nthe discharge tube and mirrors can merely be adjusted until an output beam is\nobtained. This beam will automatically be aligned with local gravitational\n\nLASEROUTPUT\nTRUE\nVERTICAL\n\nMIRROR\nOUTPUT\n\nWINDOW\nBREWSTER\n\nTUBE\nDISCHARGE\nLASER\n\nFIGURE 12.-General configuration of a true vertical laser\nWINDOW\nBREWSTER\nIRIS\n\nMERCURY\nMIRROR\n\n16\n\nLASER TECHNOLOGY: A SURVEY\n\nfield lines, except for second-order effects, and hence can be used as an electro\nplumb line for precise alignment of vertical structures. A simple modification\nof this basic design would also indicate the levelness of the support on which it\nrests. Together with a servo system, it could then be used to monitor\na stable,\nhorizontal platform.\nAlthough mercury offers many simplifying advantages in this system, its use\nas a gravitationally sensitive mirror is not always convenient because of problems\nof vapor-pressure, sensitivity to vibration, and degradation of reflectivity at\nmany of the common, low-grain lasing media wavelengths and at high laser\nintensities. Figure 13 shows some alternate mirror configurations that are\ngravitationally sensitive but do not suffer from these disadvantages.\nFigure 13(a) illustrates a dielectric mirror floating directly in mercury or\nother liquid. If the mirror is to be normal to the true vertical, it must be of\nuniform density with upper and lower surfaces parallel. A more stable arrangement is shown in figure 13(b); figure 13(c) presents still another setup that also\ndamps out mirror oscillations. The latter configuration, used by the Electronic\nResearch Center (ref. 8), comprises a brass conical apex, a hollow plastic\nmidsection, and an aluminized mirror in a 50-percent glycerol-water solution.\nBy choosing a suitable liquid, almost any degree of damping can be achieved\nwith this system.\nMeasurement of Optical Thickness\nIn optics it can be important to measure the parallelism, or lack of parallelism, between the opposite surfaces of a transparent object. For example, the\n\nS(b\\\n\nFIGURE 13.-Gravitationally sensitive mirrors that can be used instead\n\ni\nS I\n\n\\\n\n\'\n\nof mercury: (a) mirror floating on mercury or other liquid,\n(b) conical mirror substrate\nresting on bottom, (c) similar\nto (b) except vibration damping provided by the surrounding viscous liquid\n\n17\n\nAPPLICATION OF LASERS\n\nelectro-optic response of optical crystal samples can be determined by measuring how wedge-shaped they are. This kind of parallelism can be measured\nwithin + 1/10 pm by use of a collimated monochromatic laser beam to illuminate\nthe object. Reflections of the beam are projected through a field lens, which\nin effect produces a contour map of the object\'s thickness. Figure 14 shows a\nschematic diagram of the apparatus and examples of typical patterns that are\nobserved through the field lens.\nMONOCHROMATIC\nLASER\nATTENUATOR\nCOLLIMATOR\n\nTESTED\nBEING\nOBJECT\n\nDISTANCE\nBETWEEN\nADJACENT\nRESENTS\nREP\n/4\nWAVELENGTH\n\nWEDGE\nSHAPED\n\nWEDGE\nLESS\nSHAPED\n\nNON-FLAT\n(IRREGULAR)\n\nFIGURE 14.-Schematic of optical thickness measurement\nPoint Coordinate Locator\nA computer and an ultraprecision laser-ranging apparatus have been linked\nin an accurate, easily operated optical measuring system to determine the point\ncoordinates on a photograph. A helium-neon gas, continuous-wave laser provides light for a null-balancing optical system that replaces the conventional\ndrivewire measuring system. No mechanical connection is required between\nthe ranging apparatus and the photograph. The system (fig. 15) consists of a\nmeasuring table, a manually positioned cylindrical mirror with centered crosshairs, the laser and associated optics, an electro-optical servo system, and an\nangular measurement and resonant system.\nRing Lasers\nLaser beam coherence is being exploited in the so-called laser gyroscope that\ndetects angular displacement or rotation. Its operation is based on the nature\nof the laser\'s optical cavity, which is enclosed between two semitransparent\nmirrors so that beams leave the laser in opposite directions. The beams travel\naround a closed optical loop directed by mirrors. One beam moves clockwise\nand the other counterclockwise (fig. 16), and they are then superimposed on\neach other.\n\n18\n\nLASER TECHNOLOGY: A SURVEY\nROTATABLE\n\nDIFFERENTIAL\n\nFLAT\nMIRROR\n\nAMPLIFIER\n-\n\nPOWER\n\nAMPLIFIER\n\nHe-Ne LASER-\n\n-\n\nPHOTOM\nULTIPLIERS\n\nI\n\nFILTERS\n\nSL\n\nANGULAR\n\nRESOLVER\n\nPROJECTION\n\n/\n\nRESLE\n\nCYLINDRICAL\n\n.ERROR\n\nSIGNAL\n\nSINA\nSIN 0\n\nSIGNAL\n\nGENERATOR\n\n/\n\nSIN (\n\nCROSS AIRS\n(TOPVIEW)\n\n900\n\nS FTER\n\nAREA\nSIN (\n\nANGLE\n\n+ )\n\nPHASE\nCOMPARATOR\nANGLE a SUN\n\nTABLE\nCOORDINATE\n\nFIGURE 15.-Point coordinate locator\n\nThe rotation of the optical loop results-according to the general theory of\nrelativity-in time dilatation for the beam traveling in the direction of rotation\nand in time contraction for the beam traveling in opposite direction. Consequently, the velocities of propagation for the two beams become:\nv = c-K and v2 =c+K\n\nwhere vt is the velocity of the beam traveling in the direction of rotation and\nv2 that of the opposite beam. In these two expressions c is the velocity of light\n(beams), when the optical loop is at rest and K is a function of the wavelength\nof the beams, the path length of the loop and the area enclosed by the loop.\nThe beam propagates slower in the direction of loop rotation and faster in the\nopposite direction. It appears therefore that the beam in the direction of\nrotation traverses a longer, and the opposite beam a shorter path, than the\nactual path length of the loop.\nThis frequency difference can be detected by electronic circuits if the two\nbeams are extracted and allowed to produce a series of interference fringes.\nThis can be done with a combiner prism as shown in figure 16. The fringe\npattern moves when the supporting table is turning or rotating, and the number\nof fringes crossing the detector each second is proportional to the angular\nvelocity of the rotation. Each fringe thus precisely represents an angle through\nwhich the supporting table has turned.\nThe great attraction of laser gyroscopes is their ability to sense extremely\nhigh angular velocities. A conventional gyroscope mounted in a vehicle that\nmakes a sudden turn will take several minutes to settle on the new bearing.\nLaser gyroscopes have no mechanical motors and respond instantly to a sudden\nturn. They also contain none of the magnetic- and temperature-sensitive ele-\n\n19\n\nAPPLICATION OF LASERS\n\nments found in conventional gyroscopes and can be started instantly, as\nopposed to a 15- to 30-minute startup time for conventional gyroscopes.\nThe laser gyroscope is also much more rugged than the conventional type, and\nits operation is not affected by the high accelerations encountered during\ntakeoff and maneuver of spacecraft and missiles.\nOPTICAL COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS\nLaser communication systems are the optical analog of radio systems used\nfor voice and television transmission. Although they are not yet commercially\npractical because of problems in propagation through the atmosphere, several\nsystems are in the experimental stages. Outside the earth\'s atmosphere, laser\ntransmission systems are already being successfully tested. A laser radar system\ncan determine the relative position and orientation between two spacecraft in\nflight. Lasers are also apparently feasible for communicating with satellites\nfrom the earth in regions where good visibility usually prevails. This was\ndemonstrated with the NASA satellite GEOS 2.\nInformation Transmission with Laser Beams\nTransmission systems that use laser light are a logical development of radio and\nmicrowave systems. In contrast with conventional communications, lasers have\nthe advantages of high directivity and a very wide range of possible bandwidths.\nThis means that large numbers of telephone conversations or a great many\ntelevision broadcasts can be transmitted and received simultaneously. Although\ndemonstration units have proven the feasibility of this technology, there are\nproblems with practical implementation, especially for terrestrial systems.\n\nMIRROR\n\nFRISM\n\nFIGURE 16.-Concept of laser gyroscope\n\n20\n\nLASER TECHNOLOGY: A SURVEY\n\nClouds, fog, rain, and snow interfere with optical transmission through the\natmosphere. Laser communications beyond the earth\'s atmosphere are likely\nto be perfected first. Figure 17 shows a typical communication system. A laser\noscillator generates a single wavelength of constant amplitude. Information in\nthe form of an electrical signal is then superimposed on the laser beam.\n\nLASER\no\n\nILLATOR\n\nMODULATOR\n\nTRANSMITTER\nTELESCOPE\n\nTRANSMISSION\nPATH\n\nRECEIVER\nTELESCOPE\n\nPHOTOELECTRIC\nDEMODULATOR\n\nELECTRICAL\n\nSIGNAL\n\nDEMODULATED\nMODULANELECTRICAL\n\nSIGNAL\n\nMODULATION\nAMPLIFIER\n\nELECTRICAL\nSIGNAL\nCHANNELS\n\nDECODER\n\nELECTRICAL\nSIGNAL\nCHANNELS\n\nFIGURE 17.-Laser communication system\n\nAll the methods of modulation used in electronics are possible, including\namplitude, phase, frequency, pulse-amplitude, pulse-phase, and pulse-code\nmodulation. The modulated signal is fed to a telescope (which performs the\nsame function as a radio antenna), or the narrow beam from the oscillator can\nbe transmitted directly. This signal is transmitted to the receiving antenna and\nis demodulated there in a photoelectric converter.\nLaser Radar System\nA Scanning Laser Radar (SLR) system to facilitate space vehicle\ndocking,\nrendezvous and station-keeping operations was developed by International\nTelephone and Telegraph for the Marshall Space Flight Center. The SLR not\nonly determines the relative position and orientation between two spacecraft\nbut can also provide basic data to the vehicle guidance, navigation, and control\nsystems on slant range between chaser-target vehicles, range-rate, pitch and yaw\nline-of-sight angle, and so on (fig. 18).\nThe advantage of laser over microwave radar is its directivity or beamwidth.\nThe beamwidth that is obtainable by any system is directly proportional to the\nwavelength and is inversely proportional to the antenna aperture. Inasmuch\nas the optical wavelength is four orders of magnitude smaller than that of\nthe\nmicrowave, a significantly smaller antenna size can be used for the same\nbandwidth.\n\n21\n\nAPPLICATION OF LASERS\n\nRECEIVER\n\n.\n\nCHASER SENSOR\n\nSBORESIGHT\n\nAXIS\n\nTARGETSENSOR\n\nLEGEND:\nXMTR - TRANSMITTER\nRCVR - RECEIVER\n\nCC. - CORNER CUBE\nF.O.V.- FIELD OF VIEW\n\nFIGURE 18.-System block diagram scanning laser radar\n\nThe major subsystems and associated key components of the SLR are\nsemiconductor\n(1) Laser Transmitter-diffraction-limited, gallium arsenide,\nlaser\noptics\n(2) Beam Steerer-piezoelectric beam deflector and amplifying\nreceiver optics\n(3) Receiver Optics-high-speed, narrow-band, refractive\n(4) Scanning Optical Detector-image dessector\n(5) Electronics-high-speed integrated circuits\n(6) Cooperative Target-optical corner cube reflector.\nThe SLR system also has potential as a low-rate optical communications\nrates of 5 to\nsystem.

In addition to search and acquisition, the\nsystem\'s electronically scanning transmitter and receiver can track rapid movements or accelerations of the target.\nComponents of the telescope assembly are contained in three aluminum\ntubes and a small electronics chassis that are supported by a bezel casting\nmounted directly on the elevation gimbal of a tracking pedestal. The transmitter\ntube contains the beam deflector, which can electronically steer the laser beam\nin two dimensions (fig. 19). The system\'s ultimate accuracy rests with the\nimage dissector contained in the receiver. The telescope in the central tube is a\nsimple Newtonian astronomical unit. Control electronics, system\nlogic circuitry,\nand power supplies are in an external container not shown in the figure.\nMultiple Wavelength Laser Radar\nA mobile laser radar system housed in an environmentally controlled van\n(fig. 20) was used at Langley Research Center to measure dynamic processes\ntaking place in the lower atmosphere (ref. 9). The laser and telescope were\naligned parallel and pointed at the zenith through a hatch in the van roof. A\nruby laser was used in this experiment with frequency doubler and a 16-in.diam Newtonian telescope collector (fig. 21). Outputs from a photomultiplier\nwere displayed on dual-beam, dual-trace oscilloscopes and were photographed.\nThe oscillograms were then analyzed by a film reader whose punched-card output was fed to a computer for processing and plotting.\nOptical Superheterodyne Receiver\nReception of amplitude-modulated (AM) signals through the atmosphere\nwas made possible by an optical superheterodyne receiver developed by\n\nIMAGE\nDISSECTOR\nIRANGE\nDETECTOR)\n\nMAGE\nECTO\n\nUSCOIL\nRECEIVER\nTUBE\n\nEFLECTION\n\nj\n\nBEAM\nSPLITTER\n\nBIMAGE\nI\nIVECINTERFERENCE\nROEC\n\nPARAEOLICMIERFO\nR------g\n\nCORNI.\nRSECOECTOR\nFILTER\nI\n\nINPUT\nLSERBEAM\n\nFIGURE 19.-Electro-optical tracking system\n\nAPPLICATION OF LASERS\n\n23\n\nFIGURE 20.-Mobile laser radar van\n\nMONITORE\n\nSLENERGY\nMOVABLE\n\nBEAU\n\nINTERERENCE\nINTERERENCE\nELITTFER\nFILTER\n\nMIRROR\n\nITT\nEN\nFILTER\n\nLENS\n\nDOBL\nER\nBEAM\nSPLITTER\nPHOTO\nOIOOE\nENERGY\nAY\nLASER\nMONITOR\n\nI\nI\nI/\nII\n\nINTERFERENCE\nFILTER\n\nEA\nI\nSPLITTER\n\nI\nk\nI\n\nINTERFERENCE\nFILTER\n\nI\nI\n\nPaHOTOt\nMALTIPLIER\n\nBOO1PRIMARY\n\nFIGURE 21.-Block diagram of experimental multiple wavelength laser radar\n\n24\n\nLASER TECHNOLOGY: A SURVEY\n\nSylvania Electronic Systems for the Marshall Space Flight Center. A laser\ncoupled to a frequency translator supplies both the incident and the local\noscillator signal in the receiver. Laser output is reflected to a beam director and\nthence to the remote retro-reflector (fig. 22). The return rays are reflected\nfrom the beam director to a parabolic mirror and then to a secondary beamforming mirror which directs the rays through the open center of the parabolic\nmirror to the adder. Simultaneously the local oscillator beam passes through\nthe frequency translator producing a frequency offset. This beam is focused\nonto a point that corresponds to the focus produced by the secondary mirror.\nThe collimated return rays are mixed with the local beam at the adder, and the\nresultant difference beat is detected by the photomultiplier and fed to the\noutput circuitry.\n\nATMOSPHERE\n\nBEAM\nFORMING\nLENS\n\nLO\n\nO\n\nTO\nRETROREFLECTOR\n\nLLASERTOR\n\nE\n\nFIGUR\n\nR\n\nPA22.-ptic\nRAheterodyne\n\nreceiver\n\nOPTICAL\n\nMLTIPLIER\nELRCTRONICS\nOATMT\n\nSECONARY\nBEM\nFORMING\nMIRROR\n\nAn Experimental Laser Communication System\nAlthough operation of optical communication systems is quite problematical\nbecause of the high attenuation of light waves through the atmosphere, the\nMarshall Space Flight Center has developed an experimental laser system to\nstudy the feasibility of such communication. The system consists of an airborne experimental package and a ground station, which are both equipped\nwith transmitting lasers and receivers to obtain data on uplink and downlink\npropagation. The ground station uses pulsed laser radar to locate the aircraft\nand to track it during the course of the experiment. The airborne package is\nalso capable of locating and accurately pointing its laser at the ground station.\nThe optical layout of the ground terminal is shown schematically in figure 23.\nIn addition, acquisition radar comprised of a pulsed argon laser, beam steering\noptics, and receiving electronics is mounted on and bore-sighted with a 0.6096-m\nCassagrainian telescope tube.\nThe airborne end of this communication link (fig. 24) views the ground station in a steerable mirror which is servo-controlled to point the outgoing beam\n\n25\n\nAPPLICATION OF LASERS\nPACKAGE\nCOMUNICTIONS\nTERMINAL\nGROUND\ntARO-\n\nS-\n\nTELESOPE\nf3OUR EFOCUS\n\nBEA I\nER\nRAFI\n8A\n\nT-R\n06I\nFOTOAE\ntR\n\nPLATFORM\nEXPERIMENTS\n\nf\n\n3-MINUTEARC\n\nv.\n\nVISIBLE\n\nDATA\nCOMMAND\nMOWLATORPOINT\nAHEAO\nSET\nPRIMS\nSIWATT\nSLER\n\nDICHROIC\nPLITTER\nBEAM\nTRSFERMIRROR\n4800\n\nZ\nSIGNAL\nx, YDEFLECTION\n\n0\n\n-T\nIGNAL\n\nSN\nSERVO\n\nCS\nPTR\nS\nCONTAND IN R\n\nTOP"\'\nELECTRONIKS\nRCVR\nX ERRORSIGNALS\'\n\nTRACKING\n\nCOS4\nR\n\nOPUTER\nFROM\nTO\n"SIGNALSAND\n\nFIGURE 23.-Ground terminal of laser communications system\n\nUPLINK\nB.S DRIVER\n\nINFORMATION\n\nPROCESSOR\n\nNOFILTER\nSENSOR\nTRACK\nACO,\n\nMO E\n\nBEAMSPLITTER\nBEADINTING\n\nDRIVEE\n\nSSERE\n\nMFILTER\n\niRIS\n\nBEAMFORMING\n\nMIRROR\nPOINT\n\nSENSOR\nLSRC\n\nACO.\nMODE\n\nDIV\n\nTVDRIVE\n\nG NCE\n-NTROL\n\nTOR\nDATTENUATOR\n\nREINTLL\nCORDER\n\nDIVE\n\nERRORR\nSCINTILLATION\nANGLE\n\nFIGURE 24.-Airborne terminal\n\n26\n\nLASER TECHNOLOGY: A SURVEY\n\nin the proper direction. During acquisition the mirror is pointed in the general\ndirection of the ground station. When the ground-based beacon illuminates the\naircraft, an acquisition sensor detects the upcoming beam and causes the system to enter a track mode. An image dissector provides tracking\ninformation,\nand a photomultiplier detects upcoming commands and measures scintillation.\nThe airborne transmitter is a helium-neon laser superimposed on the incoming\nbeam by means of a dichroic beamsplitter; the outgoing beam is pulse-code\nmodulated. Operation of the airborne terminal is controlled by signals sent\nfrom the ground terminal (ref. 10).\n\nLASERS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES\nInterest and activities in the development of laser systems applicable to\nmedicine or the biological sciences are quite impressive. Most of this work has\nbeen carried on outside NASA, particularly in the medical departments of\nseveral universities. The advent of the laser, with its special characteristics, has\nenabled researchers and medical practitioners to innovate surgical methods\n(ref. 11) and to conduct fundamental studies of the structure of\nmacromolecules,\ne.g., amino acids, proteins, and nucleic acids. This section cites a few examples\nto indicate the trends and the present concentration of efforts in laser technology as a tool in the life sciences.\nThe laser beam, interacting with living tissue, can be used as a surgical tool\nin delicate eye operations. By the same token it can also be harmful to inadvertently exposed organs. In the early days of laser research there were\nsome laboratory accidents which caused eye injuries. Scars and bubbles of gas\ncan result from a laser beam\'s disruption of eye tissue, and cataracts may begin\nto form when the lens of the eye absorbs energy of the wrong wavelength or\nwhen the power is too high. The risk of cornea damage is also present.\nOne of the most serious aspects of this problem is that damage occurs\ninstantaneously, and the researcher and the victim himself may not be aware\nthat it is happening. The degree of damage depends on the energy density and\nthe length of exposure. Although exposure time may be quite short with a\npulsed laser, the energy density is often high. If all the energy from a conventional ruby laser were to enter the eye, its density would be many hundreds of\ntimes greater than that used to form scars in detached retina operations, and\nabout 47 000 times as great as exposure to the sun for the same period of time.\nThe most extensive studies on laser radiation damage to living organisms have\nbeen conducted at Stanford Research Institute in Menlo Park, California.\nAlthough it is now common practice for anyone working with lasers to\nwear protective glasses, none the less these are not safe in laboratories in which\nlaser energy is converted to different wavelengths. Thus laser laboratories have\nenacted rigid safety codes designed to prevent damage to the skin and eyes.\n\nAPPLICATION OF LASERS\n\n27\n\nRetinal Coagulation\nThe retina of the eye is loosely attached to a choroid coat. The retina is of\nneurodermal origin, whereas the choroid is ectodermal. At the embryo stage\nthese two join and subsequently are held by a thin layer of connective tissue. In\nadults any number of circumstances, including trauma, can cause separation of\nthe retina from the body of the eye. This leads to a loss of vision because the\nlight cannot be properly focused on the detached retina.\nFor a number of years, retinas were surgically reattached by use of long\nneedle-like probes to weld the retina to the choroid with a scar (ref. 12). This\nworked quite well and allowed proper focus to be regained, but it produced one\nor more blind spots. In the 1950\'s the xenon photocoagulator was introduced.\nIt produced the same effect through a pulse of intense white light which, when\nfocused by the lens on the retina, resulted in reattachment by coagulated blood\nin a fashion similar to spot weld. But this method also had disadvantages. The\ndevice was very bulky, and its intensity was not high enough or specific\nenough to allow exposure times shorter than 1 sec. The wide light cone entering the eye sometimes caused damage to undesired sites, and uncertain reactions\nto white light required "overdoses" to achieve the correct response.\nMore recently, retinal repair has been accomplished with the high intensity\nof the laser beam. This method obviates all the disadvantages of the earlier\nmethods. At first ruby lasers were used; then neodymium and finally argon\nlasers were employed. The value of the argon laser over the xenon photocoagulator is the much smaller size of the spot weld that allows finer "stitching."\nIt is particularly valuable around the fovea-the area of the retina that controls\nacute vision. Neither anesthesia nor hospitalization is required (ref. 13).\n\nSkin Cosmetic Repair\nThe destructive effects of lasers have been harnessed for treating some skin\ndisorders. Inasmuch as laser light is preferentially absorbed by pigmented\ntissue, one of the first experiments was the removal of tattoos. The favorable\nresults led to further study, especially in the cosmetic treatment of angioma\n(an excessive proliferation of fine blood and lymph vessels in the upper skin\nlayers, which produces a reddish discoloration of the skin). The impact of a\nlaser can occlude the blood vessels and blanch the skin that leads to eventual\nhealing of the impact area and normal skin coloration.\n\nSkin Cancer\nExperimental treatment of skin cancers has also been based on laser light\'s\nquicker absorption by pigmented tissue. There are differences between normal\nand cancerous skin cells, and a search has been underway for a dye or pigment\nthat is completely selective for cancer cells. Although the research has not\n\n28\n\nLASER TECHNOLOGY: A SURVEY\n\nbeen completely successful, cancer cells can now be stained considerably\ndarker than normal cells. The darker cancer cells then absorb more light energy\nfrom the impact of a laser beam and are more severely damaged than normal\nunstained cells. Two types of cancer treatment with lasers have been practiced.\nA low-energy beam has been used selectively to disrupt tumor cells. Higherenergy beams are more suited for excising nodules from deeper tissues.\nTwo problems have arisen with this treatment. First, the plume of debris\nfrom laser impact contains viable cancer cells which pose a possible hazard to\noperating room personnel. Second, the impact drives some of the tumor cells\ndeeper into uninfiltrated tissue, thus spreading the cancer. The first problem\nhas been solved by placing a cone over the laser head to catch the plume from\nimpact. The cone may be attached to a suction device for vacuum cleaner\naction. The second problem may be overcome by improved techniques.\nBloodlessSurgery\nBloodless surgery with a laser scalpel is an outgrowth of the perfection of\ncobalt and argon ion lasers. The infrared radiation of cobalt and the green\nargon light interact dramatically with tissue making a "cut" in which vessels\nscar immediately. These techniques facilitate surgery on organs such as the\nliver and kidney in which blood loss is a problem. Although the use of highenergy argon lasers is still experimental, it may soon become standard for liver\noperations, with concurrent use of plastic adhesives to complete closure. Disadvantages of laser surgery are the development of smoke that impairs the\nsurgeon\'s vision and difficulties that are connected with healing of the charred\ncut. These may restrict it to certain special conditions.\nTransillumination\nTransillumination is a technique in which strong light is projected through\nsoft tissues to aid in detecting tumors. The skin is relatively transparent to\nlight and thus lasers may be useful for such examinations. Laser transillumination could allow immediate examination for breast cancer without the potential\nhazard or delay associated with x-rays.\nNeurosurgery\nNeurosurgery is another promising area for lasers inasmuch as they can\naccomplish the precisely controlled cutting that is important in this type of\nsurgery. Transsection and tumor treatment can also benefit from the use of\nlasers, and bloodless tumor removal may soon be within reach. The possibility\nof infection after operations on the gray matter of the brain may be reduced\nif lasers can be used.\n\nAPPLICATION OF LASERS\n\n29\n\nLasers in Dentistry\nAt the Cincinnati Children\'s Hospital Research Foundation, doctors have\nfocused a ruby laser beam into tooth cavities and produced extensive destruction\nof the decayed areas. Laser energy is absorbed by the dark, decayed parts of\nthe tooth but not by the healthy areas. Pulses of about a millisecond are enough\nto destroy the decayed areas so that there is no overall heating of the tooth and\nnone of the vibration associated with mechanical drills. It seems likely that\nlaser "drilling" can be carried out without anesthetics. Large, deep decayed\nareas can be drilled out by repeated firings of the laser, and cavities in inaccessible areas of the teeth can be treated by transmitting the laser beam through a\nflexible glass-fiber rod.\nResearchers at Cincinnati and elsewhere are also investigating the use of\nlasers to prevent tooth decay as well as to correct it. Decay is believed to start\nin minute cracks on the tooth\'s enamel which allow decay-forming organisms\nto spread to the more sensitive inner areas. A laser beam might seal a crack by\nfusing the enamel on each side. It may also be possible to use new, longer\nlasting materials for filling teeth; a laser beam can melt highly refractory\nmaterials such as porcelain and thus can be used to fill tooth cavities.\nA Laser Microscope\nA scanning microscope designed at Yale University can be used to study\nfundamental cell types imbedded in a thick, translucent body, such as a nerve\ncell buried within the brain. In ordinary microscopy these covering layers\nobscure and degrade the image of the object that is to be studied.\nOne recently designed microscope used ordinary light and a perforated\nrotating disk to scan the optical field (refs. 14 and 15). Although it eliminated\nunwanted reflections and allowed limited observation of brain cells and similar\ntissues, the image quality was too low for most biological investigations-only\n1/10 000 000 of the light reflected from the source reached the microscope\'s\neyepiece. A new microscope featuring a helium-neon laser light source (ref. 16)\nnot only uses light more efficiently but also allows maximum discrimination\nbetween planes of observation (fig. 25).\n\nExperimental Pathology\nExperimental pathology and biology often rely on separating or changing\none subsystem and studying the behavior of the altered total system. When\nthe interest is cell functions, intercellular entities as small as micrometers may\nbe excluded. One rather crude way to achieve this is to destroy the undesired\nis\npart. If a microscope is used for observation, an ideal destruction technique\nOnly optical tools are\nto apply laser pulses through the same microscope.\nneeded: The highly collimated laser beam can be pinpointed simply by aiming\n\n30\n\nLASER TECHNOLOGY: A SURVEY\nCOLLECTING\n\nSILVERED\nMIRROR\n\nPHOTOMULTIPLIER COMPENSATING\nGLASSPLATE\n\nADI O\nOBJECTIVE\nLENS\n\nOBJECT\nAE-AXIS\nEXIT ETRANSDUCER\n\nPLY\n\nDRIVE\n\nOPERATIONAL\n\nAMPLIFIER\n\nCOLLIMATING\nLENSES\n\nO\n\nFIGURE 25.-Schematic block diagram of microscope\n\nand can be focused to a spot only one or two wavelengths in diameter. The\nmethod is quick, which is a necessity since motion occurs and the response of\nthe biological system must be clearly separable from the impact of initial\npreparation. The single-wavelength feature of the laser can overcome deficiencies in microscope lenses (ref. 17).\nMolecularStudies in Biology\nGreater knowledge of molecular structure in cell biology has been gained,\nthanks to exploitation of the monochromatic property of laser beams in\nspectroscopy. When monochromatic light energy strikes a molecule, some\nlight is scattered, but part of the initial photon energy can also cause linear\nor rotational oscillations. This part of the energy is missing in the re-emitted\n(scattered) photon; hence the re-emitted light has a frequency (wavelength)\ndifferent from the original frequency. The impinging light can also make\nexcited molecules jump to a lower energy level. These phenomena result in\ntypical Raman lines centered around the original line in the spectrum; the line\nshifts are characteristic of the molecule\'s structure.\nIn normal spectroscopy these line shifts occur in the experimentally difficult\ninfrared region because the energy changes are so minute. The Raman effect\nlifts the lines up to the more practical visible spectrum, but investigation of\nRaman lines was difficult until the laser provided a well-collimated light source\nwith sufficiently narrow spectral width and high intensity to excite the samples.\nRaman studies that use laser techniques are now benefiting both cell biology\nand quantitative biology when modules must be identified.\n\nAPPLICATION OF LASERS\n\n31\n\nLasers in Cytology\nA new method for instantly and positively identifying micro-organisms and\ntissues is now possible with commercially produced laser instruments. First a\nsample is cooled to low temperature and irradiated with ultraviolet laser light.\nUnder these circumstances the sample itself produces phosphorescent light\nwhose frequency and decay time are characteristics of the organism. A small\ncomputer matches these data with information previously stored and immediately identifies the composition of the sample.\nThis example illustrates the bright prospects for broadening other areas of\nknowledge about cell functions through the use of lasers. Development of\ntunable lasers or lasers with different wavelengths will not only facilitate\nresearch on cellular activities but will also yield more information about the\nmechanism of laser radiation (refs. 18, 19 and 20).\nLASERS IN INDUSTRY\nIt was inevitable that laser light should find application in industry. The\nreason is simple: lasers have four characteristics that cannot be obtained\ncollectively from any other energy source, namely, monochromaticity,\ncoherence, high intensity, and minute beam divergence. The laser\'s success in\nindustry, especially in the metalworking industry, has also been greatly assisted\nby the improvements in reliability and durability of laser sources over the early\nmodels.\nMetallurgy\nLasers have become practical tools for the metalworking industry because\nfew substances can withstand the energy flux of a high-powered laser beam\nfocused to a density of up to 10 billion W/sq cm. Melting and vaporization are\nthe usual results, even with hard metallic alloys and ceramics. This fact has led\nto a variety of laser applications, from ordinary welding and machining to\nhighly sophisticated metallurgical experiments. The laser\'s flexibility is such\nthat it can be accurately focused in diameters ranging from a few hundred\nmicrometers to more than a centimeter, and the rate of penetration for a given\nmaterial is largely controlled by the level of energy concentration.\nThe exact mechanism of laser penetration, i.e., drilling is not known; however,\nmetallurgists are studying structural changes that occur in grains and fibers\nadjacent to laser-drilled holes. A laser beam cannot only cut or drill holes in\nmany materials (especially metals), but can also be used for other types of\nmachining and fabricating where high heat flux in a very small area is needed,\nsuch as metal-melting and evaporation in vacuum, microwelding, and cutting.\nMicrowelding has seemed attractive to industrial physicists. Although the\nlaser beam normally tends to vaporize rather than melt small amounts of metal,\nmelting alone will occur if the material that is to be welded is cooled. Laser\n\n32\n\nLASER TECHNOLOGY: A SURVEY\n\naction can thus create tiny molten surfaces that can be merged or fused as in\nordinary metal welding. Laser techniques have now superseded earlier experiments in the use of electron beams for small precision welds.\nWelding, like drilling, is a very old technique, but in the past two decades it\nhas been more refined. New alloys demand special conditions such as inert\natmospheres or argon or helium gas around the welding action. High-temperature electric arc and plasma gas torches are now common. Laser micromachining and microwelding are economically sound only when other, more conventional, processes fail. But when electrodes or physical contact are not desired,\nwhen the work must be done in air or in a controlled atmosphere rather than in\na vacuum, when dissimilar materials are used, or when minute quantities of\nhigh-melting-point metals are involved, then the laser technique is often the\nbest or the only solution to the welding problem.\nThe two sources most suitable for heavy metalworking are the ruby and\nneodymium lasers, both of which can produce pulses with high enough energies\nto remove large amounts of material. For most other metalworking applications,\nthe neodymium-yttrium (the rare-earth element neodymium in a host matrix of\nyttrium aluminum garnet) and the carbon dioxide lasers seem most favorable.\nThe carbon dioxide laser can be employed in a repeated pulse mode, whereas\nthe neodymium-yttrium laser can be used for some applications in continuous\noperation and for others in a repetitively Q-switched mode.\nQ-switched lasers produce high peak powers and have pulse lengths of the\norder of tens of nanoseconds. They operate by optically isolating the active\nmaterial from the end mirror of the laser cavity so that the population of\nexcited atoms is allowed to build up to a high level and store a great deal of\nenergy. The laser material is then suddenly opened to the mirror, and the stored\nenergy is released in one rapid pulse rather than over a longer period as is the\ncase in a normally pulsed laser. Q-switching decreases the total energy output\nbut compresses the pulse width so that peak power is much higher. It can be\naccomplished by inserting a Kerr cell or a bleachable liquid dye cell in the\noptical cavity between the laser material and the mirror (ref. 21).\nThe continuous neodymium-yttrium laser offers enough power for continuous seam welding. For spot welding the laser\'s focusing properties are of\nmost interest. Gas laser beams can be focused to dimensions about the same as\nthe light\'s wavelength; however, typical values for ruby and neodymium glass\nlaser pulses-the usual tools of spot welding-are about 300 Am with the use of\na simple lens. The beam can be shone through an aperture to produce a\nsmaller focal area, at the expense of total energy in the beam, but this does not\nincrease brightness at the focal area.\nWelding\nLasers can do welding that is impossible with other methods. Lasers can\nmake repairs inside transparent enclosures (such as vacuum tubes), reattach\n\nAPPLICATION OF LASERS\n\n33\n\nfilaments, restore plate continuity, and fuse grid leads. Laser welding also has\nbeen used to attach small insulated wires in electronic assemblies where the\nadvantage is that the laser beam vaporizes the insulation without leaving a\nresidue during the welding process so that the wire does not have to be stripped\nbefore welding.\nIn any laser welding application, heat input to the workpiece is very small\ncompared with other welding processes. This means that the size of the heataffected area and thermal damage to adjacent parts are held to a minimum.\nInasmuch as the heat source is a light beam, direct contact with the metal is\nnot necessary; inaccessible joints can be welded as long as a direct line-of-sight\nexists. The beam\'s high-power intensity can be used to make difficult welds\nbetween dissimilar metals with high electrical resistivity or between nonconductive materials.\n\nDrilling\nLasers have been used successfully to drill alloys of gold, silver, copper,\nnickel, iron, aluminum, titanium, molybdenum, tantalum, columbium, zirconium, and tungsten. Nonmetallic materials like diamonds, rubber, plastic,\nand wood can also be drilled by lasers. Although some of these materials have\nnearly 98 percent reflectivity at the laser wavelength, high-peak powers can\nremove substantial amounts of material. Nearly all metals and nonmetals can\nbe drilled when the desired result is a small hole through an area a fraction of\nan inch thick. If the workpiece is moved while the laser beam is firing, the\nbeam will cut a slot. If the material is only a few mils thick, the slot will\npenetrate it completely; in thicker materials it will cut a groove.\n\nMachining\nThe noncontact nature of laser machining is especially suited for taking\nmetal from a moving object. Frequency tuning of quartz crystal resonators\nis accomplished by selectively vaporizing a thin layer of gold deposited on the\ncrystal. As gold is removed, the resonant frequency of the crystal increases.\nLack of mechanical contact permits tuning of the resonant frequency while the\ncrystal is operating in an active electronic circuit.\nAnother laser application for metal removal is in balancing operations. A\ndynamic balancing machine detects imbalance and transmits an electronic signal\nto laser control circuitry. The laser fires at the proper instant, removing metal\nfrom heavy spots on the rotor while it is spinning. Repeated shots are fired\nuntil sufficient metal has been removed to bring the rotating device into\nperfect balance. This process can correct imbalance in a component such as an\narmature, in the construction of a gyro, or in the balance wheel of a timepiece.\n\n34\n\nLASER TECHNOLOGY: A SURVEY\n\nPhotographicPlatemaking\nThe halftone photographic plates used in printing apply ink to paper from a\nsurface that stands out physically above the background on the plate. In the\npast, chemical methods were used to eat away the background after the desired\nareas were coated with an acid-resisting material. Now electronically controlled\ntools have been used to gouge out the background areas from metal or plastic\nplates. These tools are driven by signals from a photoelectric cell that scans the\npicture to be printed. This principle has been advanced with the use of computer-controlled laser pulses to etch the plates in a few seconds-far quicker\nthan conventional methods. When a pulsed laser beam is focused to a point on\na metal surface, a fragment of the metal is vaporized leaving behind a small\ncone-shaped crater. Repeated pulses from the laser beam burn a series of\ncavities in the plate\'s surface leaving the untreated areas at a higher level on\nwhich to take the ink for printing.\nMachine Tool Industry\nThe distance-measuring capability of the laser has been utilized in precise\ncalibration and verification of measuring tapes and scales. In an industrial system that is now being used the calibration accuracy is 0.000254 mm (0.0001 in.).\nThe laser has also been employed for tool positioning in a numerically controlled machine tool. The final tool position accuracy in one commercially\navailable system is 0.00079 mm, a significant improvement over other systems.\nGarment Industry\nIn the garment industry the laser\'s potential has been recognized. A computer-driven garment cutter using a laser beam was placed in operation by a\nmanufacturer of men\'s suits. The laser unit cuts garments one at a time, up to\n15 to 20 per hour, to tolerances of a single thread width. Mechanical cutters\ncan match the laser system\'s speed only by cutting 20 to 25 layers of cloth at a\ntime-a process plagued by inaccuracies and waste of material (ref. 22).\nThe laser cutting system has four components: a computer that stores\npatterns and cutting instructions, a laser positioning device, the laser, and a\nfabric conveyor. A single layer of material is unrolled from a bolt and moves\nalong the conveyor until it is directly under the positioning device. The computer then turns on the laser beam and maneuvers it above the cloth following\nany complex pattern that is stored in the computer.\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\nPossible Future Developments\nNEW PUMPING METHODS\nAmong the fields in which development and innovation in laser technology\ncan soon be expected are the new methods of pumping. Improved techniqdes\nare constantly being sought because flash lamp pumping of solid-state crystal\nor glass lasers is relatively inefficient. Both Government and industrial laboratories, e.g., the Naval Research Laboratories and North American Aviation\nCorp., are now working on new chemical pumping techniques which are based\non the fact that light and heat generated by certain chemical reactions is\nintense enough to induce lasing action in selected materials.\nThe idea of using the radiative energy of a chemical reaction as pumping\nenergy has also triggered another pumping idea: the use of nuclear heat as a\ndirect heat source for a laser (ref. 23). In this scheme, heat from a nuclear fuel\nis transferred to a cathode, and electrons are emitted thermally into a gas\nlamp, tube, or diode built to act as the laser itself. The virtue of the nuclear\nsystem, as well as with the chemically pumped lasers, is the elimination of an\nexternal electrical power supply for pumping action.\nThe sun has also been suggested as a pumping source, and experiments in\nthis area have been described in many papers and articles. By use of reflected\nenergy from a lightweight parabolic solar concentrator, a proprietary device\ndeveloped by Electro-Optical Systems, Inc., has produced a continuous-wave\noutput of 25 mW at 3000 K (5400 F) in ground-level sunlight; in space, sunlight could produce 1 W of continuous wave output. Another suggested\nmethod of pumping is the use of exploding wires that will emit brief, sharp\nbursts of light to trigger laser action in a suitable receiver.\nNEW LASER MATERIALS\nProbably the most extensive progress in laser development will be made in\nthe selection of new materials for laser emitters. These will be chosen for their\nversatility, reasonable production cost, stability, and efficiency in producing\nlight amplification. The hope of attaining a wider wavelength coverage is\none important stimulus in the search for new materials. Conversion efficiency\nis another strong motivating force.\n35\n\n36\n\nLASER TECHNOLOGY: A SURVEY\n\nThere are certain gas lasers in existence that require no external pumping,\nand further rapid development can be expected. These are the so-called gas\ndynamic lasers, which use supersonic flow to remove waste energy-the key to\nhigh average-power devices. The high-temperature, high-pressure stagnation\nconditions that are required to achieve such flow also thermally excite the laser\nmedium.\nThe carbon dioxide gas dynamic laser starts with a volume of the proper\ncarbon dioxide laser mixture at sufficiently high temperature and pressure to\nensure significant population of the upper laser level. This population\ndistribution is in thermal equilibrium, so that stimulated emission cannot occur.\nThe gas is then rapidly expanded through a supersonic nozzle within a period\nshorter than the lifetime of the upper laser level. At the same time, water vapor\nor helium is added so that the lower laser level cools within a time period\ncomparable to or shorter than the expansion time. The result is that several\nmillimeters downstream from the nozzle a population inversion exists between\ntwo levels of carbon dioxide. This gas can be heated by igniting a gas mixture\nof carbon dioxide and some nitrate in a combustion chamber. The pulsed\nlaser action that results can generate about 20 J of energy at 0.3-sec pulse\nduration. Further developments will increase this laser energy. Plasma physicists will no doubt give some impetus to research in extremely high peak-power\nlasers with high-energy content. Such pulses, focused on small solid targets,\ncan produce clean, high-density, high-temperature plasmas.\n\nNEW LASER APPLICATIONS\nAlthough we cannot foresee the development of all new laser applications,\nwe can predict with confidence that laser solutions for many technical problems\nwill be found by laser technologists who are also knowledgeable about the needs\nof other fields. A good example of this matching of problem to possible\nsolution is a suggestion advanced by the Marshall Space Flight Center to\nmonitor wingtip vortices on airport runways. These vortex wakes can cause\nunsafe flying conditions for several minutes after an airplane has taken off or\nlanded, and appropriate warnings to other aircraft that use the runway are\nnecessary. Although in time the vortices will decay and move off the\nrunway,\nuncontrollable variables such as crosswind speed can influence the duration of\nthe vortex hazard.\nThe proposed solution is a network of laser beams passing over the runway.\nLasers and detectors mounted on towers or poles (rigid or telescoping) are\npositioned along the runway, and the laser beam is directed across the path of\nthe aircraft to photodetectors on the opposite side. A vortex wake passing\nthrough one or more of the beams in the net is detected by continuously\nmonitoring the difference between two rms values of the composite signal, one\naveraged over a much longer time than the other. The path of the beam from\nthe laser to the detector will be a straight line only when the air is undisturbed.\n\nPOSSIBLE FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS\n\n37\n\nIf, during transmission from laser to detector, the beam encounters density\ngradients, it will be deflected from its undisturbed path, and the magnitude of\nthe deflection can be related to the magnitude of the density gradients\nencountered. A go/no-go decision for takeoff and landing can then be made\nfrom a visual display of the laser beam deflections.\nThe U.S. Department of Transportation\'s Systems Center has suggested to\nthe Coast Guard a laser system that would automatically and remotely detect\nthe presence of coastal fog banks. The Coast Guard now uses the so-called\nvideograph backscatter meter as a fog detector, however this detector becomes\nunreliable in a fog bank that renders the atmosphere inhomogeneous. If the\nfog bank lingers a few thousand feet off shore, the videograph will indicate good\nvisibility even if the fog bank obscures the view of mariners. The Transportation Systems Center recommended optical backscattering methods for fog\nbank detection using a laser radar (lidar) system. Optical backscattering correlates well with the extinction coefficient of a distribution of particles, which\nis the structure of fog banks (refs. 24 and 25). The use of lasers in fog bank\ndetection also indicates its potential for more general uses in meteorology.\nAdvances can also be expected in making laser systems feasible for longdistance communications. Such systems will almost certainly use pipes of\nsome kind to transmit the beam and obviate attenuation loss through the\natmosphere. Electromagnetic waves can be guided through a pipe in several\nways. In one, the wave is reflected back and forth between highly reflecting\nwalls, following a zig-zag path about the central line of the tube. The tube can\nbe filled with inert gas and, if the gas and wavelength are suitably chosen, the\ngas will not attenuate the waves. Losses will occur at each reflection, but these\ncan be reduced by precise manufacture of the reflecting walls. This type of\nguide has been used for microwave transmission, but transmission of optical\nwaves requires a high degree of refinement.\nFuture laser systems may be applicable to earthquake prediction measurements. It is known that strain-rate changes occur along a geological fault,\ncausing certain motions of the fault that are followed by quakes in 2 to 18\nmonths. Geodetic laser survey systems could measure the motion of a fault,\nthus providing a means for predicting earthquakes.\n\nCOST AND AVAILABILITY\nNothing has been mentioned about two questions that any potential user\nwill ask-where a laser can be bought and how much it will cost. The cost of a\nlaser is very much a function of its power and whether it is a pulsed laser or\na continuous laser. Simple pulsed lasers are now used as experimental tools\nin school laboratories. They can be bought for less than $100 from several\nscientific supply houses. More powerful lasers are available from many companies that advertise in trade journals (see the list of journals in the Appendix).\n\n38\n\nLASER TECHNOLOGY: A SURVEY\n\nDeveloping a new laser is a costly, time-consuming process that requires the\nskills of physicists, metallurgists, chemists, and engineers. However, if a\npotential application for a laser can be devised, it may not be very costly to\npurchase one and to develop the ancillary equipment required. Many laser\nmanufacturers assist interested persons in developing new applications; their\nexperience can also help avoid costly false starts. A developer should check\nto determine whether his application has already been patented. Many applications have been patented, but others are available at no cost from NASA or\nother Government agencies. Several companies that manufacture lasers keep\nup-to-date listings of laser patents and may be willing to share this information.\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nInformation Sources\nIn addition to the various NASA Centers and the U.S. Department of\nTransportation Systems Center, the following facilities were used for literature\nsearches and information gathering:\nKnowledge Availability Systems Center\nUniversity of Pittsburgh\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213\n\nLibrary and Physics Faculty\nUniversity of Delaware\nNewark, Delaware\n\nLibrary of Congress\nWashington, D.C.\n\nLaser Laboratory\nIBM Federal Systems Division\nGaithersburg, Maryland\n\nLibrary and Physical Laboratory\nUniversity of Maryland\nCollege Park, Maryland\n\nLibrary and Physics Faculty\nColumbia University\nNew York, New York\n\nLibrary and Physics Laboratory\nPennsylvania State University\nUniversity Park, Pennsylvania\n\nThe Library of Congress is an accessible and extensive source of literature\nand data search, and consequently, it is recommended to anyone interested in\nobtaining more detailed information on laser technology.\nThe following periodicals are used by laser researchers for publication\npurposes:\nAmerican Institute of Aeronauticsand AstronauticsJournal\nAmerican JournalofPhysics\nApplied Optics\nApplied Physics Letters\nBell System TechnicalJournal\nElectronics\nElectronicsDesign\nInternationalBusiness Machines Journal of Research and Development\n39\n\n40\n\nLASER TECHNOLOGY: A SURVEY\nInstitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Transactions on Electronics\nJournalof Applied Physics\nJournalof the OpticalSociety of America\nJournalof Spacecraftand Rockets\nLaser Focus\nLaser Sphere\nPhysicalReview\nPhysicalReview Letters\nProceedingsof Institute of Electricaland ElectronicsEngineers\nReview of Scientific Instruments\n\nGlossary\nBrewster window-An aperture through which light can enter into a new medium at an\nangle to the interface such that\ntan O = nb\nB\n0\nwhere B is the Brewster angle. nb and na are the indices of refraction of the media a\nand b, and light enters b from a.\nEnergy (or work)-That which is exchanged when a force acts through a given distance in\n2\nthe direction of the force.

These relations apply when the scattering particles are much smaller than the wavelength of the radiation. Thus the sky is blue because blue light is scattered more than\nred. The unscattered light is, of course, complementary to blue, ie., orange or yellow,\nwhich explains the "warm" hues of the sunset.\nTemperature-lo ceritigrade is defined as one-hundredth of the temperature interval\nbetween freezing point and boiling point of water under one normal atmosphere of\npressure.
