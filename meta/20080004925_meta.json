Using vision sensors mounted on the mobile system and the manipulator, the system establishes a relationship between the internal joint configuration of the holonomic degrees of freedom of the manipulator and the appearance of features on the manipulator in the reference frames of the vision sensors. Then, the system, perhaps with the assistance of an operator, identifies the locations of the target object in the reference frames of the vision sensors. Using this target information, along with the relationship described above, the system determines a suitable trajectory for the nonholonomic degrees of freedom of the base to follow towards the target object. The system also determines a suitable pose or series of poses for the holonomic degrees of freedom of the manipulator. With additional visual samples, the system automatically updates the trajectory and final pose of the manipulator so as to allow for greater precision in the overall final position of the system.", "title": "Mobile camera-space manipulation", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-24T08:18:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20080004925, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Seelinger, Michael J."}, "organization": {}}, "id": "18541bbc82554ac6a2ba81bec03cbb0b"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20080004925, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Yoder, John-David S."}, "organization": {}}, "id": "f30fd4be7a2d464b88e43bbee0c25ab9"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 20080004925, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Skaar, Steven B."}, "organization": {}}, "id": "87fec058f55343f8b5af8c717fa22d1a"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other - Patent", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20080004925, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20080004925, "id": "5e089618ac314f4e918fe4732ab20de3", "publicationDate": "2001-02-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20080004925.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20080004925/downloads/20080004925.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20080004925/downloads/20080004925.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20080004925/downloads/20080004925.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
