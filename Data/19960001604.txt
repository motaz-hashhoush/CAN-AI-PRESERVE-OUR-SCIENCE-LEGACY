Various embodiments of the invention include a spiral, intercoiled electrode geometry\nand an electrode geometry having substantially circular, concentric electrodes which are interposed. These\nelectrode geometries result in photodetectors with\nlower capacitances, dark currents and lower inductance\nwhich reduces the ringing seen in the optical pulse\nresponse.\n9 Claims, 4 Drawing Sheets\n\nU.S. Patent\n\nSep. 19, 1995\n\nSheet 1 of 4\n\nI\n\n5,451,769\n\nU.S. Patent\n\n0\n\nM\n\nSep. 19, 1995\n\nSheet 2 of 4\n\n5,45 1,769\n\nU.S. Patent\n\nSep. 19, 1995\n\nSheet 3 of 4\n\n5,451,769\n\nU.S. Patent\n\nSep. 19, 1995\n\n5,45 1,769\n\nSheet 4 of 4\n\nf\n\n86\n\n50\n\n90\n\na7\n9\n\n85\n\nFIG. 4(a)\n\nFIG. 4(b)\n\n1\n\n5,45 1,769\n\n2\n\nshape of the interdigitated, electrode geometry, MSM\nCIRCULAR ELECTRODE GEOMETRY\nphotodetectors is therefore not matched to these\nMETAL-SEMICONDUCTOR-METAL\nsources.

The rectangular\ntector shape and the shape of the optical beam, and has\n\nFterdigtated\n\n3\n\n5,45 1,769\n\nthe added advantage of reducing the inductance of the\ndevice, when compared to the rectangular electrode\narray, as a result of the opposing direction of current\nflow through the two arms of the spiral. This lowered\ninductance results in a reduction of ringing seen in the 5\noptical pulse response. The spiral geometry also results\nin lower capacitance and dark current.\nIn an alternate embodiment illustrated in FIG. 3,\nlower capacitances have been obtained when compared\nto conventional, rectangular electrode arrays. In this 1\n0\nembodiment, each electrode has a number of substantially circular, concentric branches and the branches of\neach electrode are interposed without contacting each\nother. The circular electrodes are not fully closed,\nforming a split-ring structure, in order to accommodate l5\nthe interconnect structure for each electrode needed to\nprovide the proper bias potential and carry the signal\ncurrent to an external circuit.\nLocated within the concentric rings of the circular\nelectrode structure is a central disk. If this disk were 2o\nabsent, carriers generated in the central region would\nencounter very low electric fields and be very slowly\ntransported to the innermost electrode. The result\nwould be a significantdegradation of the response time.\nThe split-ring type structure for the electrodes is easiest\n25\nto fabricate, however, other embodiments, such as\nclosed rings with a multilayer dielectric isolation containing via holes for the interconnect structure, as illustrated in FIG. 4, are possible.\nAlthough MSM photodetectors are typically fabri- 3o\ncated using materials such as GaAs or InGaAs as the\noptically active semiconductor material, any other material can be used on which can be formed patterned\nelectrodes that exhibit rectifying behavior (Le.,\nSchottky contacts) or non-rectifying behavior (i.e., 35\nohmic contacts) and which absorb light in a desired\nwavelength. Such materials may include Si, Sic, AlGaAs, AlN, GaN, AIGaN, BN, ZnSe and HgCdTe. In\nlike manner, any electrically conductive material that is\ncapable of forming Schottky contacts or ohmic contacts 40\nwith the semiconductor layer may be used for the electrodes. Some typical metalization schemes which are\ncommonly used include TVAu, Ti/Pt/Au, AI, Cr/Au,\nNi/Au, Pt/Au, W/Au and Ag.\n\n4\n\nwavelength. Such materials may include GaAs, InGaAs, Si, Sic, AlGaAs, AIN, GaN, AIGaN, BN, ZnSe\nand HgCdTe. The electrodes can be any electrically\nconductive material which can be formed into patterned electrodes and which are capable of forming\nSchottky contacts or ohmic contacts with the semiconductor material. Typical metalization schemes which\nare commonly used for electrodes include Ti/Au, Ti/Pt/Au, Ai, Cr/Au, Ni/Au, Pt/Au/W/Au and Ag.\nFor convenience of illustration, the semiconductor\nlayer is represented as a rectangular area slightly larger\nthan the area covered by the electrode pattern. It is\nunderstood by those of ordinary skill in the art, however, that the semiconductor layer can actually be much\nlarger than the area covered by the electrode pattern.\nThe only limitation on the size of the semiconductor\nlayer is that the semiconductor layer can not have an\narea that is less than that spanned by the electrode pattern. This semiconductor layer can be a simple active\nlayer, as depicted in the enclosed figures, or any of a\nnumber of appropriate heterostructures that are well\nknown in the art.\nThese spiral electrodes 40 and 42 turn in the same\ndirection and are parallel to each other for the entire\nlength of the spiral, resulting in interpositioning of one\nspiral electrode within the spiral of the other electrode.\nThe space between spiral electrodes is maintained essentially constant and the two electrodes are not in\ncontact with each other at any point along their length.\nThe end of each electrode that extends beyond the\nspiral connects to a bonding pad 44 or other device as\npart of a circuit or more complicated optoelectronic\nsystem. Any suitable external voltage source (not\nshown) may be used to bias the electrodes.\nIn the alternate embodiment shown in FIG. 3, a first\nelectrode 60 is disposed on the surface of an optically\nactive semiconductor material 50 and is comprised of a\nfirst element 65 which intersects a plurality of substantially circular second elements 66 and 67.
