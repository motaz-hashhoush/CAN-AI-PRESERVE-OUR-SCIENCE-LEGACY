These requirements are supported by a large experimental data base. The challenge to the flying qualities community is to demonstrate how flying qualities, the control system and aircraft configuration are still closely linked. This is evident in the definition of flying qualities and, as far as pilots are concerned, that flying qualities are still the measure of overall design success.", "title": "Flying qualities research challenges", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-13T15:26:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19880046867, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Sliwa, Steven M."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Langley Research Center", "location": "Hampton, VA, United States"}}, "id": "2ac4b5edffaa4d1da9df688dc56477f1"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19880046867, "meta": {"author": {"name": "George, Frank L."}, "organization": {"name": "USAF, Wright Aeronautical Laboratories, Wright-Patterson AFB", "location": "OH, United States"}}, "id": "4b71c57595484f39a5856fe01b405463"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 19880046867, "endDate": "1987-05-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "NAECON 87", "location": "Dayton, OH", "id": "72cd173b18504900aa7f00a6f8b14bff", "startDate": "1987-05-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "id": 19880046867, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19880046867, "id": "73f85676c4104cbdbf27fd74a395e69e", "publicationDate": "1987-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
