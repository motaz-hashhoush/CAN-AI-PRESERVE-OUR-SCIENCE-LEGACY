The objective of such a reduction is to minimize the hazard to smaller aircraft that might encounter these wakes. Inviscid modeling was used to study trailing vortices and viscous effects were investigated. Laser velocimeters were utilized in the measurement of aircraft wakes. Flight and wind tunnel tests were performed on scale and full model scale aircraft of various design. Parameters investigated included the effect of wing span, wing flaps, spoilers, splines and engine thrust on vortex attenuation. Results indicate that vortives may be alleviated through aerodynamic means.", "title": "Wake Vortex Minimization", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-03T18:16:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Proceedings", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19780004074, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19780004074, "id": "d4215f6e67a240a5b20e521e27672d5a", "publicationDate": "1977-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19780004085, "type": "ANALYTIC_SUBSIDIARY", "title": "Vortex attenuation flight experiments", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}, {"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19780004083, "type": "ANALYTIC_SUBSIDIARY", "title": "Aircraft wake-vortex minimization by use of flaps", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}, {"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19780004082, "type": "ANALYTIC_SUBSIDIARY", "title": "Ground development and flight correlation of the vortex attenuating spline device", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}, {"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19780004075, "type": "ANALYTIC_SUBSIDIARY", "title": "Inviscid modeling of aircraft trailing vortices", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}, {"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19780004077, "type": "ANALYTIC_SUBSIDIARY", "title": "Ground-based facilities for evaluating vortex minimization concepts", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}, {"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19780004080, "type": "ANALYTIC_SUBSIDIARY", "title": "Unsuccessful Concepts for Aircraft Wake Vortex Minimization", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}, {"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19780004079, "type": "ANALYTIC_SUBSIDIARY", "title": "Flight test techniques for wake-vortex minimization studies", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}, {"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19780004084, "type": "ANALYTIC_SUBSIDIARY", "title": "The development and use of spoilers as vortex attenuators", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}, {"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19780004076, "type": "ANALYTIC_SUBSIDIARY", "title": "Viscous effects in aircraft trailing vortices", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}, {"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19780004078, "type": "ANALYTIC_SUBSIDIARY", "title": "Application of laser velocimetry to aircraft wake-vortex measurements", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}, {"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19780004081, "type": "ANALYTIC_SUBSIDIARY", "title": "Thrust-augmented vortex attenuation", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19780004074.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19780004074/downloads/19780004074.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19780004074/downloads/19780004074.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19780004074/downloads/19780004074.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
