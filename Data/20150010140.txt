A heavily instrumented aircraft will be\nflown into deep convective clouds to measure the cloud properties, namely the ice water\ncontent and ice crystal particle size and shape.\nEngine Icing Performance Simulation: This effort will develop a modeling and\nsimulation tool to estimate the flow field in the fan and low pressure compressor of a\nturbine engine throughout the complete flight trajectory. The tool consists of an engine\nthermodynamic cycle code, coupled to a compressor flow analysis code. The detailed fluid\nconditions including pressure and temperature are estimated in each blade row. These will\nbe used as BCs in the ice accretion model to estimate ice accretion efficiency and rate.\nEngine Ice Accretion Simulation: This effort is focused on developing an ice accretion\nmodel which will work in conjunction with the engine performance and compressor flow\nfield estimation code. The accretion will be able to assess the compressor's susceptibility to\nice accretion in any of the blade rows, at any flight condition along the vehicle trajectory.\nPropulsion System Laboratory Modifications: The addition of a spray bar will provide\nfull scale, ground-based engine testing with a cloud of ice crystals sprayed into the engine\ninlet at simulated altitude operating conditions of pressure and temperature.\nwww.nasa.gov\n\n4\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nHigh Ice Water Content Flight Campaign: Tom Ratvasky\nThis project focuses on making measurements\nof the atmosphere in clouds of the type that\nhave been correlated with engine power loss.\nAn heavily instrumented aircraft with\nstate-of-the-art instrumentation will be flown\ninto deep convective clouds to measure the cloud\nproperties, the ice water content and ice crystal particle size and shape. The new\nimproved instrumentation will address issues encountered by traditional\ninstrumentation. The outcome of this research is to have a suite of instruments that\nset a new state-of-the-art for measuring cloud properties and meet the sensing\nrequirements for high ice water content environments.\n\nAdvanced Instrumentation Features:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Resistance to ice particles shattering on spectrometer probe tips and subsequent\nmeasurement of shattered artifacts.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Elimination of the under-sampling of ice water content due to mass loss on hotwire water content probes and saturation limits.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Resistance to electro-static buildup and discharge that can disable instrument\nelectronics, and to condensation buildup in instruments in a tropical environment.\nwww.nasa.gov\n\n5\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nEnvironment Characterization- Flight Campaign\nConduct a HIWC flight campaign to acquire a\nbenchmark database on the atmospheric environment\nthat causes engine and air data sensor failures that\nthreatens air transportation safety today. The data will\nbe used to mitigate the threat in the following ways:\n1) Set new design and certification standards for\nengines and sensors to operate within this\nenvironment\n2) Develop data base for engine ice modeling and\nsimulation\n3) Guide future experimental activities for means of\ncompliance and fundamental ice growth studies\n4) Develop HIWC detection methods and advanced\ninstrumentation (onboard; ground-based, spacebased) and weather diagnostic/forecast tools to\nenable threat avoidance\n5) Understand the fundamental cloud microphysical\nprocesses that cause High IWC to occur and by\ndoing so improve the ability to forecast or detect it\nwww.nasa.gov\n\n6\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nEngine Icing Performance Simulation: Phil Jorgenson\nThe objective of this task is to develop a modeling and simulation tool to estimate\nthe flow field and flow conditions in each blade row of the fan and low pressure\ncompressor (LPC) in the engine. This capability provides the boundary conditions\nrequired for the ice accretion model.\nThe Numerical Propulsion System Simulation code (NPSS) is used for the\nthermodynamic cycle analysis. A compressor flow analysis code (COMDES) has\nbeen coupled to, and runs concurrently with, the NPSS code such that the two codes\nprovide a higher fidelity component-level simulation of the compression system at\nall flight conditions along a vehicle flight trajectory. This coupled capability\neliminates the need for LPC characteristic maps.\n\nThe coupled NPSS-COMDES analysis tool was executed on the notional engine\nthroughout a commercial aircraft flight trajectory from 10000 ft to 39000 ft,\nincluding two cruise conditions and descent from 39000 ft at 10% of maximum\nthrust. The effects of ice blockage were simulated by parametrically varying the\nblockage at the stator row where a key static temperature was reached.\nThe detailed blade-row by blade-row flow field in the fan and LPC is provided to\nthe GlennICE and LEWICE accretion models as boundary conditions for\nestimation of ice accretion location, accretion rate and particle trajectory analysis.\nwww.nasa.gov\n\n7\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nCompressor Flow field Simulation & Ice Accretion\nThrough Flight Trajectory\nNPSS Model of Engine\n0-D Engine system performance to\nestablish compressor BC\xe2\x80\x99s at altitude\noperating conditions through trajectory\n\nShaft Rotational Speed\nInlet Pressure\nInlet Temperature\nPressure ratio, overall\nEfficiency, overall\n\nCompressor Flow Analysis\nFlow analysis of Fan & LPC to determine\nblade row by blade row performance\nthrough the flight trajectory\n( 1D: COMDES, 2D: HT0300 )\n\nIce Accretion Model\nEstimate of the onset of icing location\nand rate of ice accretion in the fan &\nLPC along the flight trajectory\n2D: GlennICE, 3D: LEWICE3D\n\nFlow field: blade row by\nblade row fluid conditions:\nstatic and total pressure,\nTemperature, velocity triangles\nwww.nasa.gov\n\n8\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nEngine Icing Performance Simulation\nFlow Field Through Fan-Core and Low Pressure Compressor\nEstimated Blade-Row by Blade-Row Through Flight Trajectory\n\n40K Thrust Engine\n\nFan and Low Pressure Compressor\n\nVehicle Flight Trajectory\nwww.nasa.gov\n\n9\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nEngine Performance Simulation\nThrough Vehicle Flight Trajectory\n\nOverall Pressure Ratio of Fan Core & LPC\n\nStatic Temperatures in Each Stage\nBlade-Row by Blade-Row\nwww.nasa.gov\n\n10\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nModeling and Simulation \xe2\x80\x93 Fan and LPC\nPerformance in an Engine System Environment\nPlanned:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCoupling of the NPSS-COMDES codes to the GlennICE code.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAdd wet-bulb temperature distribution estimation to the COMDES compressor\nflow analysis code.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nHigher fidelity 2-D Euler empirical model of compression system with and\nwithout ice blockage to determine the overall and blade-row by blade-row\nperformance of compression system due to span-wise variation of additional\nblockage.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nInvestigate 3-D CFD analysis code for analyzing the effects of blockage due to ice\naccretion.

This will provide the capability\nof full scale, ground-based engine testing\nwith ice crystal ingestion at pressures and\ntemperatures similar to those encountered\nat altitude operation. The facility can\nsimulate altitude operating conditions up\nto 40,000 ft with inlet temperatures down\nto -60 F and ice crystal cloud sprayed into\nthe engine inlet at the rate of 9 grams/m^3. It is anticipated that this facility\nwill sufficiently reproduce the conditions experienced by an engine in flight\nthrough a cloud containing high concentrations of ice crystals. If the ice cloud\nresults in accretion inside the compression system, it is expected to result in\nreduced compressor and engine performance.\nwww.nasa.gov\n\n15\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nPropulsion Systems Laboratory\nEngine Icing Modifications\nThe PSL altitude test facility has been modified to enable testing of an engine\nwhile ingesting an ice crystal cloud.
