Siry\n\nINTRODUCTION\nOrbit determination for artificial satellites and spacecraft has developed upon the foundations\nlaid by university research workers over the centuries. Elaborate theories have been developed to\ncope with the problem of determining the orbits of the planets and of their natural satellites. Modifications of these theories have been developed in order to make them applicable to some of the\nspecial problems associated with the orbits of artificial satellites.\nThe fundamental problem of orbit determination is that of comparing theories such as these\nwith observational data obtained from satellite tracking stations. Various aspects of this problem\nare indicated in Figure 1. Preparations for orbit determination for the satellites to be launched\nduring the International Geophysical Year were based upon the assumption that the principal perturbations would be due to the earth\'s oblateness and its atmosphere.\n\n.\n\nSatellites are slowed down and lose energy due to the aerodynamic drag force which is encountered primarily in the neighborhood of perigee. When a satellite loses energy, its orbital\nperiod decreases. Thus, the observed decrease in the period of a satellite orbit can be interpreted\nin t e r m s of atmospheric density in the neighborhood of perigee. It was thought prior to the IGY that\nthe atmospheric density varicd with height,\nbut not significantly with latitude, longitude or\ntime. Measures of air density were available\nfrom the sounding rocket programs pursued\nprior to the IGY. The TGY orbits were to have\nperigee altitudes of about 200 miles and apogee\naltitudes of about 1400 miles. This perigee\nheight was selected since it would permit the\nstudy of atmospheric density in the region\nnear 200 miles altitude, which was above the\nlevel for which the sounding rocket data were\navailable.\n\nical.\n\nThe satellites were designed to be spherThe e f f e c t i v e cross-sectional area\n\nFigure 1 -Orbit determination.\n\n1\n\npresented to the aerodynamic flow would thus be constant and predictable, even though the\nsatellite\'s attitude or orientation would not necessarily be known.\nThe inclination of 35" w a s the maximum which could be achieved safely with the launching\nrocket vehicle systems then contemplated.\n\n.\n\nOrbit determination systems have been called upon to do many things since the space age\nbegan. There is always interest initially in the early estimates of the principal orbital parameters\nsuch as the period, the perigee and apogee heights, and the inclination. In addition, it is necessary\nto provide accurate predictions for the tracking and data acquisition stations in order to insure\nthat additional tracking and telemetry information will continue to flow into the data gathering and\nprocessing systems. General viewing predictions also provided for satellites which can be seen\nvisually by observers around the world. It w a s also necessary to furnish detailed ephemerides for\nthe experimenters whose instruments operated in the ICY scientific satellites. Information consisting of the longitude, the latitude and the altitude of the satellite at each minute of its active\nradio lifetime is normally furnished to each scientist conducting an experiment with satelliteborne instrumentation.\nIt was anticipated that analysis of satellite orbital tracking data would yield new information\nconcerning air densities and the shape of the earth. In particular, it was hoped that it would be\npossible to obtain more accurate measures of the oblateness of the earth.\n.-\n\n1\n\nOrbit determination includes the analysis of the tracking system which is used to furnish the\ndata upon which the ephemerides and analyses are based. Accordingly, it was anticipated that\nimportant information about the tracking system would be derived from the orbit determination\nprogram.\nThese, then, were and still a r e the principal aspects of the science of orbit determination. A s\nthe space programs have become more sophisticated and complex, a number of facets of orbit\ndetermination have developed correspondingly.\n\nA number of surprises were in store for those analyzing orbital data as they sought to glean\ngeophysical information. For example the\nvery first satellite showed that the atmospheric density w a s greater than previously\nsupposed by a factor of the order of five. The\noblateness of the earth was found to be significantly different from the estimates obtained\non the basis of geodetic information. A number of additional geophysical discoveries were\nmade. Some of these are indicated in Figure2.\nFor example, it was learned from orbital\ninformation that the earth is actually pear\nshaped. Quantitative information has now been\nFigure 2-Environment factors affecting orbit\ndetermination.\nobtained about a number of the zonal harmonics\n\n2\n\n.\n\nof the earth\'s gravitational field. _ l r t h e r studies have also begun to shed more light on the\nellipticity of the earth\'s equator. /A number of new and important discoveries were made concerning the earth\'s atmosphere, using orbital data. It was found that the atmosphere actually bulges\non the side of the earth which faces toward the sun. The bulge effect is greatest in longitudes that\ncorrespond to the early afternoon hours. This was discovered by observing that the satellite\norbital period decrements, and hence the corresponding atmospheric densities, increased as the\nperigees of elliptical satellite orbits moved from the dark side of the earth around toward the\nbu1ge-i)In addition, it was observed that the atmospheric density actually increased rather sharply\nshortly after certain types of solar flares were observed to occur on the sun. This is indicated in\nFigure 3. In addition to specific changes in atmospheric density in response to individual solar\nevents, a general correlation was found to exist between solar activity and atmospheric density at\nhigh altitudes. The active regions on the sun are not homogeneously distributed with respect to\nlongitude. They occur more frequently in some solar longitudes than in others, for example. These\nclusters of active regions rotate with the sun, whose rotational period is 27 days. It has been\nfound that the atmospheric density at high altitudes varies with a period of 27 days, and that the\ncorrelation with solar activity is marked. This correlation is more pronounced in the neighborhood of the atmospheric bulge. The pressure of radiation upon a satellite is small and is often\nconsidered to be negligible. Acting over a long period, however, it does produce a detectable effect,\n\nFigure 3-Variable\n\natmospheric drag effects on satel lite orbits.\n\n3\n\neve11 upon the orbit of an ordinary satellite. Radiation pressure can result in a significant perturbation of the orbit in the case of a low-density satellite such as Echo. Lunar and solar perturbations can also be observed, even on the orbits of close earth satellites.\nThus, there has been an unfolding panorama of changes in the natural environment as it affects\nsatellite orbit determination.\nAs the space programs have evolved, numerous decisions were made concerning the design of\nthe satellite and the orbit. A number of these had important effects upon t h e problem of orbit\ndetermination. Some of them a r e indicated in Figure 4. For example, the original designs called\nfor spherical satellites. Shortly after the space age began, however, long, slender cylindrical\nsatellites were put into orbit. These were tumbling satellites whose orientation w a s not known.\nAccordingly, the effective cross-sectional area which they presented to the aerodynamic flow was\nnot known o r predictable. This complicated the problem of predicting the satellite\'s future position.\nIt also rendered more difficult the interpretation of satellite deceleration data i n t e r m s of atmospheric density. The Echo satellite had a much lower areal density than any of its predecessors.\nA s a result, even though it was launched into a nearly circular orbit at a height of about 1000 miles,\nit was significantly affected by atmospheric drag. In addition it w a s affected in a striking way by\n\nFigure 4-Mission factors affecting orbit determination.\n\n4\n\nP\n\nradiation pressure. The radiation pressure effect,\nbarely discernable for ordinary satellites, produced\na depression of Echo\'s perigee of literally several\nhundreds of miles. The variation of the perigee and\napogee heights of Echo due to this effect can be seen\nin Figure 5.\nMany of the orbits themselves varied significantly from the type initially planned for theIGY.\nFor example, the orbit of Explorer 11 had anun1\nusually low perigee height of about 117 miles. The\nlow perigee of Explorer 1 1 resulted in an extremely\n1\nlarge drag effect. The period deceleration was of\nthe order of a thousand times greater than that\nwhich was encountered in the case of other IGY\nFigure 5-Radiation pressure effect on ECHO orbit\ndetermined.\nsatellites. The first Tiros satellite, designed to obtain new information about cloud cover and weather, brought new problems from the orbit determination standpoint. The orbit of this satellite was very nearly circular. This meant that certain\norbit determination theories, which had been developed originally for the elliptic satellite orbit\ncase, had to be modified appropriately to handle this type of orbit.\nFollowing the initial scientific satellite studies, interest grew in the regions well beyond the\nimmediate neighborhood of the earth. Accordingly, high apogee satellite orbits were planned. Explorer VI, for example, w a s launched into an orbit having an apogee height of about 24,000 miles.\nThis was followed by Explorer X, whose apogee w a s at 180,000 miles from the earth, or threequarters of the way to the moon\'s orbit. In this satellite, the experimental equipment operated until the satellite reached the neighborhood of apogee on the first orbit, o r for a period of approximately two and a half days. Explorer XII was launched into an orbit having an apogee of about\n48,000 miles. Its experimental equipment operated for over three months. The orbit of each of\nthese satellites was significantly affected by the lunar and solar perturbations. Accordingly, it was\nnecessary to include the effects of these gravitational forces in determining the orbits of these new\nhigh-apogee satellites.\nThe original IGY plans called for a satellite with an active life of about a fortnight. A s the\nuseful lifetimes of satellites increased, and the periods over which their orbits were determined\nincreased correspondingly, it became customary to determine orbits on a weekly basis. This\nmeant that differential corrections were performed each week, using the data covering a one week\ninterval. The orbit determination theories were adequate to handle this type of orbital time span.\nThese separate a r c s were discontinuous. The minimum distances between them in the regions\nwhere they overlapped were of the same order as the uncertainities in position in the individual\narcs, however. Thus, a piece-wise continuous representation of the orbit could be obtained by\nmeans of a sequence of week long orbital arcs. For certain purposes, however, the precision obtained in this way w a s not sufficient. For example, in carrying out certain types of magnetic experiments in satellites it was found to be desirable to obtain a truly continuous representation of\n5\n\nthe orbital path over the entire active lifetime of the satellite. This was done in the case of the\n1,\nsatellite Vanguard 1 1 for example. In this case the orbital a r c considered had a duration of\napproximately a quarter of a year. New theoretical methods had to be developed to handle this\ntype of case. Some indication of the severity of the problems associated with orbital a r c s of this\nlength can be had by recalling that classical astronomy deals with observations of the planets extending back about two centuries. A close earth satellite completes as many orbits in a fortnight\nas a terrestrial planet does in two centuries. On this basis a quarter of a year for the close earth\nsatellite corresponds to more than a millenium for a terrestrial planet. The difficulties were\nfurther increased due to the fact that atmospheric drag force is an important one for artificial\nsatellites, whereas forces of this type are not nearly so significant for the planets and their natural\nsatellites. These new, long orbital a r c s required new\'theoretical developments.\nAt the other end of the scale, considerable interest has been focused on orbits lasting only a\nquarter of a day, such as those encountered in Project Mercury, for example. The original Project\nMercury mission involved the completion of three orbits of the earth by the astronaut. Some of the\ntheoretical problems hssociated with long a r c s were not present in this case. On the other hand,\nhowever, a number of additional problems had to be considered, in view of the fact that the\nastronaut\'s safety was at stake. Special measures had to be taken to insure that adequate information concerning the orbit and the trajectory was available at all times from the moment the\nlaunching rocket left the pad until the capsule returned to the surface of the earth in the recovery\narea. In order to insure that adequate supplies of tracking data were available to meet this objective, extensive use has been made of radar tracking systems. A network was established consisting of some ten radars which were capable of tracking the Mercury capsule during its first\norbit. The first of these radars tracked the Atlas rocket as it left the launching pad and traversed\nthe satellite launching trajectory. A s the satellite capsule was projected into orbit, it could actually\nbe tracked by two such radars. These r a d a r s were capable of obtaining ten complete sets of\nmeasures of range, azimuth and elevation each second. These radar measures were of high precision. Thus, within less than a minute after the Mercury satellite entered its orbit, sufficient\ninformation was available to determine whether, in fact, the satellite actually was in orbit and,\nfurther, whether the orbit was satisfactory from the standpoint of the mission objectives. This\ninformation had to be available on this time scale in order to permit the making of the vital decision\nas to whether the mission should be continued, or whether the manned capsule should be brought\nsafely back to earth in an emergency recovery area in the Atlantic Ocean. Once in orbit the\nMercury satellite was tracked again and again by means of precision radars, each of which was\ncapable of obtaining, by itself, enough information to permit the determination of an accurate orbit.\nIn all, ten such radars tracked the Mercury capsule during its first orbit, as is indicated in Figure 6. The handling of this tracking information and the making of the critical recommendations\nconcerning go and no-go decisions on a real time basis requires the development of extensive computer program systems. These must be capable of rapid, precise orbit determination. This includes the assessment of the accuracy of the incoming tracking data, the determination of the\norbital elements, the prediction of the satellite\'s position in order to permit acquisition by radars,\nand the making of critical recommendations involving the go, no-go decisions, the time at which\nthe retro rockets should be fired to cause re-entry into the desired recovery region, etc. These\n\n6\n\nFigure 6-Project Mercury.\n\nprograms must all be properly connected in the master, overall Mercury programming system so\nthat they will operate automatically in the real-time situation.\nThis type of orbit determination operation is in marked contrast to the type conducted for\nscientific satellites. Scientific satellites a r e normally tracked by means of the Minitrack system,\nwhich operates using the principles of radio interferometry. As a scientific satellite passes over\na Minitrack station, measures are obtained giving the direction from the Minitrack station to the\nsatellite. No range information is obtained during such a tracking pass. The Minitrack system\nutilizes fixed-beam antenna installations. These have several advantages. They do not require\nspecial acquisition aids, as do radars of the Mercury type. They will track automatically whenever\nthe satellites enters the antenna beam. The Minitrack system can operate using an extremely light\ntransmitter in the satellite itself. Scientific satellites are generally much smaller than their\nmanned counterparts. The original IGY satellites, for example, weighed about 20 pounds, whereas\nthe Mercury capsules weigh more than a ton, o r over a hundred times the weight of the original\nscientific satellites. In fact, in the Mercury Capsule, the weight of the tracking equipment alone is\ngreater than the entire weight of America\'s first scientific satellite. Even though the weights involved are different by approximately two orders of magnitude, the Minitrack system for tracking\nscientific satellites is capable of great precision. In general, however, weight is traded for the\nrate a t which tracking information becomes available to the central computing system. Ordinarily,\na scientific satellite is observed roughly once per orbit. Hence, it is necessary to observe the\nsatellite over a time interval corresponding to three o r four orbits before reasonably good orbital\n7\n\ninformation can be obtained. This is in marked contrast to the Mercury tracking system which is\ncapable of providing accurate orbital information on the basis of a single radar pass. These two\ntypes of orbit determination operations require quite different approaches from the analytical,\nmathematical, and computing standpoints.\nStill a different array of techniques is used to track high-apogee satellites. Satellite orbits\nextending out to distances of ten earth radii or so have dynamical properties which are significantly different from those of close-earth satellite orbits. For example, once a satellite is more\nthan a few earth radii from the earth, its rate of angular motion is slow. Accordingly, angular\ntracking systems a r e l e s s appropriate here than they are for close-earth satellites. The range\nand the range rate of a high-apogee satellite are, however, changing appreciably over most of the\norbit. Accordingly, it is desirable to measure these quantities. It is for this reason that doppler\nand ranging systems have been developed for tracking spacecraft travelling out toward the moon\nand deep into space. The Goddard orbit determination system has utilized data of this type in\ndetermining orbits of satellites and spacecraft. A new range and range rate tracking system is\npresently being developed by Goddard especially for use in tracking high-apogee scientific and\napplications satellites in the forthcoming OGO and Syncom programs.\nThe present Goddard orbit determination system now in operation includes the basic elements\nof the type described earlier. In each of the principal areas, however, there has been a significant\nincrease in the complexity of problems to be considered and a corresponding increase in the complexity of the theories and the computer programs developed for orbit determination. This is indicated in Figure 7. For example, the original system was designed to use Minitrack data primarily.\nAt the present time the system is capable of using many different types of data including not only\nMinitrack data but also the Mercury radar tracking data referred to earlier, Baker-Nunn precision\noptical tracking data, data from a number of doppler, range and range rate systems, and data from\nthe Deep Space Information Facility developed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California\nInstitute of Technology.\n\nIn the theoretical area, the original modification of Hansen\'s theory developed to apply to the\nclose-earth satellite case is now but one of a number of different theoretical methods available for\nuse in the Goddard general orbit determination system. Some of these are indicated in Figure 8.\nA numerical integration method is also available. Some refinements have been added t o this method\nin order to permit control of the buildup of round-off error. A new method developed by Prof.\nBrouwer of Yale University is also in extensive use. The method of variation of parameters is also\nused to handle special problems arising in connection with high-apogee satellites, satellites perturbed significantly by radiation pressure, etc.\nThe environment now is clearly recognized to be far more complex than had been suspected at\nthe time the space age began. The Goddard orbit determination system now takes into account the\nmany new types of perturbations referred to above. Modifications have also been incorporated to\ndeal with the many types of satellites, the different types of orbits and the various orbit intervals\ndiscussed above,\n\n8\n\nFigure 7-Orbit\n\ndetermination.\n\nOrbit determination objectives have become more numerous in response to the increasing\nneeds of the space programs. The problem of determining initial orbits has grown more complex\nas the launching trajectories and the orbits themselves have become more varied and complex.\nAntenna pointing predictions must now be furnished for a wide variety of antenna systems including\nnot only those which are based on direction cosines, azimuth and elevation, and right ascension and\ndeclination, but also those which are based on\nhour angle and declination, prime vertical\nangle and meridian axis angle, and meridian\nangle and prime vertical axis angle. Some of\nthese antenna systems are indicated in Figu r e 9.\nIt is also necessary to furnish predictions\nwith a much greater degree of precision than\nwas necessary heretofore. For example, in\nthe case of Project Echo, the satellite was\ntracked by means of large 84-foot dishes\noperating at frequencies in the neighborhood\nof 2300 megacycles. The beam width of such\n\nFigure 8-Orbit determination theories.\n\n9\n\nb .\n\nFigure 9-Various types of tracking data.\n\na n antenna system is extremely narrow. The problem was further compounded by the fact that one\nof the operations involved the simultaneous pointing of two such dishes at the satellite. This mode\nof operation further decreased the effective beam width of the combined two-antenna system. The\nbeam width of this combined system was approximately 0.15 degrees. Accordingly, it was necess a r y to furnish pointing predictions with this accuracy. The antenna systems used in Project Echo\nwere not all capable of automatically tracking the satellite. It was necessary actually to point them\nat the satellite by means of drive tapes generated by the Goddard orbit determination system.\nThese drive tapes were used to point the large antenna systems at the satellite from opposite\ncoasts of the United States. This method was used to transmit messages from President Eisenhower\nand Senator, now Vice-president, Lyndon B Johnson across the continent via the Echo satellite.\n.\nThis is indicated in Figure 10. Because of the large and unpredictable effect of atmospheric drag\nupon the orbit and position of Echo, it was decided to redetermine the orbit each day on the basis\nof the latest tracking information during critical operations. It was found that it was possible,\nusing this approach, to predict the position of the Echo satellite with an accuracy of 0.15 degrees\nfor periods up to a day in advance. On the same basis it was found possible to predict the position\nof more dense satellites such as Tiros with an accuracy of 0.1 degrees. Greater accuracy was\npossible in the case of these latter satellites due to the fact they are perturbed to a much smaller\ndegree by the variable and unpredictable atmospheric drag forces. Since Echo was easily visible\nto the naked eye, great interest was shown in observing this satellite by people all over the world.\nIt thus was necessary to predict the times at which Echo would be visible from cities around the\nworld. Some of the cities for which Echo predictions have been made a r e shown in Figure 11.\n\n10\n\nFigure 10-Antenna p i n t i n g predrctions.\n\nFigure 11-Cities for\n\nwhich Echo predictions were computed.\n\n11\n\nMany of you may have seen and actually used such predictions which frequently appear in our\nlocal newspapers. Predictions of this type are furnished continuously for literally hundreds of\ncities around the world by the Goddard Computing Center.\nMany scientific experimenters are now interested not only in the positions of their satellites\nin geographic space but also in the magnetic parameters of the satellite environment. In such\ncases it is customary to give the Greenwich time, the satellite position in t e r m s of geographic latitude, longitude, and height, as well as the magnitude of the magnetic field vector and three components of this vector. In addition, certain other geomagnetic quantities of interest to particular\nexperimenters are determined and furnished along with the other ephemeris information. For\nexample, the coordinates of the satellite i n B-L space are provided for experimenters studying the\nradiation belts, both natural and artificial.\nThe attitudes of satellites such as T i r o s are determined on the basis of data obtained from\nspecial horizon sensing equipment mounted in the satellite. Detailed information concerning the\nattitude history of such satellites is also furnished in addition to the basic ephemeris information\nfor use by certain experimenters.\nScientific research results of a number of different types have been obtained from detailed and\ndefinitive analyses of orbital tracking data. The contributions of Vanguard I i n this connection,\nindicated in Figure 12, a r e especially notable, since this satellite contained no experimental apparatus, per se. All of the Vanguard I research results have been achieved through orbit analyses.\nNew measures of the earth\'s oblateness were obtained using the Vanguard I orbital data. The earth\nwas discovered to be pear shaped on the basis of Vanguard I orbital information. The atmospheric\nbulge and the correlation of atmospheric density with solar activity were discovered by means of\nVanguard I tracking data. Solar radiation pressure effects were first calculated in a definitive way\nfor the Vanguard I satellite. A new measure of the scale of the solar s y s t e 4 s e l . f was obtained\nthrough analysis of the doppler observations obtained from Pioneer V. This spacecraft was\nlaunched into an orbit around the sun which carried it toward the orbit of Venus as is indicated in\nFigure 13. I t was tracked to the unprecedented distance of more than 20,000,000 miles from the\nearth. Careful analysis of the doppler tracking data from this satellite yielded a new measure f o r\nthe value of the astronomical unit, which corresponds to the mean distance of the earth from the\nsun.\nThe accuracy with which orbits are determined has steadily increased through the years. At\nthe present time the uncertainty in a satellite\'s position as determined on the basis of Minitrack\nobservations is of the order of 100 seconds of arc. The moon is approximately 1800 seconds of arc\nin diameter. Accordingly, the uncertainty of a satellite position in t e r m s of directional o r angular\ninformation corresponds to about 1/18th of the diameter of the moon. The corresponding uncertainty\nin satellite position for satellites at a mean distance of the order of a thousand kilometers is of the\norder of half a kilometer. This is comparable to the accuracies with which the positions of sounding\nrockets were known during the period before the IGY. The present precision of orbital information\nrepresents an increase of approximately an order of magnitude in accuracy over that which was\nachieved in the early days of the IGY. Analyses and inter-comparisons of different types of tracking\n\n12\n\nr\n\n,\nl\n\nFigure 12-Vanguard\n\nI\n\nscientific research results from orbital tracking data.\n\nsystems have been conducted as new systems came into operation. It has been found, for example,\nthat the Minitrack and Baker-Nunn tracking systems give consistent results.\n\nA number of new, interesting orbit determination problems have arisen in connection\nwith some of the newer NASA programs. In\nthe future, it is planned not only to determine\nthe orbits of satellites and spacecraft but also\nactually to control and to change them. Project Gemini planners, for example, contemplate the bringing together of two satellites in\nrendezvous operations. In general the orbits\nof the two satellites will differ initially. It\nwill be necessary to determine the orbit of\neach of these satellites precisely. It will then\nbe n e c e s s a r y to determine what changes\nshould be made to the orbits of one o r the\nother o r bothof the satellites in order to bring\nthe two satellites together.

The unsolved problems of principal interest currently are associated\n4\nwith the perturbative forces indicated in Figures 2 and 1 . General perturbation theories have\nbeen developed which represent the zonal gravitational harmonics. It is desirable to extend these\ntheoretical developments to treat the other types of perturbations indicated in Figure 1 . There is\n4\nalso interest in further development of special perturbation orbit determination systems as they\napply to lunar orbits and trajectories.\n\nFigure 14-Orbit determination.\n\n14\n\n'
