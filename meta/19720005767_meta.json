The failure rates and failure rate modifiers resulted from a series of studies whose purpose was to provide design, tests, reliability, and systems engineers with accurate, up-to-date failure rate information. The results of the studies were achieved through an extensive engineering analysis of the Saturn Program test data and Unsatisfactory Condition Reports (UCR's) and the application of mathematical techniques developed for the studies.", "title": "Saturn component failure rate and failure rate modifiers", "stiType": "TECHNICAL_MEMORANDUM", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-02T15:58:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Technical Memorandum (TM)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19720005767, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19720005767, "id": "4e07a86865334240b5f92a0fbfca490e", "publicationDate": "1971-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19720005767.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19720005767/downloads/19720005767.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19720005767/downloads/19720005767.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19720005767/downloads/19720005767.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
