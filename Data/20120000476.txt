b'Mechanics/Machinery\nForce Limit System\nThis system protects the operator, specimen, system, and fixtures from overload damage.\nJohn H. Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio\nThe Force Limit System (FLS) was developed to protect test specimens from\ninadvertent overload. The load limit\nvalue is fully adjustable by the operator\nand works independently of the test system control as a mechanical (non-electrical) device.\nWhen a test specimen is loaded via an\nelectromechanical or hydraulic test system, a chance of an overload condition\nexists. An overload applied to a specimen could result in irreparable damage\nto the specimen and/or fixturing. The\nFLS restricts the maximum load that an\nactuator can apply to a test specimen.\nWhen testing limited-run test articles or\nusing very expensive fixtures, the use of\nsuch a device is highly recommended.\nTest setups typically use electronic peak\nprotection, which can be the source of\noverload due to malfunctioning components or the inability to react quickly\nenough to load spikes. The FLS works\nindependently of the electronic overload protection.\nIn a standard test system, an actuator\nmoves in a uniaxial direction to apply\nload to a fixed-position specimen in a\nvery controlled fashion. The actuator,\nusually capable of very high loads, is normally driven by an electromechanical\nmotor or hydraulic power supply. So-\n\nphisticated electronic/software packages command the movement of the actuator based on transducer input and\noperator requirements. This is all independent of the FLS.\nThe Force Limit Cylinder is preset to\na calibrated amount that equals the\nsafety factor or protection value desired\nby the operator. The maximum force is\ndetermined by a precision dynamic mechanical control that has a very high relief rate. The load values and relief rates\nare dictated by test requirements. The\nForce Limit Cylinder is attached to the\nactuator on one end, and test specimen\ncontact on the other end (usually the\ncylinder push rod). Standard fixture\nalignment procedures should be used\nprior to specimen loading.\nBefore applying load to the specimen,\nthe Force Limit Cylinder should be preset to the desired value to equal the desired load limit. Once this is completed,\nthe Force Limit Cylinder push rod will\nnot permit the actuator to exceed the\npreset load to the specimen. If the actuator increases load to the point of the\nFLS set point, the Force Limit Cylinder\npush rod will retract as the mechanical\ncontrol relieves force. If the actuator\ncontinues to move downward, the Force\nLimit Cylinder will allow this until the\n\nactuator contacts its internal mechanical stops.\nThe unique features of this device are\nthat it has an independent, fully adjustable load limit using mechanical design, and it has the ability to change test\nframe control channels with minimal\nrisk by applying load while in position\ncontrol. For simplicity, the FLS uses\nreadily available parts.\nThe FLS can also be used in a test system that has no provision for control\nmode switching to an advantage. When\na test system is switched between position control and load control, there is an\nincreased risk of overload during this\noperation. The FLS can be used to apply\na very low load to a specimen while controlled in position. This allows a safe\ncontrol mode switch and avoids an\nopen-loop situation.\nThis work was done by Ralph Pawlik,\nDavid Krause, and Frank Bremenour of Glenn\nResearch Center.
