b'Network Software\n\nASA and other research organizations\n\nN\n\nemploy extra-fast supercomputers\nthat generate billions of bytes of data\nin seconds. This data must be moved\nby networks from the supercomputers to\nthe workstations where researchers can\nstudy it. But until recently the transfer time\nto move the mountains of data sometimes\nran into hours.\nAmong the solutions to that\nproblem is UltraNetB, a family of products\ndesigned to transfer billions of bits per\nsecond. Manufactured by Ultra Network\nTechnologies, San Jose, California, UltraNet\nexemplifies the personnel type of technology\ntransfer, wherein government or contractor\nemployees move to other occupations, bringing with them aerospace technology and\nskills that can be reapplied in the commercial marketplace.\nThe central figure in this case is\nJames "Newt" Perdue, a computer engineer\nat Ames Research Center in the mid-1980s,\nwhen Ames was planning to upgrade its\nsupercomputer-based Numerical\nAerodynamic Simulation (NAS) program.\nAlthough NAS was already employing the\nfastest supercomputer designed until then,\nAmes officials saw a need to\nquadruple computing power and therefore to upgrade the\nentire network to support a more\nadvanced NAS.\nPerdue and others at Ames\nworked to define a concept that\nwould solve the problems of networking and access to mass storage\nsystems. Extensive surveys of networking vendors, however, turned\nup no existing or planned network\ning products to meet NASA\'s p r e\njected requirements. Perdue took\n\nadvantage of the opportunity to fill a need;\nhe resigned from NASA in 1985 and founded Ultra Network Technologies.\nWithin 14 months, working with the\nNAS program to refine the requirements,\nthe new company had developed prototype\nexamples of gigabit/second networking\ntechnology. Today the company offers a full\nrange of products to speed transfer of information among supercomputers, mainframe\nservers, workstations and other local area\nnetworks. The key technology is intelligent\nnetwork processing to speed the flow of data\nwithout stopping, using special networking\nhardware and standard protocols.\nNow in its seventh year, Ultra\nNetwork Technologies has expanded its\nsales base to more than 100 customers\nworldwide and is designing a new\ngeneration of products for a wider market.\nAt left, company founder and vice\npresident Newt Purdue is shown with an\nUltraNet workstation used in a medical\napplication; below, an engineer is\nconducting a pre-shipment check of three\nUltraNet Model 1000 systems.\nWltraNet is a registered trademark of Ultra Network\nTechnologies.\n\n'
