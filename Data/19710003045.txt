The 15\nOutput of the summing circuit, in one embodiment is a\ntransistor connected in a common-base configuration, and\nis connected both to a parallel resistive-capacitive (RC)\ncombination and to an output terminal. The feedback\nresistor R2 is isolated from the capacitor C by an emitter 20\nfollower. ?%e OutpUt Signal at the output terminal is a\ntrue time integral of the input signal.\nORIGIN OF INVENTION\n25\nThe invention described herein was made in the performance of work under a NASA contract and is subject\nto the provisions of Sec. 305 of the National Aeronautics\nand Space Act of 1958, Public Law 85-586 (72 Stat. 3o\n435; 42 U.S.C. 2457).\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\nField of the invention\nThis invention generally relates to an integrator and, 35\nmore partiodarly, to a simple solid state operational\nintegrator.\nDescription of the prior art\nThe advantageous properties of integrating circuits or\nsimply integrators, which are well known, have been\nextensively utilized in many design applications and circuits. Among such circuits, are peak detectors, 90"\nbhase shifters, and, circuits for obtaining an output prof\nportional to the time integral o an input.\nThe prior art includes various integrators with highly\nsatisfactory performance characteristics at low or relatively low frequencies. These are generally of the operational amplifier type with capacitive feedback. Basically,\nthey are high-gain DC amplifiers with capacitors connected as feedback elements. At higher frequencies, such\n.as 10 megahertz (mHz.) and above, integrators of the\n;operational amplifier type are not satisfactory. At such\n\'frequencies, attempts have been made to use resistorcavacitor (RC) networks in coniunction with one or\nmire amplification stages, that function to amplify the\nvoltage accross the capacitor. Such integrators require\nhigh voltage gain. In the high frequency (HF)or very\nhigh frequency (VHF) ranges, the gain can be stabiliized\nonly with a relatively large number of elements and components. Consequently, the resulting integrators are quite\ncomplex, expensive and of limited performance. In addition, most integrators designed to operate in the HF or\nVHF ranges are of limited bandwidth. Yet the need for\nintegrators to operate in these ranges is increasing, because more and more systems are designed to operate at\n\'high or very high frequencies. Thus, a need exists for a\n-relativelysimple integrator, capable of satisfactory operation in (HF and VHF ranges, though not necessarily\nlimited thereto.\n\n40\n\n45\n\n5o\n\n55\n\nOBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\nIt is a primary object of this invention to provide a new,\nimproved, relatively simple integrator.\nAnother object is to provide a simple, inexpensive\nintegrator which exhibits superior performance characteristics at high and very high frequencies.\nA further object is to provide a simple integrator, which\nuses a minimum number of components that can be\nfabricated by integrated circuit and monolithic chip techniques. The resulting integrator is operable at frequencies\nup to and including those in the very high frequency\nrange.\nThese and other objects of the invention are achieved\nby providing an integrator which consists of a current\nsumming circuit or element with associated external\nimpedances. Together they operate upon an input voltage\nor current in a strict mathematical way, rather than by\napproximation, to provide an output which is the me\ntirne integral of the input.\na preferred embodiment of\nthe invention, the integrator consists of a first transistor\nconnected in a common-base configuration, which acts\nas the current summing circuit. Except for biasing components, the associated external impedances include an\ninput resistor, a resistor-capacitor combination, a feedback resistor, and a second transistor which acts as an\nemitter follower to provide impedance isolation. The\ntwo transistors, together With the biasing components,\nnecessary for the Proper biasing of the transistors, lend\nthemselves to integrated circuit technique, so that the\ncomplete integrator can be manufactured easily at a\nrelatively low cost.\nThe novel features of the invention are set forth with\nparticularity in the appended claims. The invention will\nbest be understood from the following description when\nread in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\nFIG. 1 is a simple, basic diagram of the integrator of\nthe present invention;\nFIG. 2 is a generalized, schematic diagram of the arrangement shown in FIG. 1;\nFTG. 3 is a waveform diagram of input and output\nsignals useful in explaining one application of the integrator of the invention;\nFIG. 4 is a specific embodiment of the integrator designed to integrate a sinewave input voltage;\nFIG. 5 is another specific embodiment of the integrator\ndesigned to integrate a square wave input at a very high\nfrequency;\nFIG. 6 is a multiline wave form diagram useful in\nexplaining the use of the integrator in conjunction with\na binary-digit-storing delay line;\nFIG. 7 is a simple block diagram of a circuit combination which includes a delay line and an integrator; and\nFIG. 8 is a specific embodiment of an integrator for\nuse in the combination. shown in FIG. 7.\n-\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED\nEMBODIMENTS\n""\nReferring to FIG. 1, there is shown a basic block and\nschematic diagram of the integrator. The integrator is\nshown supplied with an input voltage signal el(t). The\ninput signal or simply the input is applied between an\n65 input terminal 2 and a terminal 43 connected to a line\n14, which is assumed to be at a reference potential, such\nas ground. The output signal or simply output of the\nintegrator is represented as a voltage e z ( t ) between an\noutput terminal I\xc2\xa7 and a terminal 66 connected to line 4\n70 The integrator includes a current summing circuit 20,\na capacitor C and resistor R, the latter two being connected in parallel between the output terminal of circuit\nAn\n\n3,535,547\nCurrent summing circuit 0 is shown as a PNP transistor, whose base is connected to the reference line 14.\nIts emitter serves as the input terminal for the currents\nflowing through input resistor R1 and the feedback resistor Rz. The transistor\'s collector is connected to C and\nR, as well as to the base of another PNP transistor,\nwhich acts as circuit 22. The latter, connected as an\nemitter follower, provides the proper impedance isolation\nbetween capacitor C and feedback resistor Rz. The collector of the transistor 22 is assumed to be connected to\na DC biasing source while its emitter is connected to\noutput terminal 15. An output resistor Rout\nbetween the emitter and the reference line\nvoltage across Rout which represents the integrator\'s output signal.\nFrom Expression 2 or 2u, it should be noted that the\noutput e 2 ( t ) is not an approximation of the time integral\nof the input e l ( t ) , but rather, it is an exact mathematical\nintegration thereof. It should also be noted that except\n20 for biasing components, required to properly bias the\ntwo transistors, the integrator consists of two transistors,\nthree resistors (R, R1,and R2) and one capacitor ( C ) .\nThus, the number of components of the present integrator\ncould be regarded as minimal.\nThe novel integrator of the present invention exhibits\n25\nexcellent performance characteristics over a very wide\nfrequency range, including VHF, and thereof can be used\nin any application which has to operate at such frequencies. For example, it can be used as a 90" phase\n30 shifter, peak detector, in high speed servo-mechanism\ncontrol networks, etc.\nAs an example of the use of the present integrator as\na 90" phase shifter or in a peak detecting circuit let\n\n20 and line 14. An impedance isolation circuit 22 is connected between output treminal 1 5 and the parallel RC\n1\ncomponents. Its function is to isolate an impedance, which\nis represented by the constant transfer function Kz for\ne ( t ) from the capacitor C . The transfer function Kz and\nanother transfer function K1 for el(t), which is connected at one end to terminal 12, are connected to circuit\n28 to supply it with two currents il(t) and iz(t) to be\nsummed therein.\nUsing Laplace notation,\nil(s) =Kl.el(s)\niz(s)=K2.ez(s),and\ni(s)=i1(s)+iz(s).\nThe term e&) could be expressed as\n15\n\nR\n__\n\nsc\n\nez(s)= 1\n-\n\n.\n\n%(SI\n\nor\n\nThe last expression can be rewritten as:\nKi\nC\nez(s)=\nKz-el(s)\n\nSf--RC\nAssuming that\n\nC\n\n35\n\ne l ( t ) = A sin w t\nThen Expression 2u can be rewritten as\n\ne z ( t ) RiC Jo t A sin wtdt\n=L\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\n40 Integrating over the time interval from 0 to i,\n1 -A\nez(t)=-cos wt\n\nRC w\n(5)\nThus, the output is shifted by 90" with respect to the\nK1 1 1\ninput signal, since in response to a sine input function,\nez( s ) =-----el(s)\nc ss\n45 a cosine output function is produced.\nLet\nWhen the last expression is translated into the time\ndomain\n\nExpression 1 reduces to\n\n-Awo\nIt should be pointed out that Expression 2 is only true\ne z ( t ) = - w cos wt\nwhen K2 or 1/R2 equals 1/R so that two of the terms in\nthe denominator of Expression 1 cancel one another.\nIf wd=w\nIf l/Rz is greater than 1/R, the negative term in the 55\ne2(t),=-A cos ut\n(7)\ndenominator of Expression 1 is not canceled out, thereby\nThus, it is seen that the peak output amplitude will equal\nindicating an unstable or oscillatory condition.

From it, it should be\nFor the foregoing Expression 2a to be substantially\nappreciated that if the peaks such as 30 and 31 of the\naccurate, it is important that the input impedance of the 65 el(t) voltage have to be detected, this can be readily\ncurrent summing circuit 20 is zero or at least very small\naccomplished by applying the sinusoidal voltage el ( t )\nwith respect to R1 and Rz.Also, the impedance isolation\nto the integrator of the present invention and then detectcircuit 22 should have unity voltage gain.
