During the rollout of the integrated vehicle from the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) to the launch pad, the vehicle and its supporting structure are subjected to wind loads and the vibrations produced by the crawler-transporter (CT) that is carrying it. While the loads induced on the vehicle during this period are generally low relative to those experienced in flight, the rollout is a period of operation of primary interest to those designing both the ground support equipment and the interfaces between the launch vehicle and its supporting structure. In this paper, the methods used for reconstructing the loads during the rollout phase are described. The results generated are compared to measured values, leading to insight into the accuracy of the Ares I assessment techniques.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20110014752, "endDate": "2011-04-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Helicopter Society, Inc.", "location": "Alexandria, VA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "e2e7da32735e4ae4bc04f5e9619232ac", "id": "68333e9ab5e740a897accb4846cb8837"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "Reston, VA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "e2e7da32735e4ae4bc04f5e9619232ac", "id": "1276943c568f4259b58215edf055322a"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Society of Civil Engineers", "location": "Reston, VA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "e2e7da32735e4ae4bc04f5e9619232ac", "id": "1c588b3db8a147f29f72d22c7a311925"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Society of Mechanical Engineers", "location": "New York, NY, United States"}}, "meetingId": "e2e7da32735e4ae4bc04f5e9619232ac", "id": "1ace426a22414028a2e43c6f6ce68f59"}], "name": "52nd AIAA/ASME/ASCE/AHS/ASC Structures, Structural Dynamics and Materials Conference", "location": "Denver, CO", "id": "e2e7da32735e4ae4bc04f5e9619232ac", "startDate": "2011-04-04T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20110014752, "id": "94c6af98290e4d49bed0513104beb17b", "publicationDate": "2011-04-04T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20110014752.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20110014752/downloads/20110014752.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20110014752/downloads/20110014752.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20110014752/downloads/20110014752.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
