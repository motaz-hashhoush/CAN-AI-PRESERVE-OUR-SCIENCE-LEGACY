To identify these risk areas NASA's Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) was used to construct a digital elevation model (DEM) for the study region. The preliminary risk assessment was applied to a pilot study area, the La Mosca River basin. Precipitation data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM)'s near-real-time rainfall products as well as precipitation data from the Instituto de Hidrologia, Meteorologia y Estudios Ambientales (the Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology and Environmental Studies, IDEAM) and stations in the La Mosca River Basin were used to create rainfall distribution maps for the region. Using the precipitation data and the ASTER DEM, the web application, Mi Pron\u00f3stico, run by IDEAM, was updated to include an interactive map which currently allows users to search for a location and view the vulnerability and current weather and flooding conditions. The geospatial information was linked to an early warning system in Mi Pron\u00f3stico that can alert the public of flood warnings and identify locations of nearby shelters.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20140012785, "id": "23aaa6bd3a3b4ca1955e0efd9ceb5da3", "publicationDate": "2014-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20140012785.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20140012785/downloads/20140012785.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20140012785/downloads/20140012785.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20140012785/downloads/20140012785.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
