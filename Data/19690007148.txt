Introduction\n\nThe LAB 1 Alert program was exercised during integration of the strapdown electrostatic aerospace navigator\n(SEAN) system from August 19 through 28,1968. The system included the Alert computer,l the computer adapter\nand display (CAD), and the inertial measurement unit\n(IMU) with digital velocity meters (DVMs) but without\nthe electrostatic gyros (ESGs). Tests were conducted to\ndetermine that: (1) the basic inertial integrations had\nbeen correctly mechanized, (2) data were being correctly\nreceived from the CAD, (3) the schemes for using altimeter data to damp the position and velocity errors were\ncorrect, and (4) the proper computations were being performed to convert from inertial to local coordinates. These\ntests were successfully completed after several minor\nerrors were discovered and corrected. As the LAB 1\nprogram2 constitutes about one-fourth of the h l 9ight\na\nnavigation program, the successful completion of the tests\nsignifies a major milestone in the development of a flight\nprogram.\n\'Manufactured by Honeywell, Inc., Minneapolis, Minn.\n)\n\'Paine, G., Preliminary SEAN Navigation Program (LAB 1Request for Programming, Mar. 25,1968; Markiewicz, B. R., SEAN\nNavigation Equations for the Alert Computer, Apr. 30, 1968 (JPL\ninternal documents).\nJPL SPACE PROGRAMS SUMMARY 37-53, VOL. 111\n\nThe short length of time required for the integration\nproves the value of the complete system simulations performed in generating the equations for LAB 1 and the\nvalue of program checkout employing a computer simulator. These simulation efforts have been described previously in SPS 37-52, Vol. 111,pp. 5255.\n2. Test Setup\n\nNo attempt was made to align the IMU with the local\ngeodetic vertical. Instead, the DVM biases were set to\nzero in the computer program and the IMU was tilted\nuntil the level accelerometers were indicating less than\n50-pg output (less than 1 pulse/45 s), thus aligning the\nIMU to astronomic vertical, offset by the real DVM biases\nand the residual DVM outputs.\nTo replace the gyros, LAB 1computes a transformation\nmatrix based on time and geodetic latitude to convert\nbetween geodetic and inertial coordinates. Consequently,\nthe outputs Erom the three DVMs are processed as though\nthe IMU were aligned to geodetic vertical and there were\nno local gravitational anomalies.\n3. Test Results\n\nThe results of two of the test runs, a 52.266-min test\nwithout altimeter damping and a 26.133-min test with\naltimeter damping, are presented in Table 1.

In addition,\nthe measured equivalent vahtes of the down-range error\n(DRE). and t3Xoss-rimge error (CRE) were obtained by\nexamining &e level DVM outputs directly.

(A detailed explanation of the\nprogram is provided in a three-volume document.) Prior\nto its submission to COSMIC, 10 organizations were supplied with copies of the program. This increased use of\nthe program is possible since several different computer\nsystems can handle the Fortran version. A new computer\nsystem is being planned that is not compatible with the\nmachine language version of the program; however, no\nproblems are anticipated in converting the Fortran version to the new computer.\nThe Fortran version contains a newly developed option\nthat provides a graphical plot of the optical system configuration. This eliminates the necessity for a manually\ndrawn optical system to determine if a design is progressing in a satisfactory manner or needs new input data to\ndirect its progress.\nSeveral improvements to the code have been undertaken since it was submitted to COSMIC.\nAn improved method of handling a curved image plane\nhas been devised. The general technique used is to shift\nthe position of the flat image plane for each object and\ncorresponding image height. This position is calculated\nto cause the image plane to intersect the desired curve at\nthe exp,ected image height. In the old method, the image\nplane shift was calculated manually and entered. As the\nimage height changed during design operations, the image\nplane shifts were updated in a trial-and-error fashion\nthroughout the design phase.\nIn the new method, the image plane shift is automatically recalculated by the code after each design iteration.\nIn this way the time necessary for manual calculation is\nsaved as well as the extra computer time that was expended during the trial-and-error process of adjusting\nthe image plane.\nAn option has been developed that will generate\na punched card output for use on another program\n(PAGOS), which examines optical systems in terms of\nmodulation transfer function (MTF). This provides a\nfast method of MTF analysis for image-forming optical\nsystems.\n\nA method of controlling the contrast of the image has\nbeen developed. Weights can be entered that place more\n3Computer Software Management and Information Center, Computer Center, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia.\n\nJPL SPACE PROGRAMS SUMMARY 37-53, VOL. Ill\n\nimportance on the central image rays, compared to the\nouter ones. The program assigns weights for each ray in\na gaussian fashion when this option is exercised.\nThese program modifications are currently being incorporated into the three-volume document.\nAn attempt was made to develop a method of controlling the ratio of spot sizes relative to each object\nheight. This was discontinued when the initial efforts\nwere unsuccessful and it was concluded that such an\noption was not worth the effort required to get it operating properly.\n\n6. Vibration and Shock Analysis: Strapdown\nElectrostatic Aerospace Navigator, G.T . Starks\n\nThe purpose of the vibration and shock analysis was to\n(1)determine the g level that could be transmitted through\nvarious combinations of natural frequency and damping\nratios ([) of a mechanical isolation system, which would\nbe detrimental to the survival of the electrostatic gyroscope (ESG), and (2) determine the minimum parameters\nthat would isolate the destructive g input.\nPart of the strapdown electrostatic aerospace navigator\n(SEAN) system consists of an inertial measuring unit\n(IMU) housing the two ESGs, three accelerometers, and\ntheir associated electronic circuits in a rigid body structure weighing approximately 88 lb.\nThe g capability of the ESG to be used in the first developmental navigational test is 4 g, of which 1g is allotted to\nthe static g environment. Exceeding the 3-g capability\nabove the 1-g static environment of the ESG will result in\ndestruction of the gyroscope.\nThe environment specified by MIL STD 810A that the\nESG is expected to survive is:\nShock, 10-g terminal sawtooth\nVibration :\nMilitary aircraft\n0.10-in. double amplitude (DA)\n1g\n0.036-in.
