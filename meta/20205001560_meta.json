In that, I converted the OnePlace home page to the Service Portal to match NASA OnePlace\u2019s current application design standards, I was able to allow users to easily find applications in OnePlace and I was able to allow users to easily find and request OnePlace services (new app development, new knowledge base, etc.). It was a major accomplishment to be able to remodel a website that soon the entire Langley center that uses OnePlace will use. The website was made through ServiceNow\u2019s Service Portal, and I organized the applications like never before,  allowed a  clear styling to  applications  a  user  does  not  have  access  to and/or are  new applications, browsing of applications with clear button divisions, and allowing for different options depending if app is accessible or not, with proper error checking in place and very-well documented code. It was amazing to incorporate all this logic into one widget so that whoever wants to utilize this feature has no trouble at all to do so. The 3 most important things I learned were being able to do this work within ServiceNow, as it is such an important enterprise platform for CRM and boosting the connected  workforce of NASA, incorporate built-in  APIs  from  ServiceNow Glide Records  to connect Server Scripts to Client  Scripts  and  HTML,  and  be  able  to use agile  to  get another experience  of managing  work capacity with  stories,  and having  proper communication with the team if every feature is done correctly and steps for continuing forward. The part that I enjoyed the most was the training I did for ServiceNow and I freedom I had to experiment to see how to structure the Service Portal. I was not tied down, and I believe this allowed for a better outcome of the product. \n\nAs  part  of  the  internship,  I created a  very  in-depth  design  document  with  the  help  of  my team to document the project goals before it was started and technical documentation (including the design document) summarizing the final result of the product in terms of the new features added and the explanation of the logic thoroughly so that anyone can understand the project easily. The technical documentation will be published as a Knowledge Article within OnePlace Knowledge Base documentation.\n", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "US", "submissionId": 20205001560, "endDate": "2020-05-01T04:00:00.0000000+00:00", "nctsn": "", "sponsors": [{"organizationId": "68603dff261e5d2d9de5a550aa9e6b30", "meta": {"organization": {"name": "Langley Research Center", "location": "Hampton, Virginia, United States"}}, "meetingId": "03db15d26c4f44c980f422c4103ee222", "id": "d3c0686609964a328a7f011e24582955"}], "name": "Spring Interns 2020 Exit Deliverable Presentations", "location": "Langley Research Center", "id": "03db15d26c4f44c980f422c4103ee222", "url": "", "startDate": "2020-01-13T05:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20205001368, "type": "SUPPLEMENT_TO", "title": "OnePlace Service Portal Redesign - Exit Presentation", "stiType": "PRESENTATION", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "Ariel Wald - Abstract Spring 2020.pdf", "notes": "", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20205001560/downloads/Ariel%20Wald%20-%20Abstract%20Spring%202020.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20205001560/downloads/Ariel%20Wald%20-%20Abstract%20Spring%202020.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20205001560/downloads/Ariel%20Wald%20-%20Abstract%20Spring%202020.pdf.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
