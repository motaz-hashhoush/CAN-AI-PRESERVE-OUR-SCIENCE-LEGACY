Manufacturing techniques and the tooling used to fabricate each of the polyimide/glass structures is discussed. A brief history, tracing the development of high-temperature polyimide resins, is presented along with a discussion of the properties of DuPont's PI 2501/glass material (later redesignated PI 4701/glass). Mechanical and flammability properties of DuPont's PI 2501/glass laminates are compared with epoxy, phenolic, and silicone high-temperature resin/glass material systems. Offgassing characteristics are also presented. A discussion is included of the current developments in polyimide materials technology and the potential civilian and government applications of polyimide materials to reduce fire hazards and increase the survivability of men and equipment.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19750011368, "id": "4d0b2d400d4a490a89f4e9e01f001192", "publicationDate": "1975-03-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19750011368.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19750011368/downloads/19750011368.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19750011368/downloads/19750011368.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19750011368/downloads/19750011368.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
