This supposition is based on an analogy with central uplifts of  terrestrial cryptoexplosion structures. Sierra Madera in west Texas is one of these structures. The structure of its central uplift is described as a proposed analog of the central peaks of large lunar impact craters. Setting and stratigraphy of the Sierra Madera are discussed together with structural framework, the central uplift, fold patterns, and fault patterns. It is concluded that the central uplifts of Sierra Madera and similar cryptoexplosion structures appear to be analogous to central peaks of large lunar impact craters.", "title": "Structure of Sierra Madera, Texas, as a guide to central peaks of lunar craters.", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-06T21:02:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19720057448, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Howard, K.
