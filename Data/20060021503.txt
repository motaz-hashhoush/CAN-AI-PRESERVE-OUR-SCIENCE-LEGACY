At that time, I was just beginning to think about\nwhat space might mean in my career, although I\xe2\x80\x99d been interested\nin space for many years. I had read a lot of science fiction and\nclosely watched Al Shepard\xe2\x80\x99s first short jaunt into space followed\nby Gus Grissom\xe2\x80\x99s.\nGus Grissom\xe2\x80\x99s flight actually brought it home pretty personally\nbecause Gus grew up 12 miles from my hometown. Twelve miles\nin Indiana is a long way, but still everybody is family within the\nstate. So we thought of Gus as a hometown hero, and that\nimpressed upon me that, gosh, real people can go into space.\nYou have to be very well qualified and physically fit to withstand\nthe rigors of spaceflight. But I figured that a small-town boy\nfrom Indiana could go into space if he gets a good education. So I\nwent to Purdue University, the same school that Gus went to,\nand graduated in engineering.\nEven then, I believed that I was going to design and build\nspaceflight equipment. It was only in the 1970s, as NASA began to\nbuild the first reusable space ship, that I came to the slow realization that, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not just the test pilots, not just the Bob Crippens\nof the world, that are going to get go into space, but scientists\nand engineers too. Gosh, I am an engineer. Maybe I can do this.\xe2\x80\x9d\nLo and behold, I had the opportunity to go to work for one\nof the largest aerospace companies in this country, McDonnell\nDouglas. I specifically asked for the opportunity to work on a\nprogram that was going to fly equipment in space. The company\nat that time was subcontracting to Rockwell, which was the\n\n109\n\n22785-looking back book final 2\n\n11/20/02\n\n1:13 PM\n\nPage 110\n\nLooking Backward, Looking Forward\n\nprime contractor to NASA for producing the Space Shuttle orbiter. The\nsubcontract that McDonnell Douglas had was to build some of the\npropulsion equipment. So they said, \xe2\x80\x9cOkay. You want to build\nequipment that goes into space? Work on these tanks.\xe2\x80\x9d That thrilled\nme for a little while, but then I said, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not really what I wanted.\xe2\x80\x9d\nI was looking for an opportunity to do engineering and scientific research with processes that could be commercialized. That\xe2\x80\x99s\nthe point at which I wanted to jump into the perspective of the\nnonprofessional astronaut\xe2\x80\x99s opportunity to fly in space. Spaceflight\nis certainly a personal experience, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll touch on that.\nBut I also want to reflect first on the professional experience.\nMy opportunity to fly came through my employer at the time.\nMcDonnell Douglas was looking for an opportunity to exploit\nthe unique microgravity environment of space. In the late 1970s, the\ncompany selected a process called electrophoresis, which demonstrated the capability to purify biological materials. Electrophoresis\nwas first very briefly demonstrated on the Apollo 14 mission. In\nfluid form, virtually every biological substance is part of a very\ncomplex mixture of proteins and cellular materials. Electrophoresis\nis useful to purify pharmaceutical and other chemical products.\nPurification processes here on Earth have to operate within gravity.\nBut for separation processes in biotechnology, we see impurities\ncreated because of the churning in an imperfect purification\nprocess. Going into a low-gravity environment should prevent\nthat from happening, and that was the theoretical basis for the\nelectrophoresis technology.\nThe early experiments didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to validate that, but we\nwanted to carry it forward on a scale that had not been seen\n\n110\n\n22785-looking back book final 2\n\n11/20/02\n\n1:13 PM\n\nPage 111\n\nGoing Commercial\xe2\x80\x94Charles Walker\n\nbefore. The Space Shuttle was the obvious way to do that. It was\nthe space truck. It was going to be going into space with plenty\nof cargo capability, with crew attendants to monitor and modify\nthe early experiments or, later on, the production processes. So\nMcDonnell Douglas applied to NASA for the opportunity to fly\nthe experiment. The first opportunity was on the Spacelab module.\nUnfortunately, it looked like NASA\xe2\x80\x99s process of reviewing our\nequipment and our processes for safety and function was going\nto take up to three years.\nIn the business world, that\xe2\x80\x99s called a showstopper. When\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve got one-year research budgets, you have reviews even\nmore frequently, and your budgets are scrubbed one year at a time.\nYou have to show results. We needed to have some real significant progress and creative thinking in a lot less than three years\xe2\x80\x99\ntime. This was before John Young and Bob Crippen\xe2\x80\x99s first mission,\nthe first flight of STS.\nThe decision was made to try to fit the experiment package\ninto the crew compartment. Later I found out that this caused\nsome friction because our package was going to infringe upon\nthe food preparation facility space. We accepted that opportunity,\nand we engineered the experiment to fly in that pressurized crew\ncompartment volume, rather than in the research module, and to\nbe tended by the crew.\nThe first time it happened was on STS-4, in June 1982, and\nthis flight was very successful. But I want to point out that it\ntook a big investment on the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s part, since this was\nthe first such NASA-industry joint endeavor agreement in which\nthere was no exchange of funds. NASA got from the arrange-\n\n111\n\n22785-looking back book final 2\n\n11/20/02\n\n1:13 PM\n\nPage 112\n\nLooking Backward, Looking Forward\n\nment the opportunity to do research with our equipment. A third\nof the time on orbit was for NASA-sponsored research, and the\nremaining two-thirds was our time. For that opportunity and for\nthe integration of our equipment into the Space Shuttle and for\ncrew training, McDonnell Douglas invested millions of dollars.\nThe safety and fit checks took up to a year-and-a-half to go\nthrough. Now this was the first time this had been done aboard the\nSpace Shuttle inside the crew compartment. There had been outfitting for experiments in the Spacelab module, but this was different.\nThe process was grueling at times. A lot of engineering and technical effort was put into meeting the safety and fit requirements.\nFunction was different. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily have to function.\nWe didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be successful, except for our own objectives.\nNASA simply wanted to make sure that it was safe for the\nShuttle vehicle, safe for the crew, and that it fit in place properly.\nWe did fly that first time in June 1982. What was unique\nabout that, from a historical standpoint, is that not only were we\nthe first industrial payload to fly aboard the Space Shuttle, but\nwe also did it in an extraordinarily rapid period of time. That\nyear or so to prepare for that first flight was then followed by six\nmore flights within forty-one months. There is perhaps only one\nother industry-sponsored or industry-participating space payload that has had such a rapid turnaround time. That\xe2\x80\x99s flying\nonce every seven months with a different research objective.\nMost of the equipment was the same, which is what allowed us\nto fly so rapidly. Industry remained interested because of the very\nrapid turnaround time and frequent access that allowed an evolution toward a research and a commercial objective. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got\n\n112\n\n22785-looking back book final 2\n\n11/20/02\n\n1:13 PM\n\nPage 113\n\nGoing Commercial\xe2\x80\x94Charles Walker\n\nto have that research environment where you can test. You\xe2\x80\x99ll\nscratch your head over the results, get to that \xe2\x80\x9cah-ha\xe2\x80\x9d moment,\nand then go back and try it again as quickly as possible.\nReflecting back to that flight in June 1982, the experiment\noperator was one of the two crewmembers onboard on that mission.\nThe first four missions only had two crewmembers onboard.\nHank Hartsfield, in the right seat on that mission, was the principal operator of the equipment. He turned it on and off, and\ntook some very good photographs that helped us evaluate the\nexperimental work.\nIt went very well, so much so that then my company asked\nNASA the big question. \xe2\x80\x9cSay, training mission specialists and\npilots to conduct our research is good and important, but the\nbest way for us to obtain the maximum result is to send a\nresearch engineer along.\xe2\x80\x9d NASA\xe2\x80\x99s response was, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, we\xe2\x80\x99ve\nkind of been looking forward to an opportunity like that. We\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know that now is the time, but now that you\xe2\x80\x99ve asked the\nquestion, let\xe2\x80\x99s see if we can find an answer. Maybe yes, but\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ve got to meet all the qualifications that our career astronauts\ndo.\xe2\x80\x9d NASA then asked my company, \xe2\x80\x9cHave you got anybody in\nmind?\xe2\x80\x9d Well, lo and behold, I\xe2\x80\x99d had my hand up for two or three\nyears already. It was getting tired by that point in time, so I was\nglad that NASA said maybe yes.\nIt took a while to go through the checkout and qualification\nprocess, and, quite frankly, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t go through the routine selection\nprocess at the same time that the astronaut candidates were\ngoing through selection; although the process was the same. So\nit was a bit of a challenge to synch up with the Astronaut Office since\n\n113\n\n22785-looking back book final 2\n\n11/20/02\n\n1:13 PM\n\nPage 114\n\nLooking Backward, Looking Forward\n\nI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even a resident there. I was still a resident in St. Louis at\nthe time. NASA worked with me and the company on schedules\nand travel to and from Houston, and it worked out very well.\nThe opportunity was absolutely marvelous. It was a personal\nand a professional challenge absolutely. But the opportunity to fly\nwith not only these tremendous career NASA astronauts, but to\ngo into the environment that few other human beings have had\na chance to do was a thrill beyond belief. To accomplish some\ncareer objectives in that regard made it even more exciting.\nSince then, times certainly have changed. When talking\nabout research in space, and in particular the industrial perspective,\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ve got to come forward from that time in the early 1980s to\ntoday. Today we think about the Space Shuttle in the form in\nwhich I daresay it was originally intended, as a space truck, not\nas a laboratory going into space and coming back, but as a truly\nversatile space transportation system.\nWe\xe2\x80\x99re building an International Space Station in orbit.\nSixteen international partners are putting together a research\nlaboratory that is unsurpassed in that environment. Just getting\nit there is the largest technical peacetime program ever undertaken. The challenges are immense, but the opportunities are\ntremendous too. Science is being done there now and will continue\nto be done. Industrial research will be done there as well, both\nin basic scientific and technological applications.\nThere have been some recent studies such as the KPMG\nmarketing study for commercial opportunity and commercial\napplications on the ISS, a study which was done for NASA in\n1999. Their finding was that the commercial opportunities were\n\n114\n\n22785-looking back book final 2\n\n11/20/02\n\n1:13 PM\n\nPage 115\n\nGoing Commercial\xe2\x80\x94Charles Walker\n\nstill very limited as seen by commercial industry. Industry still\nsees two high hurdles: cost and frequent access. Again, industry\nneeds to respond to boards of directors and to stockholders, who\nneed to see results. You need to have action. You need to\nrespond to research and objectives, and to test these objectives in\na potentially commercial program and know where you\xe2\x80\x99re\ngoing. You need to be able to change course quickly if necessary\nand cut losses when necessary.\nRight now to get on the ISS, it\xe2\x80\x99s about an eighteen-month\ncycle for review of safety, fit, and functionality. That\xe2\x80\x99s just for the\nfirst flight aboard a research rack. That\xe2\x80\x99s a little daunting in itself.\nBut unfortunately we are still largely at the point where you\nsay, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, when I can redo my experiments, how quickly can I\nreaddress them?\xe2\x80\x9d And the response is, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to be\nable to either have telepresence installed such that you can\nmanipulate conditions, temperature, pressure or depending on what\nyour experimental objectives are and your equipment\xe2\x80\x99s capability, or maybe we can find some crew time, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to\narrange that, but probably not on the schedule that you would\nlike instantaneously, or you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to wait until the equipment\nor some part of it can be brought back home or replaced in some\nmany months, or maybe even a little more than a year\xe2\x80\x99s time.\xe2\x80\x9d It\nis very difficult for industry to accept limitations of those kinds.\nAnother issue is that there are no payload specialists coming\nup through the ranks anymore. That was my category of noncareer\nastronaut, a payload specialist, one who specifically focused on\na research mission. There aren\xe2\x80\x99t any in the program today, and I\nthink that\xe2\x80\x99s a problem for industry and for science and research.\n\n115\n\n22785-looking back book final 2\n\n11/20/02\n\n1:13 PM\n\nPage 116\n\nLooking Backward, Looking Forward\n\nIn closing, while the conditions are more rigorous today\nfor the ISS than they were in the very early days of space travel,\nopportunities still abound, and we just need to overcome the\nhurdles. As Pogo put it, \xe2\x80\x9cBy gosh, we seem to be surrounded by\nan insurmountable opportunity here.\xe2\x80\x9d This really is a great time\nin human spaceflight. We\xe2\x80\x99re doing marvelous things up there\nfrom an engineering standpoint. We now have to put them to\ngood use. We need to optimize the 30 percent of the ISS that our\nfederal government and the international partners have available\nin terms of the Station\xe2\x80\x99s power, volume, and crew time. Despite\nthe recent issues with cost and schedule, as Mr. Goldin has said,\nthis Agency will find a way.\nThis country and the partners will find a way to restore the\nISS\xe2\x80\x99s capability. We need help from this government, from our\nCongress, from our partners to do that, but it will be done, and\nthen this facility is going to be world class\xe2\x80\x94nah, it will out-ofthis-world class.\nI\xe2\x80\x99m pleased to be a part of not only the history of spaceflight\nand the history of industry\xe2\x80\x99s participation in spaceflight, but I\xe2\x80\x99m also\npleased to be a part of the future, the future applications, the future\nbenefits that our spaceflight program is going to bring to our\neconomy, to our careers, and to those of us that are both taxpayers\nand participants as well, to the great joy of seeing success as part of\nthis country, as a part of our intellect, applied to the great beyond.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a wonderful tomorrow. I\xe2\x80\x99m glad to be part of it.\n\n116\n\n'
