The purpose of the combining operation is to recover signal to noise ratio (SNR) losses due to antenna deformations and atmospheric effects. Previously, arbitrary signal powers and noise variances were assumed, but no attempt was made to match the receiver channels to the available signal powers. It is shown that for any signal power and noise variance distribution, a best channel assignment exists that maximizes the combined SNR in the limit of vanishingly small combining losses. This limit can be approached in practice by observing sufficiently many samples. Specific signal power and noise variance distributions are considered, and it is shown that even relatively noisy channels can be used effectively to recover SNR losses resulting from signals diverted out of a high-quality channel by antenna deformations.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19910022949, "id": "a553311af5a741a4bbe2537ea952cf0e", "publicationName": "The Telecommunications and Data Acquisition Report", "publicationDate": "1991-08-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
