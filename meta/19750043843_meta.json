The new jump resonance characteristic is described as a 'frequency island' due to the fact that a portion of the input-output transfer characteristic is disjoint from the main body. The presence of such frequency islands was predicted by using a sinusoidal describing function characterization of the dynamics of an inertial gyro employing nonlinear ternary rebalance logic. While the general conditions under which such islands are possible has  not been examined, a numerical approach is presented which can aid in establishing their presence. The existence of the frequency islands  predicted for the ternary rebalanced gyro was confirmed by simulating the nonlinear system and measuring the transfer function.", "title": "Jump resonant frequency islands in nonlinear feedback control systems", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-08T03:42:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19750043843, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Koenigsberg, W.
