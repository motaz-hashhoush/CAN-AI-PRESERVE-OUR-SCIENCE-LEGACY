Zenith angles are entered as positive numbers for rising\ntargets and negative\nnumbers\nfor setting targets.\nThe mass of the target is calculated\nfrom the\ndiameter\nand ballistic coefficient.\nThe user may opt to use the ballistic coefficient\nof a Na sphere\nof the chosen diameter.\nThe beam diameter\nat launch,\npulse energy,\nand maximum\nzenith angle are used to\ncalculate a minimum pulse duration to prevent the onset of stimulated\nRaman scattering.\nThe user\nwill generally\nuse this minimum\npulse duration\nin order to maximize\nintensity.\nThe spreadsheet\ndoes not perform\nany extinction\ncalculations\nin its present version.\nThe momentum\ncoupling\ncoefficient\nis calculated\nfrom Phipps\'s\nempirical formula for aluminum alloys with plasma ignition,\nwhich depends\non the intensity\non the target, wavelength,\nand pulse duration.\nIt varies with\nzenith angle because of the intensity dependence.\nIt is assumed that adaptive optics corrects\nthe beam for atmospheric\ndensity variations,\nand that 84% of the energy is concentrated\nin an angular radius given by 1.22 L/D, where D is the\nlaunch diameter.\nThe spreadsheet\ndoes not check that the intensity is great enough\nfor plasma\nignition, but the user may view the intensity calculations.\nThe user may view a graph of the perigee change for single pulses as a function of zenith\nangle.\nAlso available\nis a \'graph of the perigee change per zenith angle increment\nfor multiple\npulses.\nThe spreadsheet\ncalculates\nfinal orbital elements after a pass with continuous\nhits over the\nselected zenith angle range, but these numbers must be considered\nas estimates\nonly. They don\'t\ntake into account the changes in trajectory\nover the course of the bombardment.\n\nxI._-2\n\nRESULTS\n\nOF SPREADSHEET\n\nINVESTIGATIONS\n\nDebris in circular orbits are considered\nfirst.\nA small target is one for which the laser\nalways illuminates the entire target.\nA large target is one for which the laser only illuminates a\nportion of the target.\nA target which is entirely illuminated when near the laser and not entirely\nilluminated further from the laser is an intermediate\ncase, acting as a large target at small zenith\nangles and as a small target at large zenith angles.\nA single pulse is most effective in lowering\nthe perigee of a small target when it is fired\nnear a zenith angle of 30 degrees (altitude 60 degrees) as the target rises in the west.\nThis is the\nangle at which the decrease\nin intensity\nwith distance\nis balanced\nby the increase\nof the\neffectiveness\nof the impulse as it is applied more nearly opposite\nthe velocity\nvector.\nAt the\nzenith, a single small pulse has little effect, but a large pulse or many small pulses lower the\nperigee.\nAt negative zenith angles, as the object is setting in the east, it is possible for small pulses\nto raise the perigee while large pulses lower it.\nIf the laser is pulsed steadily as the piece of debris makes its pass, the zenith angle changes\nmost rapidly near the zenith, and more pulses are fired in equal zenith angle increments\nfurther\nfrom the zenith.\nThe greatest\nperigee change per zenith angle increment\nis attained\nfor zenith\nangles near 50 degrees.\nA large piece of debris always intercepts the same fraction\nof the laser energy, and the\neffect of a single pulse increases\ntoward larger zenith angles, until it is offset by the decrease\nin\nmomentum\ncoupling with decreasing\nintensity.\nThe increase in effectiveness\nwith zenith angle is\neven more pronounced\nwhen the effect of pulses is considered\nas a function\nof zenith angle\nincrement.\nIt is advantageous\nto use the largest possible zenith angles, limited by extinction.\nThe situation is somewhat\nmore complicated\nwhen elliptical orbits are considered.\nThe\ngreatest reduction\nin perigee can be attained when the object is approaching\napogee as it transits\nthe zenith. Under these circumstances,\nlaser shots over a wide range of zenith angles, including\nsome negative angles, lower the perigee.\nThese circumstances\narise about once every fourth\norbit.\nIf it happens that the object has passed apogee as it transits the zenith, laser pulses at\ncertain positive zenith angles can raise the perigee instead of lowering it. When the object is near\nperigee as it approaches\nthe zenith, all pulses at positive zenith angles have a weak tendency to\nraise the perigee.\nSince there is no range of zenith angles at which laser\nin all circumstances,\nit is necessary\neither to determine\nthe\ntarget is acquired, or adopt a strategy\nwhich tends to lower\npossibility\nof raising perigee\nin a certain fraction\nof cases.\ncircumstances,\none must measure the range, radial component\nchange.\nThe zenith angle interval required for this measurement\n\npulses are certain to lower perigee\norbital circumstances\nat the time a\nperigee on average\nbut admits the\nIn order to determine\nthe orbital\nof velocity, and rate of zenith angle\nneeds to be studied.\n\nFor a common debris object of fixed composition\nand shape, namely a solid Na sphere, in\nan initially circular orbit, I have investigated\nthe maximum size of object whose perigee can be\nlowered to 400 km in a single pass as a function of the altitude of the orbit. The maximum sizes\nestimated with LASER2D\nare listed in Table 1. Spheres of diameter 0.5 cm and 1.0 cm can be\nbrought down to 400 km perigee in a single pass from orbits of 1400 km and 1100 kin,\nrespectively.\nLarger pieces of debris are best characterized\nby total mass.\nAs an example\nI considered\nan object of diameter\n100 cm and mass 10 kg. The strategy for lowering\nits perigee from 1500\nkm to 400 km was to fire on it when its apogee was nearly overhead,\nat zenith angles from 75\ndegrees\nto zero degrees.\nThe perigee\nand apogee\naltitudes\nafter each pass estimated\nwith\nXLIX- 3\n\nLASER2D\nare shown in Table 2. The perigee is lowered below 400 km in 13 passes,\nentire process could be accomplished\nin as little as about four days.\n\nso that the\n\nTable 1.

The pulse duration is 1.43 ns.

A detection\nscheme must be found which finds pieces of debris as they rise low above the\nhorizon,\nand measures\ntheir ranges, radial velocities,\nand transverse\nvelocities.\nThese are to be\nused to calculate\nthe orbital circumstances\nwell enough to decide where in the pass it would be\neffective\nto hit the object with the laser.\nThe system should operate\nday and night to be most\neffective.\nThe system must be capable of recognizing\ntargets such as working\nsatellites\nwhich are\nnot to be hit.\n2. A large adaptive optics system must be built which compensates\nfor the density fluctuations\nin\nthe atmosphere,\nso that a near-diffraction\nlimited beam can be concentrated\non the target.\nThis\nsystem should work at all zenith angles, day and night, and for a target which is moving rapidly\nwith respect to the air mass.\n3. A targeting\nsystem must be built with a pointing accuracy\non the order of 0.1 tarad to place the\nbeam on the target and keep it there.\nThis must be done while the target is moving rapidly, and\ntake into account that retardation\ncauses the target to appear many beam widths behind its actual\nposition at the time the pulse is to arrive.\nIt must also be possible to follow the object as its path\nchanges due to the cumulative\neffects of laser pulses.\nREFERENCES\n1.
