When the animals were mature (125 to 150 d), the physiological status of the soleus (SOL) and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles of the small- and large-cage animals were compared. Analysis of whole-muscle properties including the performance of the test muscle during a standardized fatigue test in which the nerve to the test muscle was subjected to supramaximal intermittent stimulation shows: (1) the amplitude, area, mean amplitude, and peak-to-peak rate of the compound muscle action potential decreased per the course of the fatigue test; (2) cage size did not affect the profile of changes for any of the action-potential measurements; (3) changes exhibited in the compound muscle action potential by SOL and EDL were substantially different; and (4) except for SOL of the large-cage rats, there was a high correlation between all four measures of the compound muscle action potential and the peak tetanic force during the fatigue test; i.e., either the electrical activity largely etermines the force profile during the fatigue test or else contractile-related activity substantially affects the compound muscle action potential.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19850017769, "id": "269e1b18c99a484b828c81526bbbfc90", "publicationName": "NASA.
