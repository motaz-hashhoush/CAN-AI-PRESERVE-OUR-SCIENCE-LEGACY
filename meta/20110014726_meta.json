Alternatively, in its simplest use, and with minimal effort, PARAMESH can operate as a domain-decomposition tool for users who want to parallelize their serial codes but who do not wish to utilize adaptivity. The package builds a hierarchy of sub-grids to cover the computational domain of a given application program, with spatial resolution varying to satisfy the demands of the application. The sub-grid blocks form the nodes of a tree data structure (a quad-tree in two or an oct-tree in three dimensions). Each grid block has a logically Cartesian mesh. The package supports one-, two- and three-dimensional models.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20110014726, "id": "2fc7bc11701a4261932337d80badf34e", "publicationName": "NASA Tech Briefs, February 2005", "publicationDate": "2005-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20110014712, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "NASA Tech Briefs, February 2005", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20110014726.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20110014726/downloads/20110014726.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20110014726/downloads/20110014726.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20110014726/downloads/20110014726.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
