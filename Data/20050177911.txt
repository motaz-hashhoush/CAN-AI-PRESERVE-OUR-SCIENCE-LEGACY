b'Comparative Soot Diagnostics\nExperiment Looks at the Smoky World of\nMicrogravity Combustion\nFrom an economic standpoint, soot is one of the most important combustion intermediates\nand products. It is a major industrial product and is the dominant medium for radiant heat\ntransport in most flames used to generate heat and power. The nonbuoyant structure of\nmost flames of practical interest (turbulent flames) makes the understanding of soot\nprocesses in microgravity flames important to our ability to predict fire behavior on Earth.\nIn addition, fires in spacecraft are considered a credible possibility.\nTo respond to this risk, NASA has flown fire (or smoke) detectors on Skylab and the\nspace shuttles and included them in the International Space Station design. The design of\nthese detectors, however, was based entirely on normal gravity (1g) data. The detector\nused in the shuttle fleet is an ionization detector, whereas the system planned for the space\nstation uses forward scattering of near-infrared light. The ionization detector, which is\nsimilar to smoke detectors used in homes, has a comparative advantage for submicron\nparticulates. In fact, the space shuttle model uses a separation system that makes it blind\nto particles larger than a micron (believed to be dust). In the larger size range, the lightscattering detector is most sensitive.\nWithout microgravity smoke data, the difference in the particle size sensitivities of the two\ndetectors cannot be evaluated. As part of the Comparative Soot Diagnostics (CSD)\nexperiment, these systems were tested to determine their response to particulates\ngenerated during long periods of low gravity. This experiment provided the first such\nmeasurements toward understanding soot processes on Earth and for designing and\nimplementing improved spacecraft smoke detection systems.\nThe objectives of CSD were to examine how particulates form from a variety of sources\nand to quantify the performance of several diagnostic techniques. The sources tested\nincluded four overheated materials (paper, silicone rubber, Teflon-coated (DuPont) wire,\nand Kapton-coated (DuPont) wires), each tested at three heating rates, and a candle tested\nat three air velocities. Paper, silicone rubber, and wire insulation, materials found in\nspacecraft crew cabins, were selected because of their different smoke properties. The\ncandle yielded hydrocarbon soot typical of many 1g flames. Four diagnostic techniques\nwere employed: thermophoretic sampling collected particulates for size analysis; laser light\nextinction measurements near the source tallied total particulate production; and laser light\nscattering and ionization detector measurements far from the particulate source provided\ndata for evaluating the performance of smoke detection systems for these particulate\nsources.\n\nComparative Soot Diagnostics (CSD) hardware. The Far-Field Box contains space\nstation and space shuttle smoke detectors. The Near-Field Module, which is placed in the\nGlovebox facility, contains the combustible samples.\nThe CSD experimental hardware consisted of two modules: the Near-Field Module and\nthe Far-Field Box. The Near-Field Module contained the combustible sample and nearfield diagnostics. The Far-Field Box contained two spacecraft smoke detectors, an exact\ncopy of those currently used on the shuttles and a prototype International Space Station\ndetector. Products (soot and gases) from the near-field tests were transported to the FarField Box and subsequently back through Teflon hoses, isolating the crew from the\nsmoke. This project was a collaborative effort of the NASA Lewis Research Center, the\nNASA Marshall Space Flight Center, and the NASA Johnson Space Center.\nFor the majority of the samples, detectable smoke concentrations were produced and the\nsmoke was detected by both detectors. Smoke particulate samples were successfully\ncollected for most of the tests. Smoke particle size distributions determined from\nTransmission Electron Microscope data are being evaluated. In general, the lightscattering detector detected the smoke from the majority of the tests, whereas the\nionization detector was less sensitive to smoke from some of the tests. Both detectors\nresponded very well to the smoke from these sources in preflight normal-gravity tests, this\nsuggests that the particle size distribution shifted toward larger particles.\nFind out more about the Comparative Soot Diagnostic experiment.\nLewis contact: Dr. David L.
