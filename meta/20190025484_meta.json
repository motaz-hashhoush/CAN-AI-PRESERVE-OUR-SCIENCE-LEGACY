KSC, as a costal launch facility, is subjected to incredibly corrosive conditions in the form of high salt content from the nearby ocean, high temperatures and humidity, and frequent storms. As such, corrosion control is a vital part of operations here at KSC. To tackle these issues, this internship focused on three main projects; creating a corrosion control database, revamping KSC's Corrosion Lab website, and running corrosion studies in the lab and in the field.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20190025484, "id": "32f2fc87ca0b4606a146b613b7c2ad2e", "publicationDate": "2017-08-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20190025484.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20190025484/downloads/20190025484.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20190025484/downloads/20190025484.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20190025484/downloads/20190025484.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
