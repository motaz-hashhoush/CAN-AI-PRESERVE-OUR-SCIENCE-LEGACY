As the spectrum available for an MSS is limited, the system's channels should be packed as closely together as possible, with minimum-width guard bands. In addition the employment of frequency reuse schemes is an important factor. Difficulties regarding these solutions are related to the introduction of interference in the link. A balance must be achieved between the competing aims of spectrum conservation and low interference. While the interference phenomenon in narrowband FM voice channels is reasonably well understood, very little effort, however, has been devoted to the problem in digital radios. Attention is given to work, which illuminates the effects of cochannel and adjacent channel interference on digital FM (FSK) radios.", "title": "Evaluate interference in digital channels", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T11:12:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19850052846, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Davarian, F."}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Pasadena, CA, United States"}}, "id": "87e129c4816b499c820e32927ee92d39"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19850052846, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Sumida, J."}, "organization": {"name": "California Institute of Technology, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena", "location": "CA, United States"}}, "id": "d9aafe66bfe241c2aad313627899eed1"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19850052846, "publications": [{"volume": "24", "submissionId": 19850052846, "issn": "0745-2993", "id": "a01e06ea6bfb43d5b697c901a2369244", "publicationName": "Microwaves & RF", "publicationDate": "1985-05-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
