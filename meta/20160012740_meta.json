With the current Soyuz training flow, physician support is required for nominal training evolutions involving pressure changes or other potential physical risks detailed in this presentation. In addition, full-time physician presence in Star City helps to address the disparity in access to health care in these relatively remote practice areas, while also developing and maintaining relationships with host nation resources. A unique part of standard training in Russia also involves survival training in both winter and water environments; logistic details and medical impacts of each of these training scenarios will be discussed. Following support of a successful training flow, UTMB/KBRwyle's Star City Medical Support Group (SCMSG) is also responsible for configuring medical packs in support of Soyuz launches and landings; we will present the rationale for current pack contents within the context of specific operational needs. With respect to contingency events, the group will describe their preparedness to respond appropriately by activating both local and global resources as necessary, detailing a specialized subset of the group who continually work and update these assets, given changes in international infrastructure and other impacts.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20160012740, "endDate": "2017-05-04T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Aerospace Medical Association", "location": "Alexandria, VA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "b69d4cc1d65b4305b04ea06c7104bd66", "id": "782412f55a2448c38737d76284f6f967"}], "name": "AsMA Annual Scientific Meeting", "location": "Denvor, CO", "id": "b69d4cc1d65b4305b04ea06c7104bd66", "startDate": "2017-04-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20160012740, "id": "dc8546db24104cbebeaaf6515c662b61", "publicationDate": "2017-04-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20160012740.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20160012740/downloads/20160012740.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20160012740/downloads/20160012740.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20160012740/downloads/20160012740.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
