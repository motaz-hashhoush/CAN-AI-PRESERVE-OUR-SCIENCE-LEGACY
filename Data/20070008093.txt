The obvious potential for space weather applications is so great that NOAA has\nworked to incorporate the real-time data into their forecast center as much as possible. A subset\nof the STEREO data will be continuously downlinked in a real-time broadcast mode, called the\nSpace Weather Beacon. Within the research community there has been considerable interest in\nconducting space weather related research with STEREO. Some of this research is geared\ntowards making an immediate impact while other work is still very much in the research domain.\nThere are many areas where STEREO might contribute and we cannot predict where all the\nsuccesses will come. Here we discuss how STEREO will contribute to space weather and many\nof the specific research projects proposed to address STEREO space weather issues. We also\ndiscuss some specific uses of the STEREO data in the NOAA Space Environment Center.\n\n1. Introduction\nAs society becomes increasingly reliant on technologically advanced systems for many of its\nday-to-day functions, our ability to predict and respond to the impacts of space weather gains\ngreater importace. Among the systems most susceptible to geomagnetic disturbances include\npower grids, satellites, and aviation communications--systems upon which our reliance increases\ndramatically every year. The use of pagers and mobile phones has become almost ubiquitous.\nThe global positioning system (GPS) is used heavily by the military, commercial airlines, and the\nshipping and boating industry, and is being introduced into automobiles. As the use of these\nsystems, which are vulnerable to space weather, becomes more widespread, space weather\ndisturbances will impact a wider array of people and human activities.\nOne example of this was the apparent loss of a communications satellite and associated\nwidespread loss of services due to a space weather disturbance, which was described by Baker et\nal. (1998). They found that the combination of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), solar flares, and\nhigh speed solar wind streams led to a prolonged period of geomagnetically disturbed conditions\nduring which the Galaxy 4 communications satellite was subjected to an intense population of\nhighly energetic, relativistic electrons just prior to its loss. Since our society is becoming more\ndependent on advanced technological systems, we are increasingly vulnerable to malfunctions in\nthose systems. A single civilian communications satellite can cost several hundred million\ndollars. There are now over 300 commercial spacecraft in geosynchronous orbit and entire new\nconstellations of satellites are being placed into a variety of Earth orbits. If even a small\n\npercentage of these satellites exhibit severe problems due to the space environment, the costs\nwill be significant (Odenwald et al. , 2006).\nThe need to study, forecast and mitigate space weather effects is gaining increased attention at\nthe national level. Specifically, the need to develop a coordinated plan to improve present\ncapabilities in specifying and forecasting conditions in the space environment has led to the\nformation of national programs such as the U.S. National Space Weather Program\n(http://www.ofcm.gov/homepage/text/pubs.htm), NASA\xe2\x80\x99s\nLiving\nWith\na\nStar\n(http:Nlws.gsfc.nasa.gov/), and ESA\xe2\x80\x99s Space Weather Programme (http://www.esaspaceweather.net/). As a scientific pursuit, space weather is considered analogous to\natmospheric weather, having both research and forecasting elements. In some sense, our\nknowledge and ability to build predictive models of space weather is equivalent to the early\nstages of atmospheric weather studies (Siscoe, 2006).\nThe ultimate source for most space weather effects is the Sun and its activity. The NOAA Space\nEnvironment Center categorizes space weather in three convenient scales which are each related\nto the type of solar event driving them (Poppe, 2000). All three scales rate space weather\ndisturbances on a scale from one (1) to five (5), with one being considered \xe2\x80\x98minor\xe2\x80\x99 and five\n\xe2\x80\x98extreme.\xe2\x80\x99 The G (Geomagnetic Storm) scale is discussed in the next section. The R (Radio\nBlackout) scale is based on the GOES X-ray flux measurement. High levels of X-ray flux result\nin significant enhancements of ionization of the ionosphere on the sunlit side of Earth, causing\nsudden ionospheric disturbances (SlDs) and communication problems. Note that extreme\nultraviolet and radio emissions also contribute to ionospheric effects, but the X-ray flux serves as\na useful proxy in their place. The S (Solar Radiation Storm) scale is measured against the flux of\nsolar energetic particles (SEPs). These SEPs are accelerated in eruptive solar events. The most\nenergetic SEPs (>1 GeV) arrive at Earth within tens of minutes, for well connected events on the\nSun\xe2\x80\x99s western hemisphere. The bulk of the particles in SEP events have lower energies (10-100\nMeV) and begin to arrive tens of minutes to hours after solar onset. Eruptive events originating\non the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s eastern hemisphere have delayed onsets relative to well connected events (Cane et\nal. , 1988). These events cause ionospheric-related communications and navigation problems.\nMost SEP protons are accelerated in interplanetary shock waves dnven ahead of CMEs. The\nproton flux can remain elevated for days and can cause state changes or latch ups in electronic\ndevices on satellites and hazardous conditions for astronauts and even airline crew and\npassengers.\n\n1.1 CMEs and Space Weather\n\nAs mentioned previously, the third space weather scale is the G (Geomagnetic Storm) scale.\nMost of the energy imparted to the solar wind by a solar event is associated with the ejected\nplasma and magnetic fields that collectively are called a coronal mass ejection and usually take\nseveral days to reach Earth. However, the fastest CMEs travel from the Sun to the Earth in less\nthan one day. Note that high speed wind streams also cause geomagnetic storms, but rarely do\nthey produce very strong storms. CMEs cause space weather disturbances, including the largest\ngeomagnetic storms, in a number of ways. First, strong southward magnetic fields in the CME\ncan reconnect with the predominately northward fields of the Sun-facing magnetosphere,\nproducing strong induced fields and electric currents in the magnetosphere, the ionosphere, and\n\nat Earth\'s surface. These southward field regions can occw both in the compressed plasma\nbetween the shock and CME and in the CME itself, which often contains magnetic field\nstructures called magnetic clouds. Second, the impact of the CME compresses Earth\'s day side\nmagnetosphere, which can leave high altitude geostationary satellites directly exposed to the\nsolar wind. The third way CMEs drive space weather is through the production of SEP events, as\ndiscussed in the previous section.\nAlthough recent strides have been made in our understanding of the relationship between CMEs\nand space weather, our current ability to forecast space weather disturbances caused by CMEs is\nstill relatively poor. Improvements are needed both in our ability to predict if and when a CME\nwill impact Earth as well as in prediction of the magnitude and duration of the anticipated\nimpact. The Large Angle Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) and Extreme Ultraviolet\nobservations from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)\nImaging Telescope (EIT)\nhave demonstrated an advancement in this prediction capability by reliably detecting halo CMEs\n- events that are directed along the Earth-Sun line and are visible as expanding \'halos\' around the\ncoronagraph occulting disk. Halo CMEs were first identified with the Naval Research\nLaboratory SOLWIND coronagraph (Howard et al., 1982) but only a handful were seen. With\nthe increased sensitivity of the LASCO coronagraphs, however, it is now possible to detect\nalmost all of these events. In addition, observations of the origin of the CME on the disk by EIT,\nGOES Soft X-Ray Imager (SXI), H-alpha, radio, etc., can be used to determine whether the\nCME is headed toward or away from Earth.\nThe associated surface activity of "frontside" halo CMEs can be well observed and when the\nCME passes near-Earth spacecraft, the physical structure of CMEs can be analyzed. Initial\nstudies using LASCO data showed that frontside halo CMEs were associated with flaring active\nregions and filament eruptions within half a solar radius of Sun center and often accompanied at\ncoronal wavelengths by circular, expanding fronts, or waves, and areas of dimming (e.g. Moses\net al., 1997; Thcnpson et al., 1998).\nThe geoeffectiveness of halo CMEs has been examined in several studies by comparing the\ntimings of the CME onsets with WIND and Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) spacecraft\ndata at 1 AU and with geomagnetic activity. Bmeckner et al. (1998), St. Cyr et al. (2000) and\nWebb et al. (2000) found good correlations between frontside halo CMEs and moderate\ngeomagnetic storms with a lag time of 2-5 days dependent on the phase of the cycle. Magnetic\nclouds preceded by interplanetary shocks usually signified the arrival at Earth of the CME\nstructure.\nThe lesson from the SOHO data that pertains to the STEW0 mission is that even moderately\nenergetic CMEs, such as observed by LASCO near solar minimum, can be very geoeffective\nbecause they often contain coherent magnetic structures and move faster than the ambient solar\nwind. One dramatic example of this occurred in January, 1997 when an unremarkable halo\nCME, as seen by LASCO, was associated with the failure of the Telstar 401 satellite (Webb et\nal., 1998; Reeves et al., 1998). From the space weather viewpoint, one key element is to\ndetermine whether the CME is aimed toward Earth or not. With STEW0 we also anticipate\nsignificant improvements in our ability to predict the timing and impact of CME-induced\ngeomagnetic disturbances.\n\n2. Use of the STEREO Instruments for Space Weather\nAt different periods during the STEREO mission the space environmental forecasting utility will\nemphasize different portions of the payload. Early in the mission, while the two spacecraft are\nstill relatively close to Earth, the in-situ instruments, the In Situ Measurements of Particles and\nCME Transients (IMPACT) Experiment (Luhmann et al., this volume) and the Plasma and\nSuprathermal Ion and Composition (PLASTIC) Experiment (Galvin et al., this volume), will\nlikely be more useful to space weather as they will detect large scale structures in the solar wind.\nFor example, either spacecraft may encounter interplanetary CME (ICME) shocks prior to their\narrival at Earth. Also, solar energetic particles from activity east of about 45" west heliographic\nlongitude will travel along interplanetary magnetic field lines and be detected by the lagging\nspacecraft minutes to hours before their arrival at Earth. Further, corotating interaction regions\ncan be geoeffective, and these will be detected by the lagging spacecraft prior to their passage by\nEarth. Identification of potentially geoeffective features in the plasma electron, magnetic field,\nand energetic particle data from IMPACT should be straightforward. The ion compositional\ncontent from PLASTIC will be useful for identifying ICMEs and other structures in the solar\nwind.\nAs the STEREO spacecraft dnft farther away from Earth, the SECCHI imaging instrument suite\nwill become more important for space weather forecasting by providing observations that are not\navailable from the Sun-Earth line. The eruption of Earth-directed CMEs will be detected by the\nSun Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation (SECCHI) EUVI, CORl, and\nCOR2 experiments (Howard et al., this volume). Early in the mission, when the STEREO\nspacecraft are near the orbit of Earth, CORl and COR2 will record halo CMEs produced by\nfront-side sources detected with E W I . This is currently done with the LASCO coronagraphs\nand EIT instrument on SOHO and these instruments will continue to provide data during the\nearly phases of :he STEREO mission. As the separation of the STEREO spacecraft increases,\nthe different vantage points will allow determination of the velocity vector of the CME, as well\nas the material that will directly impact Earth. The velocity vector and its rate of change will be\ndetermined by triangulation techniques involving simultaneous stereo image pairs. Also, images\nfrom E W I on the lagging spacecraft will show newly formed active regions prior to their\nappearance at the Sun\'s east limb (as seen from Earth). E W I will also image other potentially\ngeoeffective structures such as coronal holes and filament channels.\nThe strongest geomagnetic storms are caused by CMEs and it is clear that significant\nimprovements still need to be made in forecasting these storms. This is expected to be a main\narea of focus for space weather research with STEREO, as it has been with SOHO. Accurate\nprediction of whether or not a CME will occur is a highly desired goal. However, the path to\nsolving that particular problem is not clear. When a CME does occur, there are still many\nparameters of a geomagnetic storm which need to be forecast. In particular, the first parameter\nto determine is the impact angle of the CME on the Earth. Will it hit Earth directly along its\ncentral axis or will it graze or miss Earth completely? In the case where the CME will hit Earth,\nthe next parameters to forecast are the arrival time, geomagnetic storm strength, and\ngeomagnetic storm duration. Much work has been done on the first two of these parameters\nduring the past solar cycle, utilizing data from the SOHO mission. Many authors have examined\n\nthe ability to predict CME arrival time based on available data, particularly the CME speed as\nmeasured by SOHOLASCO. The typical error in arrival time has been found to be of order +11\nhours (Gopalswamy et al., 2000; Gopalswamy et al., 2001; Michalek et al., 2004), though\nGonziilez-Esparza et al. (2003) and Cho et al. (2003), have shown the error can be reduced to +9\nhours in some cases or with certain models. Less work has been done on predicting geomagnetic\nstorm intensity, though Moon et al. (2005) has shown from a limited data set that a simple\nmeasure of CME impact parameter does correlate with geomagnetic storm strength.\nSTEREO Waves (SWAVES) will be used as a remote sensing instrument to produce radio\ndynamic spectra (Bougeret et al., this volume). These spectra will be used to track the\npropagation of shocks associated with Type II interplanetary radio bursts through the heliosphere\n(e.g. Kaiser et al., 1998). The comparison of dynamic spectra from the two spacecraft will give\nan estimate of the true location of the emission, and hence of the shock, by calculating the time\ndelay between the observations.\nThe occurrence rate of CMEs follows the solar sunspot cycle in phase and amplitude. The rate\nof CMEs at solar minimum is about 0.5 per day and peaks at almost 6 per day at solar maximum\n(St. Cyr et al., 1999; Yashiro et al., 2004; Gopalswamy, 2006). The primary STEREO mission\nwill extend from late 2006 to late 2008, during the solar minimum activity phase. However,\nimportant geomagnetic storms can occur during any phase of the solar cycle and there will be\nplenty of CMEs to provide data of interest to researchers.\nThe global solar magnetic field and its extension into space will simplify during the approach to\nsolar minimum and consequently the identification and tracking of individual CME events from\nthe new STEREO viewpoint should be relatively straightforward. This simplicity, in turn,\nshould aid our ability to investigate the origins of CMEs, their propagation through the solar\nwind, and their coupling to Earth\'s environment.\nIn terms of timing, we need to determine the time of arrival at Earth of a CME from the distance\nand time measurements of its frontal speed, or from the speed of any interplanetary shock being\ndriven ahead of the CME. We know the leading edge of a CME is its fastest portion, with\nvelocity dispersion through to the rear of the CME where the material is moving slowest. Thus,\nprominence material, if embedded within a CME, always moves outward more slowly than the\nwill be important for\nleading edge. The coronagraphs and Heliospheric Imagers (HIS)\ndetermination of the kinematics of a CME as it moves outward from the lower corona through\nthe solar wind.\n\nA real advance in our ability to predict the arrival of CMEs at Earth should be provided by the\nHIS on both STEREO spacecraft, which will track CMEs throughout their trajectory to Earth.\nThis is an important new component of our space weather prediction capability, because of the\nstraightforward ability to accurately predict the arrival of a CME at Earth. Though it is not yet\nknown what the errors in estimated arrival times will be, in contrast to the 29 hours or greater\nfrom the prediction techniques discussed earlier, the HISshould provide significantly smaller\nerrors. The HIS are designed to reliably determine the trajectory and three-dimensional structure\nof any Earthward CME. Since the HIS will view all CMEs traveling along the Sun-Earth line,\n\nimage reconstruction will allow us to determine, for each Earth-directed CME, the direction of\nits central axis, its overall geometry and size, its mass and its velocity.\nThe next step in advancing our understanding of this aspect of space weather lies in predicting\nthe geoeffectiveness of CMEs, which is strongly governed by the southward component of its\nmagnetic field, B,. One area where advances might be expected is in predicting B, resulting\nfrom pileup of the heliospheric plasma sheet in front of a CME. Odstrcil et al. (2005) was able\nto show that with good modeling of the background heliospheric structure and with a crude\nparameterization of a CME\'s initial properties in the low corona, the piled up field could be\nreasonably modeled. With the improved determination of CME properties that STEW0 will\nprovide, models can be better constrained and thereby produce better results.\nThe twin STEREO spacecraft will provide valuable platforms for detecting and studying SEP\nevents. SEPs are known to be well associated with fast and wide CMEs and their attendant\ninterplanetary shocks (Reames, 1997). High energy (1 to hundreds of MeV) particles in an SEP\nevent are thought to be accelerated in the shock near and ahead of a fast CME. When the\nparticles gain access\nto open field lines\nahead of the shock,\nthey can propagate\ninto the heliosphere\nfar\nfrom\nthe\nacceleration\nsite.\nSince the open field\nlines emanating from\nthe Sun form an\nArchimedean spiral,\nthe particles are\nforced to travel\nalong these curved\npaths (see Figure 1).\nThus, SEPs will\nhave the most direct\naccess and will\narrive earliest at a\n12 13\n15 16 17 15 19\npoint in space which\nf8kb\nis east of the SEP\nsource\nlongitude.\nFigure 1: A view of the ecliptic plane of the heliosphere with 4 inset images\nshowingthe SEP event profile expected for each of 4 observer locations relative Therefore, a particle\ndetector\non\na\nto the ICME location.

Therefore, the\nSTEREO spacecraft lagging Earth (STEREO-B) will be well connected to field lines which are\nnear Sun center as viewed from Earth. Its particle detectors can be used to predict the onset and\nsize of a prompt SEP, as well as the onset of the CME associated with the SEP, at Earth. This is\none of the most important reasons to have a real-time Beacon available for the STEREO mission.\n\n3. The Space Weather Beacon\nThe STEREO Space Weather Beacon mode is a continuous, real-time, low data-rate (633 bps)\nbroadcast of the data from the STEREO instruments. The Beacon mode (e.g. St. Cyr and Davila,\n2001) is desired for use by both civilian and military agencies for enhancing and providing\ncontinuity for space weather products. NASA will provide coverage through the Deep Space\nNetwork for about 3 hours per day. Because of the value of the STEREO data, the NOAA Space\nEnvironment Center (SEC) has taken on the responsibility to establish a ground station network\nto ensure that coverage of the Space Weather Beacon broadcast from both satellites is\ncontinuous. A complete discussion of the flow of Space Weather Beacon data from the\nspacecraft to the STEREO Science Center (SSC) is covered by Eichstedt et al. (this volume).\nThe SSC will make the Level 0 and higher level products available to the scientific community\nand to NOAA/SEC forecasters in near real-time, with a latency of about 5 minutes from the time\nthe data are received at the ground stations. The data and products desired by NOAA will be\nfetched automatically from the SSC for integration into forecast specific tools. In general, the\ndata that will be available in the beacon will be a subset of the full science data set, and will be\naveraged, binned, and/or compressed to maximize the number of observations which can be\nreturned. Care has been taken to work with the instrument teams to ensure the resulting data will\nstill be of value to the NOAA space weather forecasters. Some of the tools that are envisioned\nfor use by the NOAA forecasters are described in section 5.\n\n4. Space Weather Tools and Projects\nThe STEREO Space Weather Group was formed in 2002 for the purpose of promoting the\nscientific community\xe2\x80\x99s involvement in preparing, well in advance of the launch of STEREO, to\nuse STEREO data for space weather. More specifically, the Space Weather group has led in\norganizing the various efforts in software development, modeling efforts and research studies in\npreparation for using the STEREO observations as a tool for Space Weather. The public internet\nsite for the group is available through the \xe2\x80\x9cScience: Space Weather\xe2\x80\x9d link on the home page of the\nhttp://stereo.gsfc.nasa.gov/ or\ndirectly\nat:\nSTEREO\nScience\nCenter\nat:\nhttp://wwwsolar.nrl.navy.mil/STEREO/swx/swindex.html. interested scientist, whether or\nAny\nnot they are a member of the STEREO consortium, is invited to join in the group\xe2\x80\x99s efforts, as\ndescribed on the website.\nAll pertinent details and information related to the STEREO Space Weather Group efforts are\ncoordinated at the group\xe2\x80\x99s website and its activities are closely coordinated with those of the\nSSC, where the STEREO data, including the Beacon data, will be available. The purpose of the\nSpace Weather Group is to help coordinate space weather efforts involving the STEREO mission\n\nand its instruments, including that of individual team members, and to help coordinate those\nefforts that lead to tools and products that can be tested and used before and after the STEREO\nlaunch. Other activities of the group include incorporating and interfacing STEREO data and\nspace weather activities with: (1) Both imaging and in-situ data from other existing space\nmissions such as ACE, Wind, SOHO, Ulysses, the Transition Region and Coronal Explorer\n(TRACE) and Solar Mass Ejection Imager (SMEI), and ground-based observations such as\ninterplanetary scintillation (IPS), optical line and broadband emission, and radio, and future\nmissions planned for the STEREO timeframe, such as Solar-B, SXI, and the Solar Dynamics\nObservatory (SDO); (2) The Geospace community to understand the coupling of and geospace\nresponses to CMEs and other transient disturbances by encouraging and participating in space\nweather campaigns; (3) The Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC) and other\nsimulation and modeling groups to use STEREO data as input to space weather models; (4)The\nSECCHI 3D Reconstruction and Visualization Team to develop models that have a space\nweather context; (5) The various virtual observatories that are being developed; (6) The\nInternational Heliophysical Year (MY) program in 2007; (7) Meetings and workshops involving\nspace weather; and (8) NASA\xe2\x80\x99s EP/O and P A 0 and other outreach activities.\nSome of the tools and projects currently being developed for use with the STEREO observations\nfor space weather applications are briefly described next. These have been grouped into\ncategories of Space Weather Tools, including those for CME Detection and CME-related\nFeatures Detection, Space Weather-Enabling Projects, and Data Browsers and Viewers. Each\nproject description contains a title, the names of the main coordinators and their affiliations, and\na brief description and goal. Such projects are continually evolving, so this list should be\nconsidered only as an indication of the projects that will be available at the start of the mission.\nUndoubtedly, after launch, and as the STEREO data accumulates, the concepts of how to use\nthese data for space weather purposes will evolve and new projects will be added.\n\nSPACE WEATHER TOOLS:\nGeometric Localization of STEREO CMEs (V.

Space Weather Tools for the SEC Forecast Center\n\nIn this section, we describe some of the STEREO mission related tools which SEC has identified\nas desirable. Some of these tools will be developed in time for the start of the mission, while\nothers may never be developed, dependmg on whether our preconceptions of the utility of the\ndata turn out to be true and are commensurate with the resources needed for development. There\nare several important points to make about integrating STEREO data into the SEC forecast\ncenter. With the addition of so many data sets, it will be difficult for forecasters to inspect all of\nthe relevant basic time series data or raw imagery from STEREO in addition to all of the data\nalready used in the forecast center. Thus, algorithms which can do at least some simple\ninterpretation of the data will be valuable. In addition, without tools to take advantage of the\nthree-dimensional view provided by STEREO data, the full value of the STEREO data to\nforecasters will not be realized. It is hoped and expected that many of the projects described in\nsection 4 will be successful and will produce tools and products which can be transitioned to the\nSEC forecast center.\nIt is worth mentioning that there are substantial hurdles which must be overcome for a tool to be\nused by forecasters. First and foremost, the overall benefit the tool provides to forecasters must\nbe clear. However, even when the benefits of a tool or model are clear, unless the forecasters\nhave confidence that the tool is providing a good prediction at a certain time or for a specific\nevent, they are unlikely to use the tool. Thus, it is vital for validation studies to have been\nperformed, illustrating under what conditions a tool does or does not work.\nThe STEREO PLASTIC and IMPACT instruments provide a suite of observations which\ncomplement the NASA ACE mission (Stone et al., 1998; Garrard et al., 1998) data currently in\nuse by NOAA forecasters. Thus, the only additional knowledge required for interpretation of the\nin-situ data from these instruments will be recognizing how to account for the displaced location\nof the STEREO spacecraft relative to ACE. One obvious way to do this is to use the lagging\nSTEREO-B spacecraft as a monitor of co-rotating structures. Whether it is a sector crossing or a\nhigh speed wind stream, the lagging spacecraft will encounter these structures before they sweep\npast Earth. One year into the mission, the lead time for corotating structures will be about 40\nhours. There will be an obvious trade-off between the forecast lead time and the confidence in\nthe forecast, as longer lead times mean greater time for a structure to evolve. Even given a\ntemporally stable structure, small changes in spatial location can lead to significant observed\ndifferences, as was clearly shown by results from the HELIOS mission (e.g. Schwenn et al.,\n1981). Any temporal changes can be mitigated to some extent by ensuring the forecasters also\nhave access to models of the solar wind. Thus, for forecasters, we envision a standard data\ndisplay, similar to what forecasters use for ACE SWEPAM data, showing solar wind density,\nspeed and temperature (see http://www .sec.noaa.gov/ace/ACErtswdata.html). Appended to this\nwould be the same parameters from STEREO-B, with the lead time clearly identified on the\nhorizontal axis. Overlaid on this would be the solar wind speed derived from the Wang-Sheeley\nmodel (Wang and Sheeley, 1990). Returning to a point made in the previous paragraph, adding\nthe Wang-Sheeley solar wind model to this display aides the forecaster, as a variation on this\nmodel is currently used in the forecast center (Arge and Pizzo, 1999). Note, the predictions from\nboth STEREO-B and Wang-Sheeley are valid only for co-rotating structures and any\n\ninterplanetary ejecta will invalidate the output of these models. Clearly forecasters will need\nsomething integrated into the tool, or good situational awareness, to identify times when the\nmodel output will be invalid due to the presence of ICMEs.\nAnother potential product would involve utilizing the STEREO-B solar wind data to provide a\nlonger lead time for predicted Kp from the Costello Geomagnetic Activity Index (e.g. Detman\nand Joselyn, 1999; http://www.sec.noaa.gov/rpc/costello/index.html). Because the model, as\ncurrently implemented, relies on data from the ACE spacecraft, it is only used for short term\nwarnings. It is obvious that adding STEREO-B data to this model would provide a longer lead\ntime. Note, again, this added lead time will typically not be useful in the case of ICMEs.\nEcliptic Plane IMF\n2 0 AU\n.0\n\n90\n\nOctober 29,ux)3\n\n1\n\n180\n\n~\n\n-\n\nToward\n\n270\n\n1\n\n(4 EXPI\nza3$\n\nAWly\n\nFigure 2: The interplanetary magnetic field as\ncomputed with the HAFv2 model.

(EXPI),\nHuntsville, Alabama\n\nBoth for the Wang-Sheeley model and for the\nHakamada-Akasofu-Fry version 2 (HAFv2) solar\nwind model (Fry et al. 2003) STEREO will\nprovide important validation data. While the\nHAF model is not an official SEC forecast\nproduct, it is used by forecasters, and it has\nrecently been adopted by the USAF Air Force\nWeather Agency. Both models can provide an\necliptic plane view of the heliosphere, out to any\nheliocentric distance (see Figure 2). The HAFv2\nmodel output is available out to 10 Astronomical\nUnits, encompassing the orbits of Mars, Jupiter\nand Saturn. Currently, validations for each model\ncan only be based on comparisons to ACE data.\nOne data point of comparison for a model of the\nwhole ecliptic plane is obviously inadequate. The\naddition of data from both STEREO spacecraft is\nstill woefully inadequate, but will be a significant\nimprovement over the current situation. This will\nbe particularly true for Mars forecasts when Mars\nis not in conjunction with Earth but may be in\nconjunction with either of the STEREO\nspacecraft.\n\nImprovements to SEC\xe2\x80\x99s SEP event prediction is consistently identified as a high priority need by\nthe forecasters. Given the clear relationship between the shape and relative timing of SEP\nlightcurves and the longitude difference between the source region and Earth (Cane et al., 1988),\nadding the STEREO spacecraft SEP data should provide some of the desired improvement.\nDetermining what needs to be done to create a tool which takes the real-time STEREO data and\nproduces an improved SEP prediction at Earth has not yet been done.\nTurning now to the remote sensing data, it is obvious that the three-dmensional information\nabout ICMEs that STEREO will provide can be of great benefit for forecasters. However, there\nare currently a myriad of ideas on how the three-dimensional reconstructions can be done and\nhow they can be displayed. Here, we outline one simple example that would be beneficial to\n\nforecasters. From a display perspective, rather than giving the forecaster complete control and\nthe ability to view an event from any angle, the basic information needed can be reduced to three\ndisplays. First, the same ecliptic plane view, as illustrated in Figure 2, is an obvious choice.\nThis gives the forecaster the ability to see the relative location of the event and Earth, along with\na way to see how it is evolving and accelerating. The display would also show the longitudinal\nextent of the ICME and its distribution of mass. Second, a view from perpendicular to the SunEarth line, in the ecliptic plane, would illustrate the latitudinal extent of the event and the\ndistribution of mass. Third, and finally, the ability to also see a view from the perspective of an\nobserver on Earth, looking in the direction of the Sun will be important. This would give the\nforecaster the information they need about whether the event will strike Earth. The same\ninformation could be derived from the first two views, however, this particular view would make\nit obvious from just a single picture.\nPictures and movies are always good to have, partly because they give forecasters a quick\noverview of the situation, but also because they are a quick way to validate the output of any\nmodel or tool. A tool that SEC researchers envision for the forecast center would be one which\nprovides all of the desired parameters about CME related geomagnetic storms in one place. As\ndescribed in earlier sections, efforts are underway or planned on forecasting CME arrival time,\nCME impact angle and the resulting storm magnitude, and even on the basic question of whether\nthe interplanetary CME will strike Earth. Asking a forecaster to perform all the image\nprocessing necessary to derive such information, even given acceptable models, would be too\ntime consuming. Thus, automation of CME detection, CME speed determination, CME impact\nangle, and potentially other parameters will be needed. Much work has been done in this area\n(e.g. Robbrecht and Berghmans, 2005) but much more work is needed. Automated tools which\nhave a high rate of false positive results may be sufficient for a researcher, but are of little or no\nuse for forecasters, who must act in real-time. Given an automated tool meeting forecaster\nneeds, its output can then be fed into models which predict if the CME will hit Earth, and if so\nwhen, how strong the resulting storm will be and how long the storm will last. Putting these\npredictions into a single display for forecasters with the associated errors would be a significant\nbenefit. By constantly updating the forecasted parameters, utilizing data from the SWAVES and\nSECCHVHI instruments, it is hoped that forecasters would be provided with the best possible\npredictions throughout the entire transit of an ejection. As stated earlier, the imagery would be\navailable. to validate and check any of the parameters being predicted.\n\n6. Summary\nThe NOAA Space Environment Center believes the STEREO mission will be a significant\nbenefit for forecasters and has invested the effort to put together a ground station network to\nreceive the STEREO data in real-time. But, the promise of the STEREO mission and the\nexpected return from the mission is just that, a promise. When the data finally become available\nand the performance of the instruments is verified, then we will have a better idea of whether the\npromise will be realized. It is difficult to predict which elements of the program will be\nsuccessful and ultimately beneficial to forecasters, either immediately or in the long term. In this\npaper, we focused primarily on the promise of projects and illustrated some of the features which\nare necessary for a successful product; primarily utility, ease of use, and validation. One thing to\nkeep in mind is that with the changing elongation angles, the relative utility of STEREO will\n\nconstantly evolve. This may also necessitate changes in the way data are interpreted as the\nmission progresses. However, there are no technical hurdles to the STEREO mission extending\nbeyond its 2 year design life and, if the mission proves successful, the research advances made\nduring the first one-half orbit of STEREO to the far-side of the Sun could be applied as each\nSTEREO spacecraft completes its orbit, coming back towards Earth.\n\n7.
