This internship included a project to create a command center for a 120 ton regolith bin, a design and build for a blast shield to add further protection for the Surface Systems engineers, a design for a portable four monitor hyper wall that can extend as large as needed, research and programming a nano drill for a next generation robot, and social media tasks including the making of videos, posting to social networking websites and implementation of a new weekly outreach program to help spread the word about the Swamp Works laboratory. The objectives for the command center were to create a central computer controlled area for the still in production lunar regolith bin. It needed to be easy to use and the operating systems had to be Linux. The objectives for the hyper wall were to build a mobile transport of monitors that could potentially attach to one another. It needed to be light but sturdy, and have the ability to last. The objectives for the blast shield included a robust design that could withstand a small equipment malfunction, while also being convenient for use. The objectives for the nano-drill included the research and implementation of programming for vertical and horizontal movement. The hyper wall and blasts shield project were designed by me in the Pro/Engineer/Creo2 software. Each project required a meeting with the Swamp Works engineers and was declared successful.", "title": "Swamp Works- Multiple Projects", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2014-04-02T05:54:03.3800000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20140002583, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Carelli, Jonathan M."}, "organization": {"name": "University of Central Florida", "location": "Orlando, FL, United States"}}, "id": "98b79a1a7a554d22a26e7b04ef3087a5"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "id": 20140002583, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20140002583, "id": "25b982b86069491f80d57e428dba6f82", "publicationDate": "2013-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20140002583.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20140002583/downloads/20140002583.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20140002583/downloads/20140002583.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20140002583/downloads/20140002583.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
