b'Protein Crystal Growth\n\nP\n\nHealth and Medicine\n\nroteins are the chemical building blocks from\nwhich all human cells, organs, and tissues are\nmade. They also serve as the hormones, enzymes,\nand antibodies that help the body fight off invading\ngerms. Determining the structure of a protein enables\nmedical researchers to create pharmaceuticals that will\neither help or prevent a protein from doing its job.\nThrough a process known as structure-based drug\ndesign, researchers use the knowledge of a protein\xe2\x80\x99s\nstructure to develop new drugs to treat a variety of diseases. The predominate method of determining a protein\xe2\x80\x99s structure is by X-ray crystallography, which\ninvolves growing protein crystals and exposing them to\nan X-ray beam to determine their atomic structure.\nIn order to rapidly and efficiently grow crystals, tools\nwere needed to automatically identify and analyze the\ngrowing process of protein crystals. To meet this need,\n\n18\n\nDiversified Scientific, Inc. (DSI), with the support of a\nSmall Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract\nfrom NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Marshall Space Flight Center, developed\nCrystalScore,\xe2\x84\xa2 the first automated image acquisition,\nanalysis, and archiving system designed specifically for\nthe macromolecular crystal growing community. It\noffers automated hardware control, image and data\narchiving, image processing, a searchable database, and\nsurface plotting of experimental data. CrystalScore is\ncurrently being used by numerous pharmaceutical companies and academic and nonprofit research centers.\nDSI, located in Birmingham, Alabama, was awarded the\npatent \xe2\x80\x9cMethod for acquiring, storing, and analyzing\ncrystal images\xe2\x80\x9d on March 4, 2003.\nAnother DSI product made possible by Marshall\nSBIR funding is VaporPro,\xe2\x84\xa2 a unique, comprehensive\nsystem that allows for the automated control of vapor\n\nThe award-winning CrystalScore\xe2\x84\xa2 is an automated image acquisition, analysis, and archiving system for protein crystallization.\n\nS P I N O F F\n\n2003\n\nHealth and Medicine\n\nVaporPro\xe2\x84\xa2 provides solutions for higher quality crystal growth.\n\ndiffusion for crystallization experiments. The product\ncontains complete hardware and user-friendly software\nand was awarded patent protection in June 2002. Its\ncutting-edge features include individual vapor diffusion profiles for each chamber, as well as automated\ntime-lapse image acquisition, crystal detection, and\nliquid handling.\nWith a mission to make drug discovery easier, faster,\nand more affordable, DSI manufactures and markets\nproducts based on the crystallography and structurebased drug design research conducted at the University\nof Alabama at Birmingham\xe2\x80\x99s Center for Biophysical\nSciences and Engineering (CBSE), a NASA Commercial\nSpace Center. Formed as a CBSE spinoff company in\n1995, DSI has received several SBIR contracts from\nboth NASA and the National Institutes of Health to\ndevelop products that support crystal growth for all crystallographic applications, including drug design and protein engineering. The CBSE\xe2\x80\x99s commercial research is\nmade possible through NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Space Product\nDevelopment Program, a partnership between NASA,\nacademia, and U.S. industry.\nCrystalScore\xe2\x84\xa2 and VaporPro\xe2\x84\xa2 are trademarks of Diversified\nScientific, Inc.\n\nS P I N O F F\n\n2003\n\n19\n\n'
