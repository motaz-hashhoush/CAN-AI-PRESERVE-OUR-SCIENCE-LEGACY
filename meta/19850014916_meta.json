A few LANDSAT images obtained in the past were effectively used to verify and modify the depletion curve induced from the snow water equivalent distribution at maximum stage and the accumulated degree days at one representative point selected in the basin. Together with the depletion curve, the relationship between the basin ide daily snowmelt amount and the air temperature at the point above are exhibited homograph form for the convenience of the model user.
