The industry is the third largest U. S. Industrial employer with over 700,000 employees.\t Its use is growing at phenomenal\nrates.\t The U.S. is the world leader today.\t This success is due to large\nresearch and development efforts of the military, NASA and FAA.\t As a result,\n83 percent of the free world aircraft are U.S. built. \t The industry has a major\nrole in the export trade and provides a significant element of GNP.\nTo continue this in the future requires continued significant expenditures for research . Military funded research and development (R&D) has\nsupported civil aviation to a considerable extent either directly as in the\ncase of engines, or indirectly from military oriented R&D programs that provided\ntechnology usable by civil designers.\t A number of specific future civil needs,\nhowever, will not be satisfied by military R&D.\t Additional specific and concentrated efforts in research will be required by the civil sector.\t These include\nnoise and air: pollution research, better low-speed flight characteristics,\nredirection of wake turbulence, better cross wind handling capabilities, anticollision systems, fire hazard reductions, improved ATC, and all-weather\noperations capacity, economies, safety and environment.\t In addition, research\nand technology will be at lower program levels with basic military research\nfor aviation decreasing as fewer aircraft programs are initiated and the present\nnew aircraft programs move into the prototype and production status. \t Also,\n\n-2-\n\nn^e?e\n\n\t\nh\n\nrX\t\n\nLl\t\n\nfinancial problem q are facing some of the aircraft manufacturers reducing their\nfunding capability for research and technology. Consequently the intensive\nresearch effort will not come from industry but must come from NASA and\nDOT/FAA. This is an investment for the future.\nBetween now and 1990 an estimated $100 billion will be expended on\nnew equipment. Competition from Europe and Japan are aiming to capture a\nsignificant portion of this market. To offset these efforts, the U. S. must\ncontinue to maintain its technical superiority. This requires an aggressive\ncommercial transport research and technology program sponsored by the\nU. S. Government. NASA has the technical team and facilities to carry on\nthis intensive effort.\nThe aviation industry is a major force in the U. S. It employs over\n700,000 employees in manufacturing and the airlines. Its sales are over\n$25 billion annually. It is the contributor of a positive trade balance, with\nover $3.5 billion in hardware sales in 1973. A phenomenal growth in domestic\ntransportation is projected over the next 30 years. By 1980 an average of over\n1 million passengers daily are projected. Projections of sales to replace\nexisting equipment and to meet their expanding workload projections are\nestimated to be over $100 billion between now and 1990. The U. S. is the\nworld leader in aviation.\nThis leadership is due to the support that the Federal Government\nhas provided over the fast 50 years. The national goals and mandates for\naviation are directed to preserving the role of the U. S. as leader in aeronautical, science and technology. Congress has directed that aeronautical\nactivities be the responsibility of and be directed by civilian agencies. The\nrole of the Federal Government has been in the sponsorship of substantial\nresearch and development, regulation of safety and aircraft operations,\noperation of airways, and in the control of economics. In the civil aviation\narea for example, over $400 annually is being spent by NASA and DOT for\n^\nR&T.\t\nFederal support has resulted in the development of a large aviation\nindustry, both in manufacturing and in air transportation.\nMost manufacturing companies have been engaged in military procurement, with civil aviation benefitting from the military effort by a transfer\nof technology. As military procurement emphasis shifts from the long haul\ntransportation aspect, industry will be faced with financing the research\non future long haul aircraft. Long term investment will be required, in\nsome cases several times a net worth of the manufacturer, with no appreciable\nfinancial return for a period of 5-10 years after program commencement. Such\nfinancial problems as cash flow are already being experienced by some manufacturers. In addition foreign competition is developing under a heavily subsidized national basis. Europeans for example, are striv ing for a deep penetration of the world market, hoping to capture 20-25 percent of aircraft sales by 1980.\n_3\n\nThe air transportation industry has traditionally been heavily government controlled and regulated. \t An oligopolistic structure exists.\t The area of\ngovernment participation has been in safety, reliability of service and\neconomics.\n\nI\n\ni\n\nSuperiority of the U. S. aircraft industry has been maintained by a strong\nresearch and technology effort, major emphasis in the design and production\nfphases on performances, effectiveness, cost, operating efficiency, reliability,\nand safety. Government support has assisted in financing, including credits\nfor foreign sales.\t An active marketing and service support effort have been\nintegral elements of the aviation industry.\n1\nResearch and technology is a basic major building block in the\noverall well-being of the aviation industry.\t This is the area of emphasis as\nwe examine its importance to the future.\t Government sponsorship has\nprovided the impetus for most of the technological advances made by U. S.\naviation.\t Generally the military has been the first to use the significant technological advances, building a foundation of operational experience that led\nto acceptance and use in civil aircraft programs several years later. \t Continued\nU. S. leadership in aviation requires\t major research effort today in areas\nsuch as noise abatement, pollution control, congestion, energy savings, short\nhaul air transportation, and long haul air transportation.\n\n\'\n(\n\n-\n\nResearch and technology is pursued by government, industry, and\nuniversities.\t In government, NASA performs basic research and technology,\nestablishes proof of the concept, disseminates findings in research and technology, and supports other agencies and industry with its unique national\nfacilities.\t DOT/FAA performs research, technology, and development effort\non air traffic control, runway and airports, navigation aids, communication,\nand environment.\n\n:.\n\nI\n\n`\n\n,0A\n\nMilitary research has financed significant efforts in research \t technology\ng\t\naJY\nrY\t\nand development, especially in applied research and prototyping for specific\naircraft systems.\t Industry effort is principally sponsored by government\ncontracts for research and technology.\t Industry has financed civil vehicle\nprototype development and some applied technology.\t Universities, operating\ngenerally under government contracts, are engaged in basic research and\ntechnology.\nThis research and technology effort is based on the legislative mandates\nobjectives outlined in\nof the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 and ob j\np\t\nPresidentive Aeronautics and Space Reports.\t It is recognized that aeronautics\nresearch and technology are critical to the health of aviation. \t Government should\ncontinue to provide the reservoir of technology and provide financial backing.\nThe present role of government extends to management, establishing\npriorities of effort, and financing of research and technology.. \t There are\nalternative approaches which need to be explored to determine the pros and\ncons.\t Management and control could be exercised by a quasi -Federal agency,\na COMSAT-type organization, university sponsorship, or by industry.\t The real;\n\nsr\n\n\'"\n\n9\n\na\t\n\n.\n\n^\n\nquestion is public versus private management. In addition, there is a question\nof whether present financing by the government should continue, or whether\nthe financing should become an industry responsibility, recoupments or\nuser charges applied to the benefits given to industry or agency users, or\na mixture, including joint funding of research and facilities. NASA has been\noperating under some jointly funded aircraft development programs and\njoint use of facilities. User charges for wind .tunnel tests are under review.\n\ni\n\nThe criteria for evaluating alternative approaches includes an\nexamination, of the nature of the product to be provided, responsiveness to\nchanging needs, efficiercy in terms of costs, ability to provide leadership,\nand to provide impartial and ,independent evaluation of approaches, and to\nprovide technological inputs for regulating functions.\nThe key question of course is can industry take on the management\nand financing role and meet the criteria and characteristics considered\nessential for a viable research and technology program. Industry has\nperformed research and development. It has the technical capability.\nIndustry has performed some research and development with its own funding,\nbut primarily in applied and prototype areas, directed toward speo\'ific aircraft\nsystems. Major financing of research and technology has been by government.\nThe financing aspect needs careful review since the profit incentive\nnecessitates a fast return in investment, compared to a 7-15 year lag in some\nmajor research projects for payback. Today\'s cash flow problems probably\nnecessitate application to other purposes. The profit necessity discourages\n"Public; Go o6" research and technology efforts. There is a\'-so a high cost of\nogy\nacquisition and operation of research and technology facilities.\n\nThe ability to disseminate findings of research and technology may\nalso be impaired due to proprietary considerations. There are also some \'anti-trust\nproblems If a consortium approach were applied. The consortium may be\nnecessary to spread the risk, since large investments will be required as the\nlevel of technological sophistication increases.\nThe government role in managing and financing civil aeronautical\nresearch and technology has been successful. The government has met the\ntest of responsiveness the abili ty to undertake p rograms with g reat risk ,\ng\t\nY\t\np g\t\np\t\nproviding financing meeting foreign competition, exercising a coordinated\nresearch and technology effort on a long range planning basis, disseminating\nfind ngs,, providing .independent evaluations, undertaking projects for "public\ngood" which could result in government cost reductions and utilizing the\nexcellent\'facil;ities already in existence.\n\n-5_\n\ni\n\nn\nz\nQ\n\nw\n\nNational crises require quick response and the ability to draw on\nthe government base of scientific and engineering talent. This occurred\nduring the recent energy crisis.\t The nature of many research and technology\nactivities involve uncertainty as to outcome and success. \t Only the government can afford to take such risks, involving large negative cash flows for long\nlead times.\t Support by foreign governments of competitive aeronautical\nresearch and technology introduces an additional risk for U.S. firms,\nwith the potential of reducing the market. \t Government, since it provides\nthe necessary financial support, can assure a coordinated research and\ntechnology effort geared toward the long term national goals and objectives\nand avoiding overlapping and duplication.\t Government can properly discriminate results in a broad and nondiscriminatory manner. \t Government expertise\nprovides an evaluation of competitive proposals and .accurate validation of\nindustry products and a role as technical broker between industry and the\nregulator.\t Government can undertake projects\t which will benefit government\nor industry as a whole and in many cases reduce costs, but for which there is\nno private incentive to engage in research and technology effort. \t Costs have\nalready been sunk in establishing excellent government aeronautical facilities,\nmany of which are unique.\t These are manned with highly competent personnel.\nWithin the government, NASA provides the major level of effort in\ncivil aviation research and technology.\t This applies to :environmental\nprotection, short and long haul. air transportation, aviation safety and air\ntransportation system requirements and technology base. \t There has been\nconsiderable precedent, legislative and operational experience i\xc2\xbb performing the.se tasks.\t It has the ability to maintain independent nonadvocacy position.\t NASA can benefit from commonality of the research\nbase with space, including the relationship between aircraft and shuttle.\nNASA is the focal point for dissemination of aeronautical data. \t NASA has\nestablished excellent relationships with and an understanding of industry and\nother government agencies.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9e\n\nIn summary, industry does not have the financial capability to assume\nResearch and Technology responsibility due to 1 1) the large investment required, which may be several times greater than in net worth of manufacturer,\n12) large negative cash flows,\t 3) risk with uncertainty of outcome and\nsuccess in marketing, and (4) profit necessity.\t Industry also does not have\nthe (l) responsiveness, 12) ability to disseminate findings on an impartial\nbasis, (3) ability to evaluate proposals and serve as technical broker\nbetween industry and regulator, and (4) capability to establish a coordinated\nand balanced aeronautical Research and Technology program.\nGovernment must thus continue to assume responsibility for management, control and funding.\t Some modifications in funding are possible with\n\n-6_\n\nr\n}\n\ngreater use of jointly funded Research and Technology projects, utilization\nof user charges, and increased cost sharing with industry. Government can\n(1) provide responsiveness to crisis, (2) undertake programs with great risk,\n(31) provide financing, (9) meet foreign competition, (S) exercise a coordinated\nresearch and technology effort, (G) disseminate findings impartially, (7) provide\nIndependent evaluation, (8) undertake projects for "public good", and\n(9) maximize use of facilities and the strong scientific team already in\nexistence.\nNASA should continue to manage, control and finance Research and\nTechnology for civil aviation, thus continuing the major role it has today.\nThe size and scope of NASA\'s responsibilities may well increase as divergent\ndesign objectives between military and civil use occur..\t Requirements in\nResearch and Technology for civil aviation may well increase. \t Also as program\nemphasis changes in the military area, program needs for civil aviation research\nand technology may increase to assure maintenance of U.S. superiority in\ncivil aviation.\nAny major change in mana g ement approach affecting financing and timing\nwill have a massive effect on future civil aviation. \t A shift in funding responsi-bilittes can bring great economic Burdens on air transportation.\t There is no\ncertainty that Research and Technology, as now planned, will be provided,\nwhich could result in the loss of U.S. leadership\t in aviation in the 1980\'s.\nThus any change in management of funding approach should be the subject of\nintensive study before implementation.\n.\xe2\x80\xa2\n{\n\nAppendix A is attached as an outline providing the logic of the\narguments supporting the foregoing issues in largely qualitative form. \t In\nappropriate cases, this is further supported by specific quantitative\nInformation.\n\n(t\t\nk\nt\n\ni^ww,..\t\n\n,\n\n,\n\n\':R\n\t\n\n\'+\nL\n\n\',\nM\t\n\n^\n\n..\'\t\n\n!\n\n;\n\n\t\n\na\t\n[\t\n...\n\n^\t\n\ni\t\n\nw\n\n\' wr\t\n\n.\n\n1\'i \t^,\n\ni\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\n{\n\nr\na\n^\t\n\nt\n1\n\n_\nf\t : ;\n#\nx\n\n-\t\n\nindustrial and administrative productivity, however, have limited application\nin the R&T area.\t Measures of productivity or effectiveness of research and\ntechnology can be based on the benefits estimated to be achieved. \t For example, in materials research, the objective of increasing the operating\ntemperature capability of turbine materials, with resultant higher specific\nthrust, lower specific fuel consumption, greater reliability and a lower direct\noperating cost could increase the return on investment by as much as nine\npercent, according to NASA program staff.\t Increased usage of composite\'\t\nmaterials now in research could offer potential improvements in weight of\n30 percent for large transports , estimated to be equivalent to a 20 percent\n\n,r\n\ni\n\nI V I\t\n\nAlternative Management and Funding Op tions for A eronautics P r g rams\nro\ncJOp\t\nA\t\nA\t\ng\t\nThe NASA Aeronautical Research and Technology (R&T) program is\nS.\t\naimed at providing the technological base to maintain U.S. superiority in\ncivil and military aviation.\t The NASA program provides research, advanced\ntechnology, and experimental programs to remove growth restraints to civil\naviation, provides direct support for future military systems, and undertakes\nfundamental research for the long term development of advanced aircraft.\nThese efforts must be undertaken on a balanced basis, recognizing resource\nlimitations, the speed with which aviation problems must be solved, and the\npriority with which the near-term problems and the long range problems should\nbe solved.\t A number of alternative approaches are possible and these must\nbe examined in terms of constraints and agency objectives.\nThe development of the aeronautical research and technology program\nmust be supported by exhibits and analyses that facilitate weighing the gains\nand costs of alternative program sizes.\t judgments or measurements of gains\nare important, in fact as important as measures of cost. \t The potential gains\nto be realized assume that certain breakthroughs or developments can be\nachieved.\t On the other hand, uncertainties must be recognized since research and technology often result in unpredicted payoffs. \t CostAenefit\nanalysis can be developed for appraising program productivity.\t The traditional\n\ni\n\'i\n\n..\n}\n-.\n\n}\na\n\ni\n\ni\n\ndecrease in operating costs of the aircraft \t improved knowledge of fatigue\nand fractures can reduce related maintenance cost to U.S. airlines of over\n$75 million per year, plus increasing safety. \t This provides a measure of the\npotential benefits and a means of assessing priorities.\nAnother measure is to examine specific technological advances made\nin U.S. aviation.\t Of the 51 major technological advances made, Government\nresearch, technology and development (both military and civilian) contributed\nto over 45 of the advances. \t Private industry funded only six.\nAnother technique is to measure the overall increase in cost\neffectiveness. Benefits are viewed as products of the total system operating\nin a complex environment and making use of the capabilities provided; by R&T.\n\n-8\xe2\x80\xa2\'\n\nt\n\nj\n\n-\n\nk^\n\nf\n\n\t\nt^\t\n^\n\n\t\n\n+,.\t\n\n%^.\'x\n\nV\t\n\n"\'.r\nAlw,`gt N\n\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\'?I\t\n\n.#`Mr^\n\t\n\n1\n\nNs\n\n^uz\t\n\n(\t\n\n\'\t\n\n+\n\nnr-:^4\t\n\ni\t\n\n]\n\nf\t\n\nISM d=A\n\na\n\nUnder this approach, overall improvements are considered. Operating costs,\nfor example direct operating costs of aircraft since World War II, have \t\nbeen reduced threefold. Accident rates have decreased by a factor of five.\nA favorable balance of trade has been a direct benefit from civil aviation.\nCivil aviation has grown until it contributes over $10 billion annually to the\nt\n`\t\nY \'\t\n\nt1\n\nGNP. These favorable trends indicate the importance of Government support\nof research and technology. It should be noted that there is a significant time\t\n-lag between development and acceptance ranging from 5 to 15 years,depending-on the nature of the event.\n\n\'{\n\n\xe2\x80\x9e.\n\nAnother approach in the evaluation of R&T is the concept of peers.\nTechnically,roequal workers operating in the same disciplines judge the\nquality of the work conducted.\nQuantification of performance, using such approaches as measuring\nnumber of reports published, frequency of citations by others, patents\nthe\n\nj ournals these measures can\nor the number ofa9 P\t ublished in scientific j\nP es p\nbecome self-defeating. The pressure to publish becomes paramount and\nquality suffers.\nPriorities can be established as they relate to such major program\nareas as noise abatement; fuel conservation; emissions; alternative energy\nsources; research on airframe design, structures, and materials; wake turbulence; aircraft operational efficiency and safety; research on flight control\navionics; human factors; aircraft fire technology; general aviation; and joint\nefforts with the military and other Federal agencies. Several program levels\t\nfor each major area of research may be dc-veloped to provide management\t\nwith meaningful program options. A balz. ^e between research areas is\nessential to assure that resources are ust, to meet the time-phased needs.\nThere is no need for undertaking concurren research effort, where one pro\nject can be accomplished in shorter time frame, and both are essential to\nthe completion of the total system effort. The shorter time period project can\nbe deferred until its phasing is in line with the longer term project.\nThe elements of analysis to be applied to the major programs and\nprojects should include the objectives, alternatives, resources required,\nmodels, and criteria. Choice of the objective is fundamental-what are the\nprime purposes of the NASA Aeronautics Research and Technology effort\'s\nWhat are the alternatives to attaining that objective? \'ghat are the costs\n\n_easily\n\nF\nil\t\n\n;.\t\n\nt\t\n\nof the alternatives ? To predict the consequences of alternatives models\nin the form of mathematical models or simple sets of relationships are\nestablished. Criteria is used to test which alternative should be chosen.\nCriteria are tests of preference. Ideally the course of action chosen should\nmaximize the attainment of the objective in terms of resources utilized,\ntiming, or satisfaction. Problems of choice can be divided into component\npieces ,P\t\ni.e.ubo timization. Both gains and costs appear in thg criteria.\ng\t\nPP\t\n\n9\n\n> <<\nj\n\ny\n\nH\nr\t\n\nnaa..eN+..tw..+w . ^.aw\n\ns\nf\n\nf\t\n\n4\n\nk\t\n\nConstraints of either gain or cost can be applied, seeking the way to get the\nmost for a given cost, or to achieve a specified objective at least cost.\nSuboptimization\xe2\x80\x94the breaking of the program into smaller chunks \xe2\x80\x94permits\nthe models used in estimating outcomes to be less aggregative and more ac-\t\ncurate in the forecasts. It also permits better hedging against uncertainty by\nbreaking the big problems into more manageable smaller pieces.\nCost/benefit analysis can be applied to NASA R&T. It permits a \t\njudgment as to whether the investment in research is productive. It provides\na means of justifying budgets and establishing a measure of priority. The\nestimate of benefits will, of course, take time to validate. Historical efforts \t\ncan be assessed in terms of benefits and past performance applied to the\ncurrent R&T and its future estimated benefits. For management purposes\nperformance of the R&T can be assessed by using the scientists peers, both\nGovernment and industry. This approach has also been applied on a broader\nbasis to establish an appraisal of a laboratory.\nThe R&T effort of NASA should thus stand up under the close scrutiny\nof cost/\'benefit analysis, the establishment of priorities for the use of the\n$175 million in line with NASA agency objectives, the balanced program in\nterms of human technological capability, and periodically be subject to a\npeer review.\t\n\nj\n\ng\ni\n\ni\nT,\t\n\n1\n\nh\n\ns\t\n\n$T\t\n\nis\n\ni\n\nR\n\n-\n\n10 -\n\nj\n\n\'1\nAPPENDIX A\n\n!\n\nWHY GOVERNMENT AND NASA FOR\nAVIATION RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY\n\n-\n\n1r:\n\nri\n\nu\t\n\nk\n\ni\n[\ny\n\ni\t\n\n1\xe2\x80\x9e\nt\n\n-\n\nA-\n\n: ,^,\n\nx\n\n^- ^\' : ^ ^`;\'^\t\n\n..e.\t\n\nt^R\n\n\'^\':\n\n^vavrw:^ii^wer..rmt=\'ew\xe2\x80\xa2+.:i.\n\n_\t\n\nI\n\n^.\n\nN\n}\nb\n\nE\'\'\n\nr\n\nU\t\n\nA\nQ\'I\n\ns\n\na+\n\nN\t\n\n,o\n\n^\n\no\nt4\na^\n\nae\n\na\n\n44\n\n\'-J\n\n0\n\n>\ni\n\nto)\n\n$.\t\n0\n\nT\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nA\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nt,\ne/\n\n(\'^\n\na\n\nI\n\n4\n\n(+\n\n^0,\n\n^.\n\nro\n\no\n\nr\t\n\na\n\na^\t\nZ3r.\t\na^\no\t\nro\n\nr0\n\n..^\n\nb\t\n\nO\n\n>\no\n\no\t\n-^\t\n\nQ\n\n\'O\n\nO\n\nN\n\nO\n\n:: \'\n\n3\n\ntn\n\n+\t\n\nrd\n\n44\n\na\n\nto\n\nO\n\nO\n\nr\n\n!\n\n^`\n\nO\n\no\nO\n\n.r\n\nf\n\n>\n\n.-.\n\n44\n\n4-J\n\nb\no\nO\n:1\n\nN\n0\n\n(Li\n0\n\nO\n\nQ:\n\n4-J\n\n4\'\'\t\n\nS.\t y\t\n\nti\'\n\nO\n\nO\n\ns .\t\n\nN\n\n-4\t\n\n-4\n\n.\n\nC\n\nM\nO\n\nN\n\nO\nt.\t\n\n\xc2\xb0\n\nN\n,\n\nu\n\nr+\xe2\x96\xba\n\'\t\n\nN\n\ny\n\nKL\'\nt7\n\nCY\n\n1\n\n.I.,\n\nM\n\nV\xe2\x96\xba\n\nO\n\ns\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2,\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nt!)\t\n\nt0\n\nn\t\n\n00\t\n\nQ1\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2-1\n\ne-4\n\nA\n\nch\ne-^\n\n\'\n\n\t\n\nCD\n\nn+\n\n,-+1 ,-+ ^,\t\nr a t\t\n\nr^\n\nLn\n\ncn\n\n,.^\nN\n\nt`\n\nCY) N\t\n\n`\n\nto\n\nW\n\n^{\t\n\n4\n\'o\t\n\nt\t\n\n1\t\n\n\\\\\t\n\nLO\t\n\nU\t\n\nQ\t\n\nt\n\nN\t\n\na.i\t\n\nr\t\n\nto\n\n.\n\ntfi\t\n\nM\t\n\ntl\t\n\n;. _\t\n\n\'" \'\t\n\nU?\t\n\na1\t\n\nas\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nO\'\t\n\nCn\t\nf}.\t\n\nt[a\t\n\n^+\nQ\n\ntR\t\n\n(4\t\nu\t\n\nas\n\nt\xc2\xb5\t\n\ntp\t\n\ntn\n\ntU\n\t\n\nOda j\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\'\t\n\nit;BLS\t\n\n1 to\t\n\nir:\t\n\njai\t\n\nr\n\ns U2\t\n\n4tl\'\t\n\ny,t2\t\nCZ\t\n^\t\n\nt\t\n\nas\t\n\nC2^ ;
