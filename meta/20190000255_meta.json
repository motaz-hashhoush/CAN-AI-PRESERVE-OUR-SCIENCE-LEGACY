While this reliance on thresholds has been in place for decades and has permeated both cockpits and control rooms, we often find it insufficient when retrospectively analyzing data from an accident. To modernize and enhance flight test safety, we introduce new methods of monitoring for anomalous patterns of interaction rather than for thresholds exceedance. For systems with a well characterized baseline we show how the Inductive Monitoring System (IMS), utilized by NASA in the aftermath of the Columbia accident, might be implemented in real-time to provide earlier warning than currently employed techniques. For systems without such a baseline, we introduce new developments in statistical methods relating to critical slowing down, first applied in medicine and physics, which show promise for adaptation to flight test. Finally, the familiar resource constrained environment leads to a reliance on increased instrumentation that is challenging the limits of the current one-sensor, one-indicator threshold paradigm. Existing methods thus fail to accurately reflect the true complexity of a vehicle rich with interdependent interacting systems. We highlight these concepts in a brief summary of the 2001 Air Transat Flight 236 deadstick landing in the Azores. We then suggest control room and cockpit modifications to better display the information gleaned using these novel monitoring methods.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20190000255, "endDate": "2016-10-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "International Test and Evaluation Association", "location": "Fairfax, VA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "54b8b0dedada482fb3d2b06496625628", "id": "8af78e932e14474c95b445ad6bf8108e"}], "name": "Annual International Test and Evaluation Symposium-Enhancing Our Competitive Edge: T&E to Meet the Pace of Need", "location": "Reston, VA", "id": "54b8b0dedada482fb3d2b06496625628", "startDate": "2016-10-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20190000255, "id": "e84d6830c17848e7b8217aec966ec60d", "publicationDate": "2016-10-04T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20190000255.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20190000255/downloads/20190000255.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20190000255/downloads/20190000255.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20190000255/downloads/20190000255.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
