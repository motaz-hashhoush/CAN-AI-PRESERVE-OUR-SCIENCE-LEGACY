The fisheries conservation zones and the yellowfin tuna jurisdiction of the NMFS operates observer programs on foreign and domestic fishing vessels. Data input terminal and data transfer and processing technology are reviewed to establish available capability. A matrix of implementation options is generated to identify the benefits of each option, and preliminary cost estimates are made. Recommendations are made for incremental application of available off the shelf hardware to obtain improved performance and benefits within a well bounded cost. Terminal recommendations are made for three interdependent shipboard units emphasizing: (1) the determination of location and fishing activity; (2) hand held data inputting and formatting in the fishing work areas; and (3) data manipulation, merging, and editing.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19810019216, "id": "9df1a25d304342d6904080fc00c8791e", "publicationDate": "1980-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19810019216.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19810019216/downloads/19810019216.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19810019216/downloads/19810019216.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19810019216/downloads/19810019216.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
