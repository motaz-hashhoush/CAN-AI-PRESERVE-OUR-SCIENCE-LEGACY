b'Count Down to\nthe Future\nMeg Cheng-Campbell\nRyan T. Scott\nSamantha Torres\nMatthew Murray\nEric Moyer\n\nCOUNT DOWN TO THE\nFUTURE\nAt the NASA Ames Research Center in California, the next generation of\nspace biologists are working to understand the effects of long duration\nspace flight on model organisms, and are developing ways to protect the\nhealth of future astronauts.\n\nThe human body has evolved over millions\nof years within an Earth-bound environment.\nThe biomechanics of our cellular tissues\nare constrained by the physical laws\nof life on Earth. It is only within a tiny\nfraction of evolutionary time that we have\ndeveloped the ability to leave our planet\xe2\x80\x99s\nprotective atmosphere and experience\nthe weightlessness of space. As we are\ndeveloping our new-found potential for extraterrestrial exploration, the consequences of\nplacing human bodies into space long-term\nhave to be carefully considered. At NASA\nAmes Research Center in California\xe2\x80\x99s Silicon\nValley, a team of dedicated biologists is\nworking to understand the effects of space\nflight on the human body, and is developing\ncountermeasures to protect astronauts and\ncolonists of the future as they embark on\nmissions to other planets in our solar system.\nNASA needs new scientists to be trained\nto continue this work into the future of\nspace flight, and support the innovations\nin medical science that must accompany\nexplorations of this kind. Dr Sanjoy Som,\ndirector of the Blue Marble Space Institute of\nScience, is a researcher at NASA Ames in the\nfield of astrobiology \xe2\x80\x93 the study of the origin,\ndistribution, and future of life on Earth and\nbeyond. Alongside a team of other dedicated\nscientists, he has developed a unique\ntraining programme for early career scientists\npreparing to pursue postgraduate training.\nThe programme gives students access to\nthe cutting edge research environment,\nresources and expertise at NASA to develop\nprojects aimed at supporting human\nlife long-term in space. The programme\nalso supports training in ethics and a\nconsideration for the wider implications\nof their research projects. Science\ncommunication is also a big part of the\ntraining programme, helping future scientists\nand NASA to engage the public with current\nprojects and ongoing research.\n\nLiving Bone\nBone is a dynamic living tissue that\nconstantly adapts to the environment.\nThe mechanical load on bone tissue acts\nto stimulate repair and regeneration to\nmaintain a constant level of mineral content\nand mass. This process of remodelling occurs\nthrough bone resorption by specialised cells\ncalled osteoclasts, and the formation of new\nmineralised bone tissue by osteoblasts. In\nspace, under reduced gravity (microgravity),\nresorption of bone is stimulated, leading to\na loss of bone mass similar to that seen in\nosteoporosis. Scientists at the NASA Ames\nResearch Center are currently working to\nunlock the mechanisms behind this process,\nin order to find ways to prevent it from\nhappening. Back here on Earth, this research\nhas major implications for understanding the\ndegeneration of bone that occurs in disease,\nor when mechanical stimulation is lost due\nto prolonged bed rest in hospital.\nMeg Cheng-Campbell, working with Dr\nElizabeth Blaber and Dr Eduardo Almeida\nwithin the Bone and Signaling Laboratory,\nenjoys the challenge and satisfaction of\nfundamental biology research. The team\nhave previously found that mice, exposed to\nmicrogravity for 15 days on the space shuttle\nDiscovery or 30 days on the Bion M1 mission,\nexperienced a loss of bone mass. Because\nthe cells that make up bone are continuously\nreplaced by new cells, the team hypothesised\nthat these losses may be caused by a\ndecreased capability of the bone to renew its\nown cells. This suggests that being exposed\nto gravity stimulates the production of new\nbone forming cells. In space, this loss of cellrenewal ability is combined with an increase\nin bone loss, leading to a reduction in bone\nmass. The team\xe2\x80\x99s research has implications\nfor other parts of the body that rely on a\nconstant supply of new cells to repair and\nregenerate.\n\nWWW. SCIENTIA.GLOBAL\n\nCREDIT: NASA\n\nMatthew and the team are currently\ninterested in how changes in blood vessels\nin the retina change during space flight, in\norder to understand a condition known as\nVision Impairment and Intracranial Pressure\nsyndrome, which can cause vision loss after\nlong exposure to reduced gravity. The team\nhope to measure the remodelling of blood\nvessels in the retina by comparing images\nbefore and after astronauts take a trip to\nthe International Space Station. This will aid\ndevelopment of effective countermeasures\nfor astronauts, but also potential future\ntreatments for patients on Earth with similar\nmedical conditions.\nCREDIT: NASA\n\nRyan T. Scott is working with Dr Joshua\nAlwood to investigate the molecular\nmechanisms that lead to bone loss during\nweightlessness and how space radiation\naffects bone strength. Ryan further\ninvestigates the effects of weightlessness\non the female reproductive system. He has\na special interest in the study of exercise\nscience and physiology. He is working with\nDr Alwood to discover how increasing activity\nin the limbs, such as during exercise, can\ncounteract the effects of weightlessness and\nradiation when undertaken together with\ndrug treatments. Indeed, in the future, it may\nbe possible to take such drug treatments to\nprevent the loss of bone mass, and so the\nteam are also investigating the possible sideeffects these treatments might have if taken\nover a long time.\nSamantha Torres, also in the Bone and\nSignaling Laboratory, currently works with\nDr Ruth Globus on a project to investigate\nthe physiological, cellular and molecular\nresponses of bone to simulated galactic\nradiation and weightlessness. This work\nhas implications for ground-based health\nproblems such as prolonged bedrest\nand radiotherapy. The team showed that\nexposure to similar total doses and types of\nionising radiation as those predicted during\nlong duration space exploration, results in\nthe activation of molecular mechanisms\nrelated to inflammation, stimulates boneresorbing osteoclasts, and promotes bone\nresorption. The researchers are finding\nways to protect against ionising radiation,\nsuch as consumption of dried plums, which\nhave anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory\nproperties.\n\nSpace Sex\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s in the Blood\nIn the Vascular Analysis Laboratory, Matthew\nMurray is working with Dr Patricia ParsonsWingerter on the vessel generation analysis\n(VESGEN) project. Every cell in the body\nrequires a constant supply of energy for\nmetabolism and immune support, through\nhighly branched blood vessels. Each cell is no\nmore than a fifth of a millimetre away from\nthe smallest blood vessels (capillaries), while\nthese tiny vessels are at least forty branch\npoints away from the heart. The vascular\nfingerprint for each person or animal is\nunique, and constantly adapts to changes\nin the environment by adding and removing\ncapillaries. The growth of new blood vessels\nis important in embryonic development and\nalso the development of pathological tissue\nin cancer. This same process also occurs\nduring an inflammatory response to injury,\nand is required for proper wound healing.\nThe Vascular Analysis Laboratory has\ndeveloped a software system for rapid and\naccurate analysis of the vascular fingerprint\nof animals or humans, to allow a detailed\ninvestigation of how these blood vessel\npatterns can change during space flight.\nThis will enable the team to observe how\nthese changes might affect health or disease\nprogression during long-term missions. This\nvascular signature gives an accessible and\nquickly measured read-out of the complex\nmolecular and cellular signalling pathways\nthat are initiated to promote remodelling\nand growth of new vessels in response to\nstress or injury. The team has already used\nsimilar techniques to look at the changes in\nblood vessels that occur in the retina during\ndiabetes, which can lead to sight loss.\n\nWWW. SCIENTIA.GLOBAL\n\nThe number of women becoming astronauts\nwas much less than the number of men in the\nfirst few decades of space flight, but this is\nrapidly changing. In fact, the NASA astronaut\nclass of 2013 had equal numbers of men and\nwomen. Eric Moyer is working with Dr April\nRonca to explore how space flight might\naffect the physiology of males and females\ndifferently, with the aim of improving the\nhealth of all astronauts travelling beyond our\nplanet. They are investigating how to protect\nreproductive health, so that communities in\nspace might adapt to conception, pregnancy,\nbirth and development. They are also\ninvestigating the longer-term implications\nof how child development might be affected\nby exposure to the harsh environment and\nstresses of space flight.\nRecent research has shown that mice who\nhave spent weeks in space experience a\ndisruption to their reproductive health and\na loss of fertility. But this is only part of the\nproblem. Technology for mouse studies\nin space has been developed at the Ames\nResearch Center, allowing Eric and Dr Ronca\nto now analyse the effects of space flight\non mouse behaviour, which can inform all\nfuture studies involving mammals in space.\nRemarkably most behaviour such as eating,\ndrinking and grooming was very similar\nto the mice on the ground, but mice in\nspace quickly learned to propel themselves\naround the habitat, with their activity levels\nactually increasing over time in flight. The\ndevelopment of these mouse habitats in\nspace allows the team to research the effects\nof space flight on mammalian behaviour \xe2\x80\x93\n\nwhich needs to be addressed before more complex intergenerational\nexperiments can be attempted.\nThis is important because the team\xe2\x80\x99s future experiments will\ninvestigate how radiation and reduced gravity conditions unique to\nspace flight might affect the reproductive cycles of adults and also the\ndevelopment of offspring. They will be looking to expand past research\ninvestigating the effects of altered gravity, such as that seen during\na space flight launch, on foetal development via patterns of gene\nexpression and the maturity into adulthood, which has demonstrated\na strong influence on health and disease throughout life. The goal will\nbe to identify which environmental factors lead to changes in gene\nexpression across the entire lifespan and how these factors may be\ntransmitted to subsequent generations. For men and women to live\nbeyond our planet and start forming communities, there is a lot to be\nunderstood about how life in space might affect the conception and\ndevelopment of offspring.\nReady to Launch\nMeanwhile in the Biomodel Performance Laboratory led by Dr Sharmila\nBhattacharya, students Iman Hamid and Christina Cheung are busy\npreparing their payload for an upcoming launch. Dr Bhattacharya\xe2\x80\x99s\nteam are using fruit flies to explore how life in space alters the immune\nresponse to a microbial infection. They are also using software and\nvideo tracking to observe changes in fly behaviour. By comparing\nresults from flies that have been to the International Space Station\nwith flies back on Earth, they plan to look at a number of physiological\nprocesses important for future space travel, such as the roles that\ndifferent genes play in protecting against reactive oxygen species and\nradiation.\nThe new rodent and fruit fly facilities on the International Space\nStation, combined with the biological research on the ground, allows\nthis group of young scientists to gain unique hands-on research\n\nCREDIT: NASA\nexperience and to develop new strategies for long range exploration\nand colonisation of our solar system. The opportunity to take part in\nthese projects is preparing these future leaders to accomplish dizzying\nheights.\n\nW WW.
