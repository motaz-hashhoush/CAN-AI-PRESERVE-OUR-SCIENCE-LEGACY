The factors applicable to the satellite-to-satellite tracking configuration are not so readily available, however, and a special relativistic\nderivation of these factors is documented in this report.\n\nTHE DOPPLER EFFECT FORMULA\nThe relativistic formula for the Doppler effect [3] is often given in the form\n\n1 -\n\nf\n\n=\n\nfo\n\n1- e\n\n2\n\nv2/\n\n(1)\n\nv/c\n\nIn (1) fo is the proper frequency of the source (i.e. the frequency measured in\nthe inertial system in which the source is at rest). The source itself is moving\nat a vector velocity with respect to an observer. The frequency detected by a\nreceiver at rest in the inertial system of the observer is f. The vector e is a\nunit vector in the direction of propagation as measured in the coordinate system\nof the observer, v is the magnitude of the vector v, and c is the speed of light.\nIf the distance between the vehicle and the observer at the time of emission of\nthe signal is r, then (letting the vector position of the vehicle be r, differentiating r \xe2\x80\xa2 r = r 2 with respect to time, and setting i = - r e)\n\ne\n\nv\n\ndr\n\n-\n\ndt\n\n-r\n\n(2)\n\nand Equation (1) provides the downlink Doppler factor\n\n1-\n\nf / fo\n\nV2/C\n\nc\n\n1 + i/c\n\n2\n\n(3)\n\nthat holds good for one-way range-rate tracking, the Doppler factor being here\n\n1\n\ndefined as the factor by which the transmitted frequency is multiplied to give\nthe received frequency. To obtain the Doppler factors applicable in satellite-tosatellite tracking, however, a more general form of the Doppler formula (1) is\nrequired; one in which not only the transmitter but also the receiver of the signal\nis in motion with respect to the observer.\n\nGENERAL DOPPLER EFFECT FORMULA\nThe required generalization of the Doppler formula (1) can be obtained from the\nlatter by use of standard transformations of special relativity. Consider an observer at rest in an inertial frame 1, a transmitter moving with vector velocity\ni in 2, and a receiver imbedded in a frame \' that moves with vector velocity v\nwith respect to the observer. The configuration is depicted in Figure 1. As\n\n(b, tb\n\n(a, t)\n\nI\n\nU\n\nI\n\nFigure 1. Doppler Effect Geometry\n\n2\n\nseen by the observer in Z, let e be the displacement vector drawn from the\npoint R where the signal is emitted at time t. to the point b where the signal is\nreceived at time t b . Then the unit vector e in the direction of propagation is\n(4)\n\ne/e\n\n=\n\ne\n\nwhere e is the magnitude of E and is equal to\n=\n\ne\n\nc(tb\n\n-\n\n(5)\n\nta)\n\nFollowing convention, the quantities above, being measured by the observer in 2,\nare unprimed. The same quantities, as measured by an observer in Y\', will be\nidentified by a prime. With this notation, the Doppler Equation (1), as it applies\nto an observer in Y\' becomes\n\nf\'\n\n2\n\n1 - u\'\n=\n\n/c\n\n2\n\nfo\n1 - e\'\n\n(6)\n\nU \'/c\n\nHere u\' is the magnitude in 2\' of the vector velocity u\' of the transmitter.\nTo obtain the desired form of the Doppler equation, the quantities ui\', u\', and e\'\nin (6) must be expressed in terms of the unprimed quantities seen by the observer\nin 2. The vector equation for the relativistic transformation of velocities is\n[3, Eqn. 2.55]\n\n1-v/c\nu\n\n2\n\nu +\n\n1V\n\n(1-\n\n-\n\n1 - u\n\nv/c\n\n/c2\n\nv/V-\n\n) u\n\nv\n(7)\n\n2\n\nTaking the scalar product of (7) with itself, and performing some algebraic\nmanipulations, the well-known result [3, Eqn. 2.56]\n\n1\n\nis obtained.\n3\n\n-\n\nv 2 /C2\n\n-\n\n2\n\n(8)\n\nTo express e\' in terms of unprimed quantities, the Lorentz transformation in\nvector form [3, Eqn. 2.25] is used.\n\nS=\n\nx +\n\n(1/\n\nv\n\nt\'\n\n=\n\n(t\n\n-\n\n- x\n\n-1)\nt/\n\nv2\n\n2\n\nv/c\n\n)/\n\n1\n\nVC\n\nv2/c\n\n-\n\n(9a)\n\n(9b)\n\nHere (x, t) are the coordinates of any given event. Substituting (, tb) and (a, ta)\nsuccessively into (9a), taking the difference of the two resulting equations, and\nemploying (5)\n\ne\'\n\n=\n\nv 2 /c\n\n1-\n\n(1/\n\n+ v\n\n2\n\n1)\n\n-\n\n1\n\ne/(c\n\n-\n\n-\n\nv2/c2\n\n(10)\n\nSubstituting in the same way into (9b), and multiplying the resulting difference\nby c,\n\n=\n\ne\'\n\n(e\n\n- e/c)/\n\n- v\n\n1\n\n(11)\n\nv2/2\n\n-\n\nTaking the scalar product of (7) and (10), dividing both by (11) and by the constant\nc, and subtracting the result from unity, there obtains\n\n1\n\n-\n\n\'/\n\n(1 - e\n(1 -e\n\nu/c) (1 - v 2 / 2 )(12)\nv/c)(1 - u \xe2\x80\xa2 v/c2)\n\nSubstituting (8) and (12) into (6)\n\nv/c)\n\n1\n\nu/c)\n\n-1-v2c\n\ne\n\n(1-\n\nf\' =\n\n-\n\nu /c2\n\n(13)\n\nfo\n(1-\n\ne\n\n4\n\n2\n\nEquation (13) is the desired generalized Doppler formula. It relates the frequency f 0 measured aboard a transmitting vehicle moving with vector velocity i\nat the time of transmission of a signal, to the frequency received aboard a\nvehicle moving with vector velocity v, at the time of reception of the signal the\nunit vector e being directed from the point where the transmitter is located at\nthe time of transmission to the point where the receiver is located at the time\nof reception. Using this equation all of the Doppler factors involved in satelliteto-satellite tracking can be written down immediately by suitably specifying the\ntransmitter and receiver velocities.\nNote, incidentally, that (13) may be written in the form\n\n(f\'\n\n1-\n\nv 2 / C2\n\n(f\n\n1-u\n\n0\n\n2/\n\n2)\n\n1-.e\n\n1e./c\n1 - e\n\nv/c\n*\n\n/c\n\n(14)\n\nfrom which it becomes apparent that the square roots that appear in (13) may be\nregarded as corrections to the classical Doppler factor (1 - e - v/c) / (1 - e. u /c)\n[3, Eqn. 1.22] for the effect of relativistic time dilation on the frequencies measured aboard the vehicles.\n\nSATELLITE-TO-SATELLITE TRACKING DOPPLER FACTORS\nReferring to Figure 2, let a signal from a ground-based tracking station be received at time t 1 by a first satellite moving with a velocity . Let s be the vector\ndrawn from the tracking station to the point where the signal is received. After\nan interval corresponding to the transponder delay, a signal is sent from the\nfirst satellite at time t 2 to a second satellite where it is received at time t 3 .\nLet q be the displacement vector drawn from the point of transmission at time t 2\nto the point of reception at time t 3 . In a similar manner, let the round-trip of\nthe signal be completed by retransmission back to the ground station along the\nvector paths p and i. Note, however, that the direction of the latter vectors has\nbeen taken opposite to the direction of propagation.\nTo obtain the uplink Doppler factor u 1, the quantities ui and \xc2\xa2 appearing in (13)\nare defined to be the vector velocities of the tracking station and the first satellite respectively. Thus in (13) u = 0 and e = s/s - s giving\n\nU1\n\n1 -\n\ns/c\n\n2\n2\n]/1 - v (S )/ C\n\n5\n\n(15)\n\nTRAJECTORY OF\nSECOND SATELLITE\n\nTRAJECTORY OF\nFIRST SATELLITE\n\n(t3)\n\n(t )\n\n(t4)\n\n(2)\n\nU2\n\nd2\n\n(t5)\n\n(t6)\n\nTRACKING STATION\n\nFigure 2.\n\nSatellite-to-Satellite Tracking Configuration\n\n6\n\nwhere v (s) is the speed of the first satellite at the time t, when the signal was\nreceived at the vector position s.\nThe downlink Doppler factor d, has already been given in (3)\n\n1 - v 2 (r)/c\n=\n\nd\n\n2\n\n(16)\n\n1 + i/c\n\nThe second uplink Doppler factor u 2 is obtained from (13) by interchanging u\nand v\n\n(1 2\n\n1\n\nq/c)\n\n- v 2 (q)/C\n\n2\n\n=\n\n(17)\n\n(\n\nV1\n\n-\n\nu 2 (q)/c\n\n2\n\nq. ii is the component of the velocity of the second satellite along the\nHere uq\n1 direction, and vq is the like component of the first satellite.\nThe remaining Doppler factor d 2 follows from (13) by setting e = -p giving\n\nd2\n\n1\n\n- u 2 (p)/c\n\n2\n\nv 2 (p)/c\n\n(1 + v /c)\n(1 + U/C)\n/\n\n2\n\n(18)\n\nIn coherent round-trip Doppler tracking, the Doppler factors appear only as\nproducts, for example u d, or u1 u 2 d1 d 2 . In such cases, the square roots appearing in (15)-(18) cancel out provided that the speed of the vehicles does not\nchange appreciably over the duration of the round-trip. Consequently negligible\nerror is incurred in these cases if the classical Doppler factors\n\n=\n\nu\n\nd1\n\n=\n\n-\n\n1/(1 +\n\n,7\n\n(19)\n\n/c\n\n/c)\n\n(20)\n\n1 -\n\nu2\n\nUq/c\n\n1 + v\n\nd\n\n(21)\n\n1 - V /C\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n/c\n(22)\n\n+ Up/C\n\nare used in place of (15)-(18).\n\nAPPROXIMATE DOPPLER FACTORS\nIf the first satellite in Figure 2 is geostationery, which is a case of practical\ninterest [4], it is possible to further simplify (21) and (22) because of the relatively small magnitude of the velocity of the geostationary satellite. The denominator of (21) can be expanded to give\n\nVq\n\nu\n\n=1\n\nsince uq - vq = q.\n\n(Uq - Vq)\n\n1-\n\nc\n\n1+-\n\nV\n\nvq\nc\n\n_\n( 1\n\nc\n\n+ v /C)\n\n(23)\n\nConsequently the approximation\n\nu2\nproduces a relative error\n\nEr\n\n=\n\n1-\n\ncl/c\n\n(24)\n\nin range rate that is less than\nV\n\nE\n\nr\n\n< -\n\nC8\n\n8\n\n< v/c\n\n(25)\n\nand an absolute error less than\nEa\n\n< 4v/c\n\n(26)\n\nTypical values for u and v in the ATS/NIMBUS-F experiment are [5] 7.5 km/sec\nand 0.08 km/sec giving\n\nEa\n\n<\n\n2.0 millimeters/sec\n\n(27)\n\nAn error of approximately the same magnitude but of opposite sign arises in\nusing\n\nd\n\n-\n\n(28)\n\nin place of (22).\nAn error of 2.0 mm/sec is not insignificant. However this error, being of opposite sign in (24) and (28), cancels out in round-trip Doppler measurements, in\nwhich only the products of uplink and downlink Doppler factors appear. A more\ncomplete discussion of the errors is given in the Appendix.\n\nSUMMARY\nUsing the transformations of special relativity, the four Doppler factors (15),\n(16), (17), and (18) encountered in satellite-to-satellite tracking are derived. It\nis shown, in the case of round-trip tracking from the ground through a geostationary satellite to a close-in earth orbiting satellite and then back to the ground\nview the same path, that these Doppler factors may be replaced by the simpler\nones given by (19), (20) and either (21) and (22) or (24) and (28).\n\n9\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.\n\nGill, T.
