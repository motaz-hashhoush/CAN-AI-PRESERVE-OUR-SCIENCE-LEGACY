The 15-yr moving correlation between the Tropical Atlantic SST (TAtlSST)\n\n33\n\nindex (SST anomalies from 30\xc2\xb0 S to 30\xc2\xb0 N and 60\xc2\xb0 W to 20\xc2\xb0 E) and Korean precipitation\n\n34\n\n(precipitation anomalies from 35\xe2\x80\x9340\xc2\xb0 N and 120\xe2\x80\x93130\xc2\xb0 E) during June-July-August (JJA) exhibits\n\n35\n\nstrong inter-decadal variation, which becomes positive at the 95% confidence level after the\n\n36\n\n1980s. Intensification of the linkage between the TAtlSST index and Korean precipitation after\n\n37\n\nthe 1980s is attributed to global warming via the increased background SST. The increase in the\n\n38\n\nbackground SST over the Atlantic provides background conditions that enhance anomalous\n\n39\n\nconvective activity by anomalous Atlantic SST warming. Therefore, the overall atmospheric\n\n40\n\nresponses associated with the tropical Atlantic SST warming could intensify.\n\n41\n\nThe correlation between the TAtlSST index and Korean precipitation also exhibits strong\n\n42\n\ninter-decadal variation within 1980\xe2\x80\x932010, which is over 0.8 during early 2000s, while it is\n\n43\n\nrelative low (i.e., around 0.6) during the early 1980s. The enhanced co-variability between the\n\n44\n\ntropical and the mid-latitude Atlantic SST during the early 2000s induces a TAtlSST-related\n\n45\n\nRossby wave source over the mid-latitude Atlantic, which excites stationary waves propagated\n\n46\n\nfrom the Atlantic to the Korean peninsula across northern Europe and northeast Asia. This\n\n47\n\nRossby-wave train induces a cyclonic flow over the northern edge of the Korea, which\n\n48\n\nintensifies southwesterly and results in precipitation over Korea. This observed decadal\n\n49\n\ndifference is well simulated by the stationary wave model experiments with a prescribed\n\n50\n\nTAtlSST-related Rossby wave source over the mid-latitude Atlantic.\n\n51\n\n2\n\n52\n\n1. Introduction\n\n53\n\nThe major rainy season during boreal summer in Korea, which has two rainfall-peaks\n\n54\n\n(between late June and late July, and between mid-August and early September), is called\n\n55\n\nChangma (Wang et al., 2007; Ho and Kang, 1988; Lim et al., 2002; Seo et al., 2011; Lee et al.,\n\n56\n\n2017). As an important component of the East Asia summer monsoon (EASM) system, the\n\n57\n\nclimatological evolution of Changma is closely linked to the summer monsoon rainfall band\n\n58\n\nacross east Asia, which leads major rainfall in China (i.e., Mei-yu) and Japan (i.e., Baiu).\n\n59\n\nHowever, the variability of Changma is known to be rather different from Mei-yu or Baiu due to\n\n60\n\nits more complex mechanisms (Seo et al., 2011; Jeong et al., 2017).\n\n61\n\nWhile inter-annual variation of rainfall anomalies during boreal summer in China or Japan is\n\n62\n\nknown to be determined by the large-scale sea surface temperature (SST) over the tropical\n\n63\n\nPacific (e.g., the El Ni\xc3\xb1o Southern Oscillation: ENSO; Huang and Wu, 1989; Wu et al., 2010), it\n\n64\n\nis not clear whether the Pacific SST can lead to variation in summer rainfall in Korea (Chen and\n\n65\n\nZhou, 2014; He and Zhou, 2014). For example, Yun et al. (2014) used empirical orthogonal\n\n66\n\nfunction (EOF) analysis to show that the first EOF of the summer-averaged convection\n\n67\n\nanomalies over Asia is controlled by the tropical Pacific SST, and that the first EOF exhibits a\n\n68\n\ncontrast pattern in the convection activity between China and Japan, while the convection\n\n69\n\nanomalies over Korea are relatively weaker. In addition, Son et al. (2014, 2015) found that a\n\n70\n\nsignificant statistical relationship between Korean precipitation and the ENSO is shown during\n\n71\n\nthe September and boreal-winter development of El Nino, while the summer Korean\n\n72\n\nprecipitation is weakly correlated to the ENSO.\n\n73\n\nThe role of the Indian Ocean on the summer monsoon over East Asia is known to some\n\n74\n\nextent. Basin-wide Indian Ocean warming is reported to affect the inter-annual variability of the\n\n3\n\n75\n\nrainfall over the western north Pacific and Japan through the Pacific-Japan (PJ) pattern (Kosaka\n\n76\n\nand Nakamura, 2006; Kosaka et al., 2013). This is further supported by the Atmospheric Global\n\n77\n\nClimate Model (AGCM) experiments (Annamalai et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2007). However, the\n\n78\n\nrelationship between the PJ pattern and Korean precipitation is known to be marginal (Kosaka et\n\n79\n\nal., 2013). The intensity of Changma is controlled by the intensity of the Indian summer\n\n80\n\nmonsoon (ISM) by energy variation of the circumglobal teleconnection (CGT) pattern (Ding et\n\n81\n\nal., 2011; Wang et al., 2012; Lee and Ha, 2015).\n\n82\n\nWhile the dynamic role of the Pacific or Indian Ocean on the summer precipitation\n\n83\n\nvariability over Korea has been actively investigated for the past several decades, studies on the\n\n84\n\nrole of the Atlantic Ocean only started in recent years. Recently, Ham et al. (2017) found a strong\n\n85\n\nrelationship between Korean precipitation and the tropical Atlantic SST during boreal summer.\n\n86\n\nThey showed that the relationship is quite robust from early to late summer. They argued that the\n\n87\n\npositive Atlantic SST anomaly could induce a reduction in the convective anomalies over the\n\n88\n\nwestern Pacific by modulating the Walker Circulation. This excites the low-level anti-cyclonic\n\n89\n\nflow over the western north Pacific (i.e., Western-North Pacific Subtropical High, WNPSH). This\n\n90\n\nleads the southerly to advect wet air to Korea, which enhances precipitation. This atmospheric\n\n91\n\nbridge is quite different from the atmospheric bridge from the north Atlantic to Eurasia, which\n\n92\n\ninvolves the Rossby wave train from the north Atlantic to Eurasia (Wu et al., 2010, 2011; Lim,\n\n93\n\n2015; Ye et al., 2015).\n\n94\n\nThis relationship between the tropical Atlantic SST and Korean summer precipitation varies\n\n95\n\nstrongly on a decadal time scale. In Lee et al. (2017), it is pointed out that the 15 yr moving\n\n96\n\ncorrelation between the tropical Atlantic SST and Korean summer precipitation was negative\n\n97\n\nduring the early 1900s, but showed a sudden change to exhibit a significant positive relationship\n\n4\n\n98\n\nafter the 1980s (see their Fig. 9, and also Fig. 1a in this paper). Specifically, the correlation is >\n\n99\n\n0.8 for around the 2000s, which denotes that more than 60% of the total Korean-precipitation\n\n100\n\nvariability might be explained by the TAtlSST variability during boreal summer. However, the\n\n101\n\ndynamic mechanism of this strong inter-decadal variation of the Tropical Atlantic-Korea (TA-K)\n\n102\n\nteleconnection pattern has never before been examined.\n\n103\n\nTherefore, this study investigates the decadal modulation of the tropical Atlantic-Korea\n\n104\n\nteleconnection pattern using reanalysis data. In section 2, observational data and the model used\n\n105\n\nin this study are summarized. Section 3 provides the mechanism of the decadal-variation of the\n\n106\n\nTropical Atlantic-Korea (TA-K) teleconnection pattern. A summary and discussion are provided\n\n107\n\nin Section 4.\n\n108\n109\n\n2. Data and Models\n\n110\n\na. Observational data\n\n111\n\nIn this study, we used two datasets for precipitation. For land precipitation, the data used for\n\n112\n\nthe Korean Peninsula precipitation index (Figure 1) during 1901\xe2\x80\x932011 was from the Climate\n\n113\n\nResearch Unit (CRU, Harris et al., 2013). The Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP,\n\n114\n\nAdler et al., 2003) precipitation data during 1979\xe2\x80\x932008 was used for linear regression analysis.\n\n115\n\nThe observed sea surface temperature (SST) data during 1901\xe2\x80\x932011 was from the NOAA\n\n116\n\nExtended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperatures version 3 (ERSST V3b, Smith et al., 2008).\n\n117\n\nThe 500 hPa vertical pressure velocity data, 850 hPa zonal and meridional wind data during\n\n118\n\n1948\xe2\x80\x932010, and 500 hPa geopotential height data during 1979\xe2\x80\x932008 were from the National\n\n119\n\nCenter for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR)\n\n5\n\n120\n\nreanalysis version 1 (NCEP1, Kalnay et al., 1996). All data were linearly de-trended before\n\n121\n\nanalysis.\n\n122\n123\n\nb. The Stationary Wave Model (SWM)\n\n124\n\nWe use the SWM to investigate large-scale atmospheric response to the Rossby wave\n\n125\n\nsources found in the North Atlantic. This SWM is the dry dynamical core of a fully nonlinear\n\n126\n\ntime-dependent baroclinic model (Ting and Yu, 1998; Schubert et al., 2011). It has three-\n\n127\n\ndimensional (3-D) primitive equations in \xcf\x83 coordinates with 14 unevenly spaced vertical levels.\n\n128\n\nHorizontally, the model has rhomboidal wavenumber-30 truncation. A rigid-lid boundary\n\n129\n\ncondition is applied at the top and at the surface of the model atmosphere. For damping,\n\n130\n\nRayleigh friction and Newtonian cooling are applied in the vorticity, divergence, and temperature\n\n131\n\nequations to ensure meaningful solutions (Ting and Yu, 1998; Lim, 2015).\n\n132\n\nVorticity induced by divergent (irrotational) flow forces the model to generate a large-scale\n\n133\n\nrotational component of the atmospheric circulation in the form of Rossby wave propagation. In\n\n134\n\nour study, we estimated the regressed Rossby wave source in the TAtlSST index using\n\n135\n\nNCEP/NCAR re-analysis data. The SWM is forced by this Rossby wave source. The vertical\n\n136\n\nprofile of the Rossby wave source has a maximum in the upper-troposphere (Liu et al., 1998).\n\n137\n\nThe background basic state for the model is given by three dimensions globally from surface to\n\n138\n\ntropopause. With these configurations, the model generates large-scale wave trains across\n\n139\n\nEurasia in response to the Rossby wave source in the North Atlantic (e.g., Fig. 8). For further\n\n140\n\ndetails of the model, see Ting and Yu (1998).\n\n141\n142\n\n3. Mechanism of the inter-decal variation of the Tropical Atlantic-Korea (TA-K)\n\n6\n\n143\n\nteleconnection pattern\n\n144\n\nFigure 1a shows the 15-yr moving correlation between the precipitation anomaly over the\n\n145\n\nKorean peninsula from 35\xe2\x80\x9340\xc2\xb0 N and 120\xe2\x80\x93130\xc2\xb0 E, and the Tropical Atlantic SST (TAtlSST)\n\n146\n\nindex, defined as an area-averaged sea surface temperature (SST) from 30\xc2\xb0 S to 30\xc2\xb0 N and 60\xc2\xb0\n\n147\n\nW to 20\xc2\xb0 E, during Korean summer (June-July-August: JJA). During the first half of the 20th\n\n148\n\ncentury, the correlation between Korean precipitation and the TAtlSST index varies from \xe2\x88\x920.5 to\n\n149\n\nzero at the 95% confidence level. For example, the correlation for 1910\xe2\x80\x931920 is negative, while\n\n150\n\nthe correlation for 1920\xe2\x80\x931950 is nearly zero. The correlation during the 1960s is positive, but\n\n151\n\nbecomes nearly zero for 1970\xe2\x80\x931980. However, after the mid-1980s, the correlation changed\n\n152\n\nabruptly to a significantly positive value at > 95% confidence. This indicates that the positive\n\n153\n\nrelationship between the tropical Atlantic SST and Korean precipitation during boreal summer\n\n154\n\nbecame significant after the 1980s. To demonstrate clearly the decadal variation of the\n\n155\n\nrelationship between the TAtlSST and Korean precipitation, in Figure 1b (and with black dots in\n\n156\n\nFig. 1c) the scatter plot shows Korean precipitation and the TAtlSST index for 1948\xe2\x80\x931978 and\n\n157\n\n1979\xe2\x80\x932010, respectively. During 1948\xe2\x80\x931978, the correlation between the TAtlSST index and the\n\n158\n\nKorean precipitation is only \xe2\x88\x920.19, while that during 1979\xe2\x80\x932010 is 0.58 with > 95% confidence.\n\n159\n\nHereafter, the periods 1948\xe2\x80\x931978 and 1979\xe2\x80\x932010 are denoted P1 and P2.\n\n160\n\nIt is also interesting that the maximum 15-yr moving correlation is slightly > 0.8 around\n\n161\n\n2000 (red dots in Fig. 1a). This means that about 65% of the total variability in precipitation over\n\n162\n\nKorea during boreal summer occurs during this period. The red and blue dots in Fig. 1c show\n\n163\n\nthat the correlation between the TAtlSST index and Korean precipitation during 1994\xe2\x80\x932008 is >\n\n164\n\n0.8, while that during 1979\xe2\x80\x931993 is 0.63. This means that the relationship between the tropical\n\n165\n\nAtlantic and Korean precipitation also varies after 1980s even though it continuously exhibits\n\n7\n\n166\n\nsignificantly positive values. To assess the details of mechanisms of the decadal variation of the\n\n167\n\nTropical Atlantic-Korea (TA-K) teleconnection pattern after 1980s, the period 1979\xe2\x80\x931993 is\n\n168\n\ndenoted P3, while 1994\xe2\x80\x932008 is denoted P4.\n\n169\n170\n\na. Decadal difference between P1 and P2\n\n171\n\nTo demonstrate the systematic difference associated with the TAtlSST index between P1 and\n\n172\n\nP2, Figure 2 shows the regression of the SST, vertical pressure velocity at 500 hPa, wind-vector\n\n173\n\nand stream function at 850 hPa during 1948\xe2\x80\x931978 (P1) and 1979\xe2\x80\x932010 (P2). During P1, the\n\n174\n\nregressed SST anomalies show a positive signal with anomalous upward motion over the\n\n175\n\nequatorial Atlantic (Fig. 2a, 2b). The anomalous upward motion is closely linked to the release of\n\n176\n\nlatent heat by the condensation of water vapor, which heats the atmospheric and induces Gill-\n\n177\n\ntype atmospheric circulation anomalies (Gill, 1980). As a result, low-level cyclonic circulations\n\n178\n\nare induced north and south (a pair) of the equatorial Atlantic. The weaker cyclonic circulation\n\n179\n\nover the region south of the equatorial Atlantic is probably associated with the location of the\n\n180\n\nanomalous convection, which is north of the equator with the northward shift of the Atlantic\n\n181\n\nIntertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) during boreal summer.\n\n182\n\nHam et al. (2017) showed that the SST warming over the tropical Atlantic triggers the low-\n\n183\n\nlevel easterly wind anomaly over the maritime continent by modulating the zonal Walker\n\n184\n\ncirculation. This leads the low-level divergence over the western Pacific to decrease the\n\n185\n\nprecipitation anomalies. The negative atmospheric heating anomaly excites a low-level anti-\n\n186\n\ncyclonic circulation over the sub-tropical western Pacific. This is consistent with many previous\n\n187\n\nstudies indicating that the tropical Atlantic SST can lead the equatorial easterly over the western\n\n188\n\nPacific (Ding et al., 2010; Rong et al., 2010; Ham et al., 2013a,b). Consistent with previous\n\n8\n\n189\n\nstudies, an anti-cyclonic circulation is shown over the western-north Pacific (Figure 2c).\n\n190\n\nDuring P2, the positive SST anomalies over the Atlantic extend farther to the north\n\n191\n\ncompared to those during P1. For example, the positive SST anomalies during P1 are nearly zero\n\n192\n\nnorth of 15\xc2\xb0 N, while the positive SST anomalies related to the TAtlSST index during P2 extend\n\n193\n\nto 30\xc2\xb0 N (Fig. 2d). In addition, the positive SST anomalies are clear over the mid-latitude and\n\n194\n\nnorth Atlantic, with weak negative SST anomalies over the mid-latitude western Atlantic.\n\n195\n\nConsistent with the positive SST anomalies over the tropical Atlantic, local anomalous upward\n\n196\n\nmotion is shown clearly during P2 (Fig. 2e). The dramatic differences from P1 during P2 are the\n\n197\n\nresponses of the atmospheric circulation over the Pacific. During P2, the low-level anti-cyclonic\n\n198\n\nflow associated with the TAtlSST index is well-induced over the western Pacific (Fig. 2f). The\n\n199\n\nlow-level anti-cyclonic circulation leads the southerly over the Korean peninsula; then, induces\n\n200\n\nthe anomalous upward motion that is the signal of increased precipitation.\n\n201\n\nThe enhancement of the anti-cyclonic flow over the western Pacific associated with the\n\n202\n\ntropical Atlantic SST during P2 is consistent with previous studies (Rodionov, 2004; Hong et al.,\n\n203\n\n2014). Hong et al. (2014) revealed that the tropical Atlantic SST contributes significantly to the\n\n204\n\nintensified variability of the western-north Pacific subtropical high (WNPSH) after the early\n\n205\n\n1980s. Hong et al. (2014) also argued that the weakened positive relationship between the ENSO\n\n206\n\nand the SST over the tropical Atlantic is responsible for the intensified role of tropical Atlantic\n\n207\n\nSST on the WNPSH after the early 1980s. That is, when there is strong coupling between El\n\n208\n\nNino and the tropical Atlantic SST, the low-level anti-cyclonic flow over the subtropical western\n\n209\n\nPacific (induced by the tropical Atlantic SST) is cancelled by the cyclonic flow due to the El\n\n210\n\nNino signal over the equatorial eastern Pacific.\n\n211\n\nIn addition, they suspected that the difference in changes of mean state between P1 and P2\n\n9\n\n212\n\nmight contribute to enhancing WNPSH with tropical Atlantic SST warming; however, they left\n\n213\n\nthe resolution of this issue for future work. To examine this point in more detail, Figure 3 shows\n\n214\n\nthe background state difference of the SST and vertical pressure velocity at 500 hPa between P2\n\n215\n\nand P1. Due to the global warming in recent decades, the overall background SST in P2 was\n\n216\n\nsystematically higher than that in P1. In particular, the increase in the SST over the Atlantic,\n\n217\n\nIndian Ocean, and equatorial and subtropical western Pacific during P2 was more robust than in\n\n218\n\nother regions. This implies that the increase in the background SST associated with global\n\n219\n\nwarming might be related to the enhanced TA-K teleconnection observed in recent decades. With\n\n220\n\nthe aid of the increased SST during P2, the background upward motion was enhanced over the\n\n221\n\nequatorial Atlantic and western Pacific. On the other hand, the background upward motion over\n\n222\n\nthe central Africa and the equatorial central Pacific, where the increase of the background SST is\n\n223\n\nrelatively weak, was systematically weakened.\n\n224\n\nTo compare the background state difference related to the enhancement of the TA-K\n\n225\n\nteleconnection and global warming in more detail, Figure 4a and b show the linear trend of the\n\n226\n\nbackground SST and the vertical pressure velocity from 1948 to 2010. As shown in Fig. 3, the\n\n227\n\nlinear trend of increase in the background SST over the Atlantic, Indian Ocean, and western\n\n228\n\nPacific is clear. In addition, the positive SST trend over the eastern Pacific, and the negative SST\n\n229\n\ntrend over the north Pacific are also shown. The linear trend of the vertical pressure velocity\n\n230\n\nexhibits enhanced upward motion over the regions with greater positive trends in SST. For\n\n231\n\nexample, the negative vertical pressure velocity trend (i.e., enhanced upward motion) is robust\n\n232\n\nover the Indian Ocean, western Pacific, and the Atlantic; while the positive vertical pressure\n\n233\n\nvelocity trend is shown over the equatorial central Pacific, where the linear SST trend is\n\n234\n\nrelatively weak.\n\n10\n\n235\n\nFigure 4c and d show the regressed 15 yr moving background SST and the vertical pressure\n\n236\n\nvelocity at 500 hPa over the 15 yr moving correlation between the TAtlSST index and Korean\n\n237\n\nprecipitation. Therefore, the spatial distribution of the regression is understood to denote the\n\n238\n\nbackground state difference to amplify the correlation between the TAtlSST index and Korean\n\n239\n\nprecipitation. Note that the regression was performed for the period 1948\xe2\x80\x932010 due to data\n\n240\n\nlimitation. Also, the student t-test for the regression line is performed for Fig. 4c, and 4d, and the\n\n241\n\narea over 95% confidence level are only shaded. The positive signal in the background SST over\n\n242\n\nthe Atlantic, Indian Ocean, and eastern Pacific is shown clearly, implying that increase in the\n\n243\n\nbackground SST over those regions can enhance the relationship between the tropical Atlantic\n\n244\n\nSST and Korean precipitation. In addition, the enhanced upward motion over the tropical\n\n245\n\nAtlantic, and Indian Ocean/maritime continent, and the weakened upward motion over the\n\n246\n\nequatorial central Pacific, is associated with enhanced TA-K teleconnection. Those general\n\n247\n\nfeatures are quite similar to the spatial distribution of the linear trend. For example, the pattern\n\n248\n\ncorrelation between the spatial distribution of the linear trend and that related to the enhanced\n\n249\n\nTA-K teleconnection over the tropics (from 30\xc2\xb0 S to 30\xc2\xb0 N, and 0\xe2\x80\x93360\xc2\xb0 E) is significant at > 99%\n\n250\n\nconfidence (i.e., 0.64 and 0.80 for the SST and the vertical pressure velocity, respectively). This\n\n251\n\nimplies that global warming possibly plays an important role in enhancing the linkage between\n\n252\n\nthe tropical Atlantic and the climate variability over the Korean peninsula.\n\n253\n\nGiven this, how can the change in background state due to global warming amplify the\n\n254\n\natmospheric signals related to the tropical Atlantic SST? The impact of the background state on\n\n255\n\nthe atmospheric variability over the tropics has been investigated in previous studies (Choi et al.,\n\n256\n\n2011; Chung and Li, 2013; Ham et al., 2013; Ham and Kug, 2012, 2015, 2016). Ham and Kug\n\n257\n\n(2015) showed that simulation of the ENSO-related precipitation among climate models is linked\n\n11\n\n258\n\nclosely to that in the tropical mean state. They argue that the warmer background SST over the\n\n259\n\nequatorial central-eastern Pacific enhances local anomalous convective activity during the El\n\n260\n\nNino, implying a positive relationship between wetness in the background state and El Nino-\n\n261\n\nrelated precipitation anomalies. Consistent with the previous view, Choi et al. (2011) showed that\n\n262\n\nthe decades with warmer background SST over the tropical western Pacific helped to induce\n\n263\n\nstronger local precipitation response to the SST anomaly; and therefore, led to much more\n\n264\n\nfrequent central Pacific-type El Ninos. This implies that the warmer background state over the\n\n265\n\ntropical Atlantic can enhance anomalous convective activities and the resultant teleconnections\n\n266\n\ninduced by the tropical Atlantic SST anomaly.\n\n267\n\nTo examine whether the background SST can influence the upward motion response to the\n\n268\n\nSST anomaly, Fig. 5a shows a scatter diagram of the 15-yr moving SST and the anomalous\n\n269\n\nvertical pressure velocity regressed onto the SST anomaly over the tropical Atlantic. Note that\n\n270\n\nthe regressed vertical pressure velocity anomaly indicates how strongly the atmospheric upward\n\n271\n\nmotion is induced due to the given SST forcing (Choi et al., 2011; Ham and Kug, 2015). It is\n\n272\n\nclearly shown that the warmer background SST over the tropical Atlantic can lead stronger\n\n273\n\nanomalous upward motion (i.e., negative vertical pressure velocity) forced by unit SST anomaly.\n\n274\n\nWith aids of higher background SST during P2, the overall atmospheric response to the TAtlSST\n\n275\n\nis systematically stronger than that during P1, confirming that the warmer background SST\n\n276\n\nduring P2 provides a background state favorable to induction of a stronger local convection\n\n277\n\nresponse to the tropical Atlantic SST anomaly.\n\n278\n\nIn addition to the background SST over the tropical Atlantic, it was found that the warmer\n\n279\n\nbackground SST over the warm pool region plays some role in amplifying the TA-K\n\n280\n\nteleconnection. Hong et al. (2013) clearly showed through idealized AGCM experiments that the\n\n12\n\n281\n\natmospheric response over the tropical Pacific to the tropical Atlantic SST anomaly is strongly\n\n282\n\ndependent on the location of the climatological warm pool. According to their experiments, the\n\n283\n\npositive precipitation response to the tropical Atlantic SST anomaly is robust where the idealized\n\n284\n\nwarm pool is located. They argued that the climatological low-level convergence resulting from\n\n285\n\nthe warm pool over the western Pacific could lead strong low-level convergence feedback;\n\n286\n\ntherefore, the anomalous precipitation response could easily be amplified over the warm-pool\n\n287\n\nregion (Wang, 2000). This indicates that the warmer climatology over the warm pool could also\n\n288\n\namplify the Atlantic-induced teleconnection pattern over the Pacific.\n\n289\n\nTo confirm this point, Figure 5b shows the scatter diagram between the 15 yr moving\n\n290\n\nbackground SST over the warm pool region (from 5\xc2\xb0 S to 10\xc2\xb0 N and 100\xe2\x80\x93140\xc2\xb0 E) and the\n\n291\n\nanomalous zonal wind at 850 hPa over the western Pacific (from 5\xc2\xb0 S to 10\xc2\xb0 N and 130\xe2\x80\x93160\xc2\xb0 E)\n\n292\n\nregressed onto the TAtlSST index. To some extent, that notion that the TAtlSST-related easterly\n\n293\n\nover the western Pacific tends to be enhanced during decades with warmer background state over\n\n294\n\nthe warm-pool region is supported. The stronger easterly over the western Pacific is linked to the\n\n295\n\nanti-cyclonic flow over the subtropical western Pacific. This leads the southerly to increase the\n\n296\n\nprecipitation over the Korean peninsula.\n\n297\n\nAs a short summary, the background SST increase due to global warming can enhance the\n\n298\n\nTA-K teleconnection pattern by amplifying 1) the anomalous TAtlSST-related convective activity\n\n299\n\nover the tropical Atlantic, and 2) the TAtlSST-related wind response over the equatorial western\n\n300\n\nPacific. The first feature is related to the increased background SST over the tropical Atlantic,\n\n301\n\nand the second feature is related to the increased SST over the warm-pool region.\n\n302\n303\n\nb. Decadal difference between P3 and P4\n\n13\n\n304\n\nFigure 6 shows the regressed JJA SST, precipitation, and 850 hPa wind-vector anomalies\n\n305\n\nonto the TAtlSST index during 1979\xe2\x80\x931993 (P3) and 1994\xe2\x80\x932008 (P4). The general SST warming\n\n306\n\nover the tropical Atlantic from 30\xc2\xb0 S to 30\xc2\xb0 N is clearly shown in both periods. The SST\n\n307\n\nwarming over the equatorial eastern Atlantic from 5\xc2\xb0 S to 5\xc2\xb0 N was slightly stronger during P3.\n\n308\n\nOn the other hand, the SST warming over the western Atlantic between 10\xe2\x80\x9330\xc2\xb0 N was stronger\n\n309\n\nduring P4, which lead stronger positive precipitation anomalies over the equatorial Atlantic. The\n\n310\n\nstronger TAtlSST-related precipitation anomalies over the equatorial Atlantic can lead to the\n\n311\n\nenhanced atmospheric responses over the western Pacific as discussed in a previous sub-section.\n\n312\n\nThat is, the easterly anomalies over the equatorial western Pacific, along with the southerly along\n\n313\n\nthe east coast of the China, are systematically stronger during P4. This could contribute to a\n\n314\n\nstronger positive precipitation anomaly over Korea during P4.\n\n315\n\nIn addition, the tripolar SST pattern over the Atlantic (related to warming over the tropical,\n\n316\n\nnorth, and mid-latitude eastern Atlantic) and weak negative SST anomaly over the mid-latitude\n\n317\n\nwestern Atlantic are clear in both periods, implying strong co-variability between the tropical and\n\n318\n\nmid-latitude Atlantic SST (Lau and Nath, 2001; Czaja and Marshall, 2001; Czaja and\n\n319\n\nFrankignoul, 2002; Huang and Shukla, 2005; Li et al., 2007). The TAtlSST-related SST warming\n\n320\n\nover the mid-latitude eastern Atlantic was enhanced during P4 more than during P3, indicating\n\n321\n\nthat the co-variability between the tropical and the mid-latitude Atlantic became stronger during\n\n322\n\nP4. The SST warming during P4 reached > 2 \xc2\xb0C in the mid-latitude eastern Atlantic, while it was\n\n323\n\nbetween 1 and 2 \xc2\xb0C during P3. As a result, the enhanced SST warming over the mid-latitude\n\n324\n\nAtlantic during P4 increased the local precipitation anomalies. That is, the precipitation\n\n325\n\nanomalies regressed onto the TAtlSST index appeared negative over the mid-latitude Atlantic\n\n326\n\nfrom 30\xe2\x80\x9340\xc2\xb0 N during P3 (red box in Fig. 6b), while the positive precipitation anomalies became\n\n14\n\n327\n\nmore apparent during P4 (red box in Fig. 6d).\n\n328\n\nThose differences in the TAtlSST-related precipitation anomalies over the mid-latitude\n\n329\n\nAtlantic could modify the teleconnection originating from the high-latitude wave source over the\n\n330\n\nAtlantic. To examine the high-latitude teleconnection related to the TAtlSST index during P3 and\n\n331\n\nP4, the geopotential height and the wave activity flux at 500 hPa related to the TAtlSST index\n\n332\n\nwas calculated for P3 and P4 (Fig. 7).

The zonal, and the meridional components of the wave\n\n338\n\nactivity flux denote the zonal, and the merdional advection of the wave-activity (angular)\n\n339\n\npseudomomentum (Takaya and Nakamura, 2001).\n\n335\n\ndenote the streamfunction regressed onto TAtlSST index, a radius of the earth, longitude, latitude,\n\n340\n\nDuring P3, the negative geopotential height anomaly over Europe and eastern Russia and the\n\n341\n\npositive geopotential height anomaly over western Russia, were clear. The geopotential height\n\n342\n\nanomalies over Korea exhibited slightly positive values. The wave activity flux indicates that\n\n343\n\ngeopotential height anomalies over Europe and the Russia were excited by the wave source over\n\n344\n\nthe mid-latitude Atlantic. For example, the wave activity flux is predominantly northeastward\n\n345\n\nfrom the mid-latitude Atlantic to eastern Russia. This shows that the TAtlSST-related mid-\n\n346\n\nlatitude wave source over the Atlantic could have excited a Rossby wave train over Europe and\n\n347\n\nRussia during P3. However, the positive geopotential height anomalies over the Korean\n15\n\n348\n\npeninsula are not likely to be related to the Rossby wave train from the Atlantic to Russia. For\n\n349\n\nexample, the wave activity flux over Korea is mostly eastward, while the Rossby wave train\n\n350\n\noriginating from the wave source over the mid-latitude Atlantic is located north of Korea.\n\n351\n\nThe Rossby wave train excited by conditions in the mid-latitude Atlantic, is also clear during\n\n352\n\nP4. The wave activity flux is northeastward from the mid-latitude Atlantic to Scandinavia, and it\n\n353\n\nflows to eastern Russia and northeast Asia. The geopotential height anomalies exhibit negative\n\n354\n\nvalues over Scandinavia and northwest Asia, and positive values over the eastern Atlantic and\n\n355\n\nwestern Russia. The Korean peninsula is affected by the negative geopotential height anomaly\n\n356\n\nover northeast Asia; therefore, the geopotential anomaly induces the increased precipitation\n\n357\n\nanomalies. In addition, the negative geopotential height anomaly north of the Korean peninsula\n\n358\n\nleads increased precipitation by inducing a southwesterly wind over Korea. This implies that the\n\n359\n\nRossby wave train from the mid-latitude Atlantic to the Korean peninsula becomes apparent\n\n360\n\nduring P4, which helps to enhance the positive relationship between the TAtlSST and Korean\n\n361\n\nprecipitation during boreal summer.\n\n362\n\nTo clearly show that the wave source over the mid-latitude Atlantic is critical to the Rossby\n\n363\n\nwave train from the Atlantic to the Korean peninsula during P4, we performed model\n\n364\n\nexperiments using SWM by prescribing the Rossby wave source during P3 and P4 (Schubert et\n\n365\n\nal., 2011).

In addition, to emphasize the role of the mid-latitude precipitation\n\n376\n\nanomalies, the TAtlSST-related convergence/divergence is prescribed only for 30-40\xc2\xb0N and 45-\n\n377\n\n25\xc2\xb0W.\n\nrespectively.\n\nIn\n\nthis\n\nstudy,\n\nthe\n\nlinearized\n\nRWS\n\nassociated\n\nwith\n\nthe\n\n378\n\nFigure 8 shows the stream-function anomalies at 500 hPa simulated in SWM with the\n\n379\n\nprescribed mid-latitude RWS related to the TAtlSST index during P3 and P4. Note that only a\n\n380\n\nrotational component of the wind is provided as a result of the SWM, and a positive stream-\n\n381\n\nfunction (i.e., anti-cyclonic flow) is matched to the positive geopotential height due to the\n\n382\n\ngeostrophic balance. With the prescribed forcing during P3, a stationary wave response only\n\n383\n\nshows over the North Atlantic and Western Europe, and the anti-cyclonic flow is weakly\n\n384\n\nsimulated north of the Korean peninsula. The overall stream-function response during P3 is\n\n385\n\nmuch weaker than that during P4, which might be due to the fact that the RWS during P3\n\n386\n\nexhibits much localized pattern than that during P4, which eventually weakens the area-averaged\n\n387\n\nRWS amplitude within the forcing area (i.e. 30-40\xc2\xb0N and 45-25\xc2\xb0W) (not shown).\n\n388\n\nDuring P4, stationary wave responses are systematically stronger than during P3. The\n\n389\n\npropagation of the stationary waves from the mid-latitude Atlantic to the Korean peninsula is\n\n390\n\nclearly shown, along with the negative stream-function anomaly over Europe and positive\n\n391\n\nstream-function anomaly over western Russia. In addition, the negative stream-function anomaly\n\n392\n\ncentered north of the Korean peninsula is also well-simulated, even though it is shifted slightly\n\n393\n\nnorth from the observed location. This means that the TAtlSST-related convergence/divergence\n\n17\n\n394\n\nanomalies induced by the precipitation anomalies over the mid-latitude Atlantic during P4, can\n\n395\n\nact as a RWS to excite the stationary waves propagated from the mid-latitude Atlantic to the\n\n396\n\nKorean peninsula, which enhances the Tropical Atlantic - Korea (TA-K) teleconnection. The\n\n397\n\nadditional SWM experiment by prescribing basic sate during P3 and the RWS during P4\n\n398\n\nconfirms this point that the difference in the RWS, rather than the difference in the basic state,\n\n399\n\nplays a critical role on enhancement of the stream-function response during P4.\n\n400\n\nFigure 9 shows a schematic diagram of the connection between the tropical Atlantic and\n\n401\n\nKorean precipitation during P3 and P4. There are two pathways (bridges) by which the tropical\n\n402\n\nAtlantic SST could affect Korean precipitation: tropical and extra-tropical. The tropical bridge\n\n403\n\nindicates that the tropical Atlantic warming affects Korean precipitation by inducing variability\n\n404\n\nover the tropical western Pacific. That is, tropical Atlantic warming leads the easterly over the\n\n405\n\nwestern Pacific by modulating zonal Walker circulation. East of the easterly center, a low-level\n\n406\n\ndivergence is induced, which decreases the precipitation over the tropical western Pacific. This\n\n407\n\nexcites the anti-cyclonic Rossby waves over the Philippine Sea as a Gill-type response, which\n\n408\n\nleads the southerly over Korea to increase precipitation. Between P3 and P4, the strength of this\n\n409\n\ntropical bridge is enhanced more during P4.\n\n410\n\nSecond, the co-variability between the tropical and mid-latitude SST anomalies over the\n\n411\n\nAtlantic can cause the extra-tropical bridge between the TAtlSST and the Korean peninsula. The\n\n412\n\nTAtlSST-related SST anomalies over the Atlantic exhibit the tripolar SST pattern (Lau and Nath,\n\n413\n\n2001; Czaja and Marshall, 2001; Czaja and Frankignoul, 2002; Huang and Shukla, 2005; Li et al.,\n\n414\n\n2007), which indicate positive SST anomalies over the tropical, mid-latitude eastern, and\n\n415\n\nnorthern Atlantic. This co-variability between the tropical and mid-latitude, or north Atlantic\n\n416\n\nwarming becomes stronger during P4 than during P3, which enhances positive precipitation\n\n18\n\n417\n\nanomalies over the mid-latitude Atlantic during tropical Atlantic warming. The enhanced\n\n418\n\nprecipitation anomalies acts as a Rossby wave source, which excites a stationary Rossby wave\n\n419\n\ntrain propagated from the Atlantic to the Korean peninsula. This extra-tropical wave train\n\n420\n\ngenerates cyclonic flow over the area north of Korea, which leads a southerly over Korea to\n\n421\n\nincrease the precipitation.\n\n422\n423\n\n4. Summary and Discussion\n\n424\n\nIt was shown that the correlation between the TAtlSST index and Korean precipitation\n\n425\n\nexhibits strong inter-decadal variation, and becomes positive at > 95% confidence level after the\n\n426\n\n1980s. The intensification of the linkage between the TAtlSST index and Korean precipitation\n\n427\n\nafter 1980s is attributed to global warming via the increased background SST. The linear trend of\n\n428\n\nthe background SST exhibits stronger SST increase over the Atlantic, eastern Pacific, and the\n\n429\n\nwarm-pool region, and it is found that the spatial distribution of SST increases can play a role in\n\n430\n\nenhancing the TA-K teleconnection. The increase in the background SST over the Atlantic\n\n431\n\nprovides background conditions that enhance anomalous convective activity due to anomalous\n\n432\n\nSST warming (Choi et al., 2011; Ham and Kug, 2012, 2015, 2016). Therefore, the overall\n\n433\n\natmospheric responses associated with tropical Atlantic warming are enhanced. In addition, the\n\n434\n\nbackground SST increases over the warm-pool region also can boost the TA-K teleconnection by\n\n435\n\nleading stronger, low-level convergence feedback (Wang et al., 2000; Hong et al., 2013), which\n\n436\n\namplifies the TAtlSST-related atmospheric responses over the warm-pool regions.\n\n437\n\nThe correlation between the TAtlSST index and Korean precipitation also exhibits strong\n\n438\n\ninter-decadal variation in 1980\xe2\x80\x932010, which reaches > 0.8 in 1994\xe2\x80\x932008, while it is relatively\n\n439\n\nlow (i.e., about 0.6) during 1979\xe2\x80\x931993. It is found that the mid-latitude teleconnection pattern\n\n19\n\n440\n\nbetween the tropical Atlantic and the Korean peninsula becomes robust during 1994\xe2\x80\x932008 and\n\n441\n\nenhances the TA-K teleconnection. While the mid-latitude SST and precipitation anomalies\n\n442\n\nrelated to the TAtlSST index are relatively weak for 1979\xe2\x80\x931993, the co-variability between the\n\n443\n\ntropical and the mid-latitude SST is enhanced systematically in 1994\xe2\x80\x932008. This generates mid-\n\n444\n\nlatitude Rossby wave sources that excite a propagation of stationary waves from the Atlantic to\n\n445\n\nthe Korean peninsula through northern Europe and northeast Asia. Due to the stationary waves\n\n446\n\nfrom the high-latitude route, there is cyclonic flow at the northern edge of the Korean peninsula,\n\n447\n\nwhich induces an additional southwesterly that increases Korean precipitation. This is supported\n\n448\n\nby a stationary wave model (SWM) experiment prescribing a TAtlSST-related Rossby wave\n\n449\n\nsource over the mid-latitude Atlantic during P3 and P4. The results imply that the mid-latitude\n\n450\n\nRossby wave source is responsible for the observed decadal difference in the TAtlSST-related\n\n451\n\nteleconnection between P3 and P4.\n\n452\n\nThe one of main findings in this study, that the role of inter-annual Atlantic SST variability\n\n453\n\ncan be intensified due to global warming, is worth investigating in more detail in future work.\n\n454\n\nWhile the strength of Atlantic-induced climate variability over other ocean basins could be\n\n455\n\nenhanced due to the global warming through the mechanism proposed in this study; it is also\n\n456\n\npossible that the warming over the Atlantic in the future could be weakened because the strength\n\n457\n\nof Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is expected to weaken in the future\n\n458\n\n(Mikolajewicz et al., 2007; Srokosz et al., 2012; Cheng et al., 2013; Deplazes et al., 2013).\n\n459\n\nTherefore, it is worthwhile to examine whether the active role of the Atlantic climate variability\n\n460\n\nis enhanced as a result of a direct global warming signal, or weakened due to the reduced AMOC\n\n461\n\nstrength in the climate model simulations prescribing future emission scenarios.\n\n462\n\n20\n\n463\n\nReferences\n\n464\n\nAdler RF, Huffman GF, Chang A, Ferraro R, Xie P, Janowiak J, Rudolf B, Schneider U, Curtis\n\n465\n\nS, Bolvin D, Gruber A, Susskind J, Arkin P, Nelkin E (2003) The version 2 global\n\n466\n\nprecipitation climatology project (GPCP) monthly precipitation analysis (1979-present).

Schematic diagram of the connection between the tropical Atlantic and Korean\n\n676\n\nprecipitation for 1979\xe2\x80\x931993 (P3) and 1994\xe2\x80\x932008 (P4). Shading over the Atlantic shows\n\n677\n\nanomalous SST warming related to the TAtlSST index. The small red/blue circles show\n\n678\n\nanomalous high/low pressure at 500 hPa, and the large red circle over the western Pacific\n\n679\n\nrepresents the western-north Pacific subtropical high (i.e., WNPSH). The green/brown circles\n\n680\n\nshow anomalous positive/negative precipitation. The green vector represents the wave activity\n\n681\n\nflux and black vector represents the low-level wind. The Rossby wave train from the mid-\n\n682\n\nlatitude Atlantic to Korean peninsula (green vector) becomes apparent along with the stronger\n\n683\n\nintensity of the WNPSH during P4. Both lead a stronger southerly over the Korean peninsula\n\n684\n\n(black vector) to enhance the TAtlSST-related precipitation anomalies over Korea during P4.\n\n34\n\n'
