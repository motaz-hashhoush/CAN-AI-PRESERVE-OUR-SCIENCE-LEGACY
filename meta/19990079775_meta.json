An astronomical IRC architecture that combines the platform-independent processing capabilities of Java with the power of Extensible Markup Language (XML) to express hierarchical data in an equally platform-independent, as well as human readable manner, has been developed. This architecture is implemented using a variety of XML support tools and Application Programming Interfaces (API) written in Java. IRC will enable trusted astronomers from around the world to easily access infrared instruments (e.g., telescopes, cameras, and spectrometers) located in remote, inhospitable environments, such as the South Pole, a high Chilean mountaintop, or an airborne observatory aboard a Boeing 747. Using IRC's frameworks, an astronomer or other scientist can easily define the type of onboard instrument, control the instrument remotely, and return monitoring data all through the intranet. The Astronomical Instrument Markup Language (AIML) is the first implementation of the more general Instrument Markup Language (IML). The key aspects of our approach to instrument description and control applies to many domains, from medical instruments to machine assembly lines. The concepts behind AIML apply equally well to the description and control of instruments in general. IRC enables us to apply our techniques to several instruments, preferably from different observatories.", "title": "Instrument Remote Control via the Astronomical Instrument Markup Language", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-19T08:48:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19990079775, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Sall, Ken"}, "organization": {"name": "Century Computing"}}, "id": "25851316023445e9a5bf53494b0405fa"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19990079775, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Ames, Troy"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD United States"}}, "id": "f20b3890575141c586ae59988d9f3726"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19990079775, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Warsaw, Craig"}, "organization": {"name": "Century Computing"}}, "id": "86000bb8afba4de4b5e83434b8361c24"}, {"sequence": 3, "submissionId": 19990079775, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Koons, Lisa"}, "organization": {"name": "Century Computing"}}, "id": "15e5f67d9c6c43368f966f45b99d8eb1"}, {"sequence": 4, "submissionId": 19990079775, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Shafer, Richard"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD United States"}}, "id": "2c60cc61590242c0b04fdc630909c566"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19990079775, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19990079775, "publisher": "McGraw-Hill", "id": "a92f59c077b84c249a7d07e72153eb42", "publicationName": "XML for Scientific and Technical Applications", "publicationDate": "1998-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
