It is therefore important to understand the types of customer needs which, if fulfilled or exceeded, add value and contribute to overall customer satisfaction. This study identifies the needs of various research and development (R&D) customers who contract for engineering and design support services. The Quality Function Deployment (QFD) process was used to organize and translate each customer need into performance measures that, if implemented, can improve customer satisfaction. This study also provides specific performance measures that will more accurately guide the efforts of the engineering supplier. These organizations can either implement the QFD methodology presented herein or extract a few performance measures that are specific to the quality dimensions in need of improvement. Listening to 'what' customers talk about is a good first start.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19980234240, "id": "ce2784007b31413abf19e23378a484b4", "publicationDate": "1998-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19980234240.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19980234240/downloads/19980234240.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19980234240/downloads/19980234240.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19980234240/downloads/19980234240.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
