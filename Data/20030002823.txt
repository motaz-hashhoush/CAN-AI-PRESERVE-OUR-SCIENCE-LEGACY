b"Weather\n\nData\n\nReceiver\n\nIncluded\nin the family of remote sensing\nsatellites\nare those which report weather\nand other environmental\ninformation.\nFor the most part, these satellites\nbeam\ntheir signals to Earth stations\nequippedwith\nlarge\nantennas\nand elaborate\ndata processing\nequipment.\nThe\nresulting\nweather\npictures\nare relayed via commercial\ntelephone\nland lines to users, who need their own\nprocessing\nsystems.\nBecause\nof the expensive\nequipment\nrequired,\nmaintenance\ncosts and phone line\ncharges,\nsatellite\ndata reception\nis largely limited to\ngovernment\nagencies,\nmeterorological\norganizations\nand\nlarge television\nstations\nor networks.\nTo make weather\npictures\navailable\nto a broader\nuser community,\nNorthern\nVideo Graphics,\nInc., Minneapolis,\nMinnesota\nhas\ndeveloped\na low-cost\nsatellite\nreceiving\nsystem intended\nfor such users as independent\nmeteorologists,\nagribusiness\nfirms, small airports\nor flying clubs, marine\nvessels and small TV stations.\nCalled Video Fax, the\nsystem is based in part on NASA technology.\nVideo Fax is designed\nfor use with certain satellites,\nsuch as the GOES (Geostationary\nOperational\nEnvironmental\nSatellite)\nspacecraft\noperated\nby the\nNational\nOceanic\nand Atmospheric\nAdministration,\nthe European\nSpace Agency's\nMeteosat\nand Japan's\nGeostationary\nMeteorological\nSatellite.\nBy dictum of the\nWorld Meteorological\nOrganization,\nsignals from\nsatellites\nare available\nto anyone without\ncost. Thus, the\nVideoFax\nuser can acquire signals directly\nfrom the\nsatellite\nand cut out the middle man, enabling\nsavings\nin telephone\ncharges\nand other processing\ncosts. The\nunit sells for about one-fifth\nthe cost of the equipment\nused by TV stations.\n\nVideo\n\nFax consists\n\nof a two-meter\n\ndiameter\n\nantenna\n\n(below) whose design is based on technology\ndeveloped\nby Goddard\nSpace Flight Center; a receiver;\na\nmicroprocessor-controlled\ndisplay computer;\nand a\nvideo monitor\n(above). The computer\nstores data from\nthe satellites\nand converts\nit to an image which is\ndisplayed\non the monitor.\nThe weather\nmap can be\npreserved\nas signal data on tape or it can be stored in a\nvideo cassette\nas a permanent\nimage.\n\n109\n\n"
