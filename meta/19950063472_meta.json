The results support the view that experienced decision makers may solve problems in a way that is qualitatively different from the approaches of less experienced decision makers. The results also support a concept of expertise that goes beyond a stock of specialized recognitional templates, to include domain-specific methods for processing information. Such metacognitive skills evolve through long experience. They may enhance both the accuracy and the efficiency of decision processes.", "title": "Taking risks and taking advice: The role of experience in airline pilot diversions", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-17T00:05:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19950063472, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Cohen, Marvin S."}, "organization": {"name": "Cognitive Technologies, Inc.", "location": "Arlington, VA, US, United States"}}, "id": "3435604f7b914496979f209e012bad14"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19950063472, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19950063472, "publisher": "Ohio State University", "id": "84674cfa17624f708842678e9355b7e7", "publicationDate": "1993-04-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
