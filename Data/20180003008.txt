Likewise, long-term\nstorable liquid propellant candidates that offer\nsignificant reduction in personnel hazards and\nshorter payload processing schedules present a\nmore attractive propulsion subsystem solution to\nspacecraft builders. Aiming to reduce risk to\npotential infusion missions and fully comprehend\nthe alternative propellant performance, the work\npresented herein represents many years of\ndevelopment\nand\ncollaborative\nefforts\nto\nsuccessfully align higher performance, low toxicity\ngreen propellants into NASA Goddard Space Flight\nCenter (GSFC) missions. High Performance Green\nPropulsion (HPGP), and the associated propellant\ntechnology, has advanced significantly in maturity\nthrough increased familiarity with LMP-103S\npropellant handling, the proven reduction in loading\nhazards, successful launches conducted at multiple\ninternational Ranges, and HPGP on-orbit flight\nheritage. As science missions move forward to the\npotential infusion of HPGP technology, the National\nAeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and\nits partners are working to address gaps in system\nperformance and operational considerations.\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\nIncorporating green propulsion technology\ntrades early in mission studies and aligning potential\nperformance, cost, schedule, and hazard benefits to\nmission opportunities has aided in identifying and\nguiding further green propulsion technology\nmaturation efforts requisite to substantiate mission\ntechnology readiness. HPGP system trade studies\nhave been evaluated against historical on-orbit\nGSFC missions: Global Precipitation Measurement\n(GPM),\nSolar\nDynamics\nObservatory,\nMagnetospehric\nMulti-Scale\n(MMS),\nLunar\nReconnaissance Orbiter, and Mars Atmosphere\nand Volatile EvolutioN [1], as well as two current\nGSFC missions: Plankton, Aerosols, Cloud, ocean\nEcosystems (PACE) and Wide Field Infrared\nSurvey Telescope (WFIRST) [2]. Each of these\nmission trade studies represent a diverse set of\nrequirements, as each have dissimilar scientific\nobjectives. Mission requirements drive propulsion\nsubsystem design, performance parameters, and\nlife expectations. In each case evaluated, the\nmissions benefited from HPGP propulsion\nsubsystem design from the increased performance\nand propellant density offered. The flight heritage of\nPrototype Research Instruments and Space\nMission technology Advancement (PRISMA) [3], the\nPlanet SkySat HPGP propulsion constellation [4],\nas well as the Green Propellant Loading\nDemonstration [5] have demonstrated tangible\nbenefits to both HPGP propulsion subsystem on-\n\nNOMENCLATURE\nACS\nCPSM\nDM\nECAPS\nEQM\nFCV\nFD\nFOI\nGPM\nGPWG\nGRC\nGSFC\n\n= Attitude Control Systems\n= Chemical Propulsion Subcapability\nManagement\n= Demonstrator\n= ECological Advanced Propulsion\nSystems\n= Engineering Qualification Model\n= Flow Control Valve\n= Flight Dynamics\n= Swedish Defence Research Agency\n= Global Precipitation Measurement\n= Green Propulsion Working Group\n= Glenn Research Center\n= Goddard Space Flight Center\n1\n\norbit performance and the ease of LMP-103S\nhandling efforts as compared to the Self Contained\nAtmospheric Protective Ensemble operations\nrequired for highly toxic hydrazine propellant. Four\nmajor Range Safety organizations (U.S., European,\nIndian, and Russian) have gained familiarity with\nLMP-103S propellant loading operations and the\nassociated handling benefits [6]. The most recent\naddition to this list is Vandenberg Air Force Base in\nCalifornia (U.S.) with six SkySat LMP-103S\npropellant loading operations conducted in 2017. In\nall, the traded missions gain in spacecraft\nprocessing as well as propulsive performance.\nIn 2013, NASA and the Swedish National Space\nBoard\n(SNSB)\noutlined\na\ncollaborative\nImplementing Arrangement (IA) for the respective\nagencies to pursue increased HPGP technology\nmaturation [7]. Each agency has been actively\nworking the three principle objectives of this IA since\nits inception: 1) design, analyse, and manufacture a\nfully flight-like HPGP thruster in order to gather\nenvironmental and hot-fire life test data, 2) promote\nand advance LMP-103S Range Safety awareness\nand propellant handling capabilities, and 3)\ninvestigate and test LMP-103S propellant material\neffects and various other handling associated\nchemical properties. The IA is structured to reduce\nrisk to performance, cost, and schedule in future\nHPGP thruster implementation and further advance\nthe technical maturity critical for long-term\ninvestment in future NASA missions. Throughout\nthe course of the IA, GSFC, SNSB, and EColgical\nAdvanced Propulsion Systems (ECAPS), the HPGP\ntechnology owners, have collectively advanced\nHPGP thruster maturity in several meaningful ways.\nThe HPGP thruster performance testing enables\nthorough evaluation of the readiness of the HPGP\nthrusters to meet upcoming NASA mission\nrequirements. The investigations into LMP-103S\nchemical properties, including flashpoint testing,\nvapor profile, propellant tank fracture mechanics\ntesting, and point-of-use propellant sampling at\nRange in order to confirm that the propellant meets\nspecification, provide increased programmatic and\nsystem level confidence.\nThis paper focuses exclusively on the HPGP\nEngineering Qualification Model (EQM) 22 N\nthruster testing. Other objectives of the IA discussed\nabove will be published at a later date, but are\ndiscussed here briefly for context and completeness\nin the IA discussion. The IA technology\nadvancement goals enable HPGP technology\nmission proposals and utilization, positioning NASA\nto not only gain substantial knowledge and\nexperience with HPGP technology, but additional\ninsight into future implementation possibilities. The\nIA provides the ability to concentrate the technology\nmaturation in a collaborative fashion and to gain first\nhand insight into the overall HPGP technology and\nLMP-103S propellant. It is implicitly acknowledged\nthat flight technology development is challenging,\nboth technically and programmatically, and NASA,\n\nSNSB, and ECAPS are working towards a common\ngoal to systematically confront those challenges.\n2. THRUSTER DESIGN\nAs stated above, trade studies to implement\nHPGP have been conducted for two NASA GSFC\nin-house missions, PACE and WFIRST. Each of\nthese missions have different propulsion subsystem\nrequirements, but similar thrust class engines\n(22 N). PACE is a sun-synchronous polar, Low\nEarth Orbit, Earth Science mission with major\npropulsive maneuvers conducted at End-of-Life for\nsafe spacecraft system disposal. WFIRST is an\nAstrophysics mission at Sun-Earth L2 orbit, in which\nits foremost propulsive maneuvers are at\nBeginning-of-Life. Both PACE and WFIRST are\ndesigned to utilize a blow-down propulsion\nsubsystem; however, PACE will use solely 22 N\nthrust class engines, and WFIRST will use both\n22 N and 5 N thrust class engines. Together with\nthe 1 N engine already in commercial use, the 5 N\nand 22 N thrust class sizes fulfil the needs of\ncharacteristic NASA Science Mission Directorate\nmissions [8]. ECAPS, through PRISMA and the\nSkySat Constellation have already matured the 1 N\nthruster with multiple HPGP 1 N units currently\nperforming on-orbit. The IA HPGP maturation effort,\ntherefore has been focused on the 5 N and 22 N\nthruster designs. NASA GSFC Propulsion, in\ncollaboration with ECAPS, developed mission\nspecific thruster life testing requirements in order to\nset forth GSFC\xe2\x80\x99s desired test conditions and firing\nsequences. These environmental and hot-fire\nperformance requirements were tested through an\nextensive campaign conducted on a HPGP 22 N\nflight-like EQM thruster (shown in Fig. 1). Through\nthis testing the HPGP 22 N EQM thruster has\ndemonstrated the robustness of the HPGP\npropulsion thruster technology and increased the\nTechnology Readiness Level (TRL) by undergoing\nenvironmental testing (vibration and shock to\nqualification levels) as well as hot-fire performance\nlife testing.\n\nFigure 1. 22 N HPGP EQM\n\n2\n\nAt the onset of the NASA/SNSB IA, ECAPS had\nTRL 4 Demonstrator (DM) versions of the HPGP\n5 N and 22 N thrusters already built. NASA GSFC\nPropulsion developed HPGP thruster Statement of\nWork (SOW) and Specification (SPEC) documents\nfor ECAPS to meet to advance the HPGP 5 N and\n22 N thruster designs with the goal of ensuring that\nfuture evolutions would meet realistic NASA\nrequirements for flight components. Furthermore,\nthis arrangement allowed for NASA to identify and\naddress the operational differences between HPGP\nand typical mono-propellant hydrazine propulsion\ncomponents and systems. The SOW detailed the\nrequirements for the HPGP thruster manufacturing\neffort, program management, quality, and\nworkmanship standards. The SPEC documented\nthe performance and environmental requirements to\nmeet common NASA mission needs. The IA HPGP\nthruster SOW and SPEC attempted to represent a\nset of typical thruster requirements based on\nhistorical GSFC missions.\nAt the time these documents were written there\nwas not a specific upcoming mission to use as a\nbasis for outlining the HPGP thruster requirements,\nthe MMS and GPM missions were chosen as\nmodels for thruster requirement development under\nthe IA. Due to a perceived greater market interest,\nthe initial priority was focused on the HPGP 22 N\nthruster. NASA GSFC has a standardized basic set\nof environmental (vibration and shock) mechanical\nrequirements encompassing multiple launch\nconfigurations and vehicles (referred to as the\nGeneralized\nEnvironmental\nVerification\nSpecification).\nThere\nare\nalso\ngoverning\nprogrammatic guidelines for workmanship, quality,\nand contamination. These fundamental documents\nallowed for the definition of a representative basic\nrequirement set germane to HPGP thruster design\nand\nconstruction.\nThe\nmore\nchallenging\nrequirements come from mission specific\nimplementation for thruster operation, specifically\npulse-mode vs steady state, duty cycles, and\nrequired propellant throughput.\nIn order to capture hot-fire thruster operation\nrequirements for the IA development, past GSFC\nmissions and ground testing operation were studied\nand a broad-spectrum \xe2\x80\x9cwish list\xe2\x80\x9d outlining a thruster\nthat could perform across a large array of mission\narchitectures was provided to ECAPS for\nconsideration. While difficult to attain, it is ideal to\nhave a robust thruster that can operate at both\nsteady state and in pulse mode operation at any\nduty cycle, delivering repeatable high performance\nand long life. ECAPS worked to these operational\ngoals and in 2015 advanced the HPGP 22 N\nthruster design to a TRL 5 configuration (Fig. 2).\nThis version of the 22 N DM thruster included a\nqualified series redundant Flow Control Valve\n(FCV), flight-like thermal standoff and thrust\nchamber joint, and an improved injection scheme\nfrom the previous DM model.\n\nThrough this design and test iteration, the\nalignment to meet the NASA GSFC pulse mode\nperformance capability was demonstrated. Table 1\ndisplays the HPGP 22 N TRL 5 campaign totals and\nFigure 3 shows the pulse mode duty cycle mapping\nprofile tested. In this testing, the thruster was fired\nat a range of duty cycles to a pulse count of 100.\nThis operation allowed the thruster to reach thermal\nsteady state from the pre-heat start temperature of\n350 \xc2\xb0C, which represents a thermal cycle. Post this\ndemonstration\ntesting,\na\nformal\nDesign\nConformance Review was held at the ECAPS\nfacility in Solna, Sweden in 2016 to evaluate the\ndesign, analysis and testing before outlining the\nEQM\nmanufacturing\nplan.\nNASA\nGSFC\nprogrammatic and propulsion supported this\ntechnical interchange meeting.\n\nFigure 2. 22 N HPGP TRL 5 - #59B in Thrust Stand\n\nTable 1. 22 N HPGP TRL 5 - #59 Test Totals\nDemonstrated\nPropellant\nLMP-103S Propellant\nPropellant Throughput\n10 kg\nBurn Time\n30 min\nLongest Continuous\n180 sec (3 min)\nFiring\nTotal Pulses\n4000\nThermal Cycles\n400\n\nFigure 3. 22 N HPGP TRL 5 - #59B Pulse Mode\nMapping\n\n3\n\nAs testing on the TRL 5 unit progressed,\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s PACE and WFIRST missions matured in\ntheir designs. NASA GSFC took this opportunity to\nrevise the IA thruster SPEC and SOW to align with\nreal upcoming mission needs. As the PACE\npropulsion subsystem requirements gained greater\nmaturity faster, they were chosen to serve as the\nnew baseline for the next HPGP 22 N EQM thruster\ndesign and qualification effort. The EQM test\nphilosophy evolution is shown in Fig. 4. A PACEspecific version of the SOW and SPEC were\ndrafted, using the IA HPGP thruster SOW and\nSPEC as a starting point. These new documents\nwere then vetted by other PACE subsystems (e.g.\nelectrical, thermal, avionics, and mechanical) in\norder to ensure that subsystem crossover\nrequirements were properly codified in terms of the\nthruster design, development, manufacturing, and\ntesting.\nSimilarly,\nthe\nWFIRST\nmission\nrequirements will serve as the new baseline for the\nHPGP 5 N EQM thruster, which is nominally on\ntrack to be tested in 2018. A similar documentation\nvetting process will be conducted for the HPGP 5 N\nEQM thruster requirements. The overall intent is to\ndefine a realistic set of flight requirements for the\ndevelopment of the IA HPGP 5 N and 22 N engines\nto achieve. However, as the IA is a partnership in\nhydrazine alternative technology maturation and not\ncontractual, the requirements identified within the\nSOW and SPEC documents are treated as design\ngoals and not strict requirements.\n\nEQM test philosophy was to test two identical\nmission blowdowns in order to meet the 2x life\nrequirement.\nOther\ngeneral\nprogrammatic\nrequirements, such as mechanical loads, thermal,\nelectrical, workmanship, and quality were also\nincluded in the HPGP 22 N EQM manufacture and\ntest goals. The environmental vibration and shock\ntest requirements are presented in Table 2 as\nprovided by the PACE mechanical. The random and\nsine vibration levels are standard and serve as\ngeneric mechanical guidelines; however, the shock\nload is enveloping of the Launch Vehicle\nrequirements, with a PACE-specific propulsion\nconfiguration attenuation.\nA manufacturing readiness review was held\nwith NASA and ECAPS in May 2017, and the\nintegration of the EQM thruster began in June 2017.\nThe EQM thruster was fabricated according to\nnewly developed flight-like ECAPS production line\nmanufacturing and test procedures, developed for\nthe EQM and 22 N thrust class engines. The HPGP\n22 N EQM thruster completed assembly on June 17,\n2017. This build timeframe included the requisite\nhardware workmanship inspections as the build\nprocess proceeded. All manufacturing was\nperformed at ECAPS facilities in Solna, Sweden.\n4. TEST HARDWARE\nThe HPGP 22 N EQM test article is shown in\nFig. 5 on the Hot Fire test stand. The HPGP 22 N\nEQM inlet pressure range is a blowdown operation\nfrom 24 bar to 5.5 bar, with the nominal 22 N thrust\nprovided at 24 bar. The EQM uses a series\nredundant FCV, propellant feed tube, injector, thrust\nchamber and nozzle assembly. The FCV has\nthermal hardware made up of two thermostats wired\nto a dual element heater that maintains valve\ntemperatures during pre-heat and operation. In\naddition, there is a dedicated reactor heater for\nthruster pre-heat and a thermocouple for reactor\nheater temperature readout. The HPGP 22 N EQM\nthruster was built to be a flight-like test article,\nmanufactured with flight production procedures and\nwith flight qualified components.\n\nIA HPGP\nThruster Design\n\nPACE Mission\nRequirements\n\nIteration\n\nHPGP PACE\nMission Life Test\n\nFigure 4. 22 N HPGP EQM \xe2\x80\x93 TEST PHILOSOPHY\n\n3. TEST GOALS AND MANUFACTURING\nTable 2 outlines the HPGP 22 N EQM principal\nperformance and environmental test goals. These\nwere derived using the PACE mission required\npropellant load and tank blowdown profile, flight\nthruster quantity, detailed Attitude Control\nSubsystem (ACS) maneuver simulations to\ncharacterize thruster operational duty cycle, and\nFlight Dynamics (FD) simulations to determine\ndelta-V requirements. The PACE mission\nPropulsion, ACS, and FD engineering teams\nworked iteratively to frame the thruster hot-fire\ntesting requirements, as each subsystem\ncontribution was vital to the test matrix. The 2x Life\nrequirement in Table 2 is indicative of the NASA\nGSFC Gold Rules for margin in phase A. The initial\n\nFigure 5.

HPGP 22 N EQM \xe2\x80\x93 Test Flow\n\n5.1. Cold Testing\nHardware\ninspections\nwere\nconducted\nthroughout the test program. For these tests, the\nEQM was visually inspected to verify all visual\nsubcomponents were free of scratches, cracks,\nsevere oxidation, and noticeable damage. After\nthruster integration, during the first inspection\ntesting, the EQM physical dimensions and mass\nmeasurement were also performed to ensure that\nthe EQM was in accordance with the HPGP 22 N\nEQM Interface Control Document (ICD). Visual\ninspections were recurrent throughout as the EQM\nthruster progressed in the test program as shown in\nFig. 6.\nFunctional testing was also conducted\nthroughout the EQM test program. These checks\ndemonstrate compliance with the guidelines set\nforth in the HPGP 22 N EQM SPEC and the test\nresults were trended over the course of the\ncampaign. The functional testing included external\nleakage with the FCV set to open and the thruster\nplugged, FCV seat internal leakage, gas flow testing\nin order to verify no flow impedance through the\nthruster, and electrical testing (insulation and circuit\nresistance, FCV pull-in and drop-out voltages, and\nthermostat open/close verification). An \xe2\x80\x9cabnormal\nvoltage test\xe2\x80\x9d was executed as planned on the EQM\nin which all electrical components were exposed to\n40 VDC for 0.5 seconds. Directly following, an\nelectrical checkout was made to verify no damage\nto the EQM.\nReactor Heater testing was performed at the\nbeginning and end of the test program as seen in\nFig. 6. This test was conducted in vacuum as\nrequired to characterize the reactor heater\nperformance at different power levels. This pre- and\npost-hot fire reactor heater checkout tested the\nthermal effect of oxidation in regards to EQM preheat time to temperature at different power levels.\nProof pressure testing and alignment verification\nwere also competed in the EQM cold testing.\n\n5. TEST PROGRAM\nThe objective of the EQM test program was to\nvalidate the thruster design and manufacturability\nwith respect to a typical NASA GSFC mission. The\nPACE mission was selected as the benchmark to\nlay the foundational set of requirement goals, as\nlisted in Tab. 2, for the HPGP 22 N EQM thruster.\nThe test flow is shown in Fig. 6. The guiding\nprinciple was to plan and conduct a robust HPGP\n22 N life-test highlighting that the design meets\nPACE mission requirements. This would\ncomprehensively test the thruster, demonstrating\nthe maturation of the thruster design and TRL to 6,\nand ultimately support the PACE HPGP propulsion\nsubsystem trade study, pushing towards HPGP\n22 N thruster mission qualification.\nPerformance and functional EQM cold testing\nwas performed at the ECAPS facility in Solna,\nSweden. EQM shock and vibration testing was\nperformed at Innventia Transport Testing Center in\nKista, Sweden. The shock tests were performed\nusing the ECAPS in-house pyro-actuated shock\ntable. The vibration tests were conducted using an\nelectrodynamic shaker. The vibration test\nequipment used was an air cooled electrodynamic\nshaker of type IMV EM2605 Model J260-CE. The\nEQM thruster hot fire testing was performed in\nECAPS Hot Firing Test Facility located at the\nSwedish Defence Research Agency (FOI) test\nrange, Grindsj\xc3\xb6n, Sweden.\nThrough this program, the HPGP EQM 22 N\nthruster demonstrated steady state and pulse mode\noperational capability with increased propellant\nthruster throughput. This effort represents a\n5\n\nThe FCV opening and closing response times\nwere not measured during each functional test but\nwere characterized at the FCV Acceptance\nVerification Procedure level prior to integration,\nduring the EQM hot-fire testing, and post hot-fire\ntesting at final inspection.\n\n100\n\nLevel (G)\n\nSine Vibration Levels\n----------------------------------------------------5 - 20\n0.63 in (double amplitude)\n20 - 100 12.5 G\n\n5.2. Environmental Testing\nEnvironmental testing was conducted in the\nHPGP 22 N EQM test program in order to ensure\nthe thruster\xe2\x80\x99s capability of meeting performance\nrequirements after exposure to launch vehicle\ninduced mechanical loading. The specific tests\nperformed on the HPGP 22 N EQM thruster were\nlow-level sine sweeps, sine and random vibration,\nand shock. Each of the dynamic tests was\ncompleted in each orthogonal axis. Sine sweep was\nperformed before and after vibration and shock with\nthe initial sine sweep establishing the reference to\nshow compliance with fundamental frequency\nrequirements. A post-test sine sweep verified that\nthere was no discernible shift in fundamental\nfrequencies. The sine sweeps were executed in\neach axis at 0.5 G acceleration over a 5 to 2000 Hz\nrange, sweeping at two octaves per minute. Sine\nvibration testing was conducted to verify\nworkmanship quality and to simulate launch vehicle\nloading conditions. The sine vibration testing was\nswept through the frequency range at two octaves\nper min as shown in Fig. 7. Random vibration test\nwas conducted to demonstrate workmanship quality\nand to simulate launch vehicle aerodynamic\nenvironmental levels. Random vibration testing was\nperformed at 120 seconds per axis as shown in\nFig. 8. The EQM thruster is shown in the vibration\ntest fixture in Fig. 9.\nThe EQM thruster was subjected to mechanical\nshock twice in the x-axis and twice in the z-axis. Due\nto the symmetric nature of the y and z-axis, the\nshock response was similar, and it was determined\nthat the two hits in the z-axis was sufficient to verify\nthe EQM design. The EQM thruster was slightly\nunder-tested in the 500 \xe2\x80\x93 900 Hz frequency range\ndue to the characteristics of the shock table and\nHPGP 22 N EQM test fixture. Shock table test setup\nand calibration were performed using a thruster\nmass simulator in order to validate the shock\nresponse; however, the actual HPGP 22 N EQM\nshock response was slightly different than\nanticipated. This was the first time the 22 N thrust\nclass size was shock tested using the fixture and\ntable combination and performance is anticipated to\nbe improved in future tests. The HPGP 22 N EQM\nshock profile is shown in Fig. 10 and the HPGP 22 N\nEQM is shown in the shock test fixture in Fig. 11.\n\n10\n\n1\n5\n\n50\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\nFigure 7.

Further hot firing was halted in order to\nanalyse the test data and perform visual\ninspections. After discussion and agreement\nbetween NASA GSFC and ECAPS, the HPGP 22 N\nEQM thruster was removed from the test stand in\norder to perform non-destructive testing and identify\nthe root cause for the off-nominal performance.\nRadiographic inspection was performed, and it was\ndetermined that an internal retainer had become\ndisplaced at some point after initial assembly.\nFurther analysis of the low-level sine sweep test\ndata identified that the displacement occurred\nduring the random vibration testing as evidenced by\na small frequency shift that was not readily apparent\nuntil the team knew what they were looking for. This\nretainer geometry is being corrected by a\nstraightforward modification to the design and will\nbe verified with respect to structural integrity and\nqualification environments in the future.\n\n10000\n\nLevel (G)\n\n1000\n\n100\n\n10\n\nShock Qual\nUpper Limit\nLower Limit\n\n1\n100\n\n1000\n\n10000\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\nFigure 10.

HPGP 22 N EQM \xe2\x80\x93 Hot Firing\n\nThe HPGP 22 N EQM Thruster was hot fire\ntested to achieve the performance goals detailed in\nTab. 2 and as derived by the SPEC. Figure 12\nshows the HPGP EQM 22 N thruster in hot fire\ntesting. The hot fire test matrix involved a mix of\nperformance mapping and characterization firings,\nand a life test developed to represent PACE mission\nmaneuvers and operational duty cycles. The PACE\nlife test was comprised of initial on-orbit thruster\ncheckouts, launch vehicle dispersions, orbit\nmaintenance, and controlled re-entry. During the\ncontrolled re-entry testing phase, small momentum\nmanagement firings were also tested. As seen in\nFig. 6, two hot fire test campaigns were performed.\nThe first was conducted just before the FOI summer\nfacility shutdown, and covered performance\nmapping, characterization, and steady state firings.\nThe second test battery started just after the facility\nwas operational again and continued until the end\nof hot fire testing as described below.\n\n6.

CONCLUSIONS\nThe first flight-like 22 N HPGP thruster was\ndesigned and built to substantiate the thruster\ndesign, build process, and testing with respect to\nthe NASA GSFC PACE mission requirements under\nthe auspices of the international IA. This test\nprogram was developed to comprehensively test\nthe thruster, the technology, and foremost to\nincrease the HPGP 22 N TRL level. The HPGP 22 N\nEQM was tested to environmental qualification\nlevels prior to hot fire performance testing to\nrepresent the relevant end-to-end environment\n(launch to on-orbit operation). Prior to the\ndiscontinuation of the hot firing tests, the HPGP\n22 N EQM had successfully met all hot fire\n\nFigure 16.

The HPGP\n22 N EQM post hot fire test #1 is pictured in Fig. 18.\nAt this point in the test program, the EQM thruster\nhad achieved TRL 6, as confirmed by NASA GSFC\nchief engineers.\n\nIn response to the ongoing IA work and other\ngreen propulsion efforts currently being pursued at\nother NASA Centers, a green propulsion\nstakeholders organizing structure is in work as\ndescribed below.\n\nFigure 19.

NASA GREEN PROPULSION EFFORTS\nAND INTEREST\n\nThe HPGP 22 N EQM test campaign has\nstrengthened the HPGP 22 N thruster technology\nand design. Since this was the first flight-like design\nand manufacture, lessons were learned throughout\nthe development, manufacturing and testing\nprocess. The most immediately significant being the\nretainer design that ultimately resulted in the end of\nhot fire. However, halting the test resulted in a fully\nintact thruster which allowed for full destructive\ntesting to perform inspection post life. It has been\nconcluded that the retainer displacement occurred\nduring random vibration and can be corrected by a\nsimple redesign. This updated design is in progress\nand will be integrated in the next HPGP 22 N EQM\nthruster build.\nOf perhaps more significant benefit from this\ntest program, however, was the opportunity to make\nboth NASA GSFC projects and engineering, and\nother NASA Centers aware of the NASA SNSB IA\nwork and the maturing HPGP technology. NASA\nGFSC personnel continuously supported the test\nprogram, gaining a significant benefit from the\nexposure. During the active test portion in 2017, the\nPACE observatory manager, PACE spacecraft\nsystems engineer, and Safety and Mission\nAssurance Chief travelled to the ECAPS facility to\nmeet with ECAPS and receive first hand test\nbriefings, greater familiarity with the LMP-103S\npropellant manufacturing and toured the hot fire\nfacility as shown in Fig. 19. In addition, the WFIRST\nobservatory manager and propulsion lead have had\nthe opportunity to visit the ECAPS facility. The\nNASA GSFC Propulsion Branch Head has been\ninvolved in the IA testing since 2015, and has been\nfortunate to follow the HPGP technology maturation.\nPushing forward to HPGP infusion on a mission, this\ntype of involvement of the NASA GSFC project,\nsystems, and mission assurance communities is\nessential to realizing a future HPGP flight\nopportunity.\n\nAs an Agency, NASA has demonstrated an\ninterest in hydrazine alternative technologies, and\nspecifically HPGP, since 2011. Agency efforts,\nhowever, have not been particularly well\ncoordinated amongst the various NASA Centers. In\nthe past year, however, there has been a concerted\neffort to change that. In the Spring of 2017 the\nNASA Chief Engineer organized the Chemical\nPropulsion Subcapability Management (CPSM)\neffort with the goal of efficiently and effectively\nutilizing existing and emerging Agency chemical\npropulsion capabilities across the multiple Centers.\nThis CPSM effort was also specifically tasked with\naddressing the need for greater coordination and\nunified direction for Agency work in the field of\nhydrazine alternative technology (colloquially\nreferred to as Green Propulsion). To this end, the\nGreen Propulsion Working Group (GPWG) was\nestablished, focusing on the coordination and\nadvancement of Green Propulsion efforts for the\nAgency.\nThe Green Propulsion Working Group is\nchaired by a representative from Marshall Space\nFlight Center (MSFC) and Co-chaired by a\nrepresentative from Glenn Research Center (GRC).\nGSFC also has representation on the working group\nas a key stakeholder and implementer for Green\nPropulsion flight systems. One of the first products\nthe GPWG will be producing in Spring 2018, is the\nNASA Green Propulsion Technology Development\nRoadmap. This Roadmap is an initial attempt to\noutline the context for Green Propulsion at the\nAgency and seeks to achieve three goals:\n1) Establish Agency Vision for Green Propulsion\n2) Provide Guidance to Focus Energies and\nResources\n3) Knowledge Archiving, Distribution and\nUtilization\n9\n\nACKNOLEDGEMENTS\n\nThe NASA Roadmap focuses Agency\ninvestment in Green Propulsion in a way that is\nagnostic to any specific propellant formulation. It\nlays out hurdles to making the technology flight\ninfusion-ready (accurate plume modelling, ignition\npower and techniques, throughput capability) and\nattempts to address some of the technical\nchallenges common amongst the emerging\ntechnologies (material properties, response time,\nperformance modelling). Additionally, the Roadmap\naddresses infrastructure needs such as propellant\nsupply challenges and manufacturing techniques.\nThe focus of the Roadmap is on relatively small\nthrust classes (100 mN, 1 N, 5 N, 22 N) in the near\nterm (3 - 5 years) with expansion to the 50 N, 110 N,\nand 440 N thrust classes over time (5 \xe2\x80\x93 10 years).\nIt is anticipated that the small satellite market is the\nmost likely user set that would be interested in\nembracing a new propellant technology as\ndemonstrated by the commercial SkySat\nconstellation of satellites using HPGP. As budgets\nbecome constrained, small satellites are being\nconsidered for more and more demanding roles,\noften requiring innovative solutions. This is a prime\narea where low toxicity, high energy propulsion\nsystems could find welcome opportunities in both\nthe public and private sectors.\nThe GPWG is also working to foster more\npartnerships in the Green Propulsion arena. These\ninclude intra-NASA partnerships between operating\nCenters, inter-agency partnerships between NASA\nand other U.S. Government agencies, public-private\npartnerships\nbetween\nNASA\nand\nprivate\ncommercial entities, and international partnerships\nwith space agencies and companies across the\nplanet. There is an understanding that it will be\nthrough these partnerships that Green Propulsion\ntechnology can be brought to bear rapidly and\nwidely across the global aerospace industry.\n\nThe authors wish to acknowledge the support from\nthe NASA GSFC propulsion, specifically Ms. Caitlin\nBacha, Dr. Eric Cardiff and Dr. Rich Driscoll, the\nPACE and WFIRST Missions, SNSB, and all coworkers from ECAPS, Swedish Defence Research\nAgency, and NASA MSFC and GRC.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Cardiff, E., Mulkey, H.

WAY FORWARD\nThis work advances the test, analytical, and risk\nreduction activities for candidate green propellant\nLMP-103S and HPGP technology. NASA GSFC will\ncontinue to pursue risk reduction activities in order\nto capitalize on potential infusion mission\nopportunities and fully comprehend propellant and\nthruster performance, through the NASA-SNSB IA.\nThe HPGP 5 N and 22 N thrusters will be\nupdated to incorporate the lessons learned during\nthis test campaign. The 5 N is next to be tested in\nsummer 2018, and all requisite design and\nmanufacturing updated will be implemented. The\nHPGP 22 N thruster design and manufacturing will\nfollow in parallel, and the next HPGP 22 N EQM will\nalso include anything identified in the 5 N EQM test\ncampaign. Additionally, anything learned from the\ncontinued on-orbit commercial use of the 1 N\nthrusters will be incorporated going forward.\n\n[7] Mulkey, H.
