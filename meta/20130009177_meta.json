We were the first expedition to winter in Antarctica between 95 E and 57 W - nearly half the coastline of Antarctica. It was understood that we must be self-sufficient in every respect for 2 years. There could be no firm or detailed plans for inland exploration until we found where it was possible to make a landing. Geology (Slide 20) Our two geologists traveled far from the Advance Base during both field seasons. Carrying fuel supplies (dog food) for a month, man food (dehydrated) and rock specimens acquired along the way, they covered a vast area. The surveyor drove his own dogs with the geophysicist as assistant. While the geologists were hacking away at rocks, the survey team lugged a theodolite up peaks to extend a triangulation network. Glaciology (Slides 21-22) The glaciologists each had an assistant from the support staff, so they could either travel together or divided into two parties to cover more ground. At each camp they dug a pit to determine the rate of snow accumulation, drilled (by hand) to a depth of 10 m to measure ice temperatures, and in places set up and surveyed ice-movement markers to be resurveyed the following season. Geophysics (Slides 33, 34-36, 38) The principal object was to determine the thickness of ice by seismic sounding the only means known at the time. After experiments as far as the Advance Base in the 1950-51 summer, both Weasels were devoted to a seismic sounding traverse in 1951-52 as far inland as supplies would allow. The party reached 620 km inland and found ice thicknesses of 2,500 m.", "title": "Parallels Between Antarctic Travel in 1950 and Planetary Travel in 2050 (to Accompany Notes on \"The Norwegian British-Swedish Antarctic Expedition 1949-52\")", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-27T11:27:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20130009177, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Swithinbank, Charles"}, "organization": {"name": "Cambridge Univ.", "location": "United Kingdom"}}, "id": "4d7196c9c4b04993b7526fcd7cb71649"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-04-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20130009177, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20130009177, "id": "ba7664c12f4a4cfca8dfe7d22be34190", "publicationName": "Antarctic Exploration Parallels for Future Human Planetary Exploration: The Role and Utility of Long Range, Long Duration Traverses", "publicationDate": "2012-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20130009172, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Antarctic Exploration Parallels for Future Human Planetary Exploration: The Role and Utility of Long Range, Long Duration Traverses", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PUBLICATION", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20130009177.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20130009177/downloads/20130009177.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20130009177/downloads/20130009177.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20130009177/downloads/20130009177.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
