Rothschild*\nBiospheric Science Branch, Mail Stop 239-20, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA , USA\n\nThe combination of evolutionary with engineering principles will enhance synthetic biology. Conversely, synthetic biology has the potential to enrich evolutionary\nbiology by explaining why some adaptive space is\nempty, on Earth or elsewhere. Synthetic biology, the\ndesign and construction of arti\xef\xac\x81cial biological systems,\nsubstitutes bio-engineering for evolution, which is seen\nas an obstacle. But because evolution has produced the\ncomplexity and diversity of life, it provides a proven\ntoolkit of genetic materials and principles available to\nsynthetic biology. Evolution operates on the population\nlevel, with the populations composed of unique individuals that are historical entities. The source of genetic\nnovelty includes mutation, gene regulation, sex, symbiosis, and interspecies gene transfer. At a phenotypic level,\nvariation derives from regulatory control, replication and\ndiversi\xef\xac\x81cation of components, compartmentalization,\nsexual selection and speciation, among others. Variation\nis limited by physical constraints such as diffusion, and\nchemical constraints such as reaction rates and membrane \xef\xac\x82uidity. While some of these tools of evolution are\ncurrently in use in synthetic biology, all ought to be\nexamined for utility. A hybrid approach of synthetic\nbiology coupled with \xef\xac\x81ne-tuning through evolution is\nsuggested.\n\nIntroduction: The promise of synthetic\nbiology\nFor millennia, mankind has surveyed the natural world and\nwondered \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98if only. . .\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99. Through breeding, wolves, teosinte and\nother wild grasses have been transformed into dogs, maize,\nrice, wheat, and other domesticated species. But arti\xef\xac\x81cial\nselection can be a slow, haphazard affair and, like natural\nselection, depends on a pre-existing variability. We can\nincrease the pool of variability by mutagens. We can create\nvariability more precisely by genetic engineering. But, what if\nwe could go beyond this to create more complex synthetic\nbiological systems with the ease of plugging in interlocking\ncomponents that were guaranteed to function in an enclosure\nof choice, either natural or synthesized?\n\n*Correspondence to: L.

Knight(2)\nand Endy(3) see synthetic biology as an engineering challenge\nwith interchangeable parts joined to yield novel pathways. By\nstripping away the \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98baggage\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99(4) of its heritage, a minimal\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98chassis\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 organism would be created to provide a blank\ncanvas upon which to build.(4) Church and Venter aim to build\ncompletely arti\xef\xac\x81cial cells. Venter intends to patent an entirely\nsynthetic free-living organism.(5) The \xef\xac\x81rst simpli\xef\xac\x81ed proteins\nhave been synthesized.(6) Naturally evolved genomes have\nbeen recreated. Short segments of the 7,000-base poliovirus\ngenome have been synthesized in vitro, stitched together, and\nshown to be active.(7) Venter\xe2\x80\x99s team has accomplished a\nsimilar feat with a 5,400-base pair phage genome,(8) and the\n582,970-base pair Mycoplasma genitalium genome using two\nmethods.(9,10)\nEndy(3) identi\xef\xac\x81ed the four challenges to engineering\nbiology as:\n(i) biological complexity,\n(ii) the tedious and unreliable construction and characterization of synthetic biological systems,\n(iii) the apparent spontaneous physical variation of biological\nsystem behavior,\n(iv) evolution.\nCertainly the complexity of biology provides a colossal\nengineering challenge. Organisms operate not as an engineered system, but as a metabolic ecosystem with extremely\ncomplex feedback loops. But until recently it was evolution that\ncreated all life that has ever existed on Earth. While some\nworkers try to circumvent the complexity of living organisms,\nthere are various principles and approaches that have been\nused successfully during evolution, and are worth examining by\nsynthetic biologists. The richness of the evolutionary toolkit\nshould be examined, exploited and, when advisable, overcome. While virtually unknown in nature, wheels are ubiquitous\nin human cultures. However, biomimetic \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98limbs\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 or wind-blown\nvehicles may be better for traversing Mars.\nTo develop evolution\xe2\x80\x99s toolkit requires understanding\nJacob\xe2\x80\x99s metaphor(11) that natural selection works as a\n\n1\n\nReview essay\n\nL.

Data\non structural(6,12) and regulatory gene evolution have\nsupported this metaphor.(13) For the tinkerer, the premium\nis on utilizing (exapting) existing components in novel\nways.(14) But a certain amount of \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98preadaptation\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x93 having\nthe \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98right\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 parts already available \xe2\x80\x93 is helpful. Thus, evolution\nis constrained by history, creativity, and physical constraints.\nThe result is the Rube Goldberg device we call \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98life.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99\nThe goal of this paper is to categorize and survey\nevolution\xe2\x80\x99s toolkit as a way to point to potential approaches\nfor synthetic biology. Some are already in use. Others are\npromising future prospects. Some are impractical. I conclude\nwith an even less explored perspective, the potential for\nsynthetic biology to inform evolutionary studies.\n\nHow nature took its course\nWhat is different about evolution? First, evolution is a\npopulational phenomenon whereas synthetic biology focuses\non constructing single organisms that give rise to a clone.\nWhere a clonal population has genetic homogeneity, a natural\npopulation has genetic variation as a foundation upon which\nphenotypic variation and the potential for selection is built.\nNatural populations obtain genetic novelty through recombination and mutation. A clonal population could undergo\nmutation as well. But, without an evolutionary approach, such\nspontaneous variability would be seen as a liability rather than\na source of novelty.\nSecond, organisms are historical entities. Hydrogen\nproduced during the Big Bang is interchangeable with\nhydrogen produced today. In contrast, organisms carry the\nmark of their developmental history, their interaction with the\n\nphysical and biological environment, and their genetic history.\nEven if created synthetically,(5\xe2\x80\x938) from that moment onwards\neach organism will undergo a unique history which may effect\nits phenotype and genotype.\nThird, natural selection(15) is a very powerful principle in its\nlogic and explanatory power. Offspring show a range of\nheritable variation. More offspring are born than can survive.\nThose that are in some way better adapted to their\nenvironment produce offspring with the greatest chance of\nreproductive success. The illusion of directionality and\npurpose stems from consistent selective criteria over generations. And when the environment \xef\xac\x82uctuates, selection is\nfor adaptability itself rather than increasing adaptation to a\nsingle environment.\nThus, even synthetically created biological systems will,\nonce created, operate under the rules of evolution. Arti\xef\xac\x81cial\nselection is easily designed and applied. Thus, where\nevolution has the most to teach synthetic biology is in its\ndiverse toolkit of ways to generate heritable novelty, and its\ncore principles.\nOrigin of heritable novelty\nMayr(16) de\xef\xac\x81ned novelty as \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98any newly acquired structure or\nproperty that permits the assumption of a new function.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99\nVarious mechanisms for innovation are listed in Table 1,\nincluding Mendelian and non-Mendelian inheritance.\nUsually heritable variation stems from genetic changes.\nEndogenous sources include alterations in DNA sequence\ncaused by mutations and genetic recombination. Duplication\nand diversi\xef\xac\x81cation of parts is a common form of novelty, from\nthe gene to the cellular and higher levels (reviewed in\nRefs.(17,18)). Exogenous sources of variation include environmental mutagens, sex, viral-mediated gene transfer, and\n\nTable 1.

J. Rothschild\n\nsymbiosis. Heritable novelty can arise from changes in\nstructure, regulation, or development.\nThere are also non-genetic heritable processes that rely on\ntemplating to structure. For example, the cortex in ciliates may\nhave an anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral asymmetry.\nAfter conjugation, the exconjugant protozoan may be left with\na reversed row or so of cortex derived from their mate. The\nreversed rows are heritable.(19) Further, there are some\nphysical changes such as compartmentalization in organelles\nthat can be a source of heritable novelty for evolution.\nGenomic novelty\nHeritable novelty is the raw material for evolution, although\nmuch is deleterious or neutral. Changes may occur within or\nbetween generations. Novelty may be the result of the transfer\nof genes within a cell. Plant mitochondrial genes in particular\nhave been transferred to the nucleus at a high rate.(20,21)\nAlternatively, novelty can be induced by environmental\nmutagens, and of these, solar ultraviolet radiation is arguably\nthe most important. It is nearly ubiquitous, and was more\nintense during the early evolution of life, and still acts as a\nmutagen today.(22,23) Besides its direct mutagenic effect, UV\nradiation photo-produces reactive oxygen species; these\ncause oxidative damage including the production of mutagenic 8-hydroxyguanosine.\nPoint mutations are the canonical source of new genetic\nmaterial. Transitions (e.g., the replacement of a purine with\nanother purine) are an order of magnitude more common than\ntransversions (the replacement of a purine with a pyrimidine or\nvisa versa). These changes might be bene\xef\xac\x81cial, but are more\nlikely to be silent (have no functional affect on the protein),\nmissense (code for a different amino acid) or nonsense\n(produce a stop codon). The addition or deletion of a base pair\nin a protein-coding gene causes a frameshift resulting in a\nradically altered protein downstream from the mutation.\nHow important is a point mutation? With only a single point\nmutation, a highly promiscuous restriction enzyme can\nbecome extremely site speci\xef\xac\x81c.(24) A tRNAarg was changed\nto a tRNAthr by altering its anticodon from UCU to UGU.(25)\nOhno(26) argued that gene duplication is the most\nimportant evolutionary force since the divergence of life from\nthe common ancestor. Over 50% of the sequenced gene\nproducts from Escherichia coli arose through gene duplication.(27) An impressive 97% of human genes show signi\xef\xac\x81cant\nmatches to each other, and most are composites of other\ngenes: about 80% of human proteins show relationship to\nmore than one other protein in different regions.(12)\nDuplicating a gene relieves selective constraints, as one\ncopy can subsequently diverge or combine with other units to\nproduce novel functions. The additional part could enhance\nfunction, e.g., increasing gene dosage in rDNA gene families.\nIf a gene is replicated within a genome and afterward\n\nBioEssays 9999:1\xe2\x80\x9310, \xc3\x9f 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n\nReview essay\n\ndiverges, the two genes are \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98paralogous\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99. In contrast,\ndivergence in one gene between species produces \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98orthologous\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 genes. In eukaryotes, the duplicated gene often\nlooses function becoming a pseudogene, and is ultimately\nlost.(28) The homogeneity among repeats within a species,\nand the heterogeneity between species(29) suggest strong\nselective pressure.\nWhen duplicate genes diverge, the resulting paralogs often\nretain similar functions, as in the red- and green-sensitive\nopsin genes of hominoids and Old World monkeys.(18) While\nsimilar in function, their maximum absorptions differ by 30 nm.\nIn E. coli, over 70% of the enzyme pairs catalyze similar\nbiochemical reactions.(27) Conversely, about 60% of the\nenzyme pairs are related in sequence. Surely this replication\nof function must provide selective advantage to E. coli.\nHowever, there are cases where completely novel functions\narise from the duplicate gene.(18) Human eosinophil-derived\nneurotoxin and eosinophil cationic protein genes are paralogous, and belong to the RNase A gene superfamily. But after\nduplication, a novel antibacterial activity emerged in the\neosinophil cationic protein that does not depend on\nribonuclease activity.\nGene duplication can arise from unequal crossing-over,\nwhich results in tandem arrays. Gene duplication by mobile\nelements has played a particularly large role in mammalian(30)\nand plant(31,32) evolution. Transposition can involve DNA\ntransposons, autonomous retrotransposons, and nonautonomous retrotransposons.(31) Retrotransposition of an RNA\nsequence results in DNA copies scattered locations throughout the genome with poly-A tracts, but without introns or\nregulatory sequences. For example, the bacterium Bordetella,\nthe genus that includes the agent for human whooping cough,\nchanges coat proteins frequently to evade the host immune\nsystem through retrotransposition. The surface-binding\nprotein genes are reverse transcribed \xe2\x80\x93 which is an errorprone process \xe2\x80\x93 and re-inserted into the genome.(33) This\ncreates a hypervariable region where it is needed most.\nWhole genome duplication has been an important source\nof novelty: perhaps 70% of angiosperms having undergone\none or more polyploidy events.(34) The entire genome of\nthe budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is the result of\na whole genome duplication.(35) Whole genome duplication\nallows replication of entire metabolic pathways along with\nregulatory elements,(36\xe2\x80\x9338) thus maintaining gene dosage\nrelationships. If gene products interact, gene dosage is\nimportant in maintaining metabolic balance.(39)\nAfter whole genome duplication, extensive and rapid\ngenome evolution may follow. Further, polyploids may\nhybridize among themselves creating additional genetic\nnovelty.(34) Yet, whole genome duplication is almost\nalways detrimental in the short term, although it is\nbene\xef\xac\x81cial in new environments, which is why it is important\nbut rare.\n\n3\n\nReview essay\n\nClassically, genes are the property of an individual that can\nthen be shared with other members of the species. But\ncombining genes from different species \xe2\x80\x93 as practiced in\nnature and synthetic biology \xe2\x80\x93 is a very powerful tool to create\nnovelty as it circumvents the need to evolve genes de novo.(40)\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98Interspecies\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98horizontal\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 gene transfer seems to have\nmidwifed major steps in evolution, from the origin of\neukaryotes(41) to the symbiotic origin of chloroplasts and\nmitochondria. The number of documented cases of gene,\noperon, and gene cluster transfer is increasing. The spread of\nantibiotic resistance genes in bacteria is a curse of modern\nmedicine. Vibrio cholerae responsible for the current cholera\npandemic are descended from a single strain, which evolved\nmainly through gene exchange with other strains.(42) Thus,\ngene transfer has become an acknowledged source of\nevolutionary novelty,(43) and can act to accelerate innovation\nand thus evolution.(40)\nGene transfer among prokaryotes is well known.(44)\nMetabolic genes are transferred much more than informational genes.(45) Genes for virulence appear to be spread\nvia interspecies gene transfer through \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98pathogenicity\nislands\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99.(46,47) Interspecies gene transfer also occurs among\neukaryotes. For example, genes have been transferred\nbetween parasitic \xef\xac\x82owering plants and their plant hosts.(48)\nOf the 31 mitochondrial protein genes in the basal angiosperm\nAmborella, 20 are from other land plants (primarily other\nangiosperms), but 6 are from mosses.(49) Amazingly, gene\ntransfer occurs across the three domains of life. Wolf and\ncolleagues(50) identi\xef\xac\x81ed 37 cases of transfer of genes among\ndomains, which subsequently joined endogenous genes\nresulting in a multi-domain fusion protein. About 24% of the\ngenes of bacterium Thermotoga maritima MSB8 108 are very\nsimilar to archaeal genes.(51) The bdelloid rotifer, an\ninvertebrate, has genes that appear to be from bacteria,\nfungi, and plants.(42)\nThere are several mechanisms for obtaining foreign DNA.\nCompetent bacteria and archaea may incorporate DNA from\nthe environment by transformation. Eukaryotes may also take\nup environmental DNA by phagocytosis or symbiosis. In\nanimals exogenous DNA may be transported through spermmediated transfer.(53) Viral-mediated gene transfer is called\ntransduction. An example of natural transduction is the\nphotosystem I gene cassette present in the phages of marine\ncyanobacteria.(54) The cassette may increase gene dosage in\ntheir new hosts.(55)\nInterspecies gene transfer is facilitated by physical\nproximity, for example between hosts and parasites,(49) and\namong bacterial and archaeal hyperthermophiles.(46\xe2\x80\x9356)\nOther\nfactors predictive of the likelihood of gene transfer\ninclude environmental temperature, genome size, genomic G/\nC composition, the type of carbon utilization (e.g., heterotroph\nor autotroph), and oxygen tolerance.(41)\n\n4\n\nL. J. Rothschild\n\nExogenous DNA may remain epigenetic or integrated into\nthe genome. DNA uptake may represent a source of pristine\ngenes to replace those that have accumulated mutations, or\npossibly DNA uptake is a way for the host to explore \xef\xac\x81tness\nspace.(57) However, new functions are unlikely to arise from\nthis mechanism in nature since the chance of incorporation of\na full gene and regulatory sequences is low.\nClearly sexual processes are a major source of genetic\nnovelty, but are not reviewed here. Autogamy is a usual sexual\nprocess in some protists, notably ciliates and foraminifera.\nAfter meiosis a haploid nucleus undergoes a further mitotic\ndivision. The two nuclei then fuse, creating a completely\nhomozygous diploid. Parasexual processes differ from sexual\nones in that they do not involve meiosis and formation of a\nzygote by fertilization. In bacteria, conjugation is a parasexual\nprocess where a plasmid is transferred to the recipient cell\nthrough a mating bridge. In nature, the soil bacterium\nAgrobacterium tumefaciens transfers genes to plants resulting in the induction of crown gall tumor. Through biotechnology Agrobacterium\xe2\x80\x99s target range has been extended to\nyeast and \xef\xac\x81lamentous fungi.(58) In the lab, conjugation has\nbeen observed between E. coli and a species of Saccharomyces, and between E. coli and Chinese hamster ovary\ncells.(59)\nSymbiosis also results in genetic transfer between\nspecies, with the best-known cases being the evolution of\nmitochondria and chloroplasts. Endosymbiosis is common\namong the protists and invertebrates including corals. Some\nassociations, such as the binucleate dino\xef\xac\x82agellates, appear in\ntransition from containing heritable symbionts to organelles.\nParasitic plants are known to transfer mitochondrial genes to\ntheir hosts, and vice versa.(49)\nHybridization does not invariably result in sterile offspring,\nand thus is a source of genetic novelty. While best known in\nplants,(60,61) it also occurs in diversity of animals including\nvertebrates.(62) Introgression is of practical importance as\nwild plants have incorporated genes from many domesticated\nspecies.(63)\nRegulatory changes\nChanges in structural genes permanently alter the gene\nproduct, whereas regulatory changes leave the structural\ngenes intact, permitting more evolutionary \xef\xac\x82exibility. Further, a\nregulatory element may control multiple genes. For example,\na single base pair substitution in the coding sequence of a\nsignaling pathway gene in Pseudomonas \xef\xac\x82uorescens\nresulted in 52 proteomic changes, corresponding to 46\nidenti\xef\xac\x81ed proteins.(64)\nThere is a discrepancy between the rates of morphological\nand genetic evolution (e.g., (12,65,66)), which suggests that\nregulatory genes provide the link between the two. Such an\n\nBioEssays 9999:1\xe2\x80\x9310, \xc3\x9f 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n\nL. J. Rothschild\n\napproach has revealed homologies that have their origins\nmuch farther back in evolutionary history than previously\napparent.(67) Regulation can occur in a variety of ways, from\nmetabolic loops and promoters to base modi\xef\xac\x81cation. All are\npotentially useful to synthetic biology.\nNon-coding RNA (ncRNA) are potent regulatory elements\nthat can control chromosome architecture, mRNA turnover and\ndevelopmental protein expression, and may control other\nfactors as well.(68) Their importance in humans is clear: 97\xe2\x80\x93\n98% of human transcriptional output is ncRNA.(69) Another form\nof post-transcriptional regulation is that of the modi\xef\xac\x81cation of\nadenosine to inosine editing in the RNA transcript.(69) The\ninosine is interpreted as guanosine by the translational\nmachinery. Only a single nucleotide is changed, but the\nrami\xef\xac\x81cations include change in amino acid sequence, or\npotentially altered splicing or gene silencing.\nRegulatory genes can duplicate and diverge. In multicellular organisms, the duplicate genes could then regulate\ntranscription in different tissues(18) as probably occurred after\nthe whole genome duplication in teleost \xef\xac\x81sh soon after their\ndivergence from tetrapods,(70) where nearly all duplicate gene\npairs diverged in spatial and/or temporal expression during\nembryogenesis.(71)\nThe duplication and subsequent diversi\xef\xac\x81cation of parts as\na source of novelty were recognized by Darwin.(14) It is\nresponsible for, among others, segmentation, digits, cilia,\nleaves, and multicellularity. For example, multiple similar teeth\nevolved early in vertebrate evolution. But in some reptiles\n(e.g., pterosaurs, lizards, and dinosaurs) and Synapsida\n(which includes mammals), teeth have differentiated, allowing\nmore ef\xef\xac\x81cient food capture and access to a diversity of foods.\nThe duplication and diversi\xef\xac\x81cation of cells resulting in\nmulticellularity must be a relatively simply evolutionary\ntransition as it has occurred in the plants, animals, and fungi\nseparately and repeatedly. Among the protists, this transition\nis common and ongoing. For example, in the green algal\nfamily Volvocaceae, there are about 40 multicellular species in\na variety of genera that differ in the number of Chlamydomonas-like cells they contain (e.g.(72), Fig. 1). In spite of\nproblems of delayed reproduction and coordination, there are\nadvantages to multicellularity such as cell specialization and\nlarger size to avoid ingestion by \xef\xac\x81lter feeders.(73) Among\nprokaryotes, multicellularity also has arisen in myxobacteria,\nwhich form fruiting bodies, and multicellular cyanobacteria.\n\nReview essay\n\nFigure 1. Sources of genetic novelty in evolution. This figure uses\nas an example the evolution of multicellularity in the Volvocaceae\nfrom a Chlamydomonas-like ancestor (left) to a multicellular, differentiated Volvox (right). Examples of sources of genetic novelty are\nindicated in the text that may have contributed to this evolution.\nAlthough not illustrated, other multicellular genera in the Volvocaceae\ninclude Gonium, Pandorina, Eudorina, and Pleodorina.\n\norganism with respect to its overall size can provide\nevolutionary novelty. The classic case of allometry was the\nincreasing size of the antlers of the male Irish Elk relative to its\nbody size over time.\nPhysical\nPhysical compartmentalization separates components, and\nincludes the encapsulation a primitive genetic endowment in a\nlipid vesicle, allowing for the evolution of individuals. From a\nbiochemical point of view, it allowed the separation of different\nenvironments distinguished by such factors as pH and oxygen\ntension. Compartmentalization of genetic material allows\ndifferential activities. For example, most plant mitochondrial\ngenes have low nucleotide substitution rates, whereas those\nof most animals are high.(74) The physical partitioning of\ngenetic material in the nucleus and organelles was critical to\neukaryotic evolution.\n\nDevelopmental\n\nRate of production of genetic novelty\n\nDevelopmental changes leading to evolution can be based on\nregulatory rather than structural gene change. Neoteny \xe2\x80\x93 the\nretention of traits in an adult that formerly were only found in\njuveniles \xe2\x80\x93 is one example. Adult dogs are more like juvenile\nwolves, and the naked ape called Homo sapiens also evolved\nby neoteny.

J. Rothschild\n\ning environment.(75) Eukaryotes can also change their\nmutation rate in response to environmental pressure. For\nexample, 1 month starvation of the budding yeast\nS. cerevisiae induced high rates of genomic rearrangements.(76) Changes in mutation rates are not necessarily\nrandom, but can focus on \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98contingency\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 genes that are\ninvolved in environmental interactions rather than \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98housekeeping\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 genes.(77)\n\nSynthetic biology is limited primarily by formal constraints.\nIn theory, historical and developmental constraints may be\nirrelevant, but in practice until we can literally \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98dial an\norganism\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 from basic components rather than modify existing\nones, historical and developmental constraints must also be\nconsidered.\n\nSynthetic biology: where the principles of\nevolution can propel the \xef\xac\x81eld forward\n\nEvolutionary constraints\nThe diversity of life is limited by formal, historical, and\ndevelopmental constraints(78) (Table 2). Formal constraints\nare the result of physical laws, and thus control phytoplankton\nmorphology,(79) where surface area to volume ratio affects\nrates of exchanges with the environment in processes such as\nnutrient uptake, release of waste products, and intake of\ngasses and toxins. Similar principles apply to the shapes of\nanimal cells, e.g., red blood versus nerve cells. Surface to\nvolume ratio considerations are the basis for Bergmann\xe2\x80\x99s rule\nthat related animals have a larger body size in colder areas,\nand Allen\xe2\x80\x99s rule that endotherms have shorter limbs in colder\nclimates relative to their body size than their warm climate\nrelatives. A smaller surface to volume ratio reduces heat loss,\nwhich is advantageous in cold climates but detrimental in\nwarm climates.\nFormal constraints are particularly noticeable in extremophilic organisms where adaptations are required to live near\nthe physical and chemical limits for a carbon-based life\nform.(80,81) For example, chlorophyll-based photosynthesis\ndoes not occur at temperatures above \x1872 8C as chlorophyll\ndenatures at those temperatures. At low temperatures,\nmembrane \xef\xac\x82uidity decreases and thus the addition of\nunsaturated lipids to the membrane is used to restore \xef\xac\x82uidity.\nHistorical constraints are the results of the evolutionary\nhistory of a taxon. Because of this, the same solution can be\nconverged upon but the differences in history will impart\ndifferences. To use a well-worn example, bird, bat, and\npterydactyl wings all arose independently through a different\nhistorical sequence and thus are not interchangeable in the\nway that two water molecules are.\nBoth formal and historical constraints place developmental\nconstraints on organisms. Ontogeny reveals evolution as a\ntinkerer.\n\nThe history of molecular genetics shows that sources of\nnovelty exploited by evolution are also of use to synthetic\nbiology. But what about the rest of evolution\xe2\x80\x99s toolkit, as\noutlined in Table 1? The \xef\xac\x81eld moves so quickly it would\nfoolhardy to pronounce a technique untested, so rather here I\npoint out areas that are currently not in widespread use to\nidentify the potential for new or expanded approaches.\nGenomic\nFor thousand of years, humans have bred living organisms.\nOver 16 millennia ago, dogs were domesticated, and cereal\ncrops followed within 5,000 years. This breeding took\nadvantage of natural genetic variation coupled with arti\xef\xac\x81cial\nselection. The arti\xef\xac\x81cial production of novel DNA sequences\ncame in 1926 when Muller discovered that X-rays could\ninduce mutations.(82) The introduction of foreign DNA into\ncells via transformation was demonstrated by Grif\xef\xac\x81th in 1928,\nbut it was not until Avery, MacLeod and McCarty(83) showed\nthat Grif\xef\xac\x81th\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98transforming principle\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 was DNA, did it become\nthe basis for modern molecular \xe2\x80\x93 and synthetic \xe2\x80\x93 biology. Viral\ntransfer via transduction was shown in 1951 by Lederberg and\nZinder.(84) Thus, by the early 1950s, the production of\nendogenous genomic novelty by the random production of\npoint mutations, gene loss and rearrangement, transduction,\nand exogenous production of genomic variability through the\nuse of environmental mutagens were known and in use.\nMany of the other possible genomic means of variation are\nutilized in some way, including gene and genome duplication,\naltered mutation rates, induction of autogamy, uptake of DNA\nfrom the environment, interspecies gene transfer, and\nparasexual gene transfer.

J. Rothschild\n\nthe cell by the introduction of plasmids and their subsequent\nincorporation into the genome is widely used, but not so the\ntransfer from an organelle or symbiont into a host cell, or its\ngenome. Some forms of gene transfer have the potential to\nradically alter the physiology of the host, e.g., when a\nthemophilic phosphoglycerate kinase was transferred to and\nexpressed in a mesophile (yeast).(85) Similarly, symbiosis is\nextremely widespread in nature, often including a protistan\npartner, but acquisition of novelty by that means has been\nignored by synthetic biology.\nA \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98next generation\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 approach at exploiting the function of\nmobile elements is the creation of an arti\xef\xac\x81cial retrotransposon.(86) Boeke\xe2\x80\x99s lab engineered an arti\xef\xac\x81cial form of the LINE-1\n(L1) elements, retrotransposons that comprise 30% of\nmammalian genomes by mass. Altering 24% of the gene\nsequence of the transcript without altering the protein\nsequence enhanced transposition rates 200-fold. This highly\nactive synthetic retrotransposon could have great use in\nmammalian genetics.\nRegulatory\nGene expression is the basis of cellular functioning. Synthetic\npromoter libraries (e.g.,(87)) provide the material to alter\ngene expression levels. Promoter strength and gene dosage,\nseparately and together have been use to control gene\nexpression levels.(88) Counting systems are an exciting new\ntype of synthetic construct that relies on regulatory\napproaches. Friedland and colleagues(89) exploited gene\nregulation that relies on the suf\xef\xac\x81cient synthesis of an inducer\nbefore the next gene is expressed. Nature\xe2\x80\x99s use of ncRNA in\ngene expression and development is only just being revealed,\nso its use in synthetic biology is still in its infancy.\nDevelopmental\nSynthetic biology has avoided developmental work probably\nbecause it has thus far focused at the cellular level.\nPhysical\nEncapsulation technology allows for compartmentalization,\nand its potential for gene(90) and drug(91) delivery is an exciting\nbiomimetic approach. Beyond encapsulation as a tool for\nmolecular techniques, over the last few years there have been\nseveral attempts at creating arti\xef\xac\x81cial organelles. An arti\xef\xac\x81cial\nvesicle was synthesized; bacteriorhodopsin, a light-driven\ntransmembrane proton pump, and F0F1-ATP synthase motor\nprotein were inserted, and the system was shown to generate\nATP(92) The vesicle was made of amphiphilic ABA triblock\n.\ncopolymers instead of lipids as the former self-assemble in\naqueous solution, typically form vesicles of less than 200-nm\ndiameter, and are harmless in cell culture.(93) Using a similar\n\nBioEssays 9999:1\xe2\x80\x9310, \xc3\x9f 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n\nReview essay\n\nABA triblock copolymer vesicle, Ben-Haim and coworkers(92)\nbuilt an arti\xef\xac\x81cial organelle prototype that was ingested by\nClass A macrophages, a key step toward integrating arti\xef\xac\x81cial\norganelles into cells.\nA different approach is to abandon the bilayer concept, and\ndesign a novel type of organelle. A functional prototype Golgi\norganelle has been created using digital micro\xef\xac\x82uidics,\nrecombinant enzyme technology, and magnetic nanoparticles.(94)\n\nConclusions and prospects\nAs Bromham(95) pointed out the need to put \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98the \xe2\x80\x98bio\xe2\x80\x99 into\nbioinformatics\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99, so too it is time to put the (evolutionary)\nbiology into synthetic biology.\nWhat evolution can do for synthetic biology\nSynthetic biology is beginning to exploit some of the more\nesoteric components of nature\xe2\x80\x99s toolkit.(96) As novel evolutionary mechanisms, such as ncRNA, become better understood in nature, they will be used to a greater extent since their\nadvantage of maintaining structural genes applies to synthetic\nsystems. Encapsulation technology will improve with nanotechnology. Others seem to be curiously ignored, such as\nduplication and diversi\xef\xac\x81cation. Non-Mendelian inheritance\nalso provides untapped riches, such as creating novel\nmembranes.\nBut the success of evolution relied on other principles that\nshould be embraced by synthetic biology. Evolution operates\non a population of individuals that vary in some heritable\nfashion and are historical entities. So why not create\nvariation around an engineered solution and let evolution\nlead the engineer to the optimal solution? For example, why\nnot engineer a template for a part, and let evolution search\nfor a better solution by exploring \xef\xac\x81tness space? Or use the\ntemplate as starting point for duplication and diversi\xef\xac\x81cation?\nPerhaps this could include genetic exchange among\nindividuals. The design of microbial consortia should be a\npowerful approach. Thus, instead of fearing evolution,\nsynthetic biologists will do well to learn and adopt where\nfruitful.\nWhat synthetic biology can do for evolution\nFor all evolution has taught synthetic biologists, the latter \xef\xac\x81eld\nhas the potential to answer three types of questions for\nevolutionary and astrobiologists.\nFirst, organisms and their components, from the gene up,\ndo not form a continuum of all possible combinations but\nrather occupy discrete pinnacles. At the organismal level,\nthese are recognized, more or less, as species. The\n\n7\n\nReview essay\n\nL. J. Rothschild\n\nAcknowledgments: I thank Victor de Lorenzo for his kind\ninvitation to contribute to the \xef\xac\x81eld, S. Pete Worden for making\nit possible, and John Cumbers for his infectious enthusiasm\nfor synthetic biology. The comments of an anonymous review\nand Andrew Moore greatly enhanced the manuscript.\n\nReferences\n\nFigure 2. Adaptive (fitness) space of individual organisms, species,\ngenes, or other biological structures. One way to illustrate this concept\nis to interpret the black areas as adaptive space that is empty, and\ncolored areas as space that is occupied. Alternatively, the black areas\ncould be interpreted as non-functional regions, while the colored\nareas range from marginally functional (purple) to optimal (red).\nSynthetic biology has the potential to test experimentally why a\nparticular unit is where it is in adaptive space, and how it could move\nto a different position. The biological world cannot reveal the answer\nsince its distribution in adaptive space is patchy.\n\nassumption is that species, and genes and genomes, are in\nadaptive peaks to optimize \xef\xac\x81tness (Fig. 2). But this\nPanglossian view is unlikely to be true unless evolution has\ntried all permutations. With the help of synthetic biology, there\nis the potential to alter each nucleotide in a transcript and then\nmeasure \xef\xac\x81tness, thus supporting one or more of these\nhypotheses. Maerkl and Quake(97) systematically substituted\namino acids in the \xef\xac\x81ve DNA-contacting residues of transcription factor Max. However, by exploring the total potential\ndiversity for only these \xef\xac\x81ve residues, several potential\namino acids were found to be functional in vitro, but did not\noccur in nature. Clearly not every residue occupies an\nadaptive peak.\nSecond, synthetic biology could play a parallel role in the\nsearch for life in Ref.(98) The range of life on earth is taken as a\nstarting point to de\xef\xac\x81ne a minimum envelope for life in the\nuniverse.(80\xe2\x80\x9381) Synthetic biology could produce new organisms with new heritable variation, which can be tested for\nsurvival in analog environments, thus extending the minimum\nenvelope where life can be found. For example, what about\nsynthesizing an alga that can use clouds as a niche?\nThird, it is likely that life will be created soon. Even then, it\nwill be impossible to prove that the arti\xef\xac\x81cial life replicated the\npathway primordial life form(s) followed on earth. But it may\nwell suggest one, or perhaps many, ways for life to originate\nand evolve. And then the proverbial ball will be back in the\nevolutionary biologists\xe2\x80\x99 court, back to the territory that is their\nprovince: Why?\n\n8\n\n1. Szybalski W, Skalka A. 1978.
