The\npast-stated need f o r s l a n t visual range (SVR)\ndata might be an example where great sums of\nmoney could have been spent t o produce unneeded\ndata using hazardous towers or non-eye-safe\nlasers\n\nWhatever the environmental a i r c r a f t f l i g h t\nsafety hazard, the DOD i s involved i n evaluating\nand improving the observation and forecasting of\nthe phenomena.

The Plan focuses on\nthe current system and improvements t h a t must\nbe made i n the immediate future t o meet the\nprojected needs and demands of aviation.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)\nissued the National Airspace System (NAS)\nPlan i n December 1981 to provide f o r systematic\ndevelopments t h a t insure the safe and e f f i c i e n t\nmovement of both c i v i l and military a i r c r a f t .\nThis plan was developed to meet the system\ncapacity requirements resulting from the i n creased growth expected by 1993 of:\n\nEfforts t o improve aviation weather services\ni n i t i a t e d a few years ago are integrated into\nt h i s plan. The program to improve the quality\nof weather information to p i l o t s , controllers\nand f l i g h t service station specialists f o r safe\nand expeditious operation of a i r c r a f t encompasses the following major programs:\n\n85% in domestic a i r c a r r i e r passenger miles\n\n231% i n commuter passenger miles\n67% i n the number of hours flown by\ngeneral aviation\n\n0\n0\n\n21\n\nAutomatic Weather Observation System (AWOS)\n\n0\n\nThe implementation of the NAS Plan will improve\nv i t a l safety services t o aviation. These services include collision avoidance, improved\n\nFlight Service Automation System (FSAS)\n\n0\n\n112% in the hours flown by rotary wing\naircraft.\n\nRadar Remote Weather Display System (RRWDS)\n\nCenter Weather Processor (CWP)/Center Weather\nService Uni t (CWSU)\n\nm\n\nNext Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD)\nDevelopment\n\nc i a l i s t s f o r n i l o t briefinas and dissemination\nt o oilots. A national weather data base (the\nAviation Weather Processor) containina United\nStates. Canadian. Mexican and Caribbean data\nwill be available f o r r a p i d access by 1985.\nDigitized weather radar data, digitized weather\ngraphics, a nationwide f i l e of p i l o t reports and\ndata from the surface weather reporting stations\nwill be availalbe t o the p i l o t on a timely\nbasis through the use of the FSAS and the h i g h speed digital communication lines from the\nNational Airspace Data Interchange Network\n(NADIN). Pilots will be able to obtain more\naccurate and up-to-date pre-flight briefings\nfrom the FSS s p e c i a l i s t with the elimination of\nthe manual "paper shuffling" tasks of sorting\nout only those data required f o r a particular\nf l i g h t . The automated f i l t e r i n g of these data\nwill be based on departure times, a l t i t u d e of\nf l i g h t and route of f l i g h t .\n\nWhile these a r e the major e f f o r t s , i t i s s i g n i ficant to note t h a t a t o t a l of 22 separate programs are affected t o some degree by the FAA\ncommitment to upgrade weather detection and\ndissemination. For example, the FAA plans t o\nreDlace its outdated a i r t r a f f i c control coms\nDuters and displays. A part of the new display consoles, severe weather will be presented\nto the controllers along with a i r c r a f t targets.\nWork s t i l l remains t o determine the best way t o\npresent the weather data and t o what degree the\ncenter meteorologist will interact with the\ndisplay. In any event, a l l of what I present\nhere, together with the weather element in the\nr e s t of the 22 programs, a l l have the purpose\nof serving the controller and the p i l o t w i t h\nessential and real-time weather information t h a t\nsupports both e f f i c i e n t and safe f l i g h t operations.\n\nI n i t i a l l y , Flight Service Data Processors will\nbe installed i n 14 of the 23 existing ARTCCs by\n1984, which, in t u r n , will drive remote equipment located a t 41 FSS s i t e s . Enhanced Flight\nService Data Processing Systems, which include\nimprovements on the aforementioned 14, will be\ninstalled a t the other nine ARTCCs, which will\ndrive remote equipment located a t a total of\n61 FSS s i t e s by 1988. To support these improved\nsystems , two Airport Weather Processors will be\ninstalled a t S a l t Lake City and Atlanta, respectively, t o process data f o r the t o t a l system.\nDetails of the operation of the FSAS are presented i n the a r t i c l e "Meteorological Impact on ATC\nSystem Design" by Frank E, Van Demark.\n\nRRWDS\nRadar Remote Weather Display Systems will be\nable t o access six (6) levels of precipitation\nintensity ( r e f l e c t i v i t y ) from 134 radars nationwide. B mid-1983, a l l 20 conterminous Air\ny\nRoute Traffic Control Centers (ARTCCs) - Center\nWeather Service Units (CWSUs) and 44 En route\nFlight Advisory Service (EFAS) positions will\nhave dedicated and dial-up rapid access t o these\nNational Weather Service (NWS) and FAA radars.\nData from these sources will provide six-level\ncolor weather contours displayed on CRTs and be\nused by the CWSU meteorologist and Flight Service\nStation (FSS) specialists. Data from the RRWDS\nwill be used primarily to develop CWSU advisor i e s t o controllers on location, intensity and\nmovement of hazardous convective weather and by\nthe EFAS specialists t o a l e r t p i l o t s t o the\nsame hazards.\n\nAutomated Weather Observation Systems (AWOS) are\nplanned f o r operational evaluation a t 15 a i r ports during 1983 and 1984. These evaluations\nare the culmination of a series of tests on\nobservation systems and/or weather sensors\nobtained from manufacturers which began i n 1975\nand ended i n July o f 1982. The AtlOS will have\nthe capability of measuring a range of surface\nweather parameters consisting of wind speed,\nwind direction and wind gusts, temperature,\naltimeter setting, v i s i b i l i t y and cloud height/\nceiling. The system includes automated data\nentry, data display, data recording, remote\nmaintenance monitoring and f a i l u r e reporting and\nboth voice and Very High Frequency CVHF) communications output.

I t will be the\ncentral system f o r collection and dissemination\nof weather information and located in each Air\nRoute Traffic Control Center. The CWP will\ncontain alphanumeric weather observations and\nforecasts, weather charts, radar weather data\nand weather s a t e l l i t e images.

The FAA objective i n\nt h i s program i s t o provide Doppler weather\nradar information on the location, measurement\nand movement of potentially hazardous convective\nweather and i t s attendant hazards to aviation.\nNEXRAD weather data products will include automated r e f l e c t i v i t y , radial velocity and spect r a l width maps, severe weather a l e r t s , hazardous weather contour maps and echo top maps and\na free text message on equipment status.\n\n0\n\nTo continue studies of wind shear, downbursts and microbursts through the Joint\nAirport Weather Studies (JAWS) program\nf o r application i n a i r c r a f t simulations\nand avionics c e r t i f i c a t i o n . Details on\nJ W under the direction of the National\nA S\nCenter for Atmospheric Research a r e in\nthe paper "The Joint Airqort Weather Studies\n\n*Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982\n23\n\nProject" by John McCarthy. N expect t h a t\ne\nthe knowledge gained by JWS will d i r e c t l y\na f f e c t both the NEXRAD and CWP Programs\nto insure t h a t the severe $-reatheri s\nadequately detected and the data properly\nprocessed.\n0\n\nTo improve the wind shear warning capability\nf o r pilots through c e r t i f i c a t i o n of airborne\nwind shear warning systems. The FAA has\nissued an advisory circular t h a t describes\nacceptable simulation t e s t c r i t e r i a , wind\nf i e l d modeling data and minimum performance\nparameters f o r evaluating candidate systems.\nThe airborne systems will complement the\nlow-level wind shear a l e r t systems (LLWSAS)\nt h a t are currently operational a t 58 airports\nand are scheduled f o r i n s t a l l a t i o n a t 51 more.\n\n0\n\nTo some extent, the VOR broadcast of AIJOS and\nweather radar data may be redundant. However,\nfour factors mitigate the question. First, not\na l l a i r c r a f t will have Mode S transponders and\nterminals f o r acquiring weather. Second, ins t a l l a t i o n plans f o r Mode S will c a l l f o r high\na l t i t u d e coverage and, a t some future time,\ncoverage t o 6,000 feet. This compares t o curOs\nrent coverage of V R t o the minimum en route\naltitude. T h i r d , broadcasting data by VOR does\nn o t appear t o cause a saturation problem in\nareas of severe weather although a voice prio r i t y interrupt will s t i l l be required. On the\nother hand, the Mode S data link may prove t o\nbecome quite saturated as the f u l l use of the\nlink for a i r t r a f f i c control becomes clearer.\nFinally , the airborne equipment required f o r\nreceiving ground weather radar data, i f designed t o anticipate the Mode S data link\nterminal , will contain common use equipment\nelements. Thes include the display, keyboard\nand microprocessor. In summary, w currently\ne\nexpect that these two methods of transmitting\nweather data to the p i l o t can be very compatible\n\nTo develop instrumentation t o detect and\nfollow wake vortices behind a i r c r a f t f o r\nuse in developing procedures t o reduce\nseparation standards between a i r c r a f t on\ntake-offs and landings in order t o\nincrease airport capacity.\n\n0\n\nring weather data w i l l be available. On a\nrequestlreply basis, rather than by broadcasting\nover the VOR, the p i l o t will be able to access\nthe weather data base, which resides i n the\nCWP. T h i s includes thunderstorm data.\n\nTo evaluate products required by the CWSU\nmeteorologist and develop the specificat i o n of the automated CWSU workstation by\nsupporting the N S Prototype Regional\nW\nObserving and Forecast System (PROFS) a t\nBoulder, Colorado. The intent of PROFS i s\nt o automate the analysis of inputs from\nautomated surface weather observations,\nDoppler and conventional radars, special\nmicrowave upper a i r wind measuring equipment, and visible and infrared s a t e l l i t e\ndata t o produce a variety of new weather\nproducts. See the paper "Prototype Regional Observation and Forecast System" by\nJohn Hinkelman, J r . , for a detailed description. Again, we expect t o see the\nresults of t h i s program support other FAA\nprograms, i n particular, the CWP and CWSU\nworkstation.\n\n0\n\n0\n\nTo improve the dissemination of weather\ninformation t o general aviation a i r c r a f t\nby demonstrating a low-cost technique f o r\ngetting weather radar data into the cockp i t . In a recent demonstration a t\nColumbus, Ohio, using the SWR 74C weather\nradar, a small ground-based microprocessor,\nthe Zanesville VHF Omni Directional Range\n(VOR) station and the Appleton and Rosewood\nVORs, an on-board microcomputer which i s\ninterfaced w i t h the VOR receiver and an\ninexpensive printer, weather radar precipitation intensity data were transmitted\ndirectly t o pilots within 50 - 75 miles of\nthe VOR. In addition, the data include the\nrelative location of nearby VORs mapped on\nthe printout. T h i s provides an orientation\nt o the p i l o t \' s present position t o permit\nhim t o plan changes, i f necessary, t o this\nroute.\n\nTo provide i n conjunction with the N S an\nW\nimproved Aviation Route Forecast (ARF)\ntechnique f o r presenting forecast and observed data f o r routes and areas. The ARF\nd a t a base will consist of forecast weather\ninformation a t grid points covering the\nentire U. S. Information a t each grid point\non cloud cover, v i s i b i l i t y , weather, convective a c t i v i t y , freezing level and icing and\nturbulence will be stored. When a route or\narea i s entered, the computer will retrieve\ndata from those grid points applicable t o\nthat particular route or area. The ARF\nsystem will have an input workstation f o r\nN S meteorologists and a software routine\nW\nf o r o u t p u t which i s planned f o r integration\ni n the FSAS.\n\nIn summary, Figure 1 i l l u s t r a t e s the future\nFAA aviation weather systems data sources.\nThe foregoing a r e active programs.
