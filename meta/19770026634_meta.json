Contracts in the earth resources field primarily directed toward applications of satellite data and technology in solution of state and regional problems were reviewed. A summary of the progress of each contract was given in order to share experiences of researchers across a seven state region. The region included Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and North Carolina. Research in several earth science disciplines included forestry, limnology, water resources, land use, geology, and mathematical modeling. The use of computers for establishment of information retrieval systems was also emphasized.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19770026634, "id": "0ea4a76e3c0149f4b32019a2f16e18bf", "publicationDate": "1977-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19770026634.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19770026634/downloads/19770026634.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19770026634/downloads/19770026634.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19770026634/downloads/19770026634.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
