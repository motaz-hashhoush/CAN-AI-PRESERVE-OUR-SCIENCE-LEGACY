A unique feature of this installation is that the 16 semi-cylindrical solar collectors (center photo on opposite page with closeup of a single collector below it) are not mounted atop the roof as is customary, they actually are the roof. This arrangement eliminates the usual trusses, corrugated decking and insulating concrete in roof construction; that, in turn, reduces overall building costs and makes the solar installation more attractive economically. The Reedy Creek collectors were designed and manufactured by AAI Corporation of Baltimore, Maryland.", "title": "Solar Energy Demonstrations", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-23T23:03:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20070019721, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20070019721, "id": "bd92a711677a4afb8c4464459a5e58c5", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1979", "publicationDate": "1979-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20070019711, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Spinoff 1979", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20070019721.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20070019721/downloads/20070019721.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20070019721/downloads/20070019721.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20070019721/downloads/20070019721.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
