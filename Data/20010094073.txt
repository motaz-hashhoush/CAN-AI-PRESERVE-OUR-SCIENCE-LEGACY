Commercial\nair\ntransportation\nwill again seek and rely on advanced\npropulsion solutions to meet this ever-increasing\npublic demand.\n\nNASA has been researching\nnew technology and\nsystem concepts to meet the requirements\nof\naeropropulsion\nfor 21 st Century aircraft. The air\ntransportation\nfor the new millennium will require\nrevolutionary\nsolutions to meet public demand for\nimproving safety, reliability, environmental\ncompatibility,\nand affordability.\nWhereas the turbine\nengine revolution\nwill continue during the next two\ndecades, several new revolutions\nare required to\nachieve the dream of an affordable, emissionless,\n\nAs we approach the centennial celebration of the\nWright Brothers\'\nFirst Flight, the challenge of the\nnew millennium\nis to develop and deliver innovative,\nrevolutionary\nsolutions to air transport that will meet\npublic demand. Safety, capacity, and environmental\nconcerns remain the theme, vision and challenge for\nNASA and our industry partners in the 21 _tCentury.\nWe need to travel faster and cheaper, while\nimproving the quality of travel and allowing\naviation to expand to meet public demand.\nThe\naeropropulsion\nsystems of the future will require\noperation over a wide range of flight regimes,\nwhile providing high levels of safety and reliability.\nThey will need to be much more energy efficient\nthroughout their flight envelope while keeping\nemissions of atmospheric\npollutants and noise to\nharmless levels. In addition, they will need to be\ninexpensive to develop, manufacture,\nand operate.\n\nand silent aircraft. This paper reviews the continuing\nturbine engine revolution\nand explores the propulsion\nsystem impact of future revolutions\nin propulsion\nconfiguration,\nfuel infrastructure,\nand alternate\nenergy systems. A number of promising concepts,\nranging from the ultra-high bypass intelligent engine\nto fuel cell-powered\ndistributed propulsion are also\nreviewed.\nIntroduction\nThe future world economy is envisioned to be truly\nglobal, where national boundaries become diffused\nby interdependent\ncommerce.\nThis vision of the\nfuture can only be realized if there is a revolutionary\nchange in transportation\nsystems, enabling greater\nmobility of people and products with improved\ntimeliness and convenience.\nPropulsion and power\ncapabilities\nare the foundation on which future\nsubsonic and supersonic transports will shape the\naviation landscape and establish this global conduit\nof commerce.\n\nAdvanced aeropropulsion\nsystems and computational\nresearch tools, as well as discrete technologies,\nwill be the major contributors\nto 21 _tCentury air\ntransportation\ninnovation.\nRevolutionary\npropulsion\nsystems will enable revolutionary\naircraft designs\nthat meet the need and demand of the future.\nAeropropulsion\n\nAircraft\n\nNASA proposes a phased aeropropulsion\nresearch\napproach triggered by thresholds of technology\nrevolutions\nand National needs to realize our vision\nfor 21 stCentury air transportation\n(Figure 1).

NPSS\n(Figure 3) focuses on the integration of multiple\ndisciplines such as thermodynamics,\naerodynamics,\nstructures, and heat transfer. It captures the concept\nof numerical zooming between 0-dimensional\nto 1-,\n2-, and 3-dimensional\nanalysis codes. The vision for\nNPSS is to create a "numerical test cell" enabling full\nengine simulations overnight on cost effective\ncomputing platforms.\nNumerical zooming between\nNPSS engine simulations and higher fidelity\nrepresentations\nof the engine components\n(fan,\ncompressor,\nburner, turbines, etc.) has already been\ndemonstrated.\nThis type of high fidelity system level\nanalysis will greatly improve the capability of the\nengine system simulation and increase the level and\nvalue of virtual tests conducted prior to committing\ndesigns to hardware.\nFuture physics-based\nmodeling\nwithin each engineering discipline along with the\nNPSS development\nwill enable conceptualization\nand utilization of the fundamental\nand adaptive\ntechnologies\nrequired for the next generation turbine\nengine and beyond.\nInlet and Nozzle: Inlet and nozzle technologies\nwill\nfocus on noise reduction and propulsion system\noperability impacts.\nFuture physics-based\nacoustic\nmodels coupled with advanced CFD analysis will\nenable designers to strategically contour inlet and\nnozzle geometries for maximum performance\nand\nacoustic shielding.\nThese advanced modeling\ntechniques will also allow designers to capitalize\non natural acoustic phenomena\n(such as ground\nreflection/dissipation\nof noise) to reduce the\nobservable noise footprint of future aircraft to less\nthan that of the surrounding community.\nEnhanced\nmixing technologies\n(such as chevrons and naturallyaspirating ejectors) will be optimized to passively\nreduce nozzle jet noise without sacrificing\nperformance.\nAdditional active noise suppression\n(such as pulsating acoustic liners) will also be\nemployed in future inlet and nozzle systems.\n\nUltra High Bypass\n\nThe adaptable technologies\nprincipally address\nthe challenges prompted by increasingly diverse\ntransport mission requirements\nand the economic\nneed for highly reusable/modifiable\npropulsion\nsystems.\n\nNASA/T\n\nFundamental\nTechnologies\nFundamental\nnew research and technology for the\nturbine engine will center around computational\nphysics modeling and virtual engine testing, acoustic\nmodeling and noise reduction technologies\nfocused\non inlet and nozzle components,\nalternative low\nemissions combustion processes and configurations,\nand intelligent engine operations for improved\nperformance\nand safety.\n\n3\n\nAdaptive Technologies\nAdaptive technologies\nfor turbine engines will center\non performance\nand operability, utilizing research in\nfluidics, structures and material system capabilities,\nand advanced variable cycle engine configurations.\nFundamental\nfluidic technology will enable "virtual"\naerodynamic\nshapes, providing inlet and nozzle area\ncontrol and peak compressor and turbine efficiency\noperation over a wide range of flight speeds.\nTrailing edge blowing and circulation control for\nturbomachinery\nwill provide virtual shape camber,\nimproving off-design loading and efficiency as\nwell as reducing wake-induced\nacoustics.\nSimilar\napplication\nof this technology to airfoil leading edges\nwill likewise contribute to virtual camber changes as\nwell as improving operability margins by reducing\naerodynamic\nstall of high-performance,\nsharp edges.\n\nFigure Numerical\n3\nPropulsion\nSystemimulation\nS\nof\na Large Commercial\n\nTurbofan\n\nEngine\n\nCombustion:\nNew combustion types and\nconfigurations\nwill enable low-emissions\noperations\nand variability throughout the flight regime. Future\ndetonation-wave\ncombustion\nprocesses combining\npressure rise with energy release promise greater\nthermal efficiency per unit weight compared to the\nconventional\ndeflagration\nprocesses.\nStructural\nintegrity and aerodynamic\nstability impacts from\nwave-combustors\nwill challenge future propulsion\nconfigurations.\nTo overcome these challenges, offaxis toroidal wave combustor configurations\nand\nwave-diffuser\ncentrifugal compressor configurations\nwill be employed.\nThese configurations\nisolate the\npulsed, unsteady wave effects from the surrounding\nengine components\nwhile shortening the axial length\nrequired for combustion.\nSensors\ncontrols\n\nHow Management:\nActive and passive redistribution\nof boundary layer flows within the engine will have a\nprofound adaptability\neffect on the overall propulsion\nperformance\nand weight by minimizing mechanical\nactuation and associated life and leakage losses. For\nexample, turbine flow area control through fluidics\nand active seals will enable re-optimization\nof the\nengine BPR between takeoff and cruise. This will\nreconcile design constraints for reduced takeoff\nemissions and improved cruise fuel-efficiency\nacross\nthe transport aircraft flight envelope.\nComputational\nmodeling will be extremely taxed for these designs\nto minimize the losses associated with low Reynolds\nnumber flows for fluidics. New propulsion\nconfiguration\nconcepts, employing reverse-flow\ncomponents\nor concentrically\nconfigured towpaths\nwill benefit most from fluidics, because of the short\nducting distance and natural radial migration of flow\nfrom the high-pressure\ncore outward. Advancements\nin ejector design methods will also contribute the\nfluidic engine adaptability\nby exploiting natural\naerodynamic\naspiration rather than active energydebit pumping of boundary layer control flow.\nAcoustical fluidic control of inlet and nozzle\n\nand Controls: Fundamental\nsensors and\nresearch will also transform recent successes\n\nin physics-based\nmultidisciplinary\nmodeling into\nreal-time propulsion health monitoring for improved\nsafety and reduced maintenance\ncosts. Advanced\ncomponent design techniques applied to material\nsystem design strategies will promote probabilistic\ndesign for performance\nand life. These same\ntechniques coupled with material-embedded\nnanosensors and evolving information-technology\ncapabilities (computational\nprocessing speed, data\nacquisition and dissemination,\netc.) will allow for\nreal-time engine diagnostics.\nThis will facilitate both\nhealth monitoring and performance\noptimization.\nDesigner material and fuel systems will function\nmore autonomously\nfrom the cockpit using\nbiologically inspired "intelligent engine" controls\nakin to the involuntary\nnervous system.

Through\ninfusion of innovative propulsion technologies\nthe\nlosses associated with each individual propulsion\nsystem thrust will be mitigated and the\nairframe/mission\nbenefits enabled by distributed\npropulsion will be fully realized. The most profitable\nresearch investment areas to mitigate these losses are\nthose technologies\nthat can only (or most fully) be\nrealized in the small scale (ie, flow/circulation\ncontrol through micro-turbines,\nfoil/air bearings,\nconcentric engines/core).\nThe most profitable\n\nNASA/TM--2001-211087\n\nDistributed\n\nExhaust\n\nThe category of Distributed Exhaust entails using a\ncentral engine powerplant with a ducted nozzle(s) for\nstrategic deployment\nof thrust on the aircraft (Figure\n5). Distributed\nexhaust configurations\nsuffer nozzle\nviscous losses in performance\nand will likely only\n"buy their way on" to aircraft systems exhibiting\nextreme sensitivity to low-speed lift and/or cruise\ndrag. Therefore, distributed exhaust systems will be\nbetter suited to supersonic cruise applications,\nwhere\nnoise-sizing\nfor takeoff field length and sustained\nsupersonic cruise drag are the most dominant and\nleast reconcilable\nconstraints.\nHigh aspect ratio nozzles for commercial\nsupersonic\ncruise vehicles promise both noise and nozzle weight\nreduction potential.\nThe projected sideline noise\nreduction using a wing trailing edge 2-D\nmixer/ejector\nnozzle with comparatively\nsmall\nexhaust height may be as much as 10dB (due to\nincreased ambient jet mixing, improved ejector\ninternal penetration and mixing, and increased\nliner attenuability\nresulting from naturally higher\nfrequencies\nand surface areas). In addition, the high\naspect ratio geometrically\nproduces a shorter nozzle\nfor an equal nozzle pressure ratio and provides the\npotential for shared structural loading with the wing.\nThis will culminate in as much as 50% equivalent\nnozzle weight reduction and propulsion related cruise\ndrag. Increased low-speed lift via wing trailing edge\nflap blowing and thrust vectoring will also be\nachieved through this configuration,\nand reduce the\nrequired takeoff field length and affording\ncommunity and approach noise reductions.\n\nLarge\n\nMax\nThrust\n\nsystems benefits are those that result from the\nairframe configurations\nthat are realized by these\npropulsion configurations\n(i.e. tailless propulsion\ncontrolled aircraft, noise mitigation, supersonic cruise\naircraft weight & drag reductions, etc.).\n\nFigure 5 High Aspect Ratio Nozzle\n\n6\n\nSeparate\nlift-nozzles\nforuse\nwithadaptable\nengine\ncycles Vertical/Short Offand\nin\nTake\nLanding\n(WSTOL)\ntransonic supersonic\nand\naircraft\nare\nanother\nformofdistributed\nexhaust.\nThese\nconfigurations utilize\nalso\nvectored ofthe\nthrust\nmain\nengineozzle, exhibit\nn\nand\nastrong\nsensitivity\nto\nweight toseparate ductingnd\n(due\nnozzle\na wide\nactuation\nvariability\nrequirements).\nHotgas\nreingestion noise rebarriers commercial\nand\na\ntothe\nviability\noftheseystems.\ns\nEmployment\nofadvanced\nejectorechnologies fluidics mitigate\nt\nand\nwill\nthese\nproblems.\nHigh-temperature\nshape-control\nPMC\nnozzletructures\ns\nwithembedded\nsensors\nand\nintelligent\ncontrols ill becoupled\nw\nwithadaptable\nlow-pressure technologies\nspool\ntoachieve\nminimum\nweight\nconfigurations safe\nand transition\nfrom\nvertical\ntoforward\nflight.\n\nimpacts their performance\nand cost.

The reduced\nsize allows practical, cost-effective\nthese advanced-material\nstructures.\n\nDistributed Engines\nThe category of Distributed Engines encompasses\ndecentralized\npropulsion systems and utilizes\nseparate smaller powerplants strategically deployed\nover the aircraft. Examples of this type of distributed\npropulsion might include small or mini engines\n(perhaps General Aviation sized) deployed across the\nwingspan, or micro-turbine\nengines (Figures 6 and 7)\nembedded in the aircraft surface for flow/circulation-\n\nmanufacturing\nof\nSuccess of the\n\nsmall and mini engine propulsion deployed laterally\nacross the wing is dependent on exploiting\ntechnologies\nthat are best realized in the reduced\nsized.\nMicro engines themselves can provide distributed\npropulsion and exhibit large thrust to weight\npotential.\nBecause of their size, low Reynolds\nnumber fluid effects, engine manufacturing\ntolerances and corresponding\nimpacts on seals\nand clearances, 3-D turbomachinery\nshapes, and\ncombustion efficiency are primary technical\nchallenges for these propulsion systems. Currently,\nparts at the micro-scale can only be produced in two\n\ncontrol and thrust. Severe performance\npenalties\nmanifest in mini-engine systems are principally due\nto boundary layer effects of the fluid being on the\nsame geometric scale as the propulsion system.

The\ncost associated with infrastructure\nchanges and the\nsustained use of legacy aviation systems logically\ndemands a transition period as new energy sources\nare introduced.\nHybrid propulsion systems will be\nrequired in order to meet the challenges of transition\nand timely introduction\nof fledgling new power\nsystems.\n\nRecent advances in fuel cell technology and electrical\ncomponent power densities, promoted by automotive\nand other transportation\nsectors, will eventually\ndisplace combustion-based\npropulsion in the aviation\nindustry. In summary, the 21 _tCentury will see\nan environmental-inspired\nrevolution in the\ntransportation\nsystem from hydrocarbon\ncombustion\npower to electric power. Possibly hydrogen fuel and\nhybrid combustion/electric\nsystems may bridge the\ntransitions.\nFuel Cells: Fuel cells are becoming a viable option\nfor small aircraft propulsion and APUs and hold\nfuture promise for large-scale commercial\naircraft\n(Figure 8). Doubling of fuel cell power densities can\nbe achieved in the next five years. This would make\nelectrically powered light general aviation aircraft\npossible with no performance\npenalties compared to\ntheir conventionally\npowered counterparts.\nSuch a\npower density would also make fuel cell APUs for\nlarger aircraft viable. A five-fold increase in fuel cell\npower density would enable electrically powered\nregional/commuter\nsize aircraft. A ten-fold increase\nwould enable electrically powered large commercial\npassenger aircraft. The benefits of fuel cell powered\naircraft are very low to zero emissions, simpler more\nreliable power and propulsion systems providing\nincreased safety and lower maintenance\ncosts; and\ngreatly reduced noise from the power generator\nportion of the propulsion systems. Water is the only\nemission from proton exchange membrane (PEM)\nfuel cells, and must be eliminated (ejected) or\naccumulated/stored\non the aircraft during flight\n(Figure 9).\n\nLow-carbon fuels and performance-enhancing\nor\nemissions-blocking\nadditives will also contribute to\nthe Turbine Engine Revolution.\nInsitu additives will\nlessen airport fuel infrastructure\nchanges and may be\nemployed strategically to meet mission needs (like\na biologically\ninspired adrenaline for peak power\npropulsion needs). Dual fuel hybrids, while yielding\nchemically more efficient systems, are a far less\nattractive alternative because of airport infrastructure\nburdens and increased engine-related\noperating costs.\nA global hydrogen consumption\nrate for future power\ndemands a practical, cost effective production rate.\nThis implies hydrogen production from water, using\na net-positive\n(and as yet undetermined)\nenergy\nmeans. Safety issues (whether real or perceived) will\nalso govern the production, distribution,\nand storage\nof hydrogen.\nComplexities\nassociated with hydrogen\n\nNASA/TM--2001-211087\n\nproduction and densification\ncompounded\nby safety\nissues will likely result in centralized "refineries".\nThese will be similar to present-day hydrocarbon\nfuel\nrefineries, despite the global availability\nof water.\nFurthermore,\nenergy storage and consumption\nby the\nmajority of the non-aviation\ntransportation\nindustry\n(e.g. automotive) will likely be from distributed\nelectricity rather than directly from hydrogen.\nThe\naviation transportation\nsegment is the only possible\nexception to the electric currency model. This is\ndue to large takeoff power requirements\nfavoring\nhydrogen combustion systems over fledgling\nelectrochemical\nsystems on a per weight basis.\nAirports may therefore require on-site handling\nof hydrogen.\nEarly acceptance of hydrogen at\ncontrolled-access\nairport facilities will also promote\nthe introduction\nof hybrid combustion/electric\npropulsion such as the gas-turbine/fuel-cell.\n\n9\n\n12\nRecently,\n\nSignificant\n\nTechnology\nthe\nFuel\n\nCells\n\nPropulsion\n\nare\nand\n\nInvestments\n\nnow\n\na Viable\n\nAPU\'s\n\nand\n\nScale\n\nin\n\nHave Rapidly\nState-Of-The-Art.\nOption\n\nhold\n\nfor\n\nFuture\n\nCommercial\n\nFuel\n\nCell\n\nAdvanced\n\nSmall\nPromise\n\nAircraft\nfor\n\n/\n\nLarge-\n\nAircraft\n\n......................................................\n\n/\n\n/\n\no\n\n\xc2\xb0m\n\n_-\n\nlO-Fold Increase in\nAlkaline Power density\n\n4\n\n7-Fold Increase in\nAutomotive\nPower\n\n/.._..7\n\n"-_\n\nml\n\n/\n\n(lOX SOA l.d\'e_,se)\n....................................................\n\nI.\n\n_\n\n2\n\nGemini\n\nApol|o\n\nS|mllle\n\nFuel\n\nCell\n\nBu_\n\n@\n\n0\n1960\n\n1970\n\n1980\n\n1990\n\nCalendar\n\nTowards Meeting\n\nFuel Cell Schematic\n\nfor Wing\n\nsmall enough and in sufficient quantity as to allow\nviable all-electric propulsion.\nThese devices will be\nintegrated within the aircraft, taking full advantage of\nstructural load sharing and dual-functioning\nsystems\n(e.g. distributed propulsion and controls).\nThese\nand other electrical components\n(such as hightemperature superconductors)\nwill benefit from the\never-improving\nelectronics industry in terms of their\ncapability and affordability.\nFurther\nsuperconductivity\nadvancements\nin the later 2 IS\'\n\nNASA/TM--2001-211087\n\nof the Art\n\nFuture Aircraft\n\nforward propulsion, and may be coupled with blown\nwing/flaps for high lift at takeoff.
