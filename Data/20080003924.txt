b'Additive Transforms Paint into Insulation\nOriginating Technology/NASA Contribution\n\nT\n\nhe heat generated by wind resistance and engine\nexhaust during the launch of a space shuttle is\npotentially damaging to the casings on the solid\nrocket boosters, which provide over two-thirds of the\ninitial thrust needed to propel the spacecraft into orbit.\nTo protect this important equipment, in the 1980s,\nengineers at Marshall Space Flight Center developed a\nspray-on insulating process that was applied to the boosters\xe2\x80\x99 forward assembly, systems tunnel covers, and aft skirt.\nThe process involved mixing nine chemicals into an adhesive, and then, acting quickly during a 5-hour window,\napplying the material. The materials were costly, and if\nthe application was interrupted or not completed within\nthe 5-hour window, the batch was lost. In addition to\nthis drawback, the strength of the material was difficult to\nregulate, so it often chipped off during flight and splashdown, when the reusable boosters are dropped into the\nsea. Adding to the downside, two of the nine ingredients\nwere harmful to the environment.\nThrough a Space Act Agreement in 1993, Marshall\npartnered with the United Technologies subsidiary,\nUSBI, of Huntsville, Alabama, to develop an alternative\nto the old insulating spray. Using Marshall-developed\nconvergent spray technology, they atomized epoxy and\ndifferent filler materials to create an environmentally\nfriendly ablative insulation material. The material,\nMarshall Convergent Coating-1 (MCC-1) consisted\nof 8-percent hollow spherical glass, 9-percent cork, and\n83-percent epoxy, materials that were mixed at the time\nof application, at the point of release from a spray gun,\nwhich eliminated the problem of batches being ruined\nfrom interruptions and delays. The insulating paint was\nfirst flight tested in 1996 on the STS-79 mission, and\nwas so successful that it has been employed on all subsequent shuttle flights, with virtually no observed missing\nor chipped paint on the spent boosters during post-flight\ninspections.\n72\t\n\nConsumer, Home, and Recreation \t\n\nPartnership\nDavid Page, founder of Tech Traders Inc., of Merritt\nIsland, Florida, wanted assistance developing coatings\nand paints that create a useful thermal reflectance.\nAfter reading an article in the local paper advertising\nNASA technical assistance available to small business, he\n\ncontacted Marshall\xe2\x80\x99s Technology Utilization Office, now\nthe Technology Transfer program office, a division of\nthat Center\xe2\x80\x99s Innovative Partnerships Program.\nThe folks at Marshall directed Page to Kennedy Space\nCenter, where he teamed up with a group of engineers\nfrom USBI who were developing a roof coating out\nof recycled car tires that would be applied using the\nMarshall-developed convergent spray technology. The\nhardest problem they faced was creating a low-cost, yet\nhighly effective, product that was safe and non-toxic. Page\nhad access to published NASA information regarding the\nheat-reflecting tile used on the space shuttle. He learned\nthat the coating on the tile does 98 percent of the work. It\nappeared that if he was able to incorporate this composition into the paint, then he had a solution that would be\nsafe, economical, and effective.\nPage had an open line of communication between\nthe engineers at Marshall and USBI. After a year of\ncollaboration as well as additional testing with Dr. Heinz\nPoppendiek of the San Diego-based Geoscience Ltd.,\na research and development firm specializing in heat\ntransfer, fluid flow, mass transfer, micro meteorology,\nbiophysics, engineering design, system fabrication,\nproduct evaluation, and the measurement of thermal,\nmechanical, and fluid properties, Page felt that he had a\nproduct ready for market.\n\nProduct Outcome\nInsuladd is a powder additive that can be mixed into\nordinary interior or exterior paint, making that paint act\nlike a layer of insulation. The company recommends two\ncoats for optimal protection. The material is also available\nin a pre-mixed form.\nThe secret behind Insuladd is the unique propriety\nprocess that applies a coating to the microscopic inert\t\ngas-filled ceramic microspheres that make up Insuladd.\nWhen the paint dries, these form the radiant heat barrier,\nInsuladd is an insulating paint additive that can be mixed with\nall interior and exterior paint.\n\nSpinoff 2007\n\nturning the ordinary house paint into heat-reflecting\t\nthermal paint. The insulating materials reduce heat\ntransfer by reflecting heat away from the painted surface\nby forming a heat-blocking radiant barrier on the surface\nthat is painted.\nAccording to Tech Traders, the product works with\nall types of paints and coatings and will not change the\ncoverage rate, application, or adhesion of the paint. It can\nbe used on walls, roofs, ceilings, air-conditioning ducts,\nsteam pipes and fittings, and is particularly well-suited for\nuse on metal buildings, cold storage facilities such as walkin coolers and freezers, and mobile or modular homes.\nIn addition to the target market of residential and\ncommercial buildings, customers have found a variety\nof other useful applications for this insulating additive.\nFor example, Purina Feeds uses the Insuladd E-Coat, an\ninsulating wall paint and roof paint that is a 100-percent\nacrylic product containing the ceramic paint additive,\nto paint feed storage silos to help prevent feed spoilage.\nThe poultry industry uses Insuladd to reduce the summer\nheat and winter cold effects on the climate of hatcheries. Samsung uses the ceramic paint additive on military\nvehicles, and Hyundai Corporation\xe2\x80\x99s shipbuilding division uses Insuladd on its ships.\nTech Traders has continued its connection to the aerospace community by recently providing Lockheed Martin\nCorporation with one of its thermal products for use on\nthe F-22 Raptor. The designers of the high-tech fighter\njet were able to use one of the insulating paints on the\noutside of an electrical switch box that was overheating\ndue to outside heat sources. v\n\nAccording to Tech Traders Inc., its insulating paint additive can make homes, businesses, warehouses, ships, and other\nstructures more energy efficient.\n\nInsuladd\xc2\xae is a registered trademark of The Insuladd Company.\n\nThe insulating materials reduce heat transfer by reflecting heat away from the painted surface by forming a heat-blocking radiant\nbarrier on the surface.\n\nSpinoff 2007\t\n\nConsumer, Home, and Recreation \t 73\n\n'
