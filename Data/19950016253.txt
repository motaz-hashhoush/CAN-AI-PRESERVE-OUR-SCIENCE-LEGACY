The following\nmass comparisons of solar-based power systems to laser-based power systems will detail application areas where a\nparticular power system is preferred.\nA laser beam power system consists of a beam generator and a beam receiver. For a ground- (Earth-) based laser\nsystem, the beam generator is a free-electron laser with controlling adaptive optics (ref. 1). The free-electron laser receives\nits electrical power from the grid. For a space-based laser system (SBLS) (refs. 2 and 3), the beam generator is an array of\nlaser diodes, e.g., GaAs, coupled to a PV array for electrical power. In both laser systems, the beam receiver is a PV array.\nThe PV cells in these receiver arrays are specially fabricated to efficiently convert the monochromatic laser light into\nelectricity for the user. Included are electrical and thermal management system ancillaries.\nThe solar-based power system consists of a PV array containing PV cells tuned to the Sun\'s spectrum. Again, appropriate power management subsystems are required as well as an appropriately sized energy storage subsystem.\nThe mass benefits of a laser system (ground- or space-based) over a competing solar-based system originate from two\ninherent, comparative aspects of the laser system: (1) elimination or reduction of energy storage requirements and\n(2) increased power from comparably sized power receivers or comparable power to decreased mass of power receivers.\nThe magnitude of the mass advantage is dependent not only on the subsystem and component performance assumptions but\nalso on the energy storage requirements of the solar-based power system.\nThe applications of interest are shown in figure 1. Here, the ground-based lasers will supply beam energy to a\nspacecraft\' s PV array in cislunar space or on the Moon. Space-based lasers will supply beam power to surface or nearsurface elements such as outposts, rovers, airplanes, and orbiting or flyby spacecraft.\nDiscounting the mass of the laser generator in a ground-based laser system, a laser-based power system may be less\nmassive than a solar-based system in cislunar space. However, the ground-based laser beam cannot effectively reach\nbeyond the Earth-Moon system. Space-based laser systems may be less massive than solar-based power systems at\napplication distances less than five astronomical units (AU) from the Sun.\n\nGROUND-BASED LASER SYS1EMS\nGround-based laser systems can provide power to many types of users that can be reached by the laser beam. It is\nbeyond the scope of this report to discuss all possible applications. However, electrical (lunar surface) power and electric\npropulsion (low-Earth orbit to geosynchronous orbit (LEO to GSO\xc2\xbb applications will be discussed which indicate the\nbreadth of applications.\n\nLunar Surface Power\nA laser beam power system can eliminate an energy storage requirement by illuminating a PV array during eclipse or\nshadow portion of a mission. For example, the power from a PV array on the Moon can be the same whether illuminated\nby the Sun or lasers. However, the laser scenario will permit continuous illumination. A PV array illuminated by the Sun\nwill experience two weeks of darkness. The concomitant requirement of energy storage greatly increases the mass which\nmust be landed on the surface of the Moon. Figure 2 shows the mass advantage of a ground-based laser system providing\nkilowatts to megawatts of power on the lunar surface (ref. 1). The mass of the laser system is less than that of the solarbased system (marked PV-RFC for photovoltaics-regenerative fuel cells) at the lower power levels (-50 kWe). Based on\nmass considerations, the laser system appears more attractive than a nuclear reactor system beyond the 100-kWe power\n\nlevel. At 1 MWe, the landed mass of a laser-based system is nominally ten times less than the solar-based system and at\nleast two times less than a nuclear system.\n\nLEO to GSO Tug\nA ground-based laser beam power system can provide a spacecraft with increased power with concomitant increased\nmission capability or performance options. Photovoltaic arrays illuminated by a laser beam can produce many times more\npower per unit area than solar-illuminated PV arrays. For example, a PV array may provide substantially more power to an\nelectric propulsion system if the PV array is illuminated by a laser beam. This propulsion system, whether solar or laser\nilluminated, can be used for orbit raising from LEO to GSO after insertion into a LEO with an appropriate chemical propulsion system.\nFigure 3 (ref. 1) shows the outbound and return transit times for one solar electric propulsion system scenario and two\nlaser electric propulsion system scenarios. All three scenarios were conceived to raise a large spacecraft from differentaltitude LEO\'s to GSO and back down to LEO. The assumptions shown in table I (ref. 1) result in laser electric propulsion\ntrip times shorter than solar electric propulsion trip times. These shorter trip times are a result of the higher power level\nachievable with a laser-illuminated PV array.\n\nSPACE-BASED LASER SYSTEMS (SBLS\' s)\nA ground-based laser system can provide high power and reduce the energy storage required, but only in cislunar\nspace. As shown in figure 4, the intensity of a ground-based laser\'s radiation at 0.5 AU from Earth (even at the 10-MW\nupper limit of the ground laser) is close to five orders of magnitude lower than solar intensity; therefore, expecting a mass\nbenefit from a ground-based laser system beyond cislunar space is unrealistic. Space-based laser systems should then be\nconsidered. Here, the laser beam is generated in space and is directed toward a receiver at the mission site, (see fig. 1).\nSuch a scenario may allow a Mars surface rover continuous roving capability without the need of a 12-br energy storage\nsystem. The same advantage would exist for a surface outpost or an airplane flying in the martian atmosphere. Also, an\nSBLS could provide power to a planet orbiter or flyby spacecraft, should it be shadowed from the Sun during portions of\nthe mission. In an attempt to quantify the mass advantage of an SBLS, a brief analysis (discussed below) was performed.\nThe magnitude of the mass savings of an SBLS over a solar-based power system will depend heavily on the\nperformance level assumed for the various technologies, the eclipse/shadow period, and the distance from the Sun. The\nSBLS consists of a laser generation portion (PV array, radiator, diode laser array and electrical power management) which\nmayor may not be displaced from the laser-to-electric conversion portion (PV array and electrical power management).\nThe solar-based system consists of a solar-ta-electric conversion portion (PV array and electrical power management) and a\nco-located energy storage portion with its electrical power management Both the SBLS and the solar-based systems\nanalyzed below can provide power to a load located in space (Space-ta-Space) or on the surface of a planet, a planet\' s\nsatellite, or an asteroid (Space-ta-Surface).\n\nSpace-to-Space\nFigures 5 and 6 show the impact energy storage requirements have on the specific power of solar-based systems and\nthe impact the energy storage has on the specific power comparisons between an SBLS and solar-based power system.\nTechnologies designated "maximum" (fig. 5) encompass near-term, higher-mass components while "minimum" technologies\n(fig. 6) include the far-term, lower-mass components for SBLS and solar-based systems. Table II lists the component mass\nassumptions used for the maximum and minimum mass analysis. As seen in figures 5 and 6, the energy storage requirements (defined here as the length of time the energy storage subsystem must supply power to a load) dictate crossover\npoints where laser-based technologies would have a higher specific power than solar-based technologies. The mass savings\nof an SBLS occurs at distances less than 5 AU for maximum and less than 3 AU for minimum mass technologies and then\nonly for the longer eclipse periods (-100 br of energy storage).\nThe mass advantage of an SBLS extends to applications ranging from Venus (0.4 AU) to Pluto (40 AU) if the\nimportant figure of merit is the mass at the user-site rather than total system mass. Figures 7 and 8 show the user-site\nspecific power comparison of an SBLS and a solar-based power system at various energy storage requirements. Data\npresented in figure 7 utilizes maximum mass assumptions shown in table II while figure 8 data utilizes minimum mass\n2\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n---~ -- --\n\n--\n\n--- .--\n\n-~-\n\nassumptions. Since a solar-based power system requires the total system to be placed on or near the user while the laserbased system requires only the PV array receiver and electrical power management subsystems be placed near the user, the\nspecific power advantage of an SBLS can be large. Figure 7 (maximum mass assumptions) shows that an SBLS is better\nthan or equal to a solar-based system when the solar-based system requires energy storage. For the minimum mass\nassumption (fig. 8), the SBLS always shows an advantage over a solar-based system whether energy storage is needed.\n\nSpace-to-Surface\nFor surface or near-surface applications, Mars was chosen for analysis. A laser beaming down through the martian\natmosphere was assumed to be attenuated in a manner similar to sunlight The metric of intensity loss is optical density.\nFigures 9 and 10 show the specific power comparisons of an SBLS and solar-based power system as a function of atmospheric attenuation. Again, maximum and minimum assumptions are used as shown in table II. In both figures , the mass\nadvantage of an SBLS occurs only when large amounts of energy storage (-100 hr) are required in the solar-based power\nsystem and the optical density is less than 1 or 2. At an energy storage requirement of 10 hr (close to the 12-hr night\nperiod of the martian surface), an SBLS cannot match the specific power of a solar-based power system.\nHowever, the solar-based power system will require the complete system to be placed near or on the load, whereas the\nSBLS will only require the laser-to-electric conversion portion (Plus the electrical power management subsystem) of the\npower system to be placed on or near the load. For example, a solar-based power system delivering continuous power (with\na 12-hr eclipse) to a surface rover during a minor dust storm (optical density of 0.7) can have an on-board specific power\nas high as 10 W/kg. An SBLS could provide the same continuous power with an on-board rover power system at\n480 W/kg. These values were calculated using assumptions for minimum technologies shown in table II. Using maximum\ntechnologies shown in table II gives a solar-based system an on-board, specific power of 1.6 W/kg while an SBLS has an\non-board., specific power of 10 W/kg. Therefore, for a martian rover with a continuous roving requirement, a power system\nbased on laser beam power could be at least six times lighter than a solar-based power system (10 W/kg versus 1.6 W/kg).\nAn airplane flying above the martian atmosphere could also benefit from an SBLS. In this case, the optical density\nwill be zero and the eclipse period will remain at 12 hr. Using minimum assumptions shown in table II gives a solar-based\nsystem an on-board specific power of 12 W/kg while an SBLS has an on-board specific power of 480 W/kg. Using\nmaximum assumptions shown in table II gives the SBLS a specific power of 10 W/kg while the solar-based power system\nhas a specific power of 1.7 W/kg. As with the rover, there is a six-times mass advantage for the SBLS. This reduction in\nthe rover and airplane mass with a concomitant reduction in PV array area at the user site caused by higher incident\nintensity will permit more science (e.g., real-time video) and will facilitate pointing and maneuvering. If the load was a\nspacecraft operating above the atmosphere with a PV array sized for solar-based power, application of laser beam power\nmay facilitate orbit changes requiring power levels beyond solar-based capabilities.\n\nAPPLICATION SUMMARY\nThe summary of analysis results is presented in table ill. As can be seen, the benefits of laser beam power over solarbased power system technologies do exist The benefits, whether time or specific power, are very dependent upon needs\nthat drive the mission and maturity of the technologies used in analysis.\nAs seen in table ill, there are reductions in trip times for spacecraft traveling between LEO and GSO for groundbased laser systems for cislunar space applications. A substantial mass savings can be realized for lunar surface systems.\nSpace-based laser systems may have a system mass benefit as well as a mass benefit at the user-site for applications\nnear Mercury, Venus, Earth, or Mars. Beyond Mars, the mass advantage of the SBLS occurs only when the user-site mass\nis a major consideration. The mass advantage of an SBLS for Mars applications is shown in table III for rovers and airplanes. However, the advantage of an SBLS is at atmospheric optical densities less than 2, i.e., small or no dust storms. At\noptical densities greater than 2, the mass advantage of the SBLS disappears for total system mass figure of merits and is\ncompromised for user-site figure of merits.\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nAlthough they cannot effectively reach beyond cislunar space, ground-based laser systems may substantially increase\nthe power and/or propulsion performance in cislunar space. Space-based laser systems may reduce mass by providing an\n\n3\n\nL\n\neclipse period and provide power without the need for energy storage. This may cause a reduction in user-site mass or an\nincrease in payload capabilities by providing for a high specific power receiver on a spacecraft or on surface elements.\nOnce the "giggle" factor is overcome, the advantages of laser beam power comes into focus. Wireless power transmission\nvia laser beam power can provide power to remote sites shaded from the Sun or sites where the size and mass of conventional solar-based systems are limited. Wireless transmission may find applications where continuous high power is desired\nwithout resorting to nuclear technology.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.

ABSTRACT (Maximum 200 words)\n\nA space power system based on laser beam power is sized to reduce mass, increase operational capabilities, and reduce\ncomplexity. The advantages of laser systems over solar-based systems are compared as a function of application. Power\nproduced from the conversion of a laser beam that has been generated on the Earth\'s surface and beamed into cislunar\nspace resulted in decreased round-trip time for Earth satellite electric propulsion tugs and a substantial landed mass\nsavings for a lunar surface mission. The mass of a space-based laser system (generator in space and receiver near user)\nthat beams down to an extraterrestrial airplane, orbiting spacecraft, surface outpost, or rover is calculated and compared\nto a solar-based system. In general, the advantage of low mass for these space-based laser systems is limited to high\nsolar eclipse time missions at distances inside Jupiter. The power system mass is less in a continuously moving Mars\nrover or surface outpost using space-based laser technology than in a comparable solar-based power system, but only\nduring dust storm conditions. Even at large distances for the Sun, the user-site portion of a space-based laser power\nsystem (e.g., the laser receiver component) is substantially less massive than a solar-based system with requisite\non-board electrochemical energy storage.\n\n15.
