Wave height and direction, ice distribution, surface wind speed and direction, ocean-surface temperature, and atmospheric water content will be monitored by the satellite. Imaging radar, microwave scatterometer, microwave radiometer and visual and infrared radiometer experiments are included in the Seasat-A observing program. Two types of orbits have been developed: a near-repeat cycle of three days, and a near-repeat cycle of 25 days. Both orbit types offer fine coverage (18.5 km crossing separations) of the earth. Synthetic aperture radar data on computer-compatible tapes and geophysical data records available through the Seasat-A mission are described.", "title": "Seasat-A opens new phase in earth observations", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-09T10:47:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19780054614, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Cutting, E."}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Pasadena, CA, United States"}}, "id": "0e18c8f55ecf4a809e1583fe290a8306"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19780054614, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Pounder, W."}, "organization": {"name": "California Institute of Technology, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena", "location": "Calif., United States"}}, "id": "de0b3cf5006248ffbb443c80dc3abae3"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19780054614, "publications": [{"volume": "16", "submissionId": 19780054614, "id": "61e6d26add83432d8a2b382980b2b5b3", "publicationName": "Astronautics and Aeronautics", "publicationDate": "1978-06-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
