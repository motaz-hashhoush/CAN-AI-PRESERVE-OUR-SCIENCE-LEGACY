Jones\nLangley Research Center\nSUMMARY\nAn exploratory investigation was made of a wake disruption technique for studying\nthe hypersonic-wake reestablishment time in a blowdown wind tunnel. In this technique,\na highly underexpanded jet issuing from the base of a 10\xc2\xb0 half-angle cone totally disrupts\nand displaces the conventional wake. The jet was rapidly shut off by an explosively actuated valve and the time for wake reestablishment was measured. The tests were conducted in the Mach 6 high Reynolds number tunnel at the Langley Research Center at a\nstagnation temperature of 506 K and stagnation pressure of 2.86 MPa. The model base\njet stagnation pressure was 3.55 MPa at room temperature.\nHigh-speed schlieren motion pictures indicated that disappearance of the disrupting\njet and reestablishment of the wake-recompression shock were probably occurring simultaneously and that the time from disruptive-jet-air shutoff to wake recompression shock\nreestablishment was probably between 200 and 450 /j.sec (flow lengths from 1.8 to 4.2).\nThe values of flow lengths are about one-third to one-half the values measured in impulse\nfacilities in a previous study. This shorter time is believed to be largely due to the difference in flow conditions between the jet disruption technique and impulse facilities.\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe time for the establishment of a hypersonic wake is important in reentry vehicle\ndiscrimination as well as in the operation of short-run-time impulse facilities to insure\nthat the flow field is fully developed within the test time. Usually the wake formation time\nis measured in impulse facilities by rapidly initiating the flow over the model. Some\nrecent measurements of this type made in a shock tunnel are discussed in reference 1.\nThis paper discusses results obtained in exploratory tests using a wake disruption\ntechnique to study wake reestablishment times in a blowdown wind tunnel. In this technique, a jet expanding from the base of the model totally displaces the conventional wake.\nThe jet is rapidly shut off using an explosively actuated valve and the time for the conventional wake to reestablish is determined from high-speed schlieren motion pictures.\n\nAttempts were also made to determine the time required for the wake recirculation zone\ntemperature, model base pressure, and model base heat transfer to recover to the undisturbed values.\nSYMBOLS\nA\n\narea of model base\n\nD\n\ndiameter of model base\n\ng\n\ngravitational constant (Ig = 9.8 m/sec^)\n\nI\n\nlength of model\n\np,\n\nmodel base pressure\n\np,\n\nstagnation pressure\n\nRe D\n\nPeU D\nReynolds number at boundary-layer edge based on diameter, \xe2\x80\x94 e\n\n?\n\nr^oo\nU\n\nROO D\n\nfree-stream Reynolds number based on diameter,\n\n\'\n\nstagnation temperature\n\nt\n\ntime\n\nU\n\nvelocity\n\njj.\n\nviscosity\n\np\n\nPoo oo\n\n\xc2\xb0\xc2\xb0 \xc2\xb0\xc2\xb0\n\n^00\n\nTt\n\n.\n\ndensity\n\nSubscripts:\ne\n\nvalue at outer edge of boundary layer\n\noo\n\nfree stream\n\nD\n\nAPPARATUS AND TESTS\nWind Tunnel\nThe tests were conducted in the Mach 6 high Reynolds number tunnel at the Langley\nResearch Center. This facility is a blowdown wind tunnel with a contoured axisymmetric\nnozzle and a test section 30.48 cm in diameter (ref. 2).\nModel and Instrumentation\nPhotographs of the model are shown in figure 1. The model, a 10\xc2\xb0 half-angle cone,\nwas mounted on an insertion mechanism and injected into the airstream after hypersonic\nflow was established. Contour blocks and an O-ring seal on the mounting plate provided\na contoured, sealed test chamber when the model was inserted.\nFigure 2 shows a drawing of the model. The model was constructed of stainless\nsteel and machined internally to provide a plenum chamber for a small nozzle located in\nthe base of the model. The nozzle had a 30\xc2\xb0 diverging section. Small replaceable aluminum inserts with a conical converging section were fitted into the base plate and formed\nthe upstream portion of the nozzle. The aluminum inserts were also the seat for the\nexplosively actuated valve. The throat length and diverging portion of the inserts were\nconstructed in accordance with reference 3, so that the base nozzle also acted as a critical flowmeter for measuring the mass injected .into the model wake. An explosively\nactuated valve was mounted on the model base plate upstream of the nozzle. The valve\nwas fired.electrically and was used to rapidly shut off the flow of air through the nozzle.\nThe model base also has provisions for mounting rapid-response pressure gages, and thinfilm heat-transfer gages flush with the base. A conventional pressure orifice was located\non the model base for recording the steady-state model base pressure. Instrumentation\nleads were brought out through passages in the strut; passages were also used to pressurize the model. Figure 3 is a schematic diagram of the model air-supply system and\nfigure 4 is a schematic diagram of a typical instrumentation hookup.\nThe pressure transducer was the most sensitive piezotronic gage commercially\navailable with adequate response time. The gage had a sensitivity of 7.25 /J.V/Pa, which\nwas required to measure the base pressure change, and a rise time of 2 jiisec. A thinfilm heat sensor with a fisec response time was used to measure the heat transfer. A\nfine-wire resistance thermometer with a sensor diameter of 0.000508 cm and l/D of\nabout 100 was used to measure the change in wake temperature with time. The response\ntime of the resistance thermometer was about 1 msec. Data were recorded by photographing the screens of the dual-beam oscilloscopes. Schlieren photographs were taken\nwith a high-speed motion-picture camera at frame rates of approximately 4500 per second.\n\nTEST CONDITIONS AND METHODS\n\nTests were conducted at a wind-tunnel stagnation pressure of 2.86 MPa and stagnation temperature of 506 K, which gave a free-stream Reynolds number per meter of\n2.74 x 1()6. At these conditions, a fully turbulent boundary layer was established about\n20.32 cm from the model nose. The model plenum conditions were a stagnation pressure\nof 3.55 MPa at room temperature.\nAfter hypersonic flow had been established in the wind tunnel, the model was injected\ninto the airstream and the model plenum pressure adjusted to 3.55 MPa. The high-speed\nschlieren cameras were then started and, after the cameras reached operating speed, the\nexplosively actuated valve was detonated thus stopping the flow of air to the model base\njet, and also triggering the oscilloscope sweep circuits. Typical photographs of the model\nwake for the jet on-and-off conditions are shown in figure 5. The base of the cone just\nprotrudes into the picture on the right side.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nInitial tests had indicated that a measurable base-pressure change between jet on\nand off existed at a model plenum pressure of 3.55 MPa. At this model pressure, the jet\nfrom the model base is highly expanded and the conventional wake has been totally disrupted (fig. 5(b)). The mass flow of the jet is about twice the model boundary-layer mass\nflow at the cone base and about 7.5 percent of pUA. This mass injection rate is much\nlarger than the rates used in the typical cone base injection studies of references 4 and 5.\nAt a jet-stagnation pressure of 3.55 MPa, the cone base pressure has increased to about\n400 Pa .with the jet on from 200 Pa with the jet off. This is a ratio of jet total pressure to\nbase pressure of about 8875. Measurements of wake formation time were obtained with\nthe high-speed schlieren photographs and the fine-wire resistance thermometers. However, base pressure and heat transfer measurements were unsuccessful due to the high\nshock loading of the pressure gage, which occurred when the explosively actuated valve\nimpacted on the valve seat, and to the very low level and small change of base heat\ntransfer.\nHigh-Speed Motion-Picture Schlieren Photographs\nThe quality of the schlieren photographs was only moderate, due to optical imperfections in the tunnel windows and the low pressure of the undisturbed wake (about 200 Pa\nabsolute). The schlieren knife edge was mounted vertically to minimize the window distortions. The main features of the base jet were apparent, but the recirculation zone was\nnot distinct although the formation of the wake recompression shock could be detected.\nThe wake structure in the schlieren photographs of figure 6 is not as distinct as in the\n\noriginal 16-mm negatives even though the photographs have been enhanced by a special\nunsharp dodging technique developed by Leonard Weinstein of Langley Research Center.\nA sequence of schlieren photographs of the wake taken at approximately 4500 frames\nper second is shown in figure 6. At this frame rate, each frame is exposed about 75 fzsec\nand a 150-jusec interval occurs between frames. Consequently, an uncertainty in time\nexists for events which occur between frames and toward the end of the exposure time.\nAs can be seen in figure 6, a slight change in the jet structure near the model base\nhas occurred at t \xc2\xbb 225 fisec; air shutoff was probably nearing completion at this time.\nAt t ~ 450 jisec, the jet structure forward of the Mach disk has disappeared and at\nt = 675 jisec, the wake recompression shock is apparent. Little change occurred after\nt = 675 jusec. Jet disappearance and wake reestablishment probably are occurring simultaneously between t = 450 and 675 jisec and the total time for jet disappearance and wake\nrecompression shock reestablishment is about 450 j^tsec.\nAdditional schlieren photographs (not shown) were taken at 4000 frames per second\nwith probes in the wake and with a larger jet-throat diameter. At these conditions, jet\ndisappearance and wake reestablishment required about 500 fisec. This time is nearly\nthe same as the time without wake blockage.\nThe wake recompression shock always appeared within one motion-picture frame\nand consequently the time for jet disappearance and wake reestablishment is not known\nwithin 225 jusec. In addition, static b\'ench tests indicated that the finite time required for\ndisruptive jet air shutoff might introduce an additional uncertainty of about 150 /usec.\nHowever, in the sequence shown in figure 6, air shutoff appears to occur very near\nt = 225 /Ltsec and is rapid compared to the jet disappearance time as indicated by the\ninitial change in jet structure near the model base. A more gradual air shutoff would be\nindicated by the movement of the Mach disk toward the base of the model as the jet pressure ratio decreased. Both the relatively slow camera framing rate and the air shutoff\ntime tend to make the indicated time for wake reestablishment longer than the true value.\nConsidering these uncertainties, it is estimated that the wake reestablishment time is\nbetween 200 and 450 j^sec.\nWake Recirculation Zone Temperature\nSeveral tests were made with a 0.0002-in-diameter resistance thermometer and\npressure gage in the model wake. The thermometer was mounted 1.59 cm from the model\nbase at the midpoint of the base radius. The installation of both probes increased the base\npressure and caused a more complicated shock structure in the wake. An oscilloscope\nrecord of this probe is shown in figure 7. The upper trace is the thermometer and the\nlower trace is the make-wire circuit located on the valve seat. Valve seating is indicated\nby the sharp rise in the lower trace. The change in probe temperature is nearly complete\n\nabout 1200 /j.sec after valve seating. Since this time is very close to the wire response\ntime, it only sets an upper limit on the temperature reestablishment time which may be\nmuch smaller. During tests with only the resistance thermometers mounted in the wake,\nthe change in wake temperature was so small that a time measurement was impossible.\nModel Base Pressure and Heat Transfer\nDetermination of the wake formation time from the change in base pressure was\nunsuccessful due to the very high shock loading of the gage (about 2000g) caused by the\nimpact of the explosively actuated valve on the aluminum valve seat. A number of techniques including shock mounting, electronic filtering, and probe mounting of the gage were\ntried in an effort to eliminate the shock loading, but were unsuccessful.\nThe measurement of a base heat-transfer stabilization time with the thin-film gage\nwas also unsuccessful. This was due to the very low level of base heat transfer and the\nsmall change in heat transfer between the jet on-and-off condition, which was obscured by\nnoise at the high amplification settings required to obtain a measurable signal. A number\nof unsuccessful filtering techniques were also tried with this circuit.\nComparison With Impulse Facility Data\nThe table below shows wake formation times measured in several impulse facilities\nand the wake reestablishment times of the present tests.\ntU/D for Reference\n\nTurbulent\nLaminar\nboundary layer boundary layer\n\n1\n\n30\n\nType\nmeasurement\nPressure\n\nRej)\nType facility\nShock tunnel\n\nType model\n\nTurbulent\nboundary layer\n\nSphere\n\nfor -\n\nLaminar\nboundary layer\n\nKD)\n\n0.16 to 9 x 106\n6\n\n10\n\n15 to 20\n\nSchlieren\n\nShock tube\n\nHemisphere cylinder\n\n1.11 x 106\n5\n\n7\n\n7.6\n\nSchlieren\n\nShock tube\n\nHemisphere cylinder\n\n9.85 x 10\n\nPresent\n\n1.8 to 4.2\n\nSchlieren\n\nJet disruption in\nblowdown tunnel\n\nSharp cone\n\n1.85 x 106\n\n4.4 x 106\n\nThe values of tU/D for wake reestablishment after jet disruption are about onethird to one-half the values for wake formation in impulse facilities. The shorter time\nfor wake reestablishment is believed largely due to the difference in flow conditions. In\nimpulse facilities, the wake is established from a quiescent condition and the entire flow\nfield must be established; whereas in the jet disruption technique, the external flow field\nis near its established condition and only the disrupted flow must be reestablished. The\neffect of the difference in model geometry (i.e., a cone in the present tests as compared\nto a hemisphere cylinder in refs. 6 and 7) may also account for a part of the difference.\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nAn exploratory investigation was made of a wake disruption technique for studying\nthe hypersonic-wake formation time in a blowdown wind tunnel. In this technique a highly\nunderexpanded jet issuing from the base of a 10\xc2\xb0 half-angle cone totally disrupts and displaces the conventional wake. The jet was rapidly shut off by an explosively actuated\nvalve and the time for wake reestablishment was measured. The tests were conducted in\nthe Mach 6 high Reynolds number tunnel at the Langley Research Center at a stagnation\ntemperature of 506 K and stagnation pressure of 2.86 MPa. The model base jet-stagnation\npressure was 3.55 MPa at room stagnation temperature. The following initial results\nbased on a small number of data points were obtained.\nHigh-speed schlieren motion pictures indicated that disappearance of the disrupting\njet and reestablishment of the wake-recompression shock were probably occurring simultaneously and that the time from disruptive-jet-air shutoff to wake recompression shock\nreestablishment was between 200 and 450. jj.sec (flow lengths from 1.8 to 4.2). These values of flow lengths are about one-third to one-half the values measured in impulse facilities in a previous study. This shorter time is believed to be largely due to the difference\nin flow conditions between the jet disruption technique and impulse facilities.\nLangley Research Center,\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration,\nHampton, Va., February 19, 1974.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.
