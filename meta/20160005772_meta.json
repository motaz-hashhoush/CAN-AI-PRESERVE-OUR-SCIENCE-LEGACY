At NASA's Kennedy Space Center (KSC), this collaboration opens competitive opportunities for launch providers, including repurposing underutilized Shuttle Program resources, constructing new facilities, and utilizing center services and laboratories. The resulting multi-user spaceport fosters diverse activity, though it engenders risk from hazards associated with various spaceflight processing activities. The KSC Safety & Mission Assurance (S&MA) Directorate, in coordination with the center's Spaceport Integration and Center Planning & Development organizations, has developed a novel approach to protect NASA's workforce, critical assets, and the public from hazardous, space-related activity associated with KSC's multi-user spaceport. For NASA KSC S&MA, the transformation to a multi-user spaceport required implementing methods to foster safe and successful commercial activity while resolving challenges involving: Retirement of the Space Shuttle program; Co-location of multiple NASA programs; Relationships between the NASA programs; Complex relationships between NASA programs and commercial partner operations in exclusive-use facilities; Complex relationships between NASA programs and commercial partner operations in shared-use facilities. NASA KSC S&MA challenges were met with long-term planning and solutions involving cooperation with the Spaceport Integration and Services Directorate. This directorate is responsible for managing active commercial partnerships with customer advocacy and services management, providing a dedicated and consistent level of support to a wide array of commercial operations. This paper explores these solutions, their relevance to the current commercial space industry, and the challenges that continue to drive improvement with a focus on areas of safety management and risk assessment that have been crucial in KSC's evolution into a multi-user spaceport. These solutions may be useful to government entities and private companies looking to partner with the commercial space industry.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20160005772, "endDate": "2016-05-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "National Space Development Agency", "location": "Tokyo, Japan"}}, "meetingId": "e26bf04b849a41b68bbb81eea374355d", "id": "17b5bcb7773a4de495080f8397951efd"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Canadian Space Agency", "location": "Ottawa, Ontario, Canada"}}, "meetingId": "e26bf04b849a41b68bbb81eea374355d", "id": "dd3cbda1d0b14ace9fcd2a04a5392de0"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "International Association for the Advancement of Space Safety", "location": "Noordwijk, Netherlands"}}, "meetingId": "e26bf04b849a41b68bbb81eea374355d", "id": "8c6b5909e7824fd99381a1191d53a014"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "NASA Headquarters", "location": "Washington, DC, United States"}}, "meetingId": "e26bf04b849a41b68bbb81eea374355d", "id": "86064fc3683d4de2b9d1f82ca1d73a5d"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "European Space Agency", "location": "Cologne, Germany"}}, "meetingId": "e26bf04b849a41b68bbb81eea374355d", "id": "bdfca437b634492491fbdf2c14824ea8"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "International Space Safety Foundation", "location": "Noordwijk, Netherlands"}}, "meetingId": "e26bf04b849a41b68bbb81eea374355d", "id": "10590d7ad47a49efbd48c92102456fb1"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales", "location": "Aire-sur-l'Adour, France"}}, "meetingId": "e26bf04b849a41b68bbb81eea374355d", "id": "0c0720cb6db2439e96345fb70d6ebe5c"}], "name": "IAASS Conference 2016", "location": "Melbourne, FL", "id": "e26bf04b849a41b68bbb81eea374355d", "startDate": "2016-05-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20160005772, "id": "63bf669a9e61463f885cd90a6242d18d", "publicationDate": "2016-05-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20160006516, "type": "SEE_ALSO", "title": "Managing a Safe and Successful Multi-User Spaceport", "stiType": "PRESENTATION", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20160005772.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20160005772/downloads/20160005772.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20160005772/downloads/20160005772.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20160005772/downloads/20160005772.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
