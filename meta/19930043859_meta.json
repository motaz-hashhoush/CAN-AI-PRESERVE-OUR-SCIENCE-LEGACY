Attention is given not only to the present status and past history of Mars, and also to Mars as one member of the class of terrestrial planets and as one product of the evolution from the primordial accretion disk. The issue of the origin and evolution of Mars' inventory of volatile elements is treated in detail, as are the SNC meteorites, both for what these putative Martian samples indicate about volatile distributions and because of their profound impact on assessments on bulk chemical composition and the chronology of planetary differentiation and late-stage volcanism. Overviews of the major problems arising from multidisciplinary investigations of the planet are also presented.", "title": "Major issues and outstanding questions", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-16T00:31:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19930043859, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Pepin, Robert O."}, "organization": {"name": "Minnesota Univ.", "location": "Minneapolis, United States"}}, "id": "c973328bb59e43e2a865da7400a760ce"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19930043859, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Carr, Michael H."}, "organization": {"name": "USGS", "location": "Menlo Park, CA, United States"}}, "id": "9e6f6a7bea244a8eaa8645429638f2e3"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Proceedings", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19930043859, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19930043859, "publisher": "University of Arizona Press", "id": "068fc5ec049b4162980ac05496f8b595", "publicationName": "In: Mars (A93-27852 09-91)", "publicationDate": "1992-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
