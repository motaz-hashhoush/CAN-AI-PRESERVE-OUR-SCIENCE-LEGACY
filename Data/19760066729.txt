At the present time, agencies of the United States government are operating\n. approximately 50 such sets in various parts of the world, and foreign countries have\nabout 30. In addition, several private groups in the United States and abroad are\nequipped to receive the satellite pictures.\nThe satellite will come within the 2100-mile picture-reception range of any station\non two or three orbits a day. Two or three pictures, each covering four million square\nmiles, can be received .on each of these orbits. Because the APT system does not\nstore photographs after the transmission period, the ground stations will received\nonly those "local" pictures transmitted while the satellite is within receiving range.\nThe APT photographs will be a valuable new tool for weather forecasters in many\nlands, providing timely information on-existing weather conditions over a large area\naround their stations. The information can be used to improve local weather forecasts,\nto issue warnings of severe weather, and to select the safest routes for aircraft in\nflight and ships at sea.\nThe TOS system, the first .operational weather satellite system in the world, is\nfinanced by the Environmental Science Services Administration and is managed and ,\noperated by ESSA\'s National Environmental Satellite Center. The system is designed\nto provide both remote and local cloud cover pictures at least once every day on a\nglobal scale.\nESSA I, which inaugurated the TOS system, takes pictures of cloud cover over\nthe entire earth and stores them for readout by the Command and Data Acquisition\nStations near Fairbanks, Alaska, and Wallops Station, Virginia. The second ESSA\nsatellite will add the local readout feature, bringing the TOS system into full operation.

Plans for the\nTOS system were agreed upon in 1964 by the U. S. Department of Commerce, the\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the Department of Defense.\nThe TOS system is financed by the Environmental Science Services Administration (ESSA) of the Department of Commerce and is managed and operated by\nESSA\'s National Environmental Satellite Center. The National Aeronautics and\nSpace Administration is responsible for procurement, launch, and initial checkout of the spacecraft in orbit. After NASA has determined that an orbiting\nsatellite is ready for operational use, the National Environmental Satellite\nCenter assumes control of the spacecraft and supporting ground systems. The\nSatellite Center also processes the data and furnishes it to the ESSA Weather\nBureau, other U. S. agencies including the Department of Defense, and foreign\ngovernments for operational use in preparing weather analyses and forecasts.\nAn operational weather satellite system must provide global data on a daily\nbasis without interruption. The TOS system will provide regular and continuous cloud picture coverage of the entire sunlit portion of the earth at least\nonce a day. Certain infrared observations of value to meteorology also will\nbe made by the TOS system.\nThe Weather Bureau has made operational use of meteorological data received\nfrom the first ten TIROS satellites. Nine of these were NASA research and\ndevelopment spacecraft, and one was purchased by ESSA. The operational value\nof data from the first eight was limited due to incomplete and irregular\ncoverage. These satellites could view only 20 percent of the earth each day,\nbecause they were conventional TIROS spacecraft with cameras mounted in the\nbase and were spin-stabilized in orbits inclined either 48 or 58 degrees to\nthe Equator.\nTIROS IX, which was launched January 22, 1965, had the same shape as the\nearlier TIROS spacecraft, but was redesigned to a "cartwheel" configuration.\nIn the TIROS IX and ESSA I cartwheel satellites, the cameras point outward\nfrom the rim of the satellite (at a 26-degree angle) rather than from the\nbottom. After being injected into orbit, a cartwheel satellite is turned so\nthat its spin axis is perpendicular to the orbital plane. In this position,\nthe satellite rolls along in orbit on its side like a wheel, and the cameras\ntake pictures only when pointing at the earth. TIROS IX was placed in a\nnear-polar, sun-synchronous orbit, which permitted daily picture coverage of\nthe entire globe except for those areas in polar darkness.\n\n-7-\n\nTIROS X, the first ESSA-funded weather satellite, was launched on July 2,\n1965, to provide coverage during the hurricane season. This satellite was a\nconventional TIROS spacecraft, but it was launched into a near-polar, sunsynchronous\' orbit to permit more comprehensive picture coverage than that\nprovided by the first eight TIROS satellites.\nTIROS VII, VIII, IX, and X are still in operation.\nThe spacecraft used in the TOS system are cartwheel satellites, similar in\nmany respects to TIROS IX. TOS system satellites are designated ESSA - for\nEnvironmental Survey SAtellite - and each is assigned a Roman numeral (I, II,\nIII and so on consecutively) after it has been successfully launched.\nWith the TOS system in full operation, two ESSA satellites - one with automatic-picture-transmission capability and one with picture-storage capability\n- will be in orbit at all times to provide both worldwide and local cloud\ncover.pictures at least once a day.\nThe first satellite in the TOS system was launched on February 3, 1966. It is\nidentical to TIROS IX, containing two cameras with picture-storage capability,\nand was placed in a near-polar, sun-synchronous orbit with an apogee of 521\nstatute (452 nautical) miles and a perigee of 432 statute (375 nautical) miles,\nThe second satellite in the TOS system will contain two Automatic Picture\nTransmission camera systems (see page 11).\nThis satellite, and succeeding spacecraft in the TOS system, will be launched\ninto near-polar orbits 865 statute (750 nautical) miles above the earth. The\norbits will be sun-synchronous, so that the cameras photograph a given latitude at the same sun time on every orbit. At an altitude of 865 statute\nmiles, the orbital period of the satellites will be approximately 113 minutes.\nThe satellites will be similar to TIROS IX, except that the cameras will be\nmounted to point directly outward through the rim instead of being tilted at\na 26-degree angle. The higher orbital altitude allows each camera to point\nstraight downward and still leave no gaps at the Equator between pictures\ntaken on successive orbits.\nTOS system spacecraft destined for 865-mile-high orbits will be launched by\nmeans of improved Thrust-Augmented Thor-Delta rockets. NASA is constructing Delta launch facilities at the Western Test Range at Point Mugu, California,\nwhich eventually will be used for TOS launches. Pending completion of these\nfacilities, launches will be made from the Eastern Test Range at Gape Kennedy,\nFlorida.\n\'\nWhen the ESSA I satellite ceases to be useful for meteorological operations,\nit will be succeeded by spacecraft carrying two cameras of the Advanced Vidicon Camera System (AVCS) type developed by NASA for the Nimbus weather\nsatellite. This camera unit works in a manner similar to earlier TIROS\ncameras, storing data on magnetic tape for rapid transmission to one of\nESSA\'s two primary Command and Data Acquisition (CDA) stations located at\n\n-8-\n\nGilmore Creek, near Fairbanks, Alaska, and at Wallops Station, Virginia. The\nAVCS pictures will have 800 scan lines and cover an area about 2,000 statute\n(1,736 nautical) miles square. A .single camera can provide daily global\ncoverage. However, the AVCS satellites will carry two camera systems to\nprovide redundancy and thus increase the operational lifetime of the spacecraft. The AVCS spacecraft probably will be timed to obtain cloud pictures\nin midafternoon.\nAcquisition and Analysis of Stored Data. Stored data are received from the\nESSA satellites at the Command and Data Acquisition (CDA) stations at Gilmore\nCreek, Alaska, and Wallops Station, Virginia. Meteorological data are\nrecorded on magnetic tape and immediately retransmitted to the National\nEnvironmental Satellite Center at Suitland, Maryland. Here, the picture\nsignals are projected on special TV screens (kinescopes) and photographed by\n35-mm. cameras. A latitude and longitude grid prepared by computer is\nelectronically combined with the picture signal to provide location\ninformation.\nMeteorologists use the gridded photographs to produce cloud-cover maps, called\nnephanalyses . The National Meteorological Center of the Weather Bureau then\nintegrates the cloud maps with worldwide data obtained by conventional weatherobserving methods for use in daily weather analysis and forecasting. The\nsatellite analyses are also relayed to field stations in the United States\nand to other countries throughout the world.\nNOTE: The TOS system will be modified as improved features are developed and\ntented. Thus, the system details described above are subject to change.\n\n-9ESSA B\nTECHNICAL DATA SUMMARY\n\nSpacecraft\n\nCylindrical, 18-sided polygon,\n22 inches high and 42 inches in\ndiameter, weighing 290 pounds.\n\nMission Objectives\n\nAdd Automatic Picture Transmission\ncapability to the TIROS Operational\nSatellite System.\nProvide daily coverage of local\nweather systems, for weather\nstations around the world equipped\nwith APT receivers.\n\nLaunch Information:\nVehicle\n\nThree-stage, Thrust-Augmented\nImproved Delta.\n\nLaunch Pad\n\nComplex 17, Pad B, Eastern Test\nRange, Cape Kennedy, Florida.\n\nDate\n\nNo earlier than February 25, 1966.\n\nTime\n\n8:58 a.m. EST.\n\nOrbital Elements:\nInclination\n\nNear polar and sun synchronous,\n78.6 degrees retrograde to the\nEquator.\n\nPeriod\n\n113.5 minutes.\n\nOrbit\n\nCircular, approximately 865\nstatute (750 nautical) miles high.\n\nVelocity\n\nApproximately 16,300 miles per\nhour.\n\nCameras\n\nTwo 1-inch Automatic Picture\nTransmission vidicons which take\nmore than 140 two-thousand-statutemile-square pictures daily with a\nresolution of about two miles at\npicture center.\n\n-10Power System\n\n*\nTracking\n\nCommand and Data Acquisition\nStations\n\n9,100 solar cells (N on P) which\nconvert sun energy to electrical\nenergy to keep 63 nickel-cadmium\nbatteries charged.\nFifteen stations of the worldwide\nSpace Tracking and Data Acquisition\nNetwork (STADAN) operated by the\nGoddard Space Flight Center.\n\nWallops Station, Virginia\nGilmore Creek, Alaska\n\nAPT Acquisition Stations\n\nUnited States, 50 stations.\nOther nations, 30 stations.\n\nProgram Management\n\nNational Environmental Satellite\nCenter,\nEnvironmental Science Services\nAdministration,\nDepartment of Commerce\n\nSpacecraft & Launch Vehicle\nManagement\n\nLaunch Operations\n\nNASA Office of Space Science and\nApplications,\nGoddard Space Flight Center.\nKennedy Space Center\n\nMajor Contractors:\nDelta Vehicle\n\nDouglas Aircraft Company\n\nESSA Spacecraft\n\nRadio Corp. of America\n\n-11THE ESSA B SPACECRAFT\nThe second ESSA satellite, like its predecessors in the TIROS and ESSA series,\nis a hatbox-shaped structure. The spacecraft is an 18-sided polygon which\nweighs 290 pounds, stands 22 inches high, and measures 42 inches in diameter.\nMounted on the top and sides of the satellite structure are 9,100 solar cells.\nProtruding from the top of the spacecraft is an 18-inch receiving antenna\nwhich receives commands from the two Command and Data Acquisition stations.\nFour 22-inch transmitting whip antennas, which extend from the bottom or\nbaseplate of the satellite, transmit television pictures, as well as telemetry\ninformation on the spacecraft temperature, pressure, battery charge levels,\nspin rate, and other "housekeeping" data.\nTELEVISION CAMERAS\nThe camera subsystems are two identical 1-inch Automatic Picture Transmission\n(APT) cameras, which take cloud photographs and send them immediately to\nsimple receiving stations on the ground. Similar cameras were tested on\nTIROS VIII and Nimbus I.\nEach of the two cameras has a wide-angle (90-degree) lens. The two cameras\nare mounted 180 degrees apart on the side of the spacecraft and perpendicular\nto the spin axis, so they point directly downward once every revolution\n(every 5.5 seconds). An onboard camera-triggering system programs the cameras\nto take pictures only when facing the earth.\nThe APT system automatically takes and transmits a picture every 352 seconds\nwhile the satellite is in daylight. The picture is retained on a photosensitive layer of the vidicon tube\'s face during the 200-second transmission\nperiod. Images recorded by the camera are scanned line by line and sent to\nearth by a transistorized FM transmitter.\nEach APT picture has 800 scan lines and covers an area on the earth about\n2000 statute (1736 nautical) miles on a side when taken from an 865-statutemile altitude. Picture resolution is about 2 statute (1.5 nautical) miles\nper scan line directly below the camera and about 5.2 statute (4.5 nautical)\nmiles at the picture edge.\nThe satellite has two APT systems either of which, operating independently,\ncan provide the required global coverage. This dual system will ensure a\nlonger operational lifetime for the spacecraft.\nPICTURE RECEPTION\nSpecially designed APT receiving equipment may be installed anywhere it is\nneeded. A properly equipped ground station can receive pictures when the\nsatellite is within a radius of about 2100 statute (1800 nautical) miles.\nEvery day such a station can acquire two or three pictures per orbit on each\n\n-12of one to three orbits. The number of daily orbits on which the satellite\ncomes within receiving range depends on the latitude of the station, being\ngreater near the poles and lower near the Equator.\nAt the ground stations, APT pictures can be recorded on both magnetic tape\nand facsimile equipment. The magnetic tape recording can be used to make\nmultiple copies or to transmit the pictures to other stations equipped with\nfacsimile receivers.\nThe National Environmental Satellite Center sends alert messages to stations\nthroughout the world so they can determine the times when the satellite will\nbe within range of their receivers.\nDATA ANALYSIS\nAfter APT pictures are received at a ground station, they must be gridded\nwith latitude and longitude lines to provide location information. For this\npurpose, the National Environmental Satellite Center has sent an APT Users\nGuide and a set of latitude-longitude grids to every known APT station.\nThe APT pictures provide meteorologists with immediate, timely information\non cloud and weather conditions over a large area around the receiving station.\nThis information can be used to improve local forecasts, to brief pilots\nflying in the area, and to issue warnings of severe weather conditions.\nTHE ORBIT\nThe combination of the cartwheel configuration and the near-polar, sunsynchronous orbit permits complete coverage of the earth\'s weather.\nIn a sun-synchronous orbit, the precession (eastward drift) of the satellite\nis about one degree daily, at the same rate and direction as the earth moves\naround the sun, so the satellite photographs each area of the earth at the\nsame local sun time every day.\nTHE FLIGHT PLAN\nThe launch vehicle for this mission is the NASA-developed, three-stage,\nThrust-Augmented Improved ]\nDelta, which can put three times more weight into\norbit than earlier Deltas.\nIf the launch is successful, it will be the 34th time Delta has achieved orbit\nin 37 attempts for the Delta family of boosters. This will also be the\nfourth attempt to place a satellite in near-polar orbit from Cape Kennedy by\nNASA.\nThe flight path is very similar to those flown by TIROS IX, X, and ESSA I.\n\n-13The launch vehicle will perform three precise "dog-lgg" or turning maneuvers\nto inject the satellite into a sun-synchronous, near-polar, circular orbit.\nInjection will occur about 18 minutes after liftoff when the spacecraft is\nabout 700 miles west of Quito, Ecuador.\nThe spacecraft will be placed into an orbit which has an altitude of 863\nmiles, a period of 113 minutes, and inclination to the Equator of 79 degrees\n(retrograde).\nLiftoff is scheduled for 8:58 a.m. EST from Pad 17B.\n8:58\xe2\x80\x949:33 a.m. EST.\n\nThe launch window is\n\nFlight Path\nDelta will be launched on an initial azimuth of 115 degrees True. Two\nseconds after liftoff, the three-stage rocket begins to roll and seven seconds\nlater the vehicle is on a new heading of 140 degrees True.\nAbout four seconds after liftoff, Delta begins to pitch downward gradually\nuntil the launch vehicle\'s nose is at a 45-degree angle to the earth about\n90 seconds after launch.\nThe first major yaw command, which turns the vehicle 33 degrees to the right,\noccurs during first-stage burning of the Thor, from T plus 80 to T plus 100\nseconds.\nFollowing second-stage ignition at T plus 155 seconds, another yaw command,\nfrom T plus 160 to T plus 173 seconds, turns the vehicle 2% degrees to the\nright. The Delta is also pitched down six degrees from T plus 175 to T plus\n300 seconds.\nDelta\'s final dog-leg or yaw maneuver occurs during the nine-minute coast\nperiod between second-stage burnout and third-stage ignition. A yaw command\nturns the vehicle 15 degrees to the right between 700 and 800 seconds after\nliftoff, and the vehicle is also pitched down 50 degrees from T plus 600 to\nT plus 700 seconds.\n\nThrust-Augmented Improved Delta Flight Events (nominal) For OT-2 Mission\n\nEVENT\n\nStrap-on Solids\nBurnout\n\nTIME\n\n43 sec.\n\nALTITUDE\n(STATUTE MILES)\n\nSURFACE RANGE\n(STATUTE MILES)\n\n7.2\n\n2\n\nVELOCITY\nMILES PER\nHOUR\n\n1,705\nI\n\nStrap-on Solids\nSeparation\n\n70 sec.\n\n17\n\n8\n\n2,386\n\nThor burnout\n\n2 min. 31 sec.\n\n85\n\n71 \xe2\x80\xa2\n\n7,977\n\n2nd. stage ignition\n\n2 min. 35 sec.\n\n97\n\n81\n\n7,909\n\nShroud separation\n\n2 min. 39 sec.\n\n98\n\n83\n\n7,909\n\n2nd. stage burnout\n\n9 min. 4 sec.\n\n551\n\n863\n\n12,682\n\n3rd. stage ignition\n\n18 min. 5 sec.\n\n863\n\n2,302\n\n11,182\n\n3rd. stage burnout\n\n18 min. 28 sec.\n\n863\n\n2,403\n\n16,023\n\n\xc2\xa3\n\xe2\x80\xa2i\n\n-15STABILIZATION AND CONTROL SUBSYSTEMS\nTwo dynamic control (DYCON) units in TOS control the satellite\'s spin rate,\ncamera .timing, and the magnetic attitude coil currents which steer the satellite to the cartwheel attitude and maintain it in that position.\nShortly before the burned-out second stage of Delta separates from the third\nstage, the entire vehicle spins up to approximately 125 r.p.m. to maintain\ncontrol of the third stage.\nTo reduce the satellite\'s spin rate to the desired 10.9 r.p.m., a timer\ntriggers two weights attached to cables wrapped around the outside of the\nsatellite. As the weights uncoil, they reduce the spin to the proper rate\nand then automatically drop away from the spacecraft.\nThe interaction between the earth\'s magnetic field and magnetic material in\nthe spacecraft causes a drag effect which reduces the spin rate, making the\nsatellite unstable. To prevent this, the satellite has two types of spin\ncontrol systems - a magnetic coil inside the spacecraft and small, solidpropellant rockets for backup.\nThe magnetic coil, made of aluminum, is 30 inches long and is tightly wrapped\ninside a rectangular spool in the spacecraft. The satellite\'s spin rate can\nbe kept nearly constant by sending small charges of electric current through\nthe coil.\nAs a backup method of maintaining the spin rate, five pairs of small solidpropellant rockets mounted on the rim of the spacecraft can be fired upon\ncommand from a ground station. Each rocket motor develops an impulse of\napproximately 1.4 pounds per second. When fired in pairs, these rockets can\nincrease the spin rate by about three r.p.m.\nAttitude Sensors\nTwo infrared horizon sensors arranged in a V configuration determine the\nsatellite\'s attitude in space. The plane of the V contains the spin axis,\nand the bisector of the angle between the optical axes is normal to the spin\nvector.\nIf the spin axis of the satellite is normal to an earth radius, the outputs\nof the sensors are identical. If a yaw error exists at one point in orbit,\nthere will be an equal roll error 90 degrees later in orbit because of the\ninertial rigidity of the spin vector. Roll error is detectable as an inequality in the pulse durations of the two sensors. Because accuracy is determined\nby the resolution and reliability of each of the data points, at least 10\nminutes of roll error data will be required in a given pass. The roll error\ndata will be used by the satellite control center to correct attitude and\nspin rate errors.\n\n-16Power Supply\nThe power supply delivers up to 2.2 amperes and consists of solar cells,\nstorage batteries, voltage regulators, and protective circuits.\nSolar energy is converted to electricity by 9,100 N on P solar cells, 1 cm.\nby 2 cm., attached to the top and sides of the spacecraft cover assembly.\nThe cells are arranged in shingles of five series-connected cells. Each cell\nhas a bonded coat of fused silica to improve thermal emissivity, a vacuumdeposited antireflective coating, and a 6-mm. shield to prevent radiation\ndamage.\nDuring the daylight orbits, power from the solar array is fed directly to\nspacecraft subsystems. Current not used immediately charges 63 nickelcadmium storage batteries which have a capacity of 295 watt-hours. The\nbatteries, connected in three parallel strings of 21 cells, supply spacecraft power during the nighttime.\nDiodes in the solar cells prevent the storage batteries from discharging\ninto the solar cells during orbital night.\n\n-17DELTA LAUNCH VEHICLE\nDelta is a launch vehicle program of NASA\'s Office of Space Science and\nApplications.
