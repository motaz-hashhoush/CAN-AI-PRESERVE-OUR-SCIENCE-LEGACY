b't right, a researcher is inserting a sample into a\n\nA\n\nBEEM (Ballistic Electron Emission Microscopy)\nsystem, described a s a system that allows scientists to peer into the electronic structures of semiconductor devices. below are the components of the BEEM\nsystem, which was developed a t Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory (JPL), engineered by Atomis, Inc., Berkeley,\nCalifornia and introduced to the commercial marketplace\nby SurfaceAnterface Inc., Mountain View, California.\nBEEM is a research instrument invented by a\ntrio of scientists at JPL\'s Center for Microelectronics\nTechnoloav: Douglas Bell, Michael H. Hecht and William\n-"\nJ. Kaiser. The invention won for the trio an R&D 100\nAward in 1990 because of the significance of the technology to microelectronic research. Analytical instruments\nthat produce images of surface structures are in wide\nuse, but BEEM goes a step further with the ability to\nimage underlying layers or interfaces.\nBEEM was conceived a s a tool for advanced\nresearch on semiconductor devices. Co-inventor Michael\nHecht says that "almost everything of interest in semiconductor devices happens a t interfaces, not on surfaces."\nBEEM injects a tiny current into a metal layer and the\nelectrons travel ballistically through the metal: this allows\n\nthe researcher to look a t the interface and surface simultaneously to study the operation and performance of a\nstructure.\nAmong BEEM advantages cited by JPL are the option\nto inject either electrons or holes to nondestructively\nimage barrier heights and characterize devices electronically; the ability to image interface and surface using an\ninstrument that operates in air, liquid or in a vacuum; and\nthe potential to observe processes such a s molecular\nbeam epitaxy (crystal growth) in situ.\n\n.\n\ni\nI\n\nI\nr\n;\n\n'
