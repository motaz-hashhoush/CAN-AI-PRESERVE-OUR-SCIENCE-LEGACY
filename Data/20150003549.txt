b'3D Lasers Increase Efficiency, Safety of Moving Machines\nNASA Technology\n\nA\n\ns NASA planned the logistics for a proposed\nspace station, called Space Station Freedom, in\nthe early 1990s, one of the agency\xe2\x80\x99s concerns was\nensuring that the modules\xe2\x80\x94 individual station compartments to be constructed on Earth and flown piecemeal by\nspace shuttles into low-Earth orbit\xe2\x80\x94would be properly\nattached to each another. A critical part of the assembly\nprocess involved crewmembers leveraging the shuttle\xe2\x80\x99s\nCanadian-made robotic arm, Canadarm, for the heavy\nmoving, and engineers wanted astronauts to receive positioning cues sufficient for setting objects within an inch\nand a degree of one another.\nA solution was found in a technology called the\nSpace Vision System (SVS), developed by Ottawa,\nCanada-based Neptec Design Group, a contractor for the\nCanadian Space Agency. Using standard cameras to track\nblack and white dots placed on the space station modules,\nthe SVS processing system would display their location\nand orientation at 15 frames per second, giving astronauts the necessary realtime visual cues for successfully\nconnecting these large and costly research and habitation\ncomponents.\nAlthough the Space Station Freedom project was\neventually discontinued, the SVS went on to be used in\nthe construction of the International Space Station (ISS).\nFor Neptec it was also the start of a long engagement in\nthe US aerospace industry, serving as a Houston-based\nNASA prime contractor tasked with developing 3D\nsensor applications to help spacecraft safely navigate the\ndark, formidable backdrop of the cosmos.\n\nTechnology Transfer\nOne of Neptec\xe2\x80\x99s important succeeding contributions\ncame as a result of the Columbia Space Shuttle disaster\nin 2003. The tragic accident was the result of foam insulation breaking off the external tank during launch and\nstriking the left wing, causing damage that ultimately led\n72\t\n\nPublic Safety\t\n\nOn December 4, 1998, Space Shuttle Endeavor launched Unity, the first US-built module of the International Space Station, into\nlow-Earth orbit. Once in space, the shuttle performed rendezvous and docking maneuvers to attach Unity to Russia\xe2\x80\x99s Zarya module.\nNeptec Design Group\xe2\x80\x99s Space Vision System was used to provide the necessary visual cues.\n\nto the spacecraft breaking apart upon reentry. Aside from\nassisting in analyzing video imagery of the accident\xe2\x80\x94\nexpertise they gleaned from working with the SVS\xe2\x80\x94the\ncompany also helped fulfill one of the agency\xe2\x80\x99s mandates\nthat resulted from the investigation: more detailed safety\ninspections of the space shuttle before reentry through\nEarth\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere.\nNeptec helped accomplish this by installing its Laser\nCamera System, or LCS, onto a 50-foot boom, which\nwas grappled by the shuttle\xe2\x80\x99s Canadarm to capture\nimages of the spacecraft\xe2\x80\x99s thermal protection system.\nWhat made the LCS particularly effective was that it was\n\nable, using triangulation, to render a three-dimensional\nmap of the shuttle\xe2\x80\x99s hull. That data was relayed back to\nJohnson Space Center, where engineers could use a 3D\nprinter to produce a physical model. \xe2\x80\x9cWe didn\xe2\x80\x99t have\nto do this every flight,\xe2\x80\x9d says NASA\xe2\x80\x99s David Moyer, who\nhelped ensure shuttle safety, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it was nice to have those\nmodels because when we did have those cases where there\nwas some damage, we were able to give those high-definition maps to the project\xe2\x80\x99s damage assessment team.\xe2\x80\x9d\nFortunately, shuttle repairs were never needed.\nNeptec has gone on to further develop its 3D sensor\ncapabilities. Funded by NASA and the Canadian Space\nSpinoff 2015\n\nNeptec Technologies\xe2\x80\x99 Obscurant Penetrating Auto-Synchronous Lidar, or OPAL, family of 3D laser sensors, unlike conventional lidar technology, is able to penetrate dust, operate in total darkness, and\nwithstand considerable vibration and shock.\n\nAgency, the company\xe2\x80\x99s TriDAR 3D sensor combines\nthe company\xe2\x80\x99s LCS technology with a long-range Lidar\nsystem in allowing spacecraft to rendezvous and dock\nwith each other. The technology automatically acquires\nand tracks the target spacecraft without the use of any\nmarkers and can operate in total darkness. Originally\ndeveloped in part to prepare for an unmanned mission to\nrepair the Hubble Space Telescope, TriDAR was successfully tested on three space shuttle missions, including the\nprogram\xe2\x80\x99s final flight in July 2011.\nThe space shuttle program\xe2\x80\x99s closure heralded the end\nof an era for Neptec, but it also signaled new beginnings\nfor the company, which in the same year founded a\nseparate firm, Neptec Technologies Corporation, to commercialize its made-for-space products for the terrestrial\nmarket. For example, not only is TriDAR being used by\nOrbital Sciences Corporation to dock its Cygnus cargo\ntransport spacecraft to the ISS; a slightly modified version\nof the technology has found its way onto helicopters to\nhelp pilots see through dust during landings.\nBut Neptec\xe2\x80\x99s main commercial entr\xc3\xa9e is the Obscurant\nPenetrating Auto-Synchronous Lidar, or OPAL, family of\n3D laser scanners, which is derived from, among various\nother projects, its TriDAR and LCS contracts. Working\nin unison with its corresponding 3DRi software development toolkit, OPAL is designed to help machines operate\nSpinoff 2015 \t\n\nin challenging environments where safety and efficiency\nis key.\n\nBenefits\nMuch like how Neptec\xe2\x80\x99s contributions have allowed\nNASA spacecraft to navigate their missions in the dark\nexpanse of space, OPAL, which uses a Risley prism pair\nfor laser beam deflection, is designed to help businesses,\nsuch as mining and offshore gas and oil companies, more\nefficiently operate machinery in similarly dark and dangerous surroundings.\nNeptec Technologies CEO Mike Sekerka says there\nare other 3D laser scanners on the market, but they lack\nseveral of OPAL\xe2\x80\x99s capabilities, the first being its real-time\nvideo feed. \xe2\x80\x9cMost laser scanners that are out there are used\nfor survey-type applications,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, \xe2\x80\x9cso they\xe2\x80\x99re usually\ntoo slow for navigation.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s also the only device that,\nbecause of its lineage to space-approved technologies, can\npenetrate dust, operate in total darkness and withstand a\nhigh degree of vibration and shock. \xe2\x80\x9cWe really designed\nthis for environments that no other laser scanner has been\nable to operate in,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.\nThe company has already started collaborating\nwith two global mining companies by installing OPAL\nscanners on their excavators and haul trucks. The size\n\nof these machines, combined with the often limited\nlight and space in which they operate, makes it difficult\nfor operators to maneuver to desired locations on the\nfirst attempt. OPAL will help by allowing operators\nclear visual access to their targets, saving precious time\nas a result. Because equipment and other industry costs\nare high, increasing efficiency pays dividends. \xe2\x80\x9cIf this\ntechnology shaves one or two seconds off the average\nspot time, that translates to millions of dollars a year in\nincreased revenues,\xe2\x80\x9d Sekerka says.\nWith recent investments being made by industry in\ndriverless haul trucks operated by remote control, Sekerka\nnotes that 3D intelligence technologies such as OPAL are\ngenerating even greater interest. The scanner\xe2\x80\x99s ability to\noperate in murky water also makes it an appealing tool\nfor companies extracting oil from deep underwater fields.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are lots of opportunities to take this technology to\na number of applications and markets,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.\nAnd it all began with Neptec\xe2\x80\x99s initial involvement in\nspace exploration over 20 years ago. \xe2\x80\x9cTo look at space\ninvestment as purely for space is too narrow,\xe2\x80\x9d Sekerka\nsays. \xe2\x80\x9cSupport from NASA and the Canadian Space\nAgency laid the foundation for our commercial products,\nwhich helps drive jobs and exports and other economic\nbenefits.\xe2\x80\x9d v\n\nPublic Safety \t 73\n\n'
