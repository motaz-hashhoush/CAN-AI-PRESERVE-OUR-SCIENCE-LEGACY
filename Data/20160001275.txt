b'Science Fiction\n\nWhat is Gravity?\nGravity is the dominant force that is the cause of the formation, shape, and trajectory\n(orbit) of astronomical bodies like asteroids, comets, planets, stars, and galaxies.\nIt is responsible:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 For causing the Earth and the other planets to orbit the Sun,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 For causing the Moon to orbit the Earth,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 For the formation of tides and natural convection,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 For heating the interiors of forming stars and planets to very high temperatures.\nNewton\'s Law of Universal Gravitation states that any two bodies in the universe\nattract each other with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their\nmasses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.\n\nWhat is Artificial Gravity?\nArtificial gravity is the theoretical increase or decrease of apparent gravity (g-force) by\nartificial means, particularly in space, but also on Earth. It can be practically achieved by\nthe use of different forces, particularly centripetal force and linear acceleration.\nA centripetal force (from Latin centrum "center" and petere "to seek") is a force that\nmakes a body follow a curved path.\nAngular velocity, w,\nspecifies the rotational\nspeed of an object and the\naxis about which the object\nis rotating.\nThe SI unit of angular\nvelocity is radians per\nsecond.\n\nr = \xe2\x80\x9cradius\xe2\x80\x9d, the distance to the\ncenter of rotation.\n\nNewton\xe2\x80\x99s Third Law:\nF = ma\n(Force = mass x acceleration)\nCentripetal force = mw2r\n\nA circle has 2p radians.\n\nCentripetal acceleration is w2r.\n\nCentripetal Artificial Gravity as Depicted in Science Fiction\n\xe2\x80\xa2 2001: A Space Odyssey \xe2\x80\x93 Rotating Space Station:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ll_6RimCuM\n\xe2\x80\xa2 2001: A Space Odyssey \xe2\x80\x93 Centrifuge :\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wJQ5UrAsIY\n\xe2\x80\xa2 2010 \xe2\x80\x93 Rotate the habitable portion of the spacecraft (Alexei Leonov)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=eCq9ntRK-QY\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Mission to Mars \xe2\x80\x93 Rotate an interior section of the spacecraft\nhttp://www.metacafe.com/watch/6566713/mission_to_mars/\n\nRingworld\nElysium\nBabylon 5\n\nHalo\n\nInterstellar Docking Scene\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gkuBkea2Fc\n\nThe ISS has been continuously inhabited since November 2, 2000\nThere is no Artificial Gravity on ISS. Astronauts live in MICRO-GRAVITY (or free-fall)\nEarth\xe2\x80\x99s gravity attracts SS towards Earth, so the ISS is accelerated downward at almost 1g.\nWhen viewed from an orbiting observer, other close objects in space appear to be\nfloating because everything is being pulled towards Earth at the same speed and moving\nforward as the Earth\'s surface \'falls\' away below.\nAll these objects are in free fall, not zero gravity.\n\nAnd astronauts love living in micro-gravity!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjZ6rydAT_Y\nMusculoskeletal and Aerobic fitness has been maintained by ISS crew for 6-month missions.\nDysadaptation to microgravity includes visual impairment, orthostatic intolerance and loss of\nblood volume due to fluid shifts -- astronauts also have reported getting taller while on ISS!\n\nHow effective artificial gravity is in counteracting fluid shifts is not well understood\n\nAcceptable rotation rate\nis less than 4rpm.\n\nWe need to understand the Gravity Dose Response Curve for the human body:\nHow high a gravity level and how long a duration is needed to provide astronaut health benefits?\n(No data exists on \xe2\x80\x9cgravity doping\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 exposure to levels higher than 1-g for periods of time)\n\nCentripetal Artificial Gravity also exposes the crew to The Coriolis Effect\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt_XJp77-mk\nThe Coriolis force acts in a direction perpendicular to the rotation axis and to the velocity of\nthe body. It acts on the inner ear and can cause dizziness, nausea and disorientation. The\nnausea-inducing effects of Coriolis forces can also be mitigated by restraining movement of\nthe head.\n\nSO\xe2\x80\xa6What is NASA doing for artificial gravity?\n\nShort-radius centrifuge \xe2\x80\x93 a potential fluid shift countermeasure or means of gravity doping\n\nSmall-scale centrifuges\nare in-use on ISS\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 ISS considered adding a centrifuge module for primate research.\n\nAn enormous amount of work is needed to understand the benefits of artificial gravity\nfor long duration human spaceflight.\nImplementing centripetal artificial gravity on a spacecraft is feasible, but it will be complex,\nexpensive and depending on the magnitude of the g-force and the exposure duration\nneeded to provide health benefits, may result in a very large spacecraft.\nOur current ISS mission durations do not cover the current 3-year duration needed for a\nround-trip Mars mission.\n\nAs our missions get more ambitious, the desire for artificial gravity may become a requirement.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 My parents\n\nAcknowledgements\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Robert Goddard, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky and everyone who followed the dream\nof space exploration as an astronaut, engineer, chemist, biologist,\nmathematician, scientist or physician.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Astronaut Michael Barratt \xe2\x80\x93 NASA/JSC for the crew perspective on artificial\ngravity.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Everyone who came to listen to this presentation today\nThe future of space exploration is in your hands!\n\n'
