b'Business Jets\n\nnew Learjet 31 the\nhown at top is business jet and below it\nits larger and heavier companion, the Learjet 35C.\nBoth are built by Learjet\nCorporation,\nTucson, Arizona and both feature\nNASA-developed\n"winglets," nearly vertical extensions of the wing (closeup at\nlower right) designed to reduce fuel consumption\nand\ngenerally improve airplane\nperformance.\nPowered by twin turbofans, the aircraft carry up to\n10 passengers. The Model\n33C, which takes off at\n21,000 pounds, is the largest\nof the Learjet family. The\nModel 31 (15,500 pounds)\n\n122\n\nTransportation\n\nis the lowest priced Learjet,\nan "entry level" airplane intended for the business aircraft operator who wants to\nmove up from propellerdriven aircraft to jet performance. Both feature Deka\nFins, innovative\n\ncompany-\n\ndesigned tail surfaces that\nprovide high directional stability at all speeds and improved handling in the traffic pattern and at lower\ntakeoff, approach and landing speeds. Both airplanes\nare expected to receive Federal Aviation Administration\ncertification in mid- 1988.\nWinglets are lifting surfaces designed to operate in\nthe "vortex," or air whirlpool, that occurs at an airplane\'s wingtip. This complex flow of air creates air\ndrag; the winglet\'s job is to\nreduce the strength of the\nvortex and thereby substan-\n\ntiaUy reduce drag. Additionally, the winglet generates its\nown lift, producing forward\nthrust in the manner of a\nboat\'s sail. The combination\nof reduced drag and additional thrust adds up to significant improvement\nin fuel\nefficiency.\nWinglets are particularly\neffective on the two new\nLearjets, which\noperate\nand are\naltitudes\nAt such\n\ncan routinely\n\nabove 45,000\nfeet\ncapable of flying at\nup to 51,000 feet.\naltitudes, where the\n\nair is thinner, the drag reduction afforded by the\nwinglets is more pronounced.\nLearjet was the first manufacturer to use the winglet\ndesign in production\naircraft,\n\ninitially on the Models 28/\n29 introduced\nto service in\n1979 Several other plane\nbuilders are taking advantage of the NASA technology, notably McDonnell\nDouglas in its new MD-11\njetliner.
