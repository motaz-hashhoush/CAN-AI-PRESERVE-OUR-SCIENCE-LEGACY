The objectives of human exploration of Mars are: (1) to learn how Mars is similar to, and different from, Earth; (2) to explore possible life, past and present; (3) to discover what Mars is like now from the perspective of Geoscience and geologic history; and (4) how did Mars form and how did its formation differ from Earth. Considerations of human Martian exploration involve: (1) having a capable base laboratory; (2) having long range transportation; (3) having operational autonomy of the crew, and the requirement of the crew to possess a range of new cognitive processes along with easy communications with terrestrial colleagues; and finally (4) creating the human habitat along with human factors which involve more than just survivability.", "title": "Mars Human Exploration Objectives", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-19T01:11:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19990025823, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Briggs, Geoff"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Ames Research Center", "location": "Moffett Field, CA United States"}}, "id": "a9fd1abae66a4ee39dd0d8db4241c2dd"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19990025823, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19990025823, "id": "04fd3382ef474800aad9ff11acd07a15", "publicationName": "HEDS-UP Mars Exploration Forum", "publicationDate": "1998-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19990025822, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "HEDS-UP Mars Exploration Forum", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19990025823.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19990025823/downloads/19990025823.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19990025823/downloads/19990025823.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19990025823/downloads/19990025823.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
