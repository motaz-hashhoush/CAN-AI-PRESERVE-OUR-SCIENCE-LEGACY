Long operating life and reliable\nperformance are critical requirements for these applications. Accordingly, long-term materials\ncompatibility is being evaluated through the use of high-temperature life test heat pipes. Thermacore, Inc.,\nhas carried out a sodium heat pipe 10-year life test to establish long-term operating reliability. Sodium\nheat pipes have demonstrated favorable materials compatibility and heat transport characteristics at high\noperating temperatures in air over long time periods. A representative one-tenth segment Stirling Space\nPower Converter heat pipe with an Inconel 718 envelope and a stainless steel screen wick has operated\nfor over 87,000 hr (10 years) at nearly 700 \xef\x82\xb0C. These life test results have demonstrated the potential for\nhigh-temperature heat pipes to serve as reliable energy conversion system components for power\napplications that require long operating lifetime with high reliability. Detailed design specifications,\noperating history, and post-test analysis of the heat pipe and sodium working fluid are described. Lessons\nlearned and future life test plans are also discussed.\n\nIntroduction\nHigh-temperature heat pipes are being evaluated for use in energy conversion applications such as\nfuel cells, gas turbine re-combustors, and Stirling cycle heat sources. The resurgence of space nuclear\npower has created renewed interest in their use as reactor heat removal components and as radiator\ncomponents. In the temperature range between 500 and 1000 \xef\x82\xb0C, heat pipes can offer the favorable\nfeatures of passive, reliable operation, effective thermal coupling between noncontacting fluid streams,\nand modest cost (Rosenfeld and Ernst, 1999). Long operating life and reliable performance are critical\nrequirements for these applications. Reliability for space-based applications is particularly critical because\ncomponent replacement is generally difficult or impossible.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942011-217206\n\n1\n\nHeat pipes are a key component under consideration for the higher power dynamic power systems.\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Glenn Research Center (GRC) has been\ninvolved in the development of dynamic power converters for both nuclear and solar power conversion\nsystems. Of particular current interest are 1) the development of a Stirling Radioisotope Generator (SRG)\nas a possible high efficiency alternative to Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) for deep\nspace missions and unmanned Mars rovers and 2) higher power Brayton and possibly Stirling or Rankine\npower systems for nuclear electric propulsion and power applications. Thermal energy is generally\nsupplied at a high temperature (>1000 K) to the power conversion system. High-temperature heat pipes\nare one option to efficiently transfer thermal energy from the nuclear reactor heat source to the dynamic\npower converter. Heat pipes may also be useful for transferring waste heat from the power converter to\nthe radiator. Heat pipes and other passive two-phase technologies are currently being considered for the\npurpose of transferring heat from the power converter to the radiator with minimal temperature drop and\nto spread heat within the radiator panels isothermally.\nStirling heat engines are being developed for electrical power generation on manned and unmanned\nEarth orbital, planetary missions, and terrestrial applications for utility and remote power generation. Dish\nStirling solar systems and nuclear reactor Stirling systems are two promising applications of Stirling\nengine technology. Sources of thermal energy used to drive the Stirling engine typically have nonuniform\ntemperatures and heat fluxes. Liquid metal heat pipe receivers are often used as heat transformers to\nuniformly deliver thermal energy at high temperatures to the heater heads of these Stirling engines. The\nuse of heat pipe receivers can greatly enhance system efficiency and potential life span.\nOne issue that needed to be addressed during the design phase of heat pipe receivers is the potential\nsolubility corrosion of the heater head section by the liquid metal working fluid. Stainless steels and\nnickel-based superalloys are standard materials of construction for high-temperature heat pipes and heater\nheads operating in the temperature range 823 to 1073 K. At these operating temperatures, some\ncomponents of these materials are appreciably soluble in working fluids such as sodium, potassium, and\nNaK. Over a typical life span of 7 to 10 years, essentially pure working fluid condensate will condense on\nthe heater head surfaces. The condensate will leach the soluble components of the heater head material\nand transport them to the evaporator section of the heat pipe. When the working fluid is evaporated again,\nthe soluble materials are precipitated and essentially pure working fluid is returned to the condenser\nsection to leach more material. The condensation heat flux for a Stirling heater head is typically 20 to\n25 W/cm2. For a 33 percent efficient 25 kWe Stirling engine this corresponds to approximately\n760,000 liters of sodium per year condensing on a heater head.\nTo establish long-term operating reliability for sodium heat pipes, long-duration sodium heat pipe life\ntests were performed. This paper describes the design and performance results from these tests, which\ncollectively establish the capability of sodium heat pipes in applications requiring high reliability over\nlong time durations.\n\nNomenclature\nEDM\nGRC\nICP\xe2\x80\x93AES\nMTI\nNASA\nRTG\nSRG\nWDS\n\nElectron discharge machining\nGlenn Research Center\nInductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer\nMechanical Technology Incorporated\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\nRadioisotope Thermoelectric Generators\nStirling Radioisotope Generator\nWavelength dispersive spectroscopy\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942011-217206\n\n2\n\nOne-Tenth Segment Stirling Space Power Heat Pipe Life Test:\nTest Article Description\nA representative one-tenth segment Stirling Space Power Converter (SSPC) heat pipe with an\nInconel 718 envelope and a stainless steel screen wick was operated for over 87,000 hr (10 years) at\nnearly 700 \xef\x82\xb0C. Detailed design specifications, operating history, and post-test analysis are described for\nthe sodium heat pipe.\n\nHeat Pipe Design\nGRC funded a dual phase program to investigate solubility corrosion and to develop coatings that\nwould essentially eliminate the solubility corrosion potential. A complete description of the work\nperformed and the conclusions reached can be found in the Final Report for Contract No. NAS3\xe2\x80\x9326925\n(Dussinger and Lindemuth, 1997). The final task of the program was to fabricate a one-tenth segment of\nthe current SSPC, the Starfish heater head heat pipe, utilizing the coatings and coating processes\ndeveloped during the program. This heat pipe would then be life tested for up to 10 years by Thermacore\nas Phase 3. Unfortunately, the heat pipe intended for life testing had several weld failures after charging\nand processing. Because this pipe was no longer available, NASA acquired the original one-tenth segment\nheat pipe from Mechanical Technology Incorporated (MTI) and provided it for testing in the Phase 3\neffort. The one-tenth segment heat pipe, fabricated by Thermacore for the SSPC project under MTI\nSubcontract No. 003\xe2\x80\x9305034, was returned to Thermacore for testing on this program. This heat pipe was\nnot fabricated with the protective coating.\nThe Starfish heater head heat pipe is doughnut shaped with an inner diameter of 30 cm, an outer\ndiameter of 90 cm, and a thickness of 10 cm. Internal to the doughnut are 50 radial fins with 38 onemillimeter- diameter gas passages in each fin. The helium working fluid in the converter flows through\nthe gas passages while the sodium in the heat pipe condenses on the outside of each fin. The inner\ndiameter of the annular heat pipe is attached to the outer diameter of the Starfish heater head. The onetenth segment is a 36\xef\x82\xb0 slice of the overall heater head and heat pipe. The 38 small-diameter helium gas\npassages are replaced with five larger diameter passages to allow for installation of a gas-gap watercooled calorimeter to remove and measure the heat flow. Several photographs of the one-tenth segment\nare shown in Figure 1. The design specifications for this heat pipe are given in Table 1.\n\nArtery\n\nCondenser\xc2\xa0\n\nEvaporator\xc2\xa0\nThermocouple\n\xc2\xa0Well\xc2\xa0\n\n(a) Tenth segment heat pipe with top plate\nremoved to show wick structure\n\n(b) Assembled tenth segment heat pipe with\nintegral calorimeter\n\nFigure 1.\xe2\x80\x94Internal and external views of the tenth segment life test heat pipe.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942011-217206\n\n3\n\nTABLE 1.\xe2\x80\x94DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS FOR THE TENTH SEGMENT HEAT PIPE\nParameter\nSpecification\nOperating temperature\n1023 K (750 \xef\x82\xb0C)\nWorking fluid and fluid charge\n100 g, High purity sodium\nCalorimetric heat transport\n4500 W\nCondenser surface heat flux\n20 W/cm2\nEnvelope material and fill tube material\nIn 718 envelope; 316L SS fill tube\nWick structure material\n316L SS; two layers 100 mesh screen\nArteries\nFour; 0.318 cm (0.125 in.) inner diameter\nArtery material\n316L SS; 325 mesh screen\nCoating\nNone\n\nLife Test Supporting Equipment Design\nA cart-mounted supporting equipment arrangement was used to complete the life test on the heat\npipe. The heat pipe was heated primarily by radiation from 12 silicon carbide heating elements. In order\nto minimize heat loss, the heating elements were surrounded by a 9-in.-thick graded insulation package.\nThe insulation package was formed to fit and support the heat pipe and calorimeter package. The power\nwas controlled with a phase angle power controller in conjunction with a PID temperature controller. The\nsilicon carbide heating elements were operated in series at a relatively low voltage\xe2\x80\x94approximately 30 V.\nA 10-kVA stepdown transformer was used to reduce the primary 208 to 35 V.\nThe desired operating temperature was set on the temperature controller. The input signal to the\ntemperature controller was the heat pipe vapor space temperature (type K thermocouple). The temperature\ncontroller sent a control signal to the phase angle power controller to increase or decrease power to\nmaintain the heat pipe at the set point. The temperature controller also had a latching, over temperature\nalarm feature. In addition, the temperature controller had a second control feature that is being used to\nenergize the hour meter when the temperature is within 5\xef\x82\xb0 of the set point.\nThe power that the heat pipe transfers is extracted and measured using a gas gap calorimeter. The gas\ngap calorimeter consists of small-diameter water tubes that are inserted into the heater head gas passage\nholes. The gap between the heater head holes and the water tubes outer diameter is filled with a mixture\nof helium and nitrogen gas. This arrangement results in the calorimeter water tube, a gas gap, and the heat\npipe wall. The sodium vapor generated in the evaporator section of the heat pipe condenses on the\nStarfish heater head webs releasing its latent heat of vaporization. The thermal energy is transferred\nthrough the thickness of the heater head web by conduction. Next, the energy is transferred across the gas\ngap by radiation and by conduction through the gas. By controlling the fractions of nitrogen (low thermal\nconductivity) helium (high thermal conductivity) in the gap, the thermal conductance across the gap can\nbe modulated. The heat is then transferred through the water tube wall by conduction and transferred by\nconvection to the water flowing through the water tubes. The temperature rise of the water flowing\nthrough the tubes and the flow rate are used to calculate the heat pipe power throughput. The distilled\nwater coolant is pumped from a tank under the test setup, through a 50-\xc2\xb5m filter, and into the calorimeter.\nThe coolant exiting the calorimeter then flows through two liquid-to-air heat exchangers, which are also\nmounted under the test setup. Heat is ultimately rejected to the room air.\n\nLife Test Operating Results\nThe program goal was successfully reached through 10 years of operation at 700 \xef\x82\xb0C. The test\noperations began in summer 1996 and were completed on June 1, 2010. A total of 87,783 hr (10 years) of\noperation at 700 \xef\x82\xb0C were accomplished over this time period. The heat pipe continued to operate without\napparent variation in thermal performance for the entire duration of the life test program. A complete\ndescription of the history of the life test is presented in a final report supplied to NASA, which also\ndescribes the shutdowns and required supporting equipment repairs (Rosenfeld, Minnerly, and\nDyson 2011).\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942011-217206\n\n4\n\nPost-Operation Analysis Results\nThis section of the paper describes the post-test analysis of the sodium and the heat pipe envelope.\nThe goal of this task was to measure and evaluate changes to the sodium chemistry and envelope\nmetallurgy incurred during the long-term operation of the heat pipe.\n\nPost-Test Analysis of the Working Fluid Chemistry\nAt the conclusion of testing, a sodium sample was removed from the heat pipe for analysis. After\nremoval from the support test stand, the two heat pipe fill tubes were torch heated to drive liquid sodium\nout of them. The heat pipe was then placed in an argon-filled glove box, and the fill tubes were cut off. A\nclean stainless steel vessel with a 0.25-in. connecting tube was welded onto one of the fill tubes on the\nheat pipe. A tube section with a vacuum valve was welded onto the other fill tube. The heat pipe was then\nheated, and about 10 g of sodium were pushed into the collection vessel under argon pressure. The\ncollection vessel was then placed in an argon glove box, and a solution was prepared by dissolving 1 g in\ndeionized water in a glass Pyrex beaker. The sodium hydroxide solution was then diluted to 500 ml. The\nresulting solution was acidified with nitric acid to a 2.0 pH, as determined by pH paper.\nThe aqueous sample was placed into a Nalgene bottle and sent to Lehigh Testing Laboratories for\nchemical analysis. The sodium solution was scanned from ~160 to ~800 nm with a Spectro CIROS, sideon plasma, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP\xe2\x80\x93AES) equipped with a CCD\ndetector. A background blank of 2000 mg/L sodium solution from a traceable stock solution was also\nscanned; this sample was also acidified with nitric acid. Element peaks above the background scan were\nnoted and a method was generated for these elements, which were then quantified using the same ICP\xe2\x80\x93\nAES. Calibration curves for each of the elements determined were constructed using traceable standards,\nwhich included a matrix of 2000 mg/L sodium based upon the sample preparation specifications. A\ncomparison of the sodium peaks (standard, blank, and sample) suggests that the value has good integrity.\nThus, a sample concentration of 1 g/500 ml or 2000 mg/L was used to quantify the elemental\nconcentration data. In other words, the solution concentration in parts per million is equal to the\nconcentrations of other elements found in the sodium sample. The following elements were found using\nthis analysis method: 18 ppm lithium, 713 ppm boron, 15 ppm magnesium, 286 ppm aluminum,\n7171 ppm silicon, 177 ppm potassium, 86 ppm calcium, 39 ppm chromium, 4 ppm manganese, 198 ppm\niron, 98 ppm copper, 78 ppm zinc, 0.6 ppm strontium, 5 ppm zirconium, and 949 ppm barium.\nThe possible sources of these elements include being dissolved from the envelope or screen wicks, or\nthat some were initially present as contaminants in the sodium fluid charge. Review of the Inconel alloy\ncomposition shows that boron, manganese, iron, chromium, silicon, and aluminum may have dissolved\ninto the sodium from the envelope inner surface. Similarly, iron, chromium, manganese, and silicon are\npresent as alloying elements in the 316 stainless steel screen wick material. All other elements found in\nthe sodium sample could only have been present as contaminants in the initial sodium source, that is, in\nthe original fluid charge. It appears that a representative sample of the original charge sodium may be\navailable and a similar analysis on the source sodium will be performed to define the starting sodium\nchemistry.\n\nPost-Test Analysis of the Envelope and Wick Materials\nThe inside of the heat pipe was neutralized and cleaned after recovering as much sodium as possible.\nThen several sections of the heat pipe envelope were selected for detailed analysis. The heat pipe was first\ncut into two pieces; smaller samples were then removed from the halves. A wire electron discharge\nmachining (EDM) approach was used to remove the test samples. Figure 2 shows the two sections of the\nheat pipe after the samples were removed. The outer surface of the envelope retained a natural dark oxide\ncoating.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942011-217206\n\n5\n\nFigure 2.\xe2\x80\x94The sectioned halves of the heat pipe.\n\nTABLE 2.\xe2\x80\x94HEAT PIPE ENVELOPE/WICK SAMPLE DESCRIPTIONS\nSample number\nHeat pipe region\nSpecific features comments\n1A\nEvaporator\nScreen wick/Screen artery\n1B\nAdiabatic\nScreen wick\n2A\nEvaporator/Adiabatic\nInternal support divider/Weld joint\n2B\nEvaporator/Adiabatic\nInternal support divider/Weld joint\n3\nFill tube\nFill tube\n4\nCorner/Adiabatic\nCorner with other fill tube\n5A\nEvaporator\nScreen wick/Screen artery\n5B\nAdiabatic\nScreen wick\n6\nCondenser\nScreen wick/Artery\n\nA total of six envelope/wick samples were removed for analysis. Sample regions included envelope\nsamples taken from the heat pipe evaporator, adiabatic, and condenser regions. For some locations, a\nsingle-wire EDM cut removed two samples that provided a lower side (evaporator) sample and an upper\nside (adiabatic) sample from each location. These samples were designated A and B, respectively. Table 2\ndescribes the location of each sample. The samples were then delivered to GRC for metallography and\nelectron microscopy analysis. Samples were sectioned, nickel-plated, mounted, and polished. Figure 3\nshows the sample preparation steps. A detailed report on the analysis results is being supplied as a final\nreport to NASA GRC (Rosenfeld, Minnerly, and Kosta, 2011). The following discussion presents one\nenvelope-analysis example for each heat pipe region.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942011-217206\n\n6\n\nFigure 3.\xe2\x80\x94Sample preparation steps showing an EDM-cut sample, subsequent sectioning, and the\nmounted/polished cross-section. In each photo, the screen artery is denoted with a red arrow.\n\nHeat Pipe Envelope\nElectron microprobe microstructural analysis of the inner surface of the envelope in the heat pipe\nevaporator section showed about 30 \xc2\xb5m that was significantly affected (Fig. 4). Significant porosity was\nfound in the Inconel 718 surface that was in contact with the sodium. Figure 5 shows a microprobe\nwavelength dispersive spectroscopy (WDS) quantitative line scan of major elements found in test sample\n1A near the sodium-exposed surface. In this 30 \xc2\xb5m region, the relative quantity of nickel dropped\nsubstantially while some elements, including niobium, iron, silicon, and titanium, had relatively higher\nconcentration than in the sample interior. Sample 5A showed similar results. Microprobe analysis also\nwas performed on the outer envelope wall near the silicon carbide heaters. There appeared to be an\nincrease in nickel concentration and a decrease in molybdenum and iron concentrations in a region about\n100 \xc2\xb5m in thickness. The elemental concentrations were constant throughout most of the wall thickness\nwith no clear indications of a diffusion gradient.\nMicroprobe analysis was performed on samples taken from the adiabatic region of the heat pipe, for\nexample Samples 1B and 5B, and from the condenser region, Sample 6. Analysis of these mounted and\npolished cross-sections showed similar metallurgy changes to those found in the evaporator region. An\napproximately 30-\xc2\xb5m-thick region near the inner envelope surface had notable porosity, was depleted of\nnickel, and had increased concentrations of some other alloying elements.\nBecause the nickel was apparently removed from the inner envelope surface in the evaporator region,\nan effort was made to determine if nickel was transported by the sodium to other regions of the heat pipe.\nNo evidence of nickel deposition was observed in any sample; in fact, nickel removal to a 30 \xc2\xb5m depth\nwas typically observed near the inner envelope surface in all of the analyzed samples. Loss of the nickel\nto the sodium would seem to be the most likely explanation; however the sodium chemical analysis did\nnot reveal notable nickel levels. Plating out at cooler regions would also seem likely, but evidence of\nplating was not found. The higher concentration of nickel at the outer surface suggests possible diffusion\nthrough the wall, yet there was no concentration gradient indicative of diffusion. The outer surface of the\nheat pipe envelope was covered with a dark oxide that typically forms from long exposure to air at high\ntemperature.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942011-217206\n\n7\n\n30\xc2\xa0\xef\x81\xadm\n\nFigure 4.\xe2\x80\x94Electron microprobe back scattered image showing the 30 \xef\x81\xadm\naffected region observed on the sodium side of sample 1A.\n\nSS wire\n\nNi plating\n\nIN718\n\n100.000\nAl\xc2\xa0wt%\n\n90.000\n\nNi\xc2\xa0wt%\n\n80.000\n\nCr\xc2\xa0wt%\n\n70.000\n\nFe\xc2\xa0wt%\nTi\xc2\xa0wt%\n\n60.000\n\nNb\xc2\xa0wt%\n\n50.000\n\nCo\xc2\xa0wt%\nTa\xc2\xa0wt%\n\n40.000\n\nMo\xc2\xa0wt%\n30.000\n\nCu\xc2\xa0wt%\n\n20.000\n\nMn\xc2\xa0wt%\nNa\xc2\xa0wt%\n\n10.000\n\nSi\xc2\xa0wt%\nwt%\xc2\xa0Totals\n\n0.000\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\xc2\xa0\nDistance,\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb5m\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n30\xc2\xa0\xef\x81\xadm\xc2\xa0reaction\xc2\xa0zone\n\nFigure 5.\xe2\x80\x94Electron microprobe image and wavelength dispersive spectroscopy (WDS)\nquantitative line scan of major elements for test sample 1A near the sodium (inner)\nsurface.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942011-217206\n\n8\n\nHeat Pipe Wick Structure Analysis\nThe screen wick material was analyzed to determine the effects of long-term exposure to the sodium\nworking fluid. Observations of the electron beam welds indicated no evidence of corrosion in the weld\nmetal or heat-affected zone. Electron beam weld penetrations were measured to be between 3.5 and\n5.4 mm. Microprobe analysis indicated deposition of sodium, oxygen, and carbon on the surface of the\nscreen wires. These elements were most likely residues of sodium hydroxide and sodium methoxide that\nremained from the sodium removal and disposal process. Some evidence was seen of species migration in\nthe screen wires; this effect did not seem to affect the integrity of the wires. Physical observation showed\nthat the wires retained ductility and did not separate from the envelope inner surfaces near the tack-weld\nlocations.\n\nConclusions and Recommendations\nA sodium heat pipe demonstrated favorable materials compatibility and heat transport characteristics\nat 700 \xef\x82\xb0C while operating in air for over 10 years. A representative one-tenth segment Stirling Space\nPower Converter heat pipe with an Inconel 718 envelope and a stainless steel screen wick has operated\nfor over 87,000 hr at nearly 700 \xef\x82\xb0C. Post-test analysis revealed no significant degradation of the envelope\nor screen wick material as a result of the life test. The life test provides strong evidence for long-term\nchemical compatibility of sodium heat pipes at high operating temperatures.\nPost-test analysis of the sodium working fluid showed small quantities of more than a dozen other\nelements, some of which may have been originally present in the sodium. An analysis is planned for the\noriginal sodium source, to determine the sodium chemistry changes due to its operational history as a heat\npipe working fluid.\nSignificant migration of alloying elements was observed, though the total effect on the envelope\nintegrity was minimal. A 30-\xc2\xb5m region of the inner surface had significant porosity and nickel depletion.\nThe cause of this material transport is still under investigation.\n\nReferences\nDussinger, P.M., and Lindemuth, J.E., Insoluble Coatings for Stirling Engine Heat Pipe Condenser\nSurfaces, final report NASA CR-202323, NASA Contract No. NAS3-26925, July 1997.\nRosenfeld, J.H., and Ernst, D.M., \xe2\x80\x9cAdvances in Refractory Metal Heat Pipe Technology,\xe2\x80\x9d in Heat Pipe\nScience and Technology: Proc. 11th Int.

SUPPLEMENTARY NOTES\n\n14. ABSTRACT\n\nHigh-temperature heat pipes are being evaluated for use in energy conversion applications such as fuel cells, gas turbine re-combustors,\nStirling cycle heat sources; and with the resurgence of space nuclear power both as reactor heat removal elements and as radiator elements.\nLong operating life and reliable performance are critical requirements for these applications. Accordingly, long-term materials compatibility\nis being evaluated through the use of high-temperature life test heat pipes. Thermacore, Inc., has carried out a sodium heat pipe 10-year life\ntest to establish long-term operating reliability. Sodium heat pipes have demonstrated favorable materials compatibility and heat transport\ncharacteristics at high operating temperatures in air over long time periods. A representative one-tenth segment Stirling Space Power\nConverter heat pipe with an Inconel 718 envelope and a stainless steel screen wick has operated for over 87,000 hr (10 years) at nearly 700 \xc2\xb0\nC. These life test results have demonstrated the potential for high-temperature heat pipes to serve as reliable energy conversion system\ncomponents for power applications that require long operating lifetime with high reliability. Detailed design specifications, operating\nhistory, and post-test analysis of the heat pipe and sodium working fluid are described. Lessons learned and future life test plans are also\ndiscussed.\n15. SUBJECT TERMS\n\nHeat pipe; Life test; Sodium; High temperature; Stirling engine; Space power\n16. SECURITY CLASSIFICATION OF:\na.
