The phase space density n at 2 R sub J for electrons with equatorial pitch angles less than 69 deg is reduced by a factor of 4.2 x 1000 when lunar absorption is included in the calculation. For protons with equatorial pitch angles less than 69 deg, the corresponding reduction factor is 3.2 x 100000. The effect of the satellites becomes progressively weaker for both electrons and protons as equatorial pitch angles of pi/2 are approached, because the likelihood of impacting a satellite becomes progressively smaller. The large density decreases which we find at the orbits of Io, Europa, and Ganymede result in corresponding particle flux decreases that should be observed by spacecraft making particle measurements in Jupiter's magnetosphere. The characteristic signature of satellite absorption should be a downward pointing cusp in the flux versus radius curve at the L-value corresponding to each satellite.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19740004368, "id": "526d75b5056e46459248bae23e560c37", "publicationDate": "1973-11-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19740004368.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19740004368/downloads/19740004368.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19740004368/downloads/19740004368.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19740004368/downloads/19740004368.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
