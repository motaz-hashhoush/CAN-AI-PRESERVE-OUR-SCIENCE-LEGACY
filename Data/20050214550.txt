b'Close out and Final report for\nNASA Glenn Cooperative Agreement NCC3-906\nSilicon Carbide Growth\nResearch\nAndrew Trunek has focused on supporting the S i c team through the growth of S i c crystals,\nmaking observations and conducting research that meets the collective needs and requirements of\nthe team while fulfilling program commitments. Cancellation of the Ultra Efficient Engine\nTechnology (UEET) program has had a significant negative impact on resources and research\ngoals. This report highlights advancements and achievements made with this cooperative\nagreement over the past year. NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) continues to make advances\nin silicon carbide (Sic) research during the past year. Step free surfaces were used as substrates\nfor the deposition of GaN epilayers that yielded very low dislocation densities. Defect free 3CS i c was successfully nucleated on step free mesas and test diodes were fabricated. Web growth\ntechniques were used to increase the usable surface area of dislocation free S i c by 4 0 % . The\ngreatest advancement has been attained on stepped surfaces of Sic. A metrology standard was\ndeveloped using high temperature etching techniques titled "Nanometer Step Height Standard".\nThis development culminated in being recognized for a 2004 R&D100 award and the process to\nproduce the steps received a NASA Space Act award.\n\nAixtron CVD Reactor\nWithout significant investment in time and research dollars, which would have had a negative\nimpact on meeting program commitments, efforts to attain rotational capability have been\nsuspended. A decision was made to accept and use reactor components that allow S i c research to\ncontinue and meet program commitments. This includes the use of a S i c foam insulator and TaC\ncoated graphite components. Although not optimized for yield, the components selected for use\nare sufficient for proof of concept research currently being conducted. The results obtained to\ndate do not indicate that reactor components are preventing research goals from being obtained.\nContinued development of reactors and reactor components will be driven by program\nrequirements and resource availability.\n\n3C-Sic By Step-Free Heteroepitaxy\nSchottky diodes were fabricated from heteroepitaxially grown 3C-Sic on 4H-Sic substrates. A\nportion of the epilayer was heavily doped with aluminum. This is suspected of causing a\ncontamination issue with the reactor. Although it was never positively identified as the source of\ncontamination, its use coincided with the presence of the nano contamination. This\ncontamination prevented the realization of atomically flat surfaces suitable for nucleation of\ndefect free 3C-Sic. Each of the nano contaminates would act as nucleation sights for S i c\nclusters. These numerous nucleation sites would result in a film of highly defective 3C being\ngrown on the surface of the mesa. The realization of defect free 3C-Sic could not be obtained\nuntil clean step free surfaces were attained with a repeatable process.\n\nPreviously grown defect free 3C-Sic were used for the fabrication of diodes with improved\ncontact metallization. These diodes were successfully operated at high temperatures and under\nelectrical stress with no degradation in S i c crystal structure or failure of the contacts. This\nindicates that 3C is the thermodynamically stable polytype of S i c while avoiding the localized\npolytype transformations that have been observed by others [ l , 21. The results of this\nachievement are scheduled to be presented at the International Conference on Silicon Carbide\nand Related Materials 20005 (ICSCRMOS) by another member of the S i c team.\n\nStep Height Standard or Stepped Sic Sur$aces\n\nA significant investment in resources was devoted to development of S i c with highly ordered\nsteps etched into the surface. As technology moves toward the nano scale there is a lack of a\nmetrology standard for calibrating\ninstruments like atomic force microscopes\nat the nano scale. Taking advantage of the\natomic spacing between silicon and carbon\natoms and the stacking sequence of\nhexagonal S i c it is possible to etch S i c to\nproduce steps on the surface of the\nsubstrate that have step heights of 0.5 and\n1.0 nm (Figure 1). The \xe2\x80\x9cNano Meter Step\nHeight Standard\xe2\x80\x9d was selected for a 2004\nR&D 100 award. The process for\ndeveloping the well ordered step patterns\non the surface of S i c was titled \xe2\x80\x9cMethod\nFor Production of Atomic Scale Step\nHeight Reference Specimens With\nAtomically Flat Surfaces.\xe2\x80\x9d This process\nwas submitted and selected for a 2004\nNASA Space Act award. Currently efforts\nare underway to transition this technology Figure 1. AFM scan of peak of Figure 1 mesa rooftop\nto the commercial sector.\nregion showing pyramidal step pattern (rooftop) created by\nstepflow etching.\n\nNitrides on Atomically Flat S i c\nGRC has continued to collaborate with Naval Research Laboratories (NRL) on the use of step\nfree S i c as a preferred substrate material for the deposition of GaN. Because of the close lattice\nmatch between S i c and GaN of -1% it has been theorized that S i c substrates would yield much\nlower dislocation densities [3]. However, all previous efforts have used S i c substrates with an\nintentional off cut angle of 3.5\xe2\x80\x9d-8\xe2\x80\x9d from the (0001) plane toward <I 120> which results in a high\ndensity of surface steps. NRL presented results obtained depositing GaN on SIC using GRC\nprepared stepped and step free S i c surfaces and the associated reduction in defect density.\nBecause of the high density of screw dislocations in commercial substrates on the order of lo4\ncm-\xe2\x80\x99 it is impossible to produce large step-free surfaces on as received commercial substrates.\nThis collaborative effort is still in the early stages of development and GRC will continue to\nprovide NRL with step free surfaces for process development.\n\nExpansion of Defect Free S i c by Web Growth\nS i c mesas can be expanded latterly through the use of cantilever development. However the\nlimitation on this technique has been unwanted growth in trenches interfering with and stopping\ncantilever development while inducing dislocations. It has been speculated that if trench growth\ncould be suppressed that cantilever expansion\ncould be continued as long as step flow growth\nconditions can be maintained. That is\nmaintaining the surface mobility of the adatoms\nsuch that they migrate to the edge of the\ncantilever and incorporate into the crystal\nstructure at the edge. If the adatoms nucleate on\nthe step free surface the stacking sequence\ninformation will not be present and the resulting\npolytype will be 3C-Sic. Development of a\nselective epitaxial growth mask is being pursued\nto suppress trench growth. Very recent results\nusing TaC as a mask material indicates that\ntrench growth can be entirely suppressed and\nthe mask will survive extended periods in the Figure 2.

This effort has been lead by\nThis effort will continue to expand\nDr. Gary Hunter and the results have been very positive [4].\nthe sensitivity of the sensor by placing the sensing element on a thin cantilever. Current efforts to\nproduce cantilevers sufficiently large enough have been hampered by trench growth. Selective\nepitaxial growth masks will be employed to realize web based gas sensor technology.\n\nResearch Forecast\n1. Produce 4W6H-Sic cantilevers that are completely free of defects on both open and closed\nmesa shaped patterns with doping profiles suitable for device fabrication. Initial devices\nwould be used for characterizing the quality of the S i c crystal material. This would be\nfollowed by large area devices. It is proposed to systematically investigate how dopant atoms\nare incorporated into the cantilever regions. Achieving the required net donor and acceptor\nconcentrations for device applications will be required.\nGrowth in the trench area between mesa shapes has prevented GRC from producing\ncantilevers on both open and closed mesa shapes of sufficient size for device fabrication. In\norder to take advantage of GRC\xe2\x80\x99s unique mesa growth capability, a selective epitaxial growth\nmask to suppress trench growth must be developed.\n\n2. Develop Nanometer Step Height Standard parameters for repeatability consistency and\nmaximum yield. This is required for transitioning the technology to the commercial sector.\n3. Nucleate and grow the cubic form of Sic (3C-Sic) on step free mesas and cantilevers as a\nsingle defect free heteroepitaxial epi layer. The heteroepi would be used for fabrication of\nS i c devices capable of exploiting the characteristics of 3C-Sic (i.e., MOSFETS and HBT\xe2\x80\x99s).\nLarge (equivalent to 1 cm2) areas of 3C-Sic completely free of defects, with sufficient\ndoping, thickness, yield, carrier lifetime, etc. to realize high-voltage power devices in 3C-Sic\nwill be developed. Additionally, small area devices can be realized for material\ncharacterization and small signal applications (i.e., sensors).\n4. Produce step free regions of increased area to be used as a substrate as part of a collaborative\nresearch effort with Navy Research Labs (NRL) for GaN growth on S i c with reduced defect\ndensities. Increase the size of the step free regions using selective epi growth mask\ntechniques.\n\nI\n\nTechnical Papers\n1. N.D. Bassim, M.E. Twigg, C.R. Eddy, J.C. Culbertson, M.A. Mastro, R.L.
