The initiative described is a multi-year, multi-center technology development and flight demonstration program. The initiative features the further development of technologies in aircraft automation already being pursued at multiple NASA centers and Department of Defense (DoD) research and Development (R and D) facilities. The proposed initiative involves the development of technologies in intelligent systems, guidance, control, software development, airborne computing, navigation, communications, sensors, unmanned vehicles, and air traffic control. It involves the integration and implementation of these technologies to the extent necessary to conduct selected and incremental flight demonstrations.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19910016826, "id": "8d330b1e1ff4453a86e7cb0a4d5deb77", "publicationDate": "1991-07-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19910016826.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19910016826/downloads/19910016826.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19910016826/downloads/19910016826.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19910016826/downloads/19910016826.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
