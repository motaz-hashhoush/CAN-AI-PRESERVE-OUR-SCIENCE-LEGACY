In order to make alternate fuels (and blends) a viable option for aviation, the fuel must be able to perform at a similar or higher level than traditional petroleum fuel. They also attempt to curb harmful emissions, and therefore a truly effective alternate fuel would emit at or under the level of currently used fuel. This report analyzes data from gaseous and particulate emissions of an aircraft combustor sector. The data were evaluated at various inlet conditions, including variation in pressure and temperature, fuel-to-air ratios, and percent composition of alternate fuel. Traditional JP-8+100 data were taken as a baseline, and blends of JP-8+100 with synthetic-paraffinic-kerosene (SPK) fuel (Fischer-Tropsch (FT)) were used for comparison. Gaseous and particulate emissions, as well as flame luminosity, were assessed for differences between FT composition of 0, 50, and 100 percent. The data show that SPK fuel (an FT-derived fuel) had slightly lower harmful gaseous emissions, and smoke number information corroborated the hypothesis that SPK-FT fuels are cleaner burning fuels.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20140002879, "endDate": "2012-03-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Technische Univ.", "location": "Darmstadt, Germany"}}, "meetingId": "26f3e56f40234fc48e89f9ec6c70e5b9", "id": "0348636ad96443e196f8842d9e58f8ca"}], "name": "International Symposium on Transport Phenomena and Dynamics of Rotating Machinery (ISROMAC-14)", "location": "Honolulu, HI", "id": "26f3e56f40234fc48e89f9ec6c70e5b9", "startDate": "2012-02-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20140002879, "id": "b4d5f4bca2204c3483a97e06a1a169bc", "publicationDate": "2013-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20140002879.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20140002879/downloads/20140002879.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20140002879/downloads/20140002879.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20140002879/downloads/20140002879.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
