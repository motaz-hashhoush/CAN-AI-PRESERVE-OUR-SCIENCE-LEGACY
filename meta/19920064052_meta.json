Activity-vs-depth profiles of short-lived radioactivities measured in the top centimeter of lunar rocks agree with profiles calculated with directly measured solar-proton fluxes since about 1965 and were used with indirect observations to get solar-proton fluxes back to 1956. Lunar-rock profiles for long-lived radionuclides have been used to infer solar-proton fluxes averaged over several time periods in the past. New results are reported for solar-proton-produced Kr-81 measured in lunar rock 68815. Activities of 76,000-yr Ni-59 can be used to get fluxes of solar alpha particles averaged over the last 100,000 yr. The average solar-proton fluxes in the past are not greatly different from those observed during the last three 11-yr solar cycles. The work that needs to be done to determine more and better fluxes of energetic particles from the sun in the past is discussed.", "title": "Solar-cosmic-ray fluxes during the last ten million years", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-15T16:04:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19920064052, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Reedy, Robert C."}, "organization": {"name": "Los Alamos National Laboratory", "location": "NM, United States"}}, "id": "3ef3238f2f8e42c7afea7fdeae08d006"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19920064052, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Marti, Kurt"}, "organization": {"name": "California, University", "location": "San Diego, United States"}}, "id": "8d3d5e08c3d847ebbfadbe5b0e80bd9c"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Proceedings", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19920064052, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19920064052, "id": "53c788116202407abce527a369696f4d", "publicationDate": "1991-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
