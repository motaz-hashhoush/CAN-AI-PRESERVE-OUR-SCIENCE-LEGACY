Langley\'s\neffort disintegrated over the Potomac River.\nAnd on December 17. 1903, Orville Wright\npiloted man\'s first successful powered flight in\na heavier-than-air vehicle; a flight which if undertaken today could be completed within the\nfuselage of a DC-10. His short 120 foot trip\n(0.02.3 of a passenger mile) marked the beginning of rqan\'s conquest of the sky, and the s!art\nof a multi-million dollar industry, which in 197\'i\nalone resulted in 120 billion passenger-miles. It\nfreed man from the earth and darted him on his\nway to the moon in less than 66 years.\nThe aviation industry has had a tremendous influence on the American way of life: in\ntime, in mobility, in technology, in weaving our\nsocial fabric. Much of its influence, nevertheless, remains highly misunderstood and unexplored. Although aviation has touched the lives\nof millions of people, most of their contact with\nit has been either through the Ilse,or the image,\nof scheduled air carriers in operation around\nthe world. Air carriers, however, represent only\na small proportion of the total fleet of aircraft\nusing the airspace, and serve only a small proportion of the landing facilities available\naround the country. Exclusive of the military,\nthe other side of the civilian aviation coin is\nknown as General Aviation, and is defined institutionally as incorporating all operating\ncivilian aircraft other than the air carriers,\nwhich are certificated by the Civil Aeronautics\nBoard.\nToday there are approximately 3,000\naircraft beirg used by air carriers, while in excess of 130,MN) make up the general aviation\nfleet. Of the 13,000 airports in the United States,\nonly about 500 are served by air carriers in contrast to total use by general aviation vehicles.\nGeneral aviation employs thousands of persons\nin this country in a wide variety of occupations,\nincluding aircraft crews, direct and indirect\nground support personnel, and manufacturers.\nGeneral aviation is assuming an incraasingly important role in the national\ntransportation picture: in 1976! general av~ation\n\' "Non-Busmess Planes Carr~ed tv.\'l~on.\'Newpon News\n90\nDe~lyPress, July 25. 1975. p 42\n\nPRECEDING PAGE BLANK NOT\n\naircraft flew 3.8 billion miles and carried 90\nmillion people.\'\nGeneral aviation provides a wide variety of\nfunctions, varying from the actual transportation of wuple and goods through charter,\ncargo, mail, executive transport, and air taxi\noperations; to sports, recreational, and instructional activities.

For definitions of these and\nother terms, see the Glossary (Appendix E).\n\nCapabilities and Performance\nThe airplane is a specific type of flight\nvehicle or aircraft, propelled through the air by\na powerplant which exerts ~ t s\nforce preponderantly forward. It is sustained in the air by the\nforces created by differential pressures exerted\non its exposed surfaces, mainly its fixed wlngs,\ndue to its motion through the air.\nFcr purposes of considering its incorporatlon into an aviation system, the airplane can be\nconsidered as an imaginary box, the c,rnensions of which portray a volume of air around it\nwhich is forbidden to other aircraft; the airplane\n\nis at its center. The dimensions of the box (actually a rectangular figure) are variable individually with p h a e of operation \',e.g., operation in a termlnal area). The important point is\nthat the airplane interdicts a sizeable airspace\nand ground area, and this space may be, and\nsometimes is, the same for a small airplane as\nfor a large one.\nThe airplane is a moderately constrained\nvehicle in terms of its freedom to move in\nvarious directions relative to its own plane of\nsymmetry. In flight its broadest-band\ncapabilit~es in that plane, and are those of\nare\nsteady or nearly steady movement. These\ncapabilities are known collectively as its static\nperformance, consisting of climbs, cruise\nflight, and descents.\nStraight and Level Flight\nThe straight and level unaccelerated flight\ncapability of an airplane may be portrayed by a\ngraph showing true airspeed (not\ngroundspeed) against altitude. Figure 1-1 11lustrates the "flight envelope." The curved line\n\nTRUE AIRSPEED\nCAPABILITIES: THE FLIGHT ENVELOPE\nFIGURE 1-1\n\nat the left represents the trend of stalling\nspeed, the speed below which the airplane cannot be flown straight and level, because of insufficient aerodynamic lift. The long line is the\nstalling speed in "clean" (gear and high-lift\ndevices retracted) configuration; the short lines\ngive the stalling speeds for other configurations; takeoff, segmented climb, and landing.\nThe horizontal line at the top of the figure\nrepresents the maximum altitude for which the\nairplane is certificated. It may be well below the\nabsolute ceiling of the airplane since reasons\nsuch as safety in event of a window blowout or\noxygen requirements may govern the choice of\nthe highest altitude for which certification is\nsought.\nThe crooked line on the right represents\nthe highest speed or Mach number in normal\nflight for which the airplane is certificated. The\nsymbol Vmo means "maximum operating\nvelocity" and Mmo means "maximum operating Mach number." These speeds are usually\nvery close to the top speeds the airplane can attain, and are set by a combination of structural\nand handling-qualities requirements.\n\nwhich IS satisfactory for use in flight on airways. Emergency descents of 1,500 feet per\nminute or even more can be made with\nreasonable pitch angle changes and within acceptable limits of operation, though in\nunpressurized airplanes there is risk of damage\nto passengers\' ears.\nThe "best approach" angle at which landing approaches may be performed is that representing a power-off (engines idling) glide at an\nairspeed about 30 percent above that for stall,\nwith flaps fully extended and landing gear\ndown. The angle may be anywhere from about 5\nto 9 degrees. Steeper approaches may be\nmade, but some pilots consider that safety\nlevels are reduced at the higher angles. The\n"ILS landing approach" angle of 2.5 to 3\ndegrees is established by the angle that the\nglide slope beam of an instrument landing\nsystem transmitter makes with the ground. This\nshallow angle almost always requires that\nengine power or thrust be above idle setting,\nand this increases the degree of control the\npilot has over the glide angle (since the throttle\nis a climb and descent control).\n\nClimb and Descent\nGenerally, an airplane does not climb without first pitching its nose up; at its maximum\nspeed it has no climb capability at all. The maximum rate of climb is generally realized at an\nairspeed about 215 of the way between stalling\nspeed and top speed.\nThe maxium angle of climb is important for\ntakeoffs and for climbs which emergency conditions may necessitate performing near the\nground. Thls can vary with size and type of\naircraft, and with speed and flight configuration\nof a given type. Small, slow airplanes may have\nclean-configuration maximum climb angles of\nperhaps 14 degrees or so; the business jets may\nachieve 40-degree angles.\nAn airplane may be caused to descend\nwithout pitching by retarding the throttle (the\nthrottle is said by some flight instructors to be\nthe basic climb-and-descent control, though\nthis is oversimpli3tic). Except in air-carrier\noperation this is not an important maneuver. A\nmore popular descent technique is to establish\nsome fixed vertical speed while retaining cruising airspeed (approximately). In the cockpit of\npractically all modern airplanes there is an instrument called a Vertical Speed Indicator, and\na popular vertical speed for descents out of\nground proximity is 500 feet per minute, a rate\nfor which the apparent nose-down acgle of the\ncabin is not disturbing to passengers, and\n\nOther Changes of FligM Path\nThe airplane is an awkward machine to\nturn; i t must be turned and banked\nsimultaneously, much as a car requires banked\ncurves on roads. A conventional airplane cannot move directly sideways at all except by slipping, during which altitude typically must be\nlost because the aerodynamic drag (rearward)\nforce on the airplane increases, and the\nairplane must either slow down or descend or\ndo both, as a consequence. The slipping\nmaneuver was popular years ago as a means of\nsteepening landing approach paths, but its\ncapability is very limited. The advent of trailing\nedge flaps in about 1940 made it largely unnecessary, except as an aid in making\ncrosswind landings. Recently Interest has\nrevived in improving the ability of the airplane\nto move sideways, this time as a means of making adjustments in the lateral position of the\nfinal approach path relative to a landing field\nrunway. This ability can be important for instrument flight operations.\nIn turning flight, the measure is the radius\nof turn, a function both of speed and of bank\nangle. As a general rule, the radius of a turn\nmay be decreased (the turn made tighter) by increasing the bank angle. At a given bank angle\na slow airplane is able to turn tighter than a fast\none, so the minimum turning radii of small\nairplanes are generally in the hundreds of feet,\nwhile those of fast airplanes such as fighters\n\nare generally thousands of feet long. Power is\nrequired to make a level turn, in excess of that\nrequired to drive the airplane straight. Consequently, as the speed of an airplane is increased toward its top speed, its ability to turn\ngradually deteriorates until at top speed it cannot make level turns at all, but must slow down\nto do so. Passengers will begin to take notice,\nand some will be disturbed if turns are made\nwith bank angles more than 30 to 45 degrees.\nHistorically, there has been a fairly close\nrelationship between the size and the maxium\nspeed of airplanes marketed successfully in the\nUnited States. The smaller airplanes have maximum speeds near 100 knots. As gross weight\nrises, maximum speed also rises, until at the\ntop of the weight range for six-passenger\nsingle-engine airplanes (about 3,800 pounds)\nit is on the order of 200-220 knots. Larger\npiston-engine airplanes, the twins, are only a\nlittle faster than this, because of the\nunavailability of engines of more than about\n350 horsepower. The turbin powered twins use\nengines of 600 1,000 horsepower, and so are\nconsiderably faster than piston twins of comparable size, with maximum spaeds on the\norder of 250 knots. This size-speed relationship\nhas not changed much in recent years.\nThe turbofan and turbojet airplanes,\nwhatever their weights, have maximum speed\nof 350-450 knots. The lack of size-dependence\nis due to the fact that the jet airplanes are\nlimited by the effects of the compressibility of\nair on their ability economically to achieve\nhigh-speed flight. The speeds of the jet\nairplanes are well above those of propeller\nairplanes of any size, though military propeller\nairplanes during World War II were occasionally flown straight and level at speeds just\nabove 430 knots, during development programs.\nLittle on the technological horizon has appeared to indicate that the above relationships\nwill change much. New type piston engine\ndevelopment is moribund, the fuel economy of\nthe Wankel engine is not outstanding, and\nthere is a large region extending from about\nMach 0.9 to about Mach 1.5 in which efficient\nairplanes are difficult to develop.\n\n-\n\nTakeoff and Landing\nAirplanes can be built which will take off\nand land in any given distance, including zero.\nTakeoff and landing distances depend strongly\non stalling speeds, but in general, power is required to fly slow, below a certain point, just as\nit is required to fly fast. This means that the\navailable technology, as well as the market\n\nplace, will establish whatever relationships exist between field performance and other design\nfeatures.\nThree identifiable technological levels\nhave evolved into which marketed airplanes\nhave been divided. (1) Conventional Takeoff\nand Landing (CTOL) technology is typified by\nsimple flaps, such as appear on most general\naviation airplanes. (2) Reduced Takeoff and\nLanding (RTOL) incorporates complex flaps\nand leading-edge high-lift devices called slots,\nslats, and Krijgers, and perhaps a little powered\nlift. (3) Short Takeoff and Landing (STOL)\nairplanes use energy, in addition to that supplied to ihe main propulsive means (e.g., prop)\nto produce lift directly, through boundary layer\ncontrol or lifting fans. Historically, STOL\nairplanes have not found a market except with\nthe military. RTOL airplanes, slich as the Boeing 727, are in operation, but the only small\nairplanes in the category have beer, isolated\nsingle examples because of the expense involved in adopting the technology.\nField performance data on specific\nairplanes are given slsewhere, but it is instructive to look at what corporate and utility\nairplane operators have considered to be adequate field length requirements. Two surveys of\nsuch operators made some years ago, indicate\nthat all operators would be satisfied with 2,000foot-or-shorter field performance, but field\nlength requirements of 5,000 feet or longer\nwould satisfy no one.\n\nRange~Payload\nTradeofis\nMost airplanes, except very small ones, are\nweight-limited in such a way that full passengers and f u l l f u ? l cannot be loaded\nsimultaneously without exceeding the maximum certificated gross weight. Figure 1-2\nshows typical ranges for various types of\naircraft starting with full tuel tanks. It also\nshows one of the informative ways in which\nrange-payload information can be portrayed\ngraphically. The empty airplane occlrpies a\npoint at the origin of the graph, and eithei fuel\nor payload must be loaded first. If, for illustrative purposes, payload is considered to be\nloaded first, the lefthand end of the top horizontal line represents the airplane when loading is\ncompleted but fueling has not started; the\nairplane can thus go nowhere. As fueling proceeds, the capability of the airplane is indicated\nby points on the horizontal line. Finally enough\nfuel has been added that the airplane is at its\nmaximum certificated weight, and fueling must\nstop whether the tanks are full or not (point A).\nIf the tanks are filled before the payload is ad-\n\n-\n\nRANGE\n\nTYPICAL MAXIMUM RANGES (Nautical Miles)\nGeneral Aviation A i rcrafl\nLight Airplanes\nBusiness Jets\nAirliners\n\n300-990\n\nTrunk and International\n\n4,000-@30\n\nRANGE - PAYLOAD TRADEOFFS\nFIGURE 1-2\n\nded, the airplane will be represented by points\non the line between "Ferry" (the weight with nc\npayload) and B (the point at which loading\npayload must stop because the airplane has\ns\nagain reached ~ t certificated we~gh:).Between\nA and B, fuel and payload must be traded to\nkeep the gross wetght constant.\n\nThe Fixed-Wing Aircraft Technologies\nThe history of the development of the\nairplane has been that of technological evolu-\n\ntion, with the occasiona! addition of major\njumps in tnnovatlon which nevertheless did not\nchange the definitive outllne of the airplane itself.\n\nAerodynamic Design\nThe general outline of the a~rplane a set\nas\nof wings with stabilizing and control surfaces\nwas detinitive from the start. There were other\nconcepts, but these disappeared rapidly.\nTwo changes took place within a decade\nafter tha first flight. replacement of wing-warping by a~lerons.and settlement on the conclu-\n\nsion that the tail-surface of an airplane\nbelonged behind it. Nothing basic has occurred\nsince then in the area of general aerodynamic\nconfiguration of small subsonic airplanes.\nCombat airplanes underwent evolutionary\ngrowth during World War I, with both sides producing airframes using about the same technology until the Germans introduced the first\nall-metal monoplane, near the end of the conflict. General acceptance of the monoplane\nwaited until the appearance of aluminum i r ~\nsufficient quantities, and of acceptable properties, made the aerodynamically superior in!ernally braced monoplane technically feasible. In\nthe meantime, during the decade of the twenties, the biplane and strut-braced monoplane\nlived side-by-side, with no singular advance in\naerodynamic technology.\nThe next two significant improvements appeared almost simultaneously. The feasibility of\nthe internally-braced monoplar~e resulted in\nhigher wing loadings (thus higher stalling\nspeeds) and In the Increasing significance for\ndrag of items which previously were of minor\nimportance. Flaps and retractable landing gear\nappeared almost together, to make significant\nextensions to both ends of the speed range.\nThe fighters of World War I could fly a little over\ntwice as fast as their stalling speeds; by the\n1930\'s "twice as fast" had become "over three\ntimes as fast."\nAt that point the major contriSut;ons to low\nsubsonic aerodynamic art ceased. Slnce then\nthere have been detail improvementsshaping\nrefinements in ailerons, flaps. slats, airscoops,\nand so on.\nGeneral aviation includes high-subsonic\nairplanes, so the two most significant technical\ncontributions to flight in the Mach-number\nThe\nrange from 0.6 to 0.9 should be ment~oned.\nfirst of these was acc~dental.During the midthirties specially shaped families of airfoils\nwere developed in an attempt to reduce wing\nskin-friction drag. Success in doing this was\nnegligible for various reasons. Of interest,\nhowever, was the fact that the speclal airfoils\nhad better high Mach characteristics than their\npredecessors. Maximum opevating Mach number gains of more than 0.1, or about 15 percent.\nwere possible. The second development,that of\nthe swept wing, wes German, and was not\nknown to the United States until the collapse of\nGermany in 1945. High-subsonic airplane aerodynamic deslgn coasted along on the strength\nof these two developments untll the late 1950\'s.\nwhe.1 Boeing commenced utilizing a further\nrefined airfoil series and tailoring near the junc-\n\ntions of wings and bod!es, in accordance withthe Whitcomb "transonic area rule."\nAerodynamically, the modern airplane is\nar: extremely efficient device. Its propeller\ndelivers thrust horsepower at an installed efficiency, typically, of over 85 percent. The "induced" drag which is an inherent theoretical\npenalty of the production of lift is exceeded by\nonly about 10-15 percent in practice. The\n"parasite" drag which is the penalty for having\na useful load that occupies space, is little more\nthan that which would be experienced by a thin\nflat plate, equal in exposed area to that of the\nairplane\'s exposed skin, drawn through the air\nedgewise, at flight speed. This is approximately\nsix times "cleaner" than a typical automobile\n(the above statements apply to "top-of-tho-art"\nairplanes: unbraced-wing mono-planes with\nretractabls gear).\nOn the low speed end of the flight envelope\nthe airplane does not do so well. It cannot fly\nlevel at any speed below its "stalling" speed,\nwhich can be compared roughly with the cruising speed of an automobi le. The safety implications of having to toucn down no slower than\nthis are obvious and efforts to improve the\nsituation have been continual. The market\nplace typically has called for speed and efficiency, however, and has accepted the risks of\nfast touchdowns.\nIndeed, striving for very low stalling\nspeeds can be more dangerous than not. The\nreason lies in the fact that the aerodynamic\nforce that a control surface (e.g., rudder) can\nexert, is proportional to the square of the speed\nwith whlch it moves through the air. So an\nairplane configured for low speed handling can\nbe oversensitive at high speeds 3r one configured for high speeds too sluggish at low.\nConventional general aviatlon airplanes of\nsmall-to-medium size are typically acceptable\non both ends of the speed range. One of the\nways In which power requlred for cruise flight\ncan be reduced. however, is by reducing wing\nareas. The higher stallir~g\nspwds whlch result\nare undesirable, but can be lowered by increasing the maxlmum wing lift capability. Thus the\nenergy cris~shelps keep the pressure on for\nfur!her development of high lift devices.\n\nAirfoil Development\n"Airfoil" refers to the shape and thickness\nof a cross-section of a wing. Three forwclrd\nsurges in airfoil development can be identified.\nFirst, the NACA low-speed programs of the\n1920\'s and 1930\'s which resulted in the four and\nfive-d~git\nairfoil seric; (each digit of a designatlon such as 2412 gives the magnitude of an air-\n\nTABLE 1-111\nEXAMPLES OF AIRFOIL DEVELOPMENTS\nRomrrk8\n\nAirtoll\n\nNACA 24XX\nNACA 230XX (1930\'s)\nNACA 63-4XX\n\n-- 2.0\n\nNACA 6716 (1974)\n\nCdigit mries\n5-dig~t\nseries\n"Larn~ner-tlow"\nairfoiIs\n4-digit airfoil with\nhigh-loaded trailing\nedge\n"Low-speed supercritical" thick airfoil\n\nLift\n(Dynamic pressure) (Area)\n\nfoil shape parameter). The entire series used a\ntype of thickness function based on only 2 airfoils: one designed by Col. Virginius \xe2\x82\xac. Clark,\nand one very similar designed at Gottingen.\nThe mathematical difinitions of thickness functions and mean lines were sys:ematized, but not\non a theoretical physical base--!hey were arbitrary, as were the Clark and Gottingen airfoils\nthat served as the point of departure.\nSecond, the so-called "laminar flow"\nseries, which as it turned out offered more to\nhigh-Mach flight than to low. There were\nseveral families of these, of which the survivors\nare the so-called "6" and "6A" series. Airfoil\ncontours were developed to match desired surface velocity dis!ribution.\nThird, various programs seeking further\nrelief from high-subsonic-Mach number limitations of thick airfoils developed. The names\nconnected with these programs are Sinnott and\nPearcy in England, and \'Whitcomb in the United\nStates.\nCurrent work in the United States is of\nthree kinds: (1) theoretical and experimental\nwork on multi-element (f:apped and slatted) airfoils; (2) theoretical and experimental work on\nhigh-lift basic airfoils, notable among which is\nthe GA(W) airfoil series to which Whitcomb\'s\nname has literally become attached; and, (3)\ncontinued wark on the "supercljtical" ;lasses\nof airfoiIs.\n\nThe gains being sought aro relatively\nsmall, and the cost of obtaining them %metimes seems excessive. Table 1-111 illustratesthe\nevolution of high-lift airfoil technology. The\ndata are clouded by the fact that the later explorations have emphasized low test speeds.\nThere has been much attenti011devoted to\nraising the maximum lift capabilities of airfoil\nsections. This has taken the forms ~f (1) devising basic sections with high maximum lifts, and\n(2) dtwising slat and flap configurations to apply to these sections to produce high maximum\nlifts in landing configuratioas (flap down, slat\nout).\nSome of the recently-developed basic sections have had lower drag at high lift than have\nolder sections of the same thickness ratio\n(thickness ratio is important because it indicates the depth of wing availabls for structure\nand tankage). A conventionally corlfigured\nsmall airplane may be said to have "toc much"\nwing for economical cruise, since the wing size\nis determined by the requirement for low stalling speeds. The bensrit sought through use of\nthe newer airloil sections is in that they allow\nsmaller wings than usual, since their maxium\nlift capability is hiah. In climb and at cruise, the\nsmall wing omrates at higher lift per unit area,\nand the shih: of maximum weightldrag ratios to\nhigher lift values is therefore favorable to the\nnew sections.\n\nThe clas3ic approach to configuring multielement wings for takeof!, approach, and landing has been to start with a given basic airfoil,\nlay in flap and slat elements that will fit inside\nthe airfoil contour, and then explore what the\nsettings of these elements should be for lift\nrnaximiz~tion.\nPowover, an airfoil designed for\nhigh lifting capability with no flap will not\nnecessarily be exceptionally good when a flap\nsystem is added. This suggests that multi-element airfoil research might be directed toward\nfinding airfoil sections and flap configurations\nthat are best when the flaps are down.\nMost of the multi-element airfoil developments of the past have been addrsssed to the\nlanding configuration, where flap deflections\nare larg6 and maximum lifts high. The most\ntroublesome flight configuration remaining is\nthat for climb, in particular the engine-out\nc l i n h of twin-engine airplanes. Feder~l\nAviation Regulatincs acknowledge the importance\nof climb performance by prescribing mi:iimum\nvalues of climb grse;;entsor rates, but implicitly\nacknowledge that trouble ex ats by setting the\nminimum values very low.2Gzvslopment of airregimes have\nfoil systems tailoisd for the c l i ~ : ~ ; ~\nreceived little attfmtion.\n\nDirections for Airfoil Research\nWith the advent of automatic computation,\nit became possible to conduct theoretical explorations of airfoil characteristics which preto\nviously tiad been too burder~some undertake.\nThe cllrrsnt nnalytical programs for single- and\nmulti . 3nt airfoil shaping are cn\nI Y\n,d seem useful to apply such program, ,tne problem of developing airroil and\nflap systems together rather than separately,\nto\nwith specific appl~cation climb performance.\nWhile the& programs have merit, the\nfollowing should be pointed out:\nFirst, far cruder analyses, applied sensibly,\nhave provided important indications of what\nshould be done to moke given modifications in\nairfoil characlsristics.\n,\n-\n\nFederal Av~at~on\n.Tegulat~ons.\nPart 23.

In one notable case, that of the NACA\n230XX airfoils, a family c\' sections with obviously superior hlgh lie characteristics sat\natound for years, figuratively screaming for\nmore inquiry into just why they were so good.\nTo many people there were good and sufficient reasons for tt:a lack of attention to the\ndata gaps World War II, the postwar funding\ncrunch, the advent 3f diverting work (supersonic flight, missiles, space programs). During\nthose periods, understandably, relatively little\nwork was done by NASA; general aviation\nmanufacturers took occasion to point out the\nlack; the larger alrplane companies such as\nDouglas ar,d Boeing urldertook 10 remedy the\nsituation for their own benefit in their own\nfacilities, and very little appeared in the public\ndomain.\nIt ts suggested that benefit to general avialong-range\ntion would result from a co~tinuing,\nprogram cf subsonic aercidynamic research\nwhich would include:\n(1) increased financial support for\nNASA aeronautics research, to\nthe ei:snt that not only could\nNASA\'s cwn in-house and ,:ontractual research be augmented,\nbut also close and coctinual\ntechnical monitoring could be\nmaintained over the manner in\nwhich governmenr: funds in\ngeneral use are spent for aeronautical research.\n(2) continuous liaison with universities and with general aviation\nmanufacturers, using circuit.\nriders if necessary, to determine\nin what ways NASA or cther\ngovorcment agencier can be\n\n-\n\nresponsive to their research\nneeds. Coverage should not be\nlimitedto those of the public who\nhave government contracb. A\nmechanism t o ensure the\nresponsivness of the government agencies should be\ndevised.\n(3) "gap-filling" experirnen~al\nwork.\nThe everyday problems of the\nsmall or medium-sized airplane\ncompany are not those of pushi n g o u t t h e f o r e f r o n t of\nknowledge. but rather are tho..\nof obtaining detailed information\non items basically already well\nwithin the state of present artsuch items as airfoil characteristics, aerodynamics of\nfuselage irregularities, interference drag, engine cooling\ndrag, propeller performance, excrescence drag, etc.\n(4) continued publication of compendia of data, of a higli order of\ncompleterless, with periodic\nrevisions and reissues.\n(5) revival of the pre-1958 NACA index sjstem. The current STAR\nindexes are comprehensive, but\nneed supplementing to i.,\nthe visibility of important NASA\nwork. The old NACA index format was excellent in :his ragard,\nand far more usable than the\nSTAR indexes.\nElements of this program exist; some have\nexisted for a long time. The intent of the above\nsuggestions is to express general concurrence\nwith the decisions which have produced the\npresent NASA general aviation aerodynamics\nprograms, while citing areas in which addltional funding seems desirable.\n\nStructures and Materials\nStructural development h a beer1 paced\nhistorically by materials availability. The best\nutilizable weightistrengtti ratios in the preWorld War I period were possessed by various\nwocds (the u s of weightistrength ratio is a vast\noversimplification, which is why the word\n"utilizable" has been inserted). Wrought\naluminum alloys were ?ot available ic temper\nstates that allowed use in primary structure,\n,\nthough secondary structure could use ~ t and\ndid during the war.\nThe necessity for building stiff structures\n\nwith low weights and low-strength materials\ndictated the use of wire-braced, thin-membered\ntrusses: the bridge-type fuselags framework\nand the biplane wing celluk, which was essentially a repetition of the fuselage truss, disposed\nlaterally and with its horizontal panels covered\nby secondary structure, the ribs and fabric envelopes. Some all-wood airplanes, their surfaces made of spruce plywood bonded with casein glues, appeared during the war and\nthroughout the 1920\'s. but they did not account\nfor a major market share. Wooden airliners\nwere killed abruptly following the Knute\nRockne crash; the Fokker transport in which he\nwas killed was wooden-winged, aod the crash\nwas felt possibly due to the deterioration of the\nwing structure.\nSubsequently, wood for airliners was, in\neffect, regulated out of use, and the develop\nment of light-metal technohgy was thereby\nforced. Though unbraced-wooden-winged\nairplanes were buiIt (Lockheed Vega, Fairchild\nPT-19), the development of light--metaltechnology probably was a major factor in promoting aerodynamic improvements starting with\nthe unbraced (internally braced wing. Cne\nmight almost say it forced the aerodynamic\nrefinement, since duplicating w m o n structural configurations typically leads to some\nweight increase, which must be offset by drag\ndecrease if installedengine power is not to ri.-e.\nThe 1930\'s were a period, then, of refinement in all-metal design, culminating in the\ngreat combat air fleets of World War li.\nImmediate postwar developments included\nthe introduction of "sandwich" materials (a\ndouble skin of very thir layers prevec:ed from\nbuckling due to in-plane compressive loads by\na lightweight core of wood or metal\nhoneycomb). but the impact of thls technology\non general aviation has not been felt until recently. The delay was du2 in part to the\ndifficulty of inspecting sandwich structure\nbonding using nondestructive techniques. a\ndifficulty not surmounted until a very few years\nago.\nThe war product~on programs enabled\nscme general aviation manufacturers to\ndevelop their all-metal technology at public expense. The result was that production of\nwooden, fabric-covered. general aviation\nairplanes rapidly subsidea after the war until at\npresent only a few mlt-~r types are bemg produced.\nSheet-me a! !ecbr !ogy of World War II\nlevel still dc .ninates rhe civil a1:plane field.\nEarly attemp\'s tr* us.? plastics technology for\n\nsecondary structures resulted in saving neither\nweight nor cost. More recently a second cycle\nof attempts to use plastics technology was\nbegun. One certificated civil airplane, the Windecker Eagle, uses plastics almost altogether\nfor skin. but the extent of plastics use in its primary structure i s apparently lower. Other\nmanufacturers have acquired or are acquiring\nthe capability to work major structural components in plastics.\nMilitary structural research has concentrated most recently on the development of\ncomposite structure with mono-filament loadbearing members. This development has not\nyet reached the civil field.\nSail plane structure has resched a new\nplateau with the replacement of composite\nwood-and-fabric constn!ction by conventional\nfiberglasslepoxy layups aith foam filling. This\nenables glassy-smooth exterior skin-surfacs\nto be built fairly easily.\nPerhaps the most active area of structures\nr e s e a r c u t least th& most visible at the moment-is the analytical. The fairly simple sheetmetal structure of \'No, Id War IIcould be stressanalyzed using closed-form methods. Very\nthick-walled structures such as landing gear\nforgings could not be well dealt with using such\nsimple methods, however. The availability of\ndigital computer time has resulted in an explosion of finiteelement methods for the analysis\nof thick-walled structures of complex shape.\nAt the time of the disappearance of the\nwooden airliner, the technology of wooden\nairplane construction was fairly advanced.\nThroughout the years between then and 1941.\nwooden airplane development struggled along,\nand it is now the property of sport aviation and\none commercial manufacturer. The state of the\ntechnology is practically the same as at the end\nof the last major wooden airplane production,\ntke Pi-19, left it.\nIt would appear that there is riow reason for\ntaking it up again. While the state of availability\nof the major civil aircraft structural materials of\nthe preserlt day-aluminum, magnesium, and\ntitanium-is better than that of petroleum fuels.\nstill the refinementof these materials to aircraft\nstandards is energy intensive. In this regard\nwood is attractive-a renewable resource, potentially available in adequate supply to suppol:\nsmall airframe production, and with small\nenergy requirements to prepare ~t for aircraft\nuse.\nLarger airplanes will u~doubtedly\ncontinue\nto be built of more exotic materials because of\n\nthe requirements for structural strength, efficiency, and low maintenenace. Wood,\nhowever, continues to be an acceptable\nmaterial for the construction of small airplanes.\nFabric is a sort of natural companion of wood\nso\nfor this applicat~on. along with thd program\nof resumed development of wood construction\ntechnology which is suggested here, might well\ngo one of fabric application development.\nThe bugbears of the past have been: (1) insidious. invisible deterioration of the mechanical properties of wood structures; (2) nondestructive inspection of woods; (3) rot and infestation; (4) deterioration of fabrics with exposuie i t sur. (hence pigmented dopes replacing the clear dopes of the first two decades of\naviation); (5) palatability to field creatures of\ncordage used in stitching; (6) resistance to action of aviation fuels and lubricants; and. (7)\nbonding materials and techciques.\nRecent years have seen the introduction of\nsynthetic aircraft cloths and long-life dopes.\nwhich it is hoped will give finished fabric\nairplane coverings lifetime durability. However.\nwork toward improving the characteristics of\naircraft covering using renewable resources\nmay yet be in order. This same constraint\nshould be considered for application to\nresexch in any of the other areas.\nPropulsion\nPropeller airplanes represent an overwhelming percentage of the general aviation\nfleet, so perhaps starting with the propeller itself is appropriate.\nSomeone has said that only a real genius\ncould design a poor propeller. Operating at its\ndesign point a typical wooden fixed-pitch propeller of World War I vil age would show efficiencies in excess of ;3 percent, and modern\ntechn3logy metal propellers can exceed 90 percent. Thus, aerodynamic refinements for\ndesign-condition operation yielded relatively\nsmall gains, the largest being experienced\nwhen aluminum technology permitted development of metal blades in the late 1920\'s.\nThe only major avenue of improvement,\na\nthen, was in the ~ r e of off-designperformance.\nand this problem was addressed in the early\n192C\'s, with controllable-pltch and constantengine-speed propellers finally achieving wide\nyse by the mid 1930\'s. The propeller technology\nof general aviation tnda) is largely the techrlology of that era, with detail refinements.\nPract~calpiston engine development was\nalong two lines-aircooled and liquid-cooled.\nLlquid-cooled engines are no longer used ex-\n\ncept for the World War Il :eftovers. and are not\nproduced at all. Aircooled engines got a rather\nstrange start with the "rotary" engine. whose\ncrankshaft was rigidly fixed to the airframe, the\npistons. cylinders, crankcase. and propeller all\nwhirling around at prop speed, which was then\n(WorldWar I)rather low. The rotary died a welldeserved sudden death after the war, its place\ntaken by the aircooled radial.\nThe present horizontally-opposed configuration found in most general aviation\nairplanes dates back to the late 1920\'s: it and\ntne prevalent "lightplane" highwing configuration started together at thht time. a i d the family\nresemblance remains until now. Improvements\nsince the 1920\'s have been in materials and\n\n\\\n/IT\'S\n\nLESS\n\ndetail refinements, such as the introduct~on\nof\nfuel injection and turbo supercharging, both\nspinoffs from military aviation. Minor types =J\nfreaks have appeared now and then. such as\nthe Guiberson diesel radial, the six-cylinder\nCurtiss radial (single-row radials have odd\nnumbers of cylinders, so the Curtiss engine\nwas in essence two three-cylinder radials with a\ncommon crankcase), and the Herrmann cam\nengine.\nPropulsion research has produced many\nexotic configurations during the last twenty\nyears-lift fans, tilting rotors. tilt-props, tiltprop-tilt wings, tilting ducted fans. and so on.\nThe main thrust h s been toward development\nof VTOL types other thar: the helicopter. With a\n\n.\n\nNOW( cERTIFK;Lfm)\n\n\\ \\\n\n/\n\nIT\'S\n\n\\\n\nsingle military exception, these devices have\nnot been undertaken by any firm for production,\nalthough the present state ot documentation\nseems fairly good. Much of the information has\nbeen condensed into a reference work by Dr.\nBarnes W. McCormick of Pennsylvania State\nUniversity. \' Dr. McCormick has broadened the\nscope of his work to include powered boundary\nlayer control. essentially a part of STOL technology which also has found, to date, only military applications.\nPiston engine development has simply incorporated old military engine technology into\ncivil engines, with one notable exception:\nTeledyne Continental has produced an engine\nwith an altered internal power train and fairly\nsophisticated dynamic damping devices.\nDowty-Rotol has displayed a controllablepitch piston enginelshrouded propeller combination in mockup form.\nTurbine engine development in small sizes\nhas utilized essentially military-funded technology for civil engines of fairly conventional\nform. Short-life turbine engines, based on\ndroneengine technology, have been proposed\nat various times as lift engiries (axis vertical) for\nSTOL or VSTOL airplanes, but none has been\nadopted for production. Turbine engine technology is very expensive to acquire, hence the\nlack of civil funding for advanced research.\nNo engine produced to date for aviation,\nexcepr the diesel, has outshone the conventional gasoline piston engine from the standpoint of fuel economy. The shaft-gas-turbine\nenginc is lighter and its overhaul times typically\nlonger; through intensive development its fuel\nconsumpt~cnhas been hammered down to\nabout the leve! of the wartime piston engine.\nNevertheless, with little development since\n1945 except what the civil engine manufacturers could afford, the fuel consumption of the\ngasoline piston engine is now, after thirty years.\nabout as far superior to that of the turbine as it\nwas when gas turbine development started, on\na percentage basis.\nAs long as flight speeds are below about\n325 knots, the propeller engine is superior to\nthe only other two types in use. the turbofan and\nthe turbojet. This superiority exists because of\npropeller, rather than engine, characteristics.\nThe implication of this and the superior fuel\neconomy of the basic piston engine is clear.\n\nNoise\nThe general aviation airplane, taken by and\n-\n\n-\n\n--\n\n\' McCorm~ck.Barnes W Aerodyn~mrcsof V/STOL Flrght\n(New vork Academ~c\nPress. 1967)\n\nlarge, is a far less noisy device at the distances\nat which it is typically encountered than is a\npower lawnmover, a motorcycle or a "performance" car. Experience has shown, however,\nthat the airpicine\'s high visibility makes it\nvulnerable, and that noise levels at major airports generate an awareness of aircraft noise\nthat "wipes off" on all airplanes. Also, an objectionable noise need not be "loud." or have\nany specific frequency content, to generate\ncomplaints. There is experience to indicate that\nmany complaints about "noise" are generated\nsimply by newness and unusualness. It all\namounts to the fact that silencing airplanes is a\nresponse to a political fact of life, however artificially generated, which did not exist as such\nyears ago, but which we now ignore at our peril.\nSmall piston engines are muffled, but not\nas effectively as automobile engines. There are\ntwo probable reasons: (1) avery significant proportion of the noise of an aircraft power plant is\npropeller noise--perhaps as much as 40 to 60\npercent. The propeller noise therefore masks\nthe exhaust noise at high prop speeds; and (2)\nweight is always critical, and the tendency is\ntherefore to minimize the weight. as a percentage of the total, of items that do not contribute\nto safety of flight or to sales potential.\nPropdler noise is predominantly due to air\ncompressibility effects at the blade tips. To get\nrid of the noise, then, demands that either the\npropeller be slowed to a tip speed where these\neffects will disappear (usually below Ms0.6) or\nthat blade profiles be reshaped. The "highspeed supercritical" airfoils proposed by Dr.\nRichard T. Whitcomb are designed for the\nspecific purpose of delaying the onset of compressibilily effects by approximately .05- 0.10\nMach. Along with this benefit go increases in\nthe loadings at which it is acceptable to drive\nthe blades, from a power-required standpoint.\nLow tip speeds dictate increases in propeller "solidity" (number and width of blades)\nto realize acceptable thrust power levels. Since\nthrust not only varies almost directly with\nsolidity, but also with the square of propeller\nspeed, ground and low-speed engine cooling\nbecomes a problem with slow turning propellers, as was again demonstrated with the\n"spook" airplanes used in Vietnam.\nSome persons have proposed L;se of\nshrouded propellers to diminish noise output.\nThere is no present evidence to indicate that\nthe complicated tradeoffs involved in shrouded\npropeller design will favor low-noise configurations of acceptable weight and efficiency. Indeed, the basic configuration generates noise\n\nproblems all its own at the low-loading end of\nthe range of applicability. At the high end, the\nshrouded propeller becomes the secondary\nstage of the ducted fan engine. Here the tradeoffs are considered vis-a-vis the turbojet\nengine, and are favorable to the fan because of\nits long shroud (not feasible at low loadings),\nwhich can be acoustically treated.\nIt is surprisingly little understood that smsll\npropeller airplanes can now be silenced almost\nto the lwel of the automobile at high speed\ncruise. Detail changes of configuration which\nmust be made to do so include: (1) more effective exhaust muffling; (2) overwing routing of\nexhaust stacks: (3) slow turning, wind bladed\npropellers; and. (4) improvements in grol~nd\nand low-speed cooling, perhaps with auxiliary\nblowers or a reversion to liquid cooling. But the\nthe limits of present\njob can be done with111\ntechnology. An inspectionof the circumstances\nsurrounding the addition of noise certification\nrequirements to the Federal Aviation Regulations would seem to be in order, to determine\nwhether. for any small airplane other than the\nbusiness jets, 2 real need exists for the regulations.\nThe changes listed above do not come\nfree. Each hasits cost in weight or efficiency,\nsmall though it may be. Whether this cost wi!!\nbe tolerable as fuel supplies grow scarcer cannot be predicted, but it is worth considering\nwhether significant amounts of funds should be\nspent on developing improvements which may\nin a very few years have to be discarded as the\nlast few percentage points of efficiency are\nsought.\n\nBasic Configuration\nAs pointed out previously, no definitive\nchanges in airplane configuration have taken\nplace since aboct World War I. That war also\ngenerated the basic conventional twin, with\nwing-mounted tractor-type powerplants, a type\nwhich survives and is popular today.\nThe conventional light twin represents the\nfirst step up in performance from the heavy\nsingle, largely due to the fact that there are no\nengines on the market today in the 600 horsepower class except the Pratt and Whitney PT-6\nturbine and the R-1340. Neither of these\nengines is suitable for other than specialized\nsingle-engine applications, the turbine\nbecause of its cost, the R-1340 because of its\nlimited availabiiity. The twins, with their modern\nopposed engines, fill the gap.\nThe conventional twin as a type, unfortunately. has one bad characteristic, which renders i t among the most potentially dangerous\n\nmachines in the air. This characteristic is the\ndifficulty of "cleaning it up" after a single\nengine failure. The pilot must sort out which\nengine failed, shut it down, at the same time\nconteracting the roll and yaw occasioned by\nthe shutdown, then rapidly retract the gear and\nraise the flaps if they are extended. The\ndifficulty of doing this is emphasized by the fact\nthat a large propocion of fatal accidents to\ntwin-engined airplanes in which engine stoppage played a part is sustained in training for\nengine failure emergencies.\nAttempts have been made to circumvent\nthe trouble by designing airplanes with "centerline thrust," e.g., the "push-pull" Cessna\n337. Such airplanes have their own problems,\nnotably those of detecting when an aft engine\nfailure has occurred, and of providing adequate\nground cooling for the aft engine. The cancept\nremains attractive, however, as a remedy for the\nbasic problem, and if the conventional win\ncannot be rendered more tractable by the epplication of advanced technology, the centerline thrust twin should be taken in hand and\ndeveloped to the extent that it possesses less\nserious problems of its own than are possessed\nby the conventional type.\n..\nThe Advanced Technology LigM Twin\n(ATLIT). For several years a group under Dr.\nDavid Kohlman and Dr. Jan Roskam has been\nworking at the University of Kansas in the area\nof the improvement of cruise and low speed\nperformance of ?mall airplanes. The general\napproach is to adopt high-lift airfoil technology\nto maintain low stalling speeds while improving\ncruise performance (range) and gust response\nby reducing wing area about 30 percent to cut\nskin-friction-type parasite drag. Spoiler\nailerons are adopted to maintain good roll performance at low speed.\nAt present this NASA-contracted program\nhas modified a Piper airplane, an "ATLIT," for\nfurther experimental work. Their first airplane\nwas a single-engined Cessna.\nRobertson Aircraft. While the aerodynamic\ngains sought by the ATLlT project are worth\nachieving, quite a bit can be done toward improvement of low-speed performance alone by\nadopting less drastic measures. For many years\nthe Robertson Aircraft Company has\nspecialized in modifying conventional production airplanes for this purpose. The modifications consist of sophisticated flap systems,\ndrooped-wing leading edges, vortex generators, and lately full-span flaps and spoilers.\nRobertson\'s emphasis has been on keeping\nmodification costs low and doing as little as\n\npossible that will affect the structural integrity\nof the basic airplane.\n\ndown of the various field length performilnce\ntargets advocated throughout the years, with a\nlittle information on each:\n\nShort Field Aircraft\n"Short-field Aircraft" is a catchall term\nunder which can be lumped all aircraft which\nuse advanced technology to achieve shorter\nthan ordinary takeoff and landing distances.\nThe term embraces short takeoff (STOL),\nreduced takeoff (RTOL). and vertical-or-short\ntakeoff (V/STOL) types of machines.\n\nRTOL and STOL\nThere have been two definitions associated with each of the names Reduced Takeoff\nand Landing (RTOL) and Short Takeoff and\nLanding (STOL), and much confusion has existed because this fact was not appreciated.\nThe confusion existed because, while Conventional Takeoff and Landing (CTOL) airplane\ntechnology and its associated performance\nwere representedby existing types of airplanes,\nas was VerticalIShort Takeoff and Landing\n(V/STOL) by the performance of the helicopter,\nno hardware and no steady performance\ntargets existed for STOL. During the early years\nin the development of STOL technology, the\ntypical argument was over what single fixed\ntakeoff and landing distances should be striven\nfor through the application of the technology.\nOne of the early "definitions" of STOL was\n"500 feet over a 50 foot obstacle." It was\nsurprisingly long in coming out that there were\nactually two entities to define separately.\nThe first was STOL technology, the aggregation of technical developments that would\nenable the design of an airplane with field\nlength requirements substantially less than\nthose of a CTOL airplane, of the same payload,\nrange, and speed.\nThe second was STOL airplane, and to its\ndefinition no fixed field performance requirement could be attached except arbitrarily. 5 ne\nfield performance of successful airplanes\ndesigned to a given state of the art is size dependent as shown in Figure 1-3. A STOL\nairplane, then, is an airplane which utilized\nSTOL technology effectively to produce some\npercentage improvement in performance, no\nmatter how short or long its field requirement is.\nPotential users, however, insist on thinking\nin dimensional terms so here is a sample run-\n\n.\n\n.\n\n* Stalter.
