The true risk for renal stone formation in\nastronauts due to the space flight environment is unknown. Proper management of this\ncondition is crucial to mitigate health and mission risks.\nMETHODS: The NASA Flight Medicine Clinic electronic medical record and the\nLifetime Surveillance of Astronaut Health databases were reviewed. An extensive\nreview of the literature and current aeromedical standards for the monitoring and\nmanagement of renal stones was also done. This work was used to develop a\nscreening and management protocol for renal stones in astronauts that is relevant to the\nspaceflight operational environment.\nRESULTS: In the proposed guidelines all astronauts receive a yearly screening and\npost-flight renal ultrasound using a novel ultrasound protocol. The ultrasound protocol\nuses a combination of factors, including: size, position, shadow, twinkle and dispersion\nproperties to confirm the presence of a renal calcification. For mission-assigned\nastronauts, any positive ultrasound study is followed by a low-dose renal computed\ntomography scan and urologic consult. Other specific guidelines were also created.\nDISCUSSION: A small asymptomatic renal stone within the renal collecting system\nmay become symptomatic at any time, and therefore affect launch and flight schedules,\nor cause incapacitation during a mission. Astronauts in need of definitive care can be\nevacuated from the International Space Station, but for deep space missions evacuation\nis impossible. The new screening and management algorithm has been implemented\nand the initial round of screening ultrasounds is under way. Data from these exams will\nbetter define the incidence of renal stones in U.S. astronauts, and will be used to inform\nrisk mitigation for both short and long duration spaceflights.\n\n'
