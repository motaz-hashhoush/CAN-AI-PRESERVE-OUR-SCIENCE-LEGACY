b'Space to Space Advanced EMU Radio\nEV2 \xe2\x80\x93 Data and Command Handling Branch\nAndrew Maicke - Summer 2016\nThe main task for this project was the development of a prototype for the Space to Space\nAdvanced EMU Radio (SSAER). The SSAER is an updated version of the Space to Space EMU Radio (SSER),\nwhich is the current radio used by EMUs (Extravehicular Mobility Unit) for communication between suits\nand with the ISS. The SSER was developed in 1999, and it was desired to update the design used in the\nsystem. Importantly, besides replacing out-of-production parts it was necessary to decrease the size of\nthe radio due to increased volume constraints with the updated Portable Life Support System (PLSS) 2.5,\nwhich will be attached on future space suits.\nIn particular, it was desired to fabricate a PCB for the front-end of the prototype SSAER system.\nOnce this board was manufactured and all parts assembled, it could then be tested for quality of\noperation as well as compliancy with the SSER required specifications. Upon arrival, a small outline of\nthe target system was provided, and it was my responsibility to take that outline to a finished, testable\nboard. This board would include several stages, including frequency mixing, amplification, modulation,\ndemodulation, and handled both the transmit and receive lines of the radio.\nI developed a new design based on the old SSER system and the outline provided to me, and\nfound parts to fit the tasks in my design. It was also important to consider the specifications of the SSER,\nwhich included the system noise figure, gain, and power consumption. Further, all parts needed to be\nimpedance matched, and spurious signals needed to be avoided. In order to fulfill these two\nrequirements, it was necessary to perform some calculations using a Smith Chart and excel analysis.\nOnce all parts were selected, I drew the schematics for the system in Altium Designer. This included\ndeveloping schematic symbols, as well as layout. Once the schematic was finished, it was then necessary\nto lay the parts out onto a PCB using Altium. Similar to the schematic design, in order to accomplish this\nit was necessary to develop component land patterns and add component 3D models.\nAll of this was achieved, and the PCB is currently in review. After it is finished being reviewed,\nthis board will be sent out for manufacture. All electronic components used in the PCB have been\nacquired, and once the board arrives they will be soldered onto the board using a machine in building\n44. Finally, the board will be tested for performance on-site. This will likely be accomplished by the end\nof the internship.\n\n'
