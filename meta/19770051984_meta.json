Of the present models for lunar magnetism, only the Sonett and Runcorn (1974) model of a central iron core dynamo can explain the presence of such a large field in early lunar history. However, because of the similarity in size of this field and that for the early solar system deduced from carbonaceous chondrites, we draw attention to an apparently little-considered possibility: that the large magnetic field in early lunar history was external and solar in origin, and emanated from a pre-main sequence T-Tauri stage sun. Therefore, there should be no record of such a large magnetic field in lunar rocks younger than approximately 4.0 billion yr.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19770051984, "endDate": "1976-03-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "Lunar Science Conference", "location": "Houston, TX", "id": "ff5da4f086e14b33af59d7ba127136fa", "startDate": "1976-03-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19770051984, "id": "72b11cbddbb0463aaf09515ba88101ac", "publicationDate": "1976-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
