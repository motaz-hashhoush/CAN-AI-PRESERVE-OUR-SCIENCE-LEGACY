Software methods are very flexible and economical but suffer an excessive time overhead, whereas hardware methods require no time overhead but are unable to handle transmission delays in clock signals. The effects of nonzero transmission delays in synchronization have been studied extensively in the communication area in the absence of malicious or Byzantine faults. The authors show that it is easy to incorporate the ideas from the communication area into the existing hardware clock synchronization algorithms to take into account the presence of both malicious faults and nonzero transmission delays.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"volume": "37", "submissionId": 19890030626, "issn": "0018-9340", "id": "f44b807da3ca48e484b6df6944a8c1a1", "publicationName": "IEEE Transactions on Computers", "publicationDate": "1988-11-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
