Here, the observed phenomenon of\nvortex bounce is explained in terms of secondary vorticity produced on the ground. This vorticity is swept off the ground\nand advected about the vortex pair, thereby altering the classic\nhyperbolic trajectory. When compared with the decay of a vortex\npair out of ground plane interaction, it is shown that strength\nof the vortex pair is rapidly reduced by the scrubbing on the\nground.\nThe phenomenon of the solitary vortex is explained as an\ninteraction of a vortex with crosswind shear. Here, the vortex\nhaving the sign opposite that of the sign of the vorticity in\nthe shear is dispersed by a convective instability. This instability results in the rapid production of turbulence which in\nturn disperses the smoke marking the vortex.\nIt is shown that the effect of stable stratification on the\ndescent of a vortex pair is to halt the descent of the pair.\nNumerical experiments have allowed a simple relation to be derived which predicts the maximum descent of a vortex pair in a\nlinearly stratified atmosphere.\nLastly, the "WAKE" code has been updated, including new\nalgorithms to improve accuracy and speed. In particular, the\noriginal primitive variable formulation has been replaced by a\nstream function-vorticity formulation, thereby eliminating previous numerical problems with regard to maintaining divergencefree flow.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nIn Ref. 1 (hereafter denoted I) a two-dimensional, unsteady,\nfinite difference, computer code "WAKE" was documented and used to\ninvestigate vortex interactions and turbulent transport in aircraft\nwakes. The thrust of I was to investigate the phenomenon of merging or coalescing of vortices in multivortex pair wakes. One major\nconclusion of this study was that vortex pairs can be made to\ninteract in a favorable way so as to reduce the hazard induced on\nan encountering aircraft. After this interaction was complete,\nhowever, it was shown that the decay of the wake in the absence of\natmospheric effects was a very slow process. The study contained\nherein is an extension of I and was undertaken to determine the\neffects of atmospheric turbulence, shear, and stratification as\nwell as to investigate the dynamics of vortex interaction with the\nground plane. In addition, general improvements were made to the\n"WAKE" code which reduced computational time with no sacrifice in\naccuracy. The study contained herein,assumes that vortex interactions are complete, and that vortex merging has occurred and that\nthe vortex wake can now be characterized by two counter-rotating\nvortices of circulation T \xe2\x80\xa2-, with separation b .\nThe fact that our atmosphere can be sheared, turbulent, and\nstably stratified simultaneously has made difficult the interpretation of vortex data obtained during flight tests. Apparently it is\nquite difficult to measure atmospheric parameters sufficiently to\nquantify the dissipative ability of the atmosphere, particularly\nsince these measurements must not necessarily be made near the\nground. For these reasons, it was decided to analytically investigate atmospheric effects by devising computational models which\nexamined atmospheric turbulence, crosswind shear, and stratification\nseparately. It is felt that this approach should both produce a\nmaximum understanding as well as quantitative predictions of the\ndissipative ability of the atmosphere.\nThis report is organized as follows. In Section 2, changes\nmade to the "WAKE" code are detailed including a description as to\nhow a viscous ground plane has been augmented into the code. In\nSection 3, results are presented as to how atmospheric effects in a\nneutral atmosphere result in decay of a vortex pair. It is noted\nhere that much of the material contained in Section 3 is included as\nan appendix and has been presented at the American Institute of\nAeronautics and Astronautic\'s 16th Aerospace Sciences Meeting in\nHuntsville, Alabama. In Section 4, vortex descent in a stable atmosphere is investigated. In Section 5, results of several additional\ncomputations are presented which include roll up of a vortex sheet\nas well as computations of vortex ascent in an enclosed wind tunnel.\nLastly, in Section 6, conclusions and recommendations are offered.\n\nNOMENCLATURE\nA, b, s, v\n\nconstants of the invariant second-order closure\nmodel\nseparation between vortices\nrolling moment coefficient,\ninduced drag\n&\n\nD. ,.\nind.\n\na I yWdy\nsr\n-sf\nr\n\n_,\n_\n\nn\nJ\n\nVS.

The two-dimensional approximation is justified for these flows since gradients\nin the flight x direction are very small compared with changes in\nthe vertical z\nand lateral y directions. Therefore, a numerical simulation is equivalent to observing a wake flowfield in a\nplane which is both perpendicular to the aircraft\'s flight direction\nand fixed to the ground. Incompressibility is justified since the\nMach number of the swirling velocities in the wake is small. The\n"WAKE" code is operational on the NASA Langley computers.\n2.1\n\nEquations of Motion\n\nThe continuity, momentum, and energy equations govern the solution to well-posed incompressible, turbulent, stratified flow problems which are of interest in the study of vortex wakes. Unfortunately, full numerical unsteady solution to. these equations are\nbeyond today\'s current computer hardware and software capabilities.\nTo overcome this problem, turbulent transport in fluids is estimated\nwith transport models which have been developed to be compatible\nwith today\'s resources. The approach used here is to numerically\nsolve for ensemble averaged mean field and ensemble averaged secondorder correlations. The current model is one which has been used to\npredict successfully both quantitative and qualitative features of\nmany turbulent flowfields ; (Refs. 1 - 4).\nThe model equations are briefly reviewed . Let each \'\ndependent variable Be; written as the sum of a mean and a fluctuating\npart (e.g., U^ = Uj_ + ui) . Af ter formal\\ substitution into the\ncontinuity, momentum, and energy equations and ensemble averaging,\nthe equations for the mean fields become;\nContinuity\n1 _ n\n\n/o i \\\n\nMomentum\nDU.\n\n_i = _\n\nu u. . u..\n\n-\n\ni 1 j. 3\n\n,\n\nL,\n\nwu.\n\ni\n\n-i ,,p\n\ni I_ i\nP\n\n4. ci.

(2.2) and Eq. (2.3), are\nsubtracted from\nthe complete equations. This operation leaves equations for u-j^\nand 6 which can be premultiplied and averaged to yield equations\nfor u-ju^ and u^8 . These equations are then closed by modeling\nthird-oraer as well as certain second-order correlations. The details of this closure are not given here but are. discussed in Ref .\n\xe2\x80\xa2J \xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe modeled rate equations for the second-order correlations^ are,. ,.,.

They are assigned the values 0.3 , 0.125 , 0.75 and 1.8\nrespectively. These values have been chosen from computer simulations of turbulent flows where experimental data are available\n(see Ref. 5 for a complete description). The scale A is a measure of the large eddies to be found in a flow. The scale is,\ntherefore, itself determined from a differential scale equation^\n\nDA\n\nTit~\ni/L.\n\n=\n\nI\n\xc2\xb1.\n\nA STu.

Equations (2.1) through (2.7) are the\nsecond-order invariant model of turbulent transport.\n2.2\n\nSuperequilibrium\n\nThe above turbulent transport model has a simple limit which\nis useful analytically to fix background turbulent atmospheres\nthrough which vortices will be allowed to descend. This limit\nexists when second-order correlations have equilibrated to the mean\nfield; hence the name Superequilibrium is used. The Superequilibrium\nlimit of the turbulent model is Cfourid\' by neglecting convection and\ndiffusion terms in the equations for the second-order correlations.\n\nIn addition, the high Reynolds number limit of the dissipation\nterms is taken. The resulting equations for the turbulent correlations are\n3\n\n0 = - 2w\n\n- . uH + (i . 2b)\n\n(2.8)\n\n3\n0 = - \xc2\xa3 \xe2\x84\xa2 + (1 - 2b) |_\n\n(2.9)\n\n3\no = |\xc2\xa3 \xc2\xa3e - a ^ + (i - 2b) \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa3\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n(2.10)\n\no\n\n(2.11)\n\n.\n0 = - 2w\xc2\xa5, ff - 2bs\n\n(2.13)\n_\n\n(2.14)\n\nwhere it has been assumed that Ui = [U(z),0,0] and that 0 = 0(z) .\nThe solution of Eq. (2.8) through Eq. (2.14) may be computed if the\nfollowing definitions are introduced.\n\n(2.15)\nand note that\nQQ = Q2 = UU + W + WW\n\n(2.16)\n\nSubstitution of the definitions, Eq. (2.15) and Eq. (2.16) into\nEq. (2.8) through Eq. (2.14) results in a system of nonlinear algebraic equations which may be solved to give expressions for the\nturbulent correlations in terms of the stratification 30/3z , the\nshear 3U/3z , and the scale A . A discussion of the stabilizing\neffects of stratification and rotation in the superequilibrium\nlimit is given in Refs. 6-8.\n2.3\n\nSolution Algorithm\n\nThe solution algorithm is the same as that described in I with\none significant change; the mean equations have been solved in\nterms of stream f.unction-vorticity variables.

(2.20), and Eq. (2.3) through Eq. (2.7),\nThe Poisson equation, Eq. (2.19), is then solved for ty using a fast\ndirect solver developed by Swartztrauber and Sweet (Ref. 9). The\n\nvelocity field may then be computed from the definition of the\nstream function. Use of the stream function-vorticity system eliminates the need to compute the pressure field and automatically insures that continuity, Eq. (2.17),is satisfied, as opposed to the\nalgorithm employed in I where a correction for continuity must be\nadded at each time step. In addition, boundary conditions for the\nstream\' function (needed for. solving/ the Poisson equation) may be\ndirectly related to the velocity components V and W , while the\nchoice of boundary conditions for pressure in I is less clear.\n2.4\n\nBoundary Conditions\n\nThe "WAKE" code is designed to accept boundary conditions of\nthe form Ae + B(3e/3n) + C = 0 on the variable e on any of the\nfour sides of the computational domain. A , B , C may be functions\nof y , z, t and 3/3n is the normal derivative. Two special cases\nof the above are described below.\nRigid Wall - Law of the Wall\nVortices descending in ground effect must experience a deintensification as a result of viscous scrubbing along the ground.\nIn order to quantify the amount of dissipation which results, a viscous no slip boundary condition is needed. Instead of resolving the\nwall boundary layer with a finite difference mesh, it is more efficient to develop an asymptotic wall layer condition. This is accomplished by noting that ^asymptotically the velocity shear in the\nneighborhood of a wall (say at z = 0) of surface roughness z ,\nis given by\noV\n\nU\n\n=\n\n-L . ;\n\nFz- \xe2\x80\x94 z\n\n/o o i\\\n\n(\n2 2 )\n1\n\n\'\n\nJk\n\nwhere U is a to be determined friction velocity and K is von\nKarman\'s constant. In this wall layer, since (3/3z) \xc2\xbb (3/3y) ,\nEq. (2.21) defines an approximation to the vorticity, i.e.,\nTT* i\n\nair\n\n<2-22>\n\nn\n\n(2.23)\n\n"\xe2\x80\xa2-TC--TT!\nIntegration of Eq.

(2.22) - Eq. (2.24), to define a boundary condition at a reference level zr above the wall,\nbut within the asymptotic region where these equations are valid.\nThe reference level zr is the first mesh point in the computational domain. To define boundary conditions, consider the finite\ndifference formulation for n and V in terms of ^ :\n( 2 )\n2 5\n\nT-1\n\nV\n\nr\n\n=\n\n<2\n\n2Az\n\nwhere Az is the mesh size and ipr represents the streamf unction\nat zr and tyr+i is the streamf unction at the mesh points above\nand below zr tzr_i is a fictitious point).

If upon reaching the boundary, some condition\nis not employed to allow these waves to pass out of the domain,\nthey will be reflected back and possibly spoil the computation. No\none universal technique has been devised to avoid this problem.\nSpecification of boundary conditions on a finite computational domain representing an infinitely large stratified domain is both\nchallenging andfrustrating, requiring both physical insight and art.\nPreviously, one technique which we have employed was to apply a^\nporous liner near the computational boundaries. This is accomplished\nby adding damping terms to the equations of motion,, the .strength of\nthe damping increasing as the Boundary\'~ is approach\'ed .(Ref. 9) / jThis\ntechnique has been abandoned since it is difficult to accurately\nassess how much artifical damping is actually added to the computation. Modest success has been achieved with the use of a\nSommerfield radiation condition which is described below.\nBoundary conditions of the type\n\n|f + c 11=0\n\n(2.30)\n\npropagate the quantify e at velocity c in the n direction.\nIf c is the phase speed of internal waves as they approach the\nboundary, Eq. (2.30) should allow these waves to propagate out of the\ndomain. The success of this condition rests with the accurate specification of c and with a narrow width of the wave number spectrum which must be passed out of the domain.\nIf c is a fluid speed, Eq. (2.30) is an advection condition.\nFor example, in the case of a pair of descending vortices, a downward moving coordinate system can be imposed which will keep the\nvortices of interest in the center of the domain. This means that\nfluid will be washing out through the top of the domain. A suitable\ncondition for the top boundary would be to set c equal to the\nlocal vertical velocity when e is a variable which will be advected\nout, e.g., the vorticity.\n\n12\n\n3.\n\nVORTEX DECAY IN NEUTRAL ATMOSPHERES\nVORTEX/GROUND PLANE INTERACTION\n\nThe investigation of atmospheric effects as they influence\nthe decay of aircraft wake vortices can be separated as to whether\nthe atmosphere is neutral or stably stratified. In this section,\nresults obtained for descent of aircraft vortices in a neutral\natmosphere are summarized. Details of the work undertaken may be\nfound in the Appendix which is a preprint of the work entitled,\n"The Role of Atmospheric Shear, Turbulence and a Ground Plane on\nthe Dissipation of Aircraft Vortex Wakes." This work was presented\nat the 16th Aerospace Sciences Meeting in Huntsville, Alabama.\nResults of three types of computations are presented and discussed.\nThey are;\n1.\n\nComputations undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness\nof background ambient turbulence on the dissipation of\na vortex wake.\n\n2.\n\nComputations undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness\nof crosswind shear on the dissipation of a vortex wake.\n\n3.\n\nComputations undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness\nof the ground on the dissipation of a vortex wake.\n\nThe following conclusions have been drawn;\nVortex pairs in a turbulent background - Numerical computations\nhave shown that the decay of a vortex pair in a turbulent atmosphere\nis greatly enhanced by the presence of turbulence. Direct computation has shown that the decay of circulation in a square contour\npositioned on the vortex "center" decays as t"^ when turbulence is\npresent. This is compared to a computed t~l/2 decay when the\nambient turbulence is zero and the pair diffuses as a result of its\nown internally generated turbulence. Computations have shown that\nturbulence levels typical of the atmosphere can reduce the circulation by a factor of three or so one minute after passage of a B747\naircraft. The inability to directly correlate real data with computations is tied to failure to quantify the scale of turbulence in\nthe atmosphere. Work is currently under way to validate models\nwhich predict integral scale lengths.\nVortex pairs in a crosswind shear - During flight tests, vortices are marked with smoke for visualization purposes. Under certain conditions the smoke in one vortex would vanish, leaving what\nappeared to be a solitary vortex (Ref.10). It was conjectured at\nthe time of observation that the solitary vortex may pose a more\nserious problem than a pair wake and that the phenomenon was in some\nway brought about by atmospheric shear. Computations run with crosswind shear essentially confirm that shear disperses the vortex whose\n\n13\n\nvorticity is of the opposite sign of the vorticity associated with\nthe shear. However, direct computations cannot confirm that the\nremaining vortex will be a more significant hazard than a comparable pair wake. Basically, the decay of the solitary vortex is\nstrongly influenced by the turbulence associated with the cross\nshear. It has been speculated, that over tens of minutes it is\'possible\nto have shear without turbulence and turbulence without shear when\nthe atmosphere is stably stratified. Under these conditions, it\nmay indeed be possible to have a solitary vortex which may persist\nfor a long period of time.\nVortex ground plane interaction - Vortices in close proximity\nto the ground must feel some decay of strength as a consequence of\nscrubbing of fluid along the ground. To quantify this effect computations were run with a viscous turbulent law \' of the wall boundary condition applied at ground level. The results of these computations were quite surprising in that the vortices did not follow\nthe classical hyperbolic trajectories but rebounded from the ground\nplane. This rebounding or bouncing phenomenon results from secondary vorticity generated at the ground being swept up and convected\nabout the primary vortices. This result is significant in that it\nprovides a mechanism by which vorticity of opposite sign can be\nmixed with the vortex wake and thereby augment the decay process.\nDirect computation suggests that rolling moment induced on a follower aircraft may be reduced by a factor of 3 after one minute of\nthe passage of a B747 aircraft.\n\n4.\n\nSTABLE ATMOSPHERIC STRATIFICATION\n\nIn this section the descent of a vortex pair in a stably stratified, incompressible atmosphere is investigated. This study is\nthe first which includes turbulent transport directly. Motivation\nhas come from the several previously published analytical investigations, (Ref s . 11-15); most of which are in disagreement. This\ndisagreement, as discussed by Widnall (Ref. 16), results from the different accounting of fluid impulse and energy and the entraining/\ndetraining of mass and vorticity from the interface of the descending\noval of fluid. The computations discussed below will suggest that\nthe dynamics of the descent of a vortex pair in a stably stratified\nflow is intimately tied to the correct accounting of turbulent transport effects.\n4"..l\n\nPhysical Effects of Stratification\n\nConsider a linearly stratified stable incompressible fluid with\nthe unperturbed density given by\n\n(4.1)\nThe characteristic scale height\n\nH\n\nof the stratification is defined\n\nand is assumed to be much greater than the characteristic vortex\nspacing b . The characteristic time of a gravity wave is .known\nto be\n\nA measure of the importance of stratification is to compare the\ncharacteristic vortex pair time TV = 2-ns^/T with the B.V. period.\nThis ratio of time scales defines a Froude number which is\n1/2\nFr -\n\n(4.4)\n\nThe Froude number for a standard atmosphere at an altitude of\n300 m can be computed to be of the order of 10 for a B747 aircraft.\nThis implies that stratification effects are weak. An alternate\ninterpretation is that the effects of stratification are significant\nafter the vortex pair has descended; say five spans. \' The Fraude number\nis infinite when the flow is neutrally stratified.\n15\n\nIt is appropriate here to discuss qualitatively the anticipated\neffects of stratification prior to presenting numerical results. In\nFig. 4.1(a) is shown the streamline pattern of a vortex pair descending in a neutral fluid. As is well known the vortex pair transports\nmass downward. This mass is that contained in the oval of recirculating fluid which is observed in a coordinate system moving with\nthe vortex pair. As is also well known, this descent velocity is\napproximately r/4irs . In the absence of three-dimensional instability and ambient atmospheric turbulence, a vortex pair propagates\nwith little change in velocity (see Fig. 2 in the Appendix). If\nthis oval of fluid of density p\nwere to descend into a fluid of\ndensity p^ such that P]_ > po it is anticipated that the behavior\nof the pair is significantly altered as a result of the vorticity\nwhich will be generated at the density discontinuity.\nThe origin of this vorticity can be seen by examining Eq. (2.20),\nwhere density p. may be substituted for temperature 0 , since\np/p = _ 0/0 . The production term is\n_g_ 1\xc2\xa9 =_\xc2\xa3_ l\xc2\xa3\n6o 9y\nPQ 8y\n\nC4 5}\n<4\'5>\n\nand is proportional to the gradient of the density in the horizontal,\ny , direction. This density gradient is large at the oval interface.\nIt should be anticipated that the additional vorticity generated will alter the descent of the pair as a consequence of inducing\nan additional component of velocity on the descending vortices. We\nhave schematically illustrated in Fig. 4.1 three possibilities. The\ncentroids of the buoyancy generated vorticity are above the pair,\nbelow the pair or at the altitude of the pair. The first-order consequence of these centroid locations in the absence of turbulent\ndiffusion would be to decrease the separation between vortices in\nthe pair and possibly lead to an acceleration (Ref. 14), increase\nthe separation or hold constant the separation, respectively. Unfortunately, turbulent diffusion alters this simple description.\n4.2\n\nDescent of a Vortex Pair in a Stably Stratified Atmosphere.\n\nIn order to study the decay of vortex pairs in a stably stratified atmosphere, simulations were run at three different Froude numbers with three levels of background turbulence (determined from\nsuperequilibrium theory), nine cases in all.\nThe computations are initialized by positioning a Gaussian of\nvorticity of the form r\\2vs2/T = \xc2\xb1(2/02; exp[-(r/s)^/a2) ] at y/s =\n\xc2\xb11 , z / s = 0,respectively. The coordinate r is measured radially\nfrom the vortex center and a is the vortex spread (0= 0.5 for all\ncomputations). The numerical mesh is specified for only y > 0\nsince symmetries about y = 0 can be utilized.

A passive tracer of the same Gaussian character with strength\nC0 = 1 is also positioned over the vortex centers. The background\nconstant density gradient [Fr 2-rrs2/r]2 (g/po) 9p/3z = - 1 and the\nbackground axial velocity field is chosen such that the shear\n(2irs^/r) 8U/3z is that required to give the proper level of background turbulence in accordance with superequilibrium theory. An\nupwash velocity is added to the solution in order to keep the vorticity in the center of the computational domain. This is equivalent\nto viewing the solution in a coordinate system that moves with the\nvortices. This upwash velocity is computed throughout the calculation such that the centroid of the passive tracer is kept in the\ncenter of the domain. The initial conditions are shown schematically in Fig. 4.2.\nThe boundary conditions are given in terms of the moving coordinate system. The stream function is computed-from a Biot-Savart\nlaw as described in I with the addition of a contribution due to the\nmoving coordinate system. The vorticity, density, and axial velocity\nare specified at the bottom of the domain by their values in the undisturbed fluid;namely, vorticity is zero and the density and axial\nvelocity are determined by the background gradients that were specified initially. These three quantities are advected out through the\ntop of the domain with the local vertical velocity as the domain\ndescends into heavier fluid. At the outer edge of the domain, the\ncondition on these quantities is that 9/8y = 0 . At the edges of\nthe computational domain, except at the y = 0 boundary, turbulent\nquantities are assumed to have zero slope and the passive tracer\nis assumed to have zero value. The zero slope condition at the\nouter edge in the y direction is quite adequate at this boundary\ndespite the presence of Brunt-Vaisala waves since the computations\nwere not carried so far in time that a reflecting wave became a\nproblem.\nNine cases were run with three different Froude numbers and\nthree different values of initial background turbulence levels.\nThese runs are summarized in Table 1 below.\nAll cases were run with a Reynolds number of 10 and a fixed\nvalue of the integral scale A/s =0.1 . Results of cases 4, 5, and\n6 (no initial background turbulence) are shown in Figs. 4.3 and 4.4\nFigure 4.3 is a plot of the descent velocity of the vortex measured\nby tracking the centroid of the smoke, while Fig. 4.4 is a plot of\nthe penetration depth of the vortices as a function of time. Simulations were carried out until the descent velocity dropped to less\nthan 0.1 from an initial value of 0.5 . Note the much larger stopping times, as expected, for the higher Froude number (lower stratification) cases. It should be noted that the descent velocity is\na monotonically decreasing function throughout the computation.\n\n18\n\nz /s,\n\nl@age\n. plane\n\nComputational\nboundaries\n\nw\n\nstratification\n\nNZ\npoints\n\ny/s,v\n\n\\\n\nGaussians of\nvorticity\nturbulence \xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\x94\n\nNY points\n\nOS\n\n"Figure 4.2.\n\nUp wash velocity\nadded to cancel\ndescent\n\nSchematic of initial, conditions for the\ncomputation of a vortex pair descending\nin a stably stratified fluid.\n\n19\n\n3\n\nCO\n\ncu\nco\n\na\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\nCO\n\n3\n\nCO\n\nM\n<U\n\n>\n^\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\n\ncd\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2w\n\nrt\n\nco\n\nCU\n\nCU\n\no^:\nCO JJ\n0) -r<\nO 5\n\n<r\nCD\n60\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\nfa\n\n20\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2XT:\'\n**:\nvO\n\nS\'\n\nco\n<U\nco\n\nO\nO\n\n8\nco T3\n2 C\nto ct}\n\nOd\n\n<U co\nT) }-4\nCU\n\nC^i\nO 6\n\xe2\x80\xa2H 3\nH P\n^ <U\n4-1 T3\nCU ^J\nC O\n\ncu M\n\na)\nM\n^J\noo\n\nIM\n\nI\n21\n\nTABLE 1.\nDESCENT OF A VORTEX PAIR INTO STABLE STRATIFICATION\n\nRun\n\nFr\n\n(2TTS/T) 2 g 2\n\n(2TTS/T)/QU/3z)\n\n1\n\n1.0\n\n0.0090\n\n1.43\n\n2\n\n5.0\n\n0.0096\n\n0.50\n\n3\n\n10.0\n\n0.0091\n\n0.39\n\n4\n\n1.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n5\n\n5.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n6\n\n10.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n7\n\n1.0\n\n0.00098\n\n1.355\n\n8\n\n5.0\n\n0.00094\n\n0.310\n\n9\n\n1.0\n\n0.00091\n\n0.195\n\nFor case 6, NY = 32 , NZ = 45 , z\xc2\xa3 = - 4.4 , zu = 4.4 ,\nand yu = 7.0 .

This observation at first appears contradictory, but is simply explained by\nexamining the maximum computed level of turbulence present in\nthe vortex pair as a function of time. As can be seen in Fig.\n4.5, the internally produced turbulence in the descending oval\nfar exceeds the ambient value and, therefore, it is this internal process which intimately controls the descent of the pair\nin a stably stratified fluid.\nIn order to measure the decay rate of the vortices, rolling\nmoments induced on a follower aircraft of wing semispan sf have\nbeen computed and displayed in Fig. 4.6. It can be seen that the\nvortices have stopped their descent long before there has been\nany significant decay of rolling moment on the follower aircraft.\nThis is a major finding in that vortices may, as a result of\nstable stratification, be observed to stop descending but may\nstill be capable of inducing large rolling moments on an encountering aircraft.\n4.3\n\nA Simple Estimate of the Penetration of a Vortex Pair into a\nStably Stratified FluidT\n\nAnalysis of the streamline pattern generated while undertaking the above computations has shown that the volume of fluid\ndescending is "approximately" constant during much of the descent. This can be seen in Figs. 4.7 and 4.8 where > streamline\npatterns are shown for the Fr = 1 and 10 case, respectively.\nDuring the final stages of descent, when the descent velocity\nis approximately 25% of the initial value, recirculating oval\nsizes do change but the additional penetration distance covered\nafter this time is small when compared to the total penetration.\nThis observation suggests a simple model which can be used to\nestimate maximum penetration. This model is based on an energy\nbalance.\nThe initial kinetic energy of the pair is related to the\ninduced drag of the wing. Expressing the induced drag as a\nmultiple of the drag of an elliptically loaded wing we write\nD\n\nind. - 5\xc2\xabPoro\n\n<4 6)\n\n\'\n\nwhere 3 is a function of the spread of vorticity a .

To demonstrate that the WAKE\ncode can be adapted to compute these flowfield configurations, a\nsample calculation was undertaken of the ascent of two equal " j\nstrength vortices of opposite sign in a square enclosure.\nThe calculation simulates a square tunnel with walls located\nat y/s = \xc2\xb11.0 , z/s = \xc2\xb11.0 , and the flow is initialized with two\nGaussian vortices of the form\n= \xc2\xb14.0e-(r/s)2/(0-16)2\n\nt5\'1)\n\nlocated at z/s = 0 , y/s = \xc2\xb10.31 , respectively, in a uniform\nbackground turbulence of magnitude (2irs/r)2qz = 0.01 . The turbu-,\nlent scale is initialized as A/s =0.2 , the Reynolds number is 10^\nand the numerical grid is uniform in both directions with a spacing\nof Ay/s = Az/s = 1/16 . The law of the wall boundary condition,\ndescribed in section 2, is applied at all four walls. Isopleths of\nthe vorticity field at three times tr/2irs2 =0 , 5.0 , 9.0 are\nshown in Figs. 5.1 - 5.3. Note that the vortex pair is self-induced\nto move upwards and produces vorticity of opposite sign on the wind\ntunnel walls. Note also that this simulation could have been run\nusing half the mesh points if the symmetry of the solution had been\nutilized.\n5.2\n\nRoll Up of a Vortex Sheet\n\nThe vorticity that is shed from the trailing edge of a wing is\ninitially a vortex sheet which then rolls up into discrete vortices.\nThe difficulties of computing sheet roll up by finite difference\nare tied to the problem of the high numerical resolution required\nto resolve the sheet of vorticity. To check to see if finite difference is a feasible technique, a sample calculation has been performed.

Direct computation has shown that the circulation in a fixed contour and the rolling moment induced on an encountering aircraft decay asymptotically\nfor large times as t~l\'2 m\n\n2.\n\nThe presence of ambient background turbulence in a\nneutral atmosphere has a strong influence on the decay\nrate of a vortex pair. Direct\'.computation has shown\nthat asymptotically for large time, the circulation in\na fixed contour and the rolling moment induced on an\nencountering aircraft decay as t~2 . More detailed\npredictions of the decay rate must include specification of-the integral-scale of turbulence if comparisons\nare to be made with measured data.\n\n3.\n\nCrosswind shear results in the observed solitary vortex\nphenomenon. The vortex whose vorticity is of the sign\nopposite to that vorticity in the shear is dispersed.\nThe decay of the solitary vortex is dependent on the\namount of ambient turbulence associated with the shear.\nIt is postulated that under stable conditions, where\nshear can be present without turbulence, the solitary\nvortex may persist for a long time.\n\n4.\n\nThe classic picture of a vortex pair descending towards\na ground plane following a hyperbolic trajectory is\nshown to be incorrect. Viscous interaction with the\nground plane results in the generation and separation\nof secondary vorticity from the ground. This secondary\nvorticity reduces the strength of the vortex wake as\nwell as results in a rebounding or bouncing of the pair\naway from the ground.\n\n5.\n\nA vortex pair descending into a stably stratified incompressible atmosphere is shown to have a finite penetration dependent upon the severity of the stratification.\nIt is suggested that proper accounting of turbulent\ntransport is as important as proper accounting for the\nbuoyancy produced vorticity in predicting the dissipation of a vortex pair in a stably stratified fluid. A\nmajor finding is that once a vortex pair\'s descent is\nhalted by stratification, the vortex is still capable\nof inducing a significant rolling moment on an encountering aircraft of a span less than or equal to the\ngenerator\'s span.\n46\n\n6.\n\nLastly, sample calculations have shown that the WAKE code\ncan be used to compute the initial sheet roll up as well\nas to simulate vortex flows in rectangular enclosures.\nThis capability should prove useful in future wake\nrelated work.\n\nThe results obtained from this study warrant the following\nrecommendations.\nIt is becoming increasingly apparent that the WAKE code has the\npotential of being an invaluable predictive tool in flow situations\nwhere it is impractical or even impossible to make measurements.\nThe code\'s usefulness is, however, limited until proper validation\nagainst vortex related data can be completed. It is strongly\nrecommended that a set of experiments be devised which will produce\nsufficient data appropriate to validate the WAKE code.\nResults of analytic studies reported here suggest that the\natmosphere plays a powerful role in affecting the dissipation of\naircraft vortex wakes. No comparison is directly made with data.\nThe Department of Transportation, as part of their effort in the\nvortex hazard program, has monitored the descent of thousands of\nvortex wakes under various atmospheric conditions. It is suggested\nthat a review of these data and correlation against predictions\nmade herein will increase our understanding of the ability of the\natmosphere to dissipate vortex wakes.\n\n47\n\nAPPENDIX\nPresented at the 16th Aerospace Sciences Meeting,\nHuntsville, Alabama, January 17, 1978.\nTHE ROLE OF ATMOSPHERIC SHEAR. TURBULENCE AND A GROUND PLANE\nON THE DISSIPATION OF AIRCRAFT VORTEX WAKES\nA. J. Bilanin.* M. E. Teske1" and J. E. Hirstf\nAeronautical Research Associates of Princeton, Inc.\n50 Washington Road. Princeton, New Jersey 08540\nAbstract\nEnhanced dispersion of two-dimensional\ntrailed vortex pairs within simplified\nneutral atmospheric backgrounds is studied\nnumerically for three conditions: when the\npair is imbedded in a constant turbulent\nbath (constant dissipation); when the pair\nis subjected to a mean cross-wind shear;\nand when the pair is near the ground. Turbulent transport is modeled using secondorder closure turbulent transport theory.\nThe turbulent background fields are constructed using a superequilibrium approximation. The computed results allow several\ngeneral conclusions to be drawn with regard\nto the reduction in circulation of the vortex pair and the rolling moment induced on\na following aircraft: Tl) the rate of\ndecay of a vortex pair increases with increasing background dissipation rate; (2)\ncross-wind shear disperses the vortex whose\nvorticity is opposite to the background;\nand (3) the proximity of a ground plane reduces the hazard of the pair by scrubbing.\nThe phenomenon of vortex bounce is explained in terms of secondary vorticity produced\nat the ground plane. Qualitative comparisons are made with available experimental\ndata, and inferences of these results upon\nthe persistence of aircraft trailing vortices are discussed.\nNomenclature\npassive tracer (C*\nc/co)\nproportional to the induced rolling\nmoment, Eq.

A comprehensive\nreview of the entire subject has recently\nbeen given by Hallock and Eberle.\nIn\nBilanin, Teske and Williamson^ (hereafter\nreferred to as "I"), we used the pointvortex approach of Rossow^ to initiate a\ndiscussion of vortex merging, wherein vortices of like sign interact. The thrust in\nI was the application of turbulent transport theory to the merging process, to provide for a complete description of the\nconvective and dissipative processes within\nthe vortices themselves. The two-dimensional, unsteady numerical code, "VORTEX\nWAKE," programs the Reynolds stress equations modeled by Donaldson.5 The formulation of the modeled equation and the\nnumerical procedures involved in solving\nthem are included in I, as is an extensive\ndiscussion of the merging of multiple\ntrailing vortices and the minimum hazard\npotential for a wing.\nOne important result from I is that a\npair of oppositely-signed vortices exhibit\na surprisingly slow rate of decay when\n\xe2\x80\xa2descending in a calm, neutral atmosphere\n\nCopyrighl \xc2\xa9 Amrrtein lutltulrof AeroMuUd ind\nAnronaotlo, Int., 1971.

More commonly, vortex pairs encounter background turbulence, mean wind\ngradients, or the ground while descending\nin an atmosphere which is not in general\nneutrally stable. The effects of background turbulence, wind shear and ground\ninteraction form the subject of this paper.\nHere, we will demonstrate through the use\nof our turbulent transport code that any of\nthese quite naturally occurring effects may\nsubstantially reduce the lifetime of a vortex pair. Descent of a vortex pair in a\nstably stratified atmosphere will be the\nsubject of a subsequent paper.\nIn Section II, we briefly review the\nturbulent transport model and examine the\nsuperequilibrium limit of this model which\nis used to provide idealized atmospheric\nenvironments. Also, improvements in the\nnumerical code are discussed here.\nIn Section III, we examine the effects\nof background turbulence on a vortex pair,\nshowing that decay increases with increasing dissipation rate. In Section IV, we\ninvestigate the effects of mean shear and\noffer an explanation of the "solitary" vortex phenomenon. Finally, in Section V, we\ninvestigate vortex interaction with a\nground plane and explain the phenomenon of\nvortex bounce which has been observed on\nrunways and in subscale tests.\nII.\n\nThe Turbulence Model and "Vortex Wake"\nCode\n\nA need to predict turbulent transport\nin\nrapidly rotating, as well as stratified flows,led Donaldson to develop a\nsecond-order closure model of turbulent\ntransport. A second-order model implies\nthat partial differential equations are\nsolved for the Reynolds stress tensor\n<u^uj> as well as for the mean ensemble\naveraged U^ velocity components. Higherorder unknowns and certain second-order\ncorrelations in the Reynolds stress equations are replaced by modeled terms containing constants and second-order correlations. These constants are evaluated by\ncomparison with measurements made of fundamental fluid flows. A complete summarization of the current state of incompressible\nmodeling as used here may be found in\nLewellen and Teske.\nThe computations\nwhich follow idealize the neutral atmosphere by assuming constant shear and homogeneous turbulence in the absence of a vortex wake. The background turbulence levels\nare determined by the "superequilibrium"\nlimit of the turbulent transport model.5\nSuperequilibrium limit is that turbulent\nfluid state which is approached at high\nReynolds number when time rates of change\nand diffusion of second-order correlations\nare negligible. When the diffusion and\nrate terms are set equal to zero in the\nrate equations for the second-order velocity correlations and a high Reynolds number is assumed, the resulting Reynolds\n\n49\n\nstress equations for <u^u.>\nwritten as:\n^\nproduction\n\nmay be\n\n3U\n3U?\n-<uiV 5xJ \'<Ukuj> 3^\ntendency towards\nisotropy\n\nisotropic\ndissipation (1)\n\nwhere q2 = <u.u.> and A is the turbulent\nmacroscale. TRe production terms in (1)\nare balanced by a Rotta tendency-towardsisotropy term and an isotropic dissipation\nterm. If the principle gradient is in the\nz-direction for the U velocity, for instance, then it may be shown that the solution to (1) is\n\n<uu> = (A ffj\n<w>\n\n= <ww> = 0. 5 (A\n\n(2)\n\n<uw> = -0.354 (A |^)\n<uv> = <vw> = 0\nIn the vicinity of a ground plane, the\nvelocity gradient is inversely proportional\nto z , (with z measured upwards from the\'\nground) while the macroscale is proportional\nto z , maintaining a constant product of\nA3U/3z .\nThe mean and rate equations for the\nsecond-order equations correlations have\nbeen programmed into a two-dimensional unsteady incompressible computer code. The\nassumption of two-dimensionality implies\nthat the phenomena to be investigated are\nsuch that axial gradients are insignificant and can be neglected. Therefore,\nsinusoidal instability and vortex breakdown\nare phenomena which cannot be addressed\nwith this code.\nThe numerical solution technique (using an ADI scheme) is given in I. Several\nextensions to the code since the publication of I are the following. The mean\nequations have been reworked into streamfunction-vorticity variables, eliminating\nthe need to compute the pressure. A direct solver developed by Swartztrauber and\nSweet\' determines the streamfunction, from\nwhich the velocity fields are obtained.\nIn this way continuity is assured, even\nthough a more difficult set of boundary\nconditions may sometimes result. To improve our simulation of the convective\nnature of the vortex flow problem, we now\nuse a J6 representation of the convective operator (Arakawa8), wherein the conservative and nonconservative operators are\naveraged.\n\nFor the specific computation of vortex\npairs, an upwash velocity is added to keep\nthe vortex pair in the computational domain.\nThis is equivalent to sitting on the vortex\npair as it descends. When the results are\npresented, however, the vertical coordinate is shifted to show the actual amount of\ndescent which has resulted. The choice as\nto what defines the position of a vortex is\narbitrary. In I the centroid of the vorticity distribution was used to define vortex location. This definition was adequate\nfor vortex pair computations in the absence\nof a ground plane. As will be shown later,\nhowever, when vortices interact with a\nground plane, vorticity of the opposite\nsign is generated at the ground. This additional vorticity limits the \'usefulness of\nthe centroid concept to fix position. To\novercome this difficulty a passive tracer\n(neutral smoke) is initially prescribed in\nthe center of the vortex and the maximum\nof this passive tracer is taken as the vortex center. As the pairs spread by turbulent diffusion, readjustment of the numerical grid is undertaken to keep the\nboundaries away from the centers of vorticity. This readjustment does not cause any\nnumerical problems.\nAs a convenience, initial distributions of vorticity, second-order turbulence\nquantities and passive tracer are taken to\nbe Gaussian. To reduce grid point requirements, whenever possible, half-plane computations are made. A uniform mesh is used\nexcept near the ground where additional \xe2\x80\xa2\nresolution is, in general, needed to define\nthe large shears that exist there.\nIII.\n\n2\n2\n<uu> = <w> = <ww> = (q0/3) exp [-(r/s)\n/oz) . When a passive tracer is used, it\nbegins-with the same Gaussian character and\nhas strength C0 = 1 . At the edges of the\ncomputation domain, except at the y = 0\nboundary, turbulent quantities are assumed\nto reach the superequilibrium state and\ntracer concentration is set equal to zero.\nThe streamfunction is obtained from moment\nexpansion of the Biot Savart law as described in I. The initial conditions are\nschematically shown in Fig. 1.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nz/s, W\n\nAz\n\nI\n\nf\n\nlip wash added to\ncancel descent\n\nI\n17 points-\n\nFigure 1. The initial conditions for the\ncomputation of the decay of a vortex pair\nin a neutrally stable turbulent atmosphere.\n\nVortex Pairs in Constant Turbulent\nBackgrounds\n\nIn I the decay of a vortex pair in a\nconstant dissipation rate turbulent bath\nwas investigated to show that the dissipation rate itself is not sufficient to determine the rate of decay of vortices. It\nwas shown that in a neutrally stable atmosphere, in the absence of mean cross wind\nshear, both the integral scale of the turbulent eddies, A , and the turbulent dissipation rate, E , must be specified to\nfix vortex wake decay rate. In this section, additional computations are described\nand simple decay laws are deduced from the\ncomputations.\nThe computations are initialized by\npositioning a Gaussian of vorticity of the\nform c2TTs"/r0 = \xc2\xb1 (2/<j2) exp (-(r/s)"/d2)\nat y/s = \xc2\xb1 1 , z = 0 .respectively.\nThe coordinate, r , is measured radially\noutward from the vortex center and o is\nthe vortex spread, (o = 0.5 for all computations) . The numerical mesh is specified\nonly for y > 0 since symmetries about\ny = 0 can be utilized. In addition to a\nuniform background level of turbulence an\nisotropic Gaussian spot of turbulence is\npositioned in the center of each vortex of\nstrength (q 2ns/ro)2 = 0.01 , such that\n\nAs a baseline computation the ambient\nturbulent field was set equal to zero and\nthe decay of a vortex pair in.a calm atmosphere was simulated. In this computation,\nas in all computations presented here unless otherwise noted, the integral scale\nparameter was initialized to be A/s = 0 . 2\nand the Reynolds number was fixed at ro/v\n= 10^ . The evolution of the scale is\ncontrolled by a dynamic scale equation detailed in I. As can be seen by examining\nthe contour plots of vorticity for several\ntimes as shown in Fig. 2, a vortex pair in\na calm atmosphere is predicted to dissipate\nvery slowly. The vorticity distribution\nretains its shape initially (except for\nsome slight vortex-on-vortex straining),\nand shows signs of trailing a wake after 20\nvortex flow times. The vorticity level has\ndropped a factor of 10 below its initial\nvalue after 100 vortex flow times. For a\ntypical landing B-747 aircraft, a flow time\nroughly corresponds to about 10 seconds.\nThe apparent persistence of the vortex pair\nis not in agreement with observation.\nA substantial increase in the decay\nrate occurs when the pair is placed in a\nturbulent flowfield. We assume that the\nturbulence is the result of a headwind\n\n50\n\n3 3\n0) cr\nC <U\nCO\n\nE *\n\n.-I 3\nQJ\n\no\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCD\n\nin\n.Co\n\no uo\nCi-l\n\n) OO\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2o uc c \xe2\x84\xa2\n0) DO\nO l< \xe2\x80\xa2\nCO CO\nCD\n\n*O\n\n03 LO\n\na) o\n^ 3 \xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2H i-<\nCO cs O. >i-l\n<U 3 J-) O C*J\ntJ U \xe2\x80\xa2\n\nO C\n\n> o u tn\n<0\n\n0) 6\nM O\n0) VJ\n\na.\n\nM-I ra B\no o cu\nBA:\no> u a\n\ncu cu ra\n\n\xc2\xab-H r-t\nO.J3\n\nO\n\n0)\n3\n\n- CO\nI-l CO >\nCO\n\n00\ni-l\n[h\n\n51\n\ngradient, 3U/3z , such that the background turbulent level through (2) is nonzero and homogeneous.\nIf the scale length is taken to be\nA/s = 0.2 and (3U/3z)/(re/2ns2l = 0.56\nthe dissipation rate, (2ir)3s4e/r3 = 0.0025\nis obtained. Isopleths of vorticity are\nshown in Fig. 3. In comparison with Fig. 2,\nit can be seen that substantial diffusion\nof the vorticity has occurred, with a drop\nin\'maximum value of an order-of-magnitude\nbelow the zero background case. In addition, the structure of the vortex pair has\nbeen noticeably altered. It is clear from\nthe shape of the isopleths at times greater\nthan tr/2irs2 = 20.0 that the vortex pair\nleaves a wake of low intensity vorticity.\nAn extrapolation of the decay of the pair\nwithout background turbulence shows that\nover 10^ flow times must pass before the\nzero background pair would decay to the\nsame level as this decayed pair in 100 flow\ntimes.\n\ntracer. Curiously the E = 0 computation\nhas a long time decay of r - t~l\'2 . This\ntime behavior may be shown to be the diffusion limit of a turbulent decaying pair\nonce mean fluid convection of vorticity\nis neglected. As a general expected observation, when the integral scale is initialized to be the same between turbulent atmospheres of differing dissipation rate at\ncomparable times after wake initialization,\nincreased E results in decreased circulation computed over a fixed contour. By\nfar, however; it is our inability to\nquantify A in the atmosphere which precludes deriving a general decay curve for\nneutral turbulent atmospheres.\nCorresponding rolling moment predictions for a follower aircraft, having a\ncoaxial encounter with the vortex, are\ngiven in Fig. 5.\nHere the rolling moment\n\nTwo quantities have been selected to\nquantify the amount of decay which occurs\nin a vortex pair; the circulation in a\ngiven area, and an integral which is\napproximately proportional to the rolling\nmoment induced on a constant chord airfoil\nof semispan Sf .

This general\nenhanced decay in the left vortex, is attrt\nbuted to the turbulent diffusion associated\nwith the cross shear. It has been speculated that in the atmosphere over periods\nof tens of minutes it is possible to have\nshear with turbulence when the atmosphere\nis stably stratified. One might speculate\nthat under these conditions the solitary\nvortex may indeed persist for long periods\nof time.\nV. Vortex Pair in Ground Effect\n\nflight tests that under certain atmospheric\nconditions the smoke in one vortex would\nvanish while the second vortex remained intact. This phenomenon has come to be called the solitary vortex phenomenon. At the\ntime of observation, it was conjectured\nthat atmospheric shear might be responsible\nin some way. More recently, Rossow10 using\ndistributions of point vortices has shown\nthat a vortex immersed in a cross shear is\nrapidly distorted when the shear is of opposite sign of the vorticity. Computations\nwere undertaken to see if the large distortion in vortex structure could generate\nturbulence and thereby diffuse the smoke\nseeded in the vortex to make it visible.\n\nOne of the most perplexing observations of vortices has been the rebounding\nof a vortex as it approaches the ground.\nThe phenomenon, we believe, was first\nobserved by Dee and Nicholas \' \' in 1968 and\n-\xe2\x80\xa2\nhas been observed numerous times by researchers measuring vortex trajectories at\nairports. \'\' In 1971 Harvey and Perry,13\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\nprompted by the above observation, conducted a series of tests in a wind tunnel with\na moving floor to simulate correctly the\nground plane. Using total head probes they\nconcluded that the proximity of the vortex\nto the ground plane could result in boundary layer separation and secondary vorticity which could explain the upward\nmigration of the vortex pair.\n\nThe computation was initialized, as in\nFig. .1, but now a cross shear of magnitude\n6 = (3V/3z)/(2Tis2/ro) = 0.5 was imposed.\nFigures 6 and 7 show isopleths of vorticity\nand turbulence. The vortex of sign opposite to the cross shear is distorted which\nresults in an increased turbulent level inside the vortex. Figure 8 is the computed\ndispersion of passive tracer which results.\nThe fluid mechanisms which result in the\nenhanced dispersion of smoke in one vortex\nare now clear. It is concluded that it is\ncross wind that is responsible for the\nphenomenon of the solitary vortex.\nTo quantify the decay of vortices in\ncross shear, the rolling moment was computed and is shown in Fig. 9. Note that\n\nThe computer code was modified to include a viscous ground plane in an effort\nto simulate the ground interaction. The\nsurface is fixed at a level plane z = zo\n(where zo is the roughness height). As\nfar as the streamfunction boundary conditions are concerned, this surface is merely\nanother reflecting plane across which\noppositively-signed image vortices influence the flow (much as the image vortex of\nstrength -r\ndid in Sections III and IV).\nThe vortex pair will be assumed sufficiently close to the surface so that the velocity gradient, 3U/3z , maintaining a small\nturbulence level, may be taken to be\ninversely proportional to z . Since the\nscale length is proportional to z in the\nMonin-Obukhov sublayer, the background\nturbulence level may still be taken constant. All necessary turbulence quantities,\nhowever, will be given zero vertical gradients at the hydrodynamic roughness height.\nWe relate the vorticity level at the surface to the streamfunction there by a finite difference representation of the\nPoisson equation and the velocity law-ofthe-wall to give:\n\nFigure 9.

Normalized constant cross shear\nis 6 = 0.5.\n\nn =1+\n\nthe rolling moment induced by the right vortex is about half that induced by the left\nvortex at six flow times. As can be seen\nat six flow times, both the right and left\nvortices induce rolling moments on a follower aircraft which are well below the\n\n2zrin(z/z0\nAz\n\n()\n4\n\nwhere < i is the streamfunction value at\n(+\nz+ = zr + iz , and zr is the reference z\nheight above zo (typically zr/s = 0.01).\nWhen the flow simulation begins, (4) gives\nan immediate surface vorticity layer of opposite sign to the vortex convecting toward\n\n54\n\nthe surface from above.\ntour plots of vorticity\nz0/s = 10"* , with the\npositioned at y/s = \xc2\xb11\nin Fig. 10.\n\nA sequence of confor the case where\nvortices initially\n, z/s = 2 , is shown\n\nZ/S\n\n\\ 4\nV*=-;\n\n8\n\n\\Z\n\ny/s\n\nAs the vortex approaches the ground\n(its pair is across the reflecting plane at\ny = 0 ) , the boundary layer beneath grows\nand separates, resulting in a secondary\nvortex. The secondary vortex is of the\nopposite sign to the descending vortex\naround which it is advected. The secondary vortex induces an upward and outward\nmotion on the descending vortex pair, which\nresults in a rebound (bounce) of the pair\naway from the ground plane. The rebound\nphenomenon described here suggests that the\nclassical "inviscid" description of a pair\nof vortices following a hyperbolic trajectory may not be a particularly good model.\nIn Fig. 11 is shown the computed trajectories of the maximum value of passive\ntracer.\n\nC*=2\nt*=8\nLaminar ground\ninteraction\n\nTurbulent ground\ninteraction\nr0/, = io4\n20/\n\nInviscid point vortex\ntrajectories\n\nFigure 11.

Negative contours generated near the wall follow -5, -2, -1,\n-.05, -.02, -.01, -.005.\n\n55\n\nNote that a laminar computation has been\nundertaken at T0/v = 100 and the rebounding phenomenon still occurs.\n14\nCuriously, Barker and Crow\nhave\nrecently investigated vortex pairs in\nground effect and have attributed the rebound to effects of finite vortex core\nradius. To demonstrate that this explanation is suspect, we have undertaken a computation with an inviscid boundary condition applied on the ground (vanishing of\nvertical velocity). The vortex spread,\na = 0 . 5 , is used and the results of the\ncomputation are summarized also in Fig. 11.\nAs can be seen the rebounding phenomenon\ndoes not occur unless the viscous boundary\ncondition is applied, even though the vortex cores are of finite size. It is seen\nthat the finite difference solution with\ninviscid ground plane is in good agreement\nwith the hyperbolic point vortex trajectories. The slight drift upward results\nfrom diffusion of the smoke.\nThe decay which results from scrubbing\nalong a viscous ground is "presented in\nFig. 12. Included is the rolling moment\njdecay curve with zero background turbulence\ntaken from Fig. 5.\n\nis hyperbolic is generally not correct.\nThe vortex pair rebounds or bounces\naway from the ground as a result of\nseparation of the ground boundary\nlayer below the vortex. It is shown\nthat this separation results in secondary vortices which induce a velocity on the descending vortices outward and upward, thereby explaining\nthe rebounding phenomenon. It is\nspeculated that when cross winds are\npresent symmetries of the secondary\nvortices are destroyed. This results\nin tipping of the descending pair\nwhich has been observed.\nAcknowledgement\nThis work was sponsored by NASA,\nLangley Research Center under contract No.\nNAS1-14707.\nFigure 12.
