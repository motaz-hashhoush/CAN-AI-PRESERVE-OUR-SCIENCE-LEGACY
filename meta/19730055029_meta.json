The study was completed in three phases. The  first report presented the information needs of the state agencies and educational efforts; the second defined the data handling procedures for fulfilling the applications; and the third phase was a development of a dynamic information dissemination plan on a state-wide basis. Aircraft data, satellite imagery, and other remotely sensed information are valuable for decision-making processes. A design for an organization to acquire for the state the advantages of remote-sensing systems for resources research and management has been developed.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19730055029, "endDate": "1972-10-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "International Symposium on Remote Sensing of Environment", "location": "Ann Arbor, MI", "id": "132f4146bfc944398907d8c4404720e9", "startDate": "1972-10-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19730055029, "id": "f82ac914b56b453294ec77795696445e", "publicationDate": "1973-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
