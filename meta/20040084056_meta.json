It is responsible for Agency wide technical standards development, adoption (endorsement), and conversion of Center-unique standards for Agency wide use. One major element of the Program is the review of NSA technical standards products and replacement with non-Government Voluntary Consensus Standards in accordance with directions issued by the Office of Management and Budget. As part of the Program s function, it developed a NASA Integrated Technical Standards Initiative that consists of and Agency wide full-text system, standards update notification system, and lessons learned - standards integration system. The Program maintains a \"one stop-shop\" Website for technical standards ad related information on aerospace materials, etc. This paper provides information on the development, current status, and plans for the NAS Technical Standards Program along with metrics on the utility of the products provided to both users within the nasa.gov Domain and the Public Domain.", "title": "NASA Technical Standards Program", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T11:39:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20040084056, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Gill, Paul S."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Marshall Space Flight Center", "location": "Huntsville, AL, United States"}}, "id": "d68f0d08d3c84a4fba121eafc197c3c2"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20040084056, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Vaughan, WIlliam W."}, "organization": {"name": "Alabama Univ.", "location": "Huntsville, AL, United States"}}, "id": "fdc19c35e2254ffb88b0801d12346e48"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20040084056, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20040084056, "id": "f1735f525458460a84666e40f6554431", "publicationName": "5th Conference on Aerospace Materials, Processes, and Environmental Technology", "publicationDate": "2003-11-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20040083973, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "5th Conference on Aerospace Materials, Processes, and Environmental Technology", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20040084056.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20040084056/downloads/20040084056.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20040084056/downloads/20040084056.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20040084056/downloads/20040084056.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
