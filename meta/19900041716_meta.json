The gas phase is assumed to remain quasi-steady and the liquid temperature spatially uniform. The ratio of the liquid-phase diffusion coefficient to the initial burning-rate constant is treated as a small parameter. Asymptotic analyses in this parameter are developed, and the conservation equations are integrated numerically in obtaining descriptions of the combustion history. It is shown that at the surface of the droplet a boundary layer arises in which the mass fraction of the low-volatility component increases with time. The results are used to explain qualitatively some observed conditions of flame contraction and liquid disruption in droplet combustion.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"volume": "33", "submissionId": 19900041716, "issn": "0017-9310", "id": "7e46b010f3e4448c8d13afe8e97923cd", "publicationName": "International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer", "publicationDate": "1990-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
