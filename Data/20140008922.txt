b'Generic Airspace Survey\nRichard Mogford,1 Wayne Bridges,2 Vimmy Gujral,3 Paul U. Lee,4\nand William Preston 5\nNASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA, 94035, U.S.A.\n\nThis paper reports on an extension of generic airspace research to explore the amount of\nmemorization and specialized skills required to manage sectors with specific characteristics\nor factors. Fifty-five retired controllers were given an electronic survey where they rated the\namount of memorization or specialized skills needed for sixteen generic airspace factors. The\nresults suggested similarities in the pattern of ratings between different areas of the US\n(East, Central, and West). The average of the ratings for each area also showed some\ndifferences between regions, with ratings being generally higher in the East area. All sixteen\nfactors were rated as moderately to highly important and may be useful for future research\non generic airspace, air traffic controller workload, etc.\n\nNomenclature\nANOVA\nARTCC\nCC\nCD&R\nCIT\nFAA\nICF\nKSA\nNASA\nTRACON\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\nAnalysis of Variance\nAir Route Traffic Control Center\nCognitive Construct\nConflict Detection and Resolution\nController Information Tool\nFederal Aviation Administration\nIntegrated Control Facility\nKnowledge, skills, and abilities\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\nTerminal Radar Control Facility\n\nI. Introduction\nGeneric sectors are defined as segments of airspace in Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Air Route Traffic\nControl Centers (ARTCCs) that controllers could manage without significant specialized training or experience,\nbeyond what they would normally acquire to become certified. Generic airspace is part of the Next Generation Air\nTransportation System (NextGen) vision.1\nThe generic sector concept would apply to low complexity sectors in high altitude airspace. It may also\nencompass sectors with moderate traffic and complexity, given that limited local knowledge and specialized skills\nare required. An ability to identify and provide generic sectors could be helpful when facilities redesign or\nreorganize the airspace in the NextGen timeframe. The goal of this research was to identify and explore techniques\nthat could be considered when creating or identifying generic sectors.\nThe FAA is developing plans to reconfigure the US airspace and replace the facilities that control it.2 There are\ndiscussions about moving from 20 ARTCCs and over 50 Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) facilities to\nsix Integrated Control Facilities (ICFs). An ICF would combine en route and terminal operations and include a\nmodern, open floor plan, enhanced amenities, and improved training capabilities.\n\n1\n\nResearch Psychologist, Human System Integration Division, MS 262-4; richard.mogford@nasa.gov\nEnroute/Oceanic Air Traffic Control Associate, Flight Research Associates, MS 257-1; wayne.bridges@nasa.gov\n3\nResearch Engineer, San Jose State University, MS 257-1; vimmy.gujral@nasa.gov\n4\nSenior Research Associate, San Jose State University, MS 262-6; paul.u.lee@nasa.gov\n5\nSenior Airspace Operations Specialist, Dell Services, MS 210-15; bill.preston@nasa.gov\n1\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n2\n\nIn the ICFs, it is expected that lower altitude sectors near airports will continue to be complex, requiring special\nprocedures, routings, altitude restrictions, etc. However, at or above 24,000 feet (FL240), aircraft will mostly be in\nstraight and level flight and controllers will primarily be keeping traffic separated and dealing with weather issues. It\nmay be that some of this airspace could be classified as generic. Therefore, it is important to identify characteristics\n(or factors) that may be present in sectors that would make them difficult to manage (and so \xe2\x80\x9cnon-generic\xe2\x80\x9d). There\nhas been extensive research on sector complexity factors that generate controller workload,3 but very little\ninvestigation of factors that necessitate special knowledge and skills to manage airspace.\n\nII. Background\nIt is evident that the FAA may be moving toward large facilities that will hold many more sectors than the\ncurrent ARTCCs and TRACONs. The existing restrictions that limit controllers to working six to eight sectors in an\narea of specialization could constrain the flexibility and staffing of the ICFs. However, generic airspace research, in\npreparation for a NextGen ICF environment, can provide technology and methods that may increase the number of\nsectors controllers can manage.\nThe first area of benefit results from systems that are either anticipated to be in place for NextGen, or have been\ndeveloped as part of generic airspace research. DataComm and conflict detection/resolution (CD&R) are automation\ntools that should reduce controller workload and errors. They may also lessen the amount of information that\ncontrollers must remember. For example, DataComm obviates the need to memorize sector frequencies when\ninitiating handoffs.\nResearch on generic airspace by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)4,5,6 and MITRE7,8\nhas resulted in the development of on-screen displays, such as the Controller Information Tool (CIT), that provide\nessential information to controllers so that they do not have to rely on memorization as much as in today\xe2\x80\x99s system.\nThese workload reduction and safety tools can help controllers manage a larger number of sectors, thus supporting\nstaffing flexibility in ICFs.\nThe second area where generic airspace research may be of benefit is the identification of sector complexity\nfactors that can be considered when selecting or designing sectors. Previous work has assumed that generic sectors\nmust be, by definition, simple in terms of traffic, procedures, and events (e.g., weather). Certainly, simple sectors\ncould be considered generic in that controllers could manage traffic without extensive local knowledge. Data that are\nneeded could be supplied by a CIT-type system.\nOther sectors may seem more complex because they possess certain features, such as military traffic or a mix of\naircraft types (e.g., turboprop and jets). However, if operating such sectors is included in a certified controller\xe2\x80\x99s\nabilities, and does not require much specialized (local) knowledge or unique skills and abilities, then these sectors\ncould also be considered generic. A controller could work traffic in such sectors with a reasonable amount of\nadditional memorization and skills.\nIf the generic sector concept can be extended from being constrained to simple sectors to also include up to\nmoderately complex sectors, it could lead to a new approach to the current areas of specialization. Controllers in an\nICF would be assigned to an area containing a larger set of sectors than is possible today. The challenge is to\nidentify factors that would affect whether a sector can be considered generic.\n\nIII. Approach\nAssuming the presence of DataComm, CD&R, CIT, and other tools, the following discussion focuses on the\namount of information and skills controllers have to learn to manage a sector. To address this, NASA identified a set\nof 16 complexity or generic airspace factors, based on prior research. These were incorporated into an online\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeneric Airspace Survey\xe2\x80\x9d that had two \xe2\x80\x9ccognitive constructs\xe2\x80\x9d (CCs): memorization and skills. These two\nconstructs are related to the concept of \xe2\x80\x9cknowledge, skills, and abilities\xe2\x80\x9d or KSAs. KSAs are used to identify\nrequirements for employment. For this study, we emphasized memorization (an aspect of obtaining knowledge) and\nspecialized skills. (We omitted the \xe2\x80\x9cabilities\xe2\x80\x9d component, judging it to be closely related to skills in this context.)\nEach of the generic airspace factors may require some amount of memorization of sector data and/or specialized\nskills to manage traffic. By separating out these CCs, we hoped to better define the variables relevant to generic\nairspace.\nIn the survey, the same set of factors was used twice. The first part of the survey asked: \xe2\x80\x9cAssuming that the\nairspace is at or above FL240 and that the traffic density is moderate, please rate the amount of memorized\ninformation required to work sectors with the following characteristics.\xe2\x80\x9d The second section asked: \xe2\x80\x9cAssuming\nagain that the airspace is at or above FL240 and that the traffic density is moderate, please rate the amount of\nspecialized skills required to work sectors with the following characteristics.\xe2\x80\x9d The rating scales were 1 (low) to 5\n2\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n(high) with an additional \xe2\x80\x9cnot applicable\xe2\x80\x9d response option. The survey was given remotely (via the Internet) to 55\nretired en route controllers.\nGeneric Airspace Survey Factors:\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n8.\n9.\n10.\n11.\n12.\n13.\n14.\n15.\n16.\n\nLimited number of flight levels\nMany climbing and/or descending aircraft\nSeveral nearby major airports\nMany required procedures\nMany Letters of Agreement\nSeveral merging traffic flows\nSeveral crossing traffic flows\nSeveral conflict points ("hot spots")\nComplex airspace structure\nLimited maneuvering space\nFrequent weather events that affect operations\nHigh mix of traffic (e.g., capabilities, speeds)\nSpecial Use Airspace\nMany military flights\nMany Traffic Management Advisories\nLimited radio and radar coverage\n\nIV. Results\nIn the analysis, the data were organized by the 16 generic airspace factors, two CCs (amount of memorization\nrequired and amount of specialized skills required), and geographical areas. With regard to the third element, the\nsurvey data were separated into three groups corresponding to the area of the US where the retired controller had last\nworked. The following table shows the ARTCCs that were delegated to each area (East, Central, and West). There\nwere 20 respondents from the East area, 18 from Central, and 17 from West for a total of 55. (Not all facilities were\nrepresented in the responses.)\nTable 1.

This provides a graphical indication of the relative importance of the factors. The range of\nindividual mean scores was between 2.8 to 4.1 (out of 5) in the amount of memorization needed. The results are in\nthe medium to high range, suggesting the importance of memorization for these airspace factors and areas.\n3\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n=:.>"1,M/)1,-"<12;,-/1,9"\n=:.>"(,T,19"23"A51,,*,.+"\nS2*<7,E":)19<:;,"9+1/;+/1,"\nB,8,1:7".,:10>"*:R21":)1<21+9"\nB<,;):7"Q9,"A)19<:;,"\n=:.>";7)*0).5":.-O21"-,9;,.-).5":)1;1:P"\nL1,M/,.+"C,:+6,1",8,.+9"+6:+":N,;+"2<,1:I2.9"\nB,8,1:7"*,15).5"+1:@;"42C9"\n\nWXB?"\n\n=:.>"*)7)+:1>"4)56+9"\n\nSXY?VA("\n\nB,8,1:7";2.4);+"<2).+9"FK62+"9<2+9KJ"\n\nXAB?"\n\nD)56"*)E"23"+1:@;"F,G5GH";:<:0)7)I,9H"9<,,-9J"\nB,8,1:7";1299).5"+1:@;"42C9"\n=:.>"?1:@;"=:.:5,*,.+"A-8)921),9"\n()*)+,-"*:.,/8,1).5"9<:;,"\n()*)+,-"1:-)2":.-"1:-:1";28,1:5,"\n()*)+,-"./*0,1"23"4)56+"7,8,79"\n!"\n\n#"\n\n$"\n\n%"\n\n&"\n\n\'"\n\nA*2/.+"23"=,*21)U:I2."V,M/)1,-"\n\nFigure 1.

Controllers rated the importance of the factors generally the same within each CC. However, a\ncorrelation of the ratings (averaged across areas) between the CCs was not statistically significant, indicating that the\npattern of ratings between the CCs is not similar.\n5\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nAn Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was completed to determine if the averages of the memorization ratings\nacross all factors varied between the three geographical areas. There was a significant difference between the\naverages F(2, 45) = 5.07, p = .010. Tukey post-hoc comparisons between the three means indicated that the East\nratings (M = 3.57, SD = 0.23) were significantly higher than the West ratings (M = 3.25, SD = 0.30), p = .031.\nComparisons between the other groups were not statistically significant at p < .05.\nAn ANOVA was also completed to determine if the averages of ratings for specialized skills differed between\nthe three areas. For these data, there was a significant difference between the average ratings F(2, 45) = 3.49, p =\n.039. Tukey post-hoc comparisons between the three means indicated that the East ratings (M = 3.77, SD = 0.26)\nwere significantly higher than the Central ratings (M = 3.45, SD = 0.40), p = .031. Comparisons between the other\ngroups were not statistically significant at p < .05.\nThese results show that the average ratings for East, Central, and West tended to be dissimilar, except in the\ncases noted above. Out of the six possible comparisons, there were statistically significant differences between two\npairs of areas. For memorization questions, the East ratings were higher than West and for specialize skills\nquestions, East was higher than Central. Although the differences are not uniform, this does suggest that airspace in\nthe ARTCCs in the eastern part of the US tends to be seen as requiring more memorization and specialized skills\nthan other areas of the country.\n\nV. Conclusion\nThe generic airspace factors used in this study were derived from prior research in the area. Over time, various\nsets of factors that could help account for sector complexity or controller workload have been identified and\nevaluated. The survey data reported here confirms the importance of these factors. What is new is the focus on two\nseparate CCs involved in managing airspace: amount of memorization and specialized skills.\nThe overall results from a survey of 55 retired controllers show that the sixteen generic airspace factors for both\nmemorization and skills were rated from moderate to high in importance. While there were apparent differences in\nthe rankings in Figures 1 and 2, statistical testing was not practical, and so the order may not be reliable.\nHowever, for memorization and specialized skills, the patterns of ratings were related across the three\ngeographical areas. Although there are probably differences on some factors for ratings between the areas (e.g.,\n\xe2\x80\x9cMany climbing or descending aircraft\xe2\x80\x9d in Figure 1), the pattern of results was similar between East, Central, and\nWest. The average ratings between the three areas were different in most cases. For memorization, East was higher\nthan West and for specialized skills East was higher than Central. This might be expected since eastern US airspace\nis generally regarded as more complex and congested, thus requiring controllers to memorize more information and\ndevelop specialized skills.\nThe results of this work can be applied to research on generic airspace, sector complexity, skills, and other areas\nwhere there is interest on how airspace characteristics affect the memorization and specialized skills required in air\ntraffic control. The responses from the survey confirm that the list of 16 generic airspace factors should be include\nwhenever the characteristics of airspace and their effects on air traffic controllers must be considered.\n\nReferences\n1\nJoint Planning and Development Office, \xe2\x80\x9cNext Generation Air Transportation System Integrated Plan,\xe2\x80\x9d URL:\nwww.jpdo.gov/library/ngats_v1_1204r.pdf, December 2004.\n2\nKelly, S., FAA NextGen Facilities Program Overview, FAA, PowerPoint Presentation, August 2011.\n3\nBloem, M., Gupta, P., and Laui, C.
