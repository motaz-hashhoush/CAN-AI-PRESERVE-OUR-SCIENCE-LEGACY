A large portion of this sample are stars that are either proved active chromosphere stars or are candidates for such activity. The photometric data base consists of differential V measurements of the Vanderbilt 16 inch (41 cm) automatic photoelectric telescope and 25 observers at 26 observatories worldwide. Published photometric data have also been utilized, with proper adjustments made to ensure that all magnitudes are differential. Searches for photometric period, amplitudes, and times of minimum light showed 68 percent of the sample to be photometrically variable with periods found for 34. Two stars were deemed norvariable for the period of observation. Conclusive statements could not be made concerning the photometric variability of the 14 remaining stars.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"volume": "74", "submissionId": 19900059866, "issn": "0067-0049", "id": "d1d40ba2bb0543ecb71df33f77ed8322", "publicationName": "Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series", "publicationDate": "1990-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
