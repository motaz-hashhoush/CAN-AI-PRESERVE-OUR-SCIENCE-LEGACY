This is a classic example of an interdisciplinary problem, since the model-building requirements include the need for understanding and communication between technical disciplines on one hand, and the financial/accounting skill categories on the other. The systems approach is utilized within this context to establish a clearer and more objective relationship between reliability assurance and the subcategories (or subelements) that provide, or reenforce, the reliability assurance for a system. Subcategories are further subdivided as illustrated by a tree diagram. The reliability assurance elements can be seen to be potential alternative strategies, or approaches, depending on the specific goals/objectives of the trade studies. The scope was limited to the establishment of a proposed reliability cost-model format. The model format/approach is dependent upon the use of a series of subsystem-oriented CER's and sometimes possible CTR's, in devising a suitable cost-effective policy.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19730023640, "id": "79094914e39043e79a5562c629e1c088", "publicationDate": "1973-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19730023640.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19730023640/downloads/19730023640.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19730023640/downloads/19730023640.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19730023640/downloads/19730023640.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
