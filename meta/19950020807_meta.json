To carry out this study, the JTEC panel evaluated the framework of the Japanese consumer electronics industry and various technological and organizational factors that are likely to determine who will win and lose in the marketplace. This study begins with a brief overview of the electronics industry, especially as it operates in Japan today. Succeeding chapters examine the electronics infrastructure in Japan and take an in-depth look at the central issues of product development in order to identify those parameters that will determine future directions for electronic packaging technologies.", "title": "Microelectronics in Japan", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-16T21:33:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19950020807, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Boulton, William R."}, "organization": {"name": "Auburn Univ.", "location": "AL., United States"}}, "id": "ca49247e3b68451c8155f0dde278d2c2"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19950020807, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19950020807, "id": "7dfb4dafc7d8417fabdbfea07182f9b5", "publicationName": "JTEC Panel Report on Electronic Manufacturing and Packaging in Japan", "publicationDate": "1995-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19950020648, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Cataclysmic variables and related objects", "stiType": "SPECIAL_PUBLICATION", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
