These emissions are received and recorded on magnetic tape by two or more radio telescopes separated\nby large distances.\n\nThese signals are subsequently compared to\n\ndetermine the difference in the time at which the signals reached\neach telescope, and the time differences are analyzed\n\nto deter-\n\nmine the precise distance between each of the stations.\n\nCurrent-\n\nly the precision of this technique is on the order of 3 cm\n\n(1.4\n\nin. ) .\n\nBy making repeated measurements over a period of years using\nboth techniques, crustal motions as small as 1 cm per year can be\ndetermined.\n\nCurrent knowledge of the relative motions of the tec-\n\ntonic plates is based on paleomagnetic data and other information,\nand is averaged over the past several million years of geologic\ntime.\n\nThese averaged rates are estimated to be between 1 and 20\n\ncm/year.\n-more-\n\nUsing laser\n\nranging and Very Long Baseline Interferometry,\n\nthese movements can be directly measured for the first time, and\ntectonic\n\nmodels\n\ncan\n\nbe\n\nrevised\n\nto reflect contemporary\n\nplate\n\nmotion.\nIn California, Alaska and other regions of high earthquake\nactivity, the driving forces of plate tectonics cause a buildup\nof\n\ncrustal\n\nstress\n\nstrain\n\nexceeds\n\nnear\n\nthe\n\nplate\n\nboundaries.\n\nstrength of\n\nthe\n\nWhen\n\nthe resulting\n\nunderlying materials,\n\nstress is released in the form of earthquakes or slow creep.\n\nthe\nA\n\nmanor objective of the Crustal Dynamics Project is to measure and\nanalyze regional deformation and strain accumulation along major\nplate\n\nboundaries such\n\nas the San Andreas Fault\n\nin California,\n\nwhich separates the North American Plate from the Pacific Plate.\nThis will help us to understand the basic\'mechanisms leading to\nearthquakes,\n\nand\n\neventually\n\nto\n\nthe development\n\nof\n\na reliable\n\nearthquake prediction model.\nIn order to measure the accumulation of crustal strain over\nan\n\nactive\n\ntectonic region, measurements must be made at many\n\nsites. NASA has developed highly mobile systems using both laser\nranging\n\nand Very Long Baseline\n\nInterferometry technology which\n\ncan easily relocate from one site to another within a matter of\ndays.\n\nMobile\n\nsystems\n\nusing\n\nVery\n\nLong\n\nBaseline Interferometry\n\ntechniques have been developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory\nand mobile laser\n\nsystems\n\nhave been developed\n\nFlight Center and the University of Texas.\n\n-more-\n\nat Goddard Space\n\n-5-\n\nThese systems are now being deployed\n\nin the western United\n\nStates and the data obtained will be made available to the selected investigators. Over the life of the Crustal Dynamics Project,\nwhich will extend through 1986,\n\nmeasurements are expected to be\n\nmade\n\nstations\n\nbetween\n\nCanada,\n\nfixed and mobile\n\nMexico,\n\nSouth\n\nAmerica,\n\nin the United\n\nStates,\n\nthe Caribbean, Australia, New\n\nZealand and Europe.\nThe analysis and publication of the results of the investigations are generally planned\n\nfor a period of between two and\n\nfive years, depending on the nature of the investigation, and all\nare expected to be completed by the end of 1986.\nAll principal investigators will become part of the Crustal\nDynamics Working Group, which will meet twice a year during the\ncourse of the investigations to discuss progress and/or problem\nareas.\n\nThe initial meeting is scheduled for Sept. 1-3 at Goddard\n\nSpace Flight Center.\nThe selected crustal dynamics investigations and their principal\n\ninvestigators are as follows\n\n(those\n\ntentatively selected\n\nare indicated by a asterisk):\n\nRegional Deformation (23)\nSAFE II - The San Andreas Fault Experiment -- Christopher\nScholz, Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory, Palisades, N.Y.\nInterpretation of Crustal Deformation Data in Southern\nCalifornia -- John B.
