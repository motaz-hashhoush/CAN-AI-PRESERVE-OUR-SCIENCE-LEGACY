One astronaut was studied per flight, electroencephalographic, electro-oculographic, and headmotion signals acquired during sleep by use of an elastic recording cap containing sponge electrodes and an attached miniature preamplifier/accelerometer unit are shown. A control-panel assembly, mounted in the sleep compartment, tested electrodes, preserved analog signals, and automatically analyzed data in real time (providing a telemetered indication of sleep stage). Results indicate that men are able to obtain adequate sleep in regularly scheduled eight-hour rest periods during extended space missions.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19750019675, "id": "7777dee60fcd470f8f8cb8e31d4e870c", "publicationDate": "1975-01-31T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19750019675.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19750019675/downloads/19750019675.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19750019675/downloads/19750019675.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19750019675/downloads/19750019675.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
