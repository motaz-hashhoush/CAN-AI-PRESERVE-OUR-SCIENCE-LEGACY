This simulation tracks probabilistically the composite design evolution from constituent materials, fabrication process through composite mechanics, and structural component. Comparisons with experimental data are provided to illustrate selection of probabilistic design allowables, test methods/specimen guidelines, and identification of in situ versus pristine strength. For example, results show that: in situ fiber tensile strength is 90 percent of its pristine strength; flat-wise long-tapered specimens are most suitable for setting ply tensile strength allowables; a composite radome can be designed with a reliability of 0.999999; and laminate fatigue exhibits wide spread scatter at 90 percent cyclic-stress to static-strength ratios.", "title": "Probabilistic Approaches: Composite Design", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-17T15:39:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19970029336, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Chamis, Christos C."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Lewis Research Center", "location": "Cleveland, OH United States"}}, "id": "5c70ec0289f0423b879407eaeaec191b"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-10-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19970029336, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19970029336, "id": "bfa7f5df37aa4ead8ecb870514bde198", "publicationName": "Loads and Requirements for Military Aircraft", "publicationDate": "1997-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
