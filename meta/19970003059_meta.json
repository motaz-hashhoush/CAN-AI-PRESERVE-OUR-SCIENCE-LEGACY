Research was conducted in order to determine what makes an effective EOC. Specifically information concerning the various types of equipment and communication capability that an efficient EOC should contain (i.e., computers, software, telephone systems, radio systems, etc.) was documented. With this information a requirements document was written stating a brief description of the equipment and required quantity to be used in an EOC and then compared to current capabilities at the NASA Langley Research Center.", "title": "Emergency Operation Center", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-17T18:10:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19970003059, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Chinea, Anoushka Z."}, "organization": {"name": "Hampton Univ.", "location": "VA United States"}}, "id": "db9d982a3c2445198583c9010625aa83"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19970003059, "publications": [{"volume": "Part 1", "submissionId": 19970003059, "id": "a34405df2dd24610afb10e64e35441fb", "publicationName": "Technical Reports: Langley Aerospace Research Summer Scholars", "publicationDate": "1995-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19970003049, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Technical Reports: Langley Aerospace Research Summer Scholars", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19970003059.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19970003059/downloads/19970003059.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19970003059/downloads/19970003059.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19970003059/downloads/19970003059.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
