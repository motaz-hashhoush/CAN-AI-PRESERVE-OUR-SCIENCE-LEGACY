NPO47679\n\nStemless Ball Valve\nPotential applications include hazardous fluids and chemicals, and where fugitive emissions\nfrom valves are a concern.\nLyndon B. Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nThis invention utilizes a new method of\nopening and closing a ball valve. Instead\nof rotating the ball with a perpendicular\nstem (as is the case with standard ball\nvalves), the ball is rotated around a fixed\naxis by two guide pins. This innovation\neliminates the leak point that is present\nin all standard ball valves due to the penetration of an actuation stem through the\nvalve body.\nThe VOST (Venturi Off-Set-Technology) valve has been developed for\ncommercial applications. The standard\nversion of the valve consists of an off-set\nventuri flow path through the valve.\nThis path is split at the narrowest portion of the venturi, allowing the section\nupstream from the venturi to be rotated. As this rotation takes place, the\nventuri becomes restricted as one face\nrotates with respect to the other, eventually closing off the flow path. A springloaded seal made of resilient material is\n\n18\n\nembedded in the upstream face of the\nvalve, making a leak-proof seal between\nthe faces; thus a valve is formed. The\nspring-loaded lip seal is the only seal\nthat can provide a class six, or \xe2\x80\x9cbubbletight,\xe2\x80\x9d seal against the opposite face\nof the valve. Tearing action of the seal\nby high-velocity gas on this early design\nrequired relocation of the seal to the\ndownstream face of the valve.\nIn the \xe2\x80\x9cstemless\xe2\x80\x9d embodiment of this\nvalve, inner and outer magnetic cartridges are employed to transfer mechanical torque from the outside of the\nvalve to the inside without the use of a\nstem. This eliminates the leak path\ncaused by the valve stems in standard\nvalves because the stems penetrate\nthrough the bodies of these valves.\nThis design requires high precision\nduring assembly for proper performance of the face seal. Slight variations in\ntolerances result in unacceptable seal\n\nperformance. An effort was made to replace this design with a less demanding\narrangement of component parts. A rotating gate was proposed to be installed\nbetween the two faces of the valve. This\ngate would rotate in and out of the flow\npath of the venturi, opening and closing\nthe valve. Although this new gate design\nwould require a seal on both sides of the\ngate, it would eliminate the requirement\nof rotating the entire downstream side\nof the valve. This would simplify the\nvalve and allow for larger tolerances for\nproper performance. Magnetic cartridges would again be used to actuate\nthe valve in a stemless design.\nA MagBall concept replaces the rotating gate with a rotating ball. The ball\ndoes not rotate lock-step with the magnetic cartridge as the rotating gate did.\nInstead, the torque has a more complex\nrotation that allows the ball to go from\nfully open to fully closed.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, April 2012\n\nValves based on this concept are similar to standard ball valves, but they do\nnot require an actuation stem as do\nother standard ball valves. Instead, this\nvalve rotates the ball around a fixed axis\nby means of two guide pins. The two\npins are guided by concentric grooves\nthat interlock with the inner magnetic\ncartridge of the valve. This design is\nsuited for magnetic actuation, and provides a leak-proof valve that can be used\nfor hazardous gases and fluids.\nThe distinct advantages that this new\ndesign provides over previous VOST designs are the following:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The passageway through the valve no\nlonger has to be off-set as required by\nthe rotating gate design. Instead, it can\nbe machined through the center of the\nvalve, using conventional boring techniques, and avoiding costly wire EDM\n(electrical discharge machining).\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The cross-sectional area of the passage\nthrough the ball is nearly twice the area\nprovided by the hole in the rotating\ngate. Resistance to the fluid flow has\nbeen reduced by 40%. This is equivalent to gaining the advantage of the\nnext pipe size larger without increasing\nthe exterior size of the valve.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The off-set venturi is no longer required for the best performance of\nthe valve. This means that the previous minimum length requirements\nof the venturi are no longer neces-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, April 2012\n\nThe rotating venturi ramp of the original VOST design is replaced in the Stemless Ball Valve by a rotating, non-venturi gate.\n\nsary. The valve can be shortened to\nmeet ASME flange-to-flange dimensions in the 4-in. (\xe2\x89\x8810-cm) and larger\nsizes without increasing the resistance to flow.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Rotational requirements have been reduced from 180\xc2\xb0 to 90\xc2\xb0. The valve can\nbe actuated by standard quarter-turn actuators (without step-up gearing). This\nis the same type of actuation used with\nall ball, plug, and butterfly valves.\nThis work was done by Robert K.
