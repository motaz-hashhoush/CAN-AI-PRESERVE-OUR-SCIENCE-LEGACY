Consolidation\nof some of SMC/TE's\nelements is continuing at Kirtland AFB as of this\nwriting. The Space Test Program Office (SMC/TEL) is managed by Col Peter Young, who oversees the efforts of\nthe following divisions:\nMission Design and Management\n(TELO), Shuttle Payloads (TELH, co-located with\nNASA at the Johnson Space Center, Houston), the Tri-Service\nSpacecraft Division (TELS), and the Spacecraft\nDevelopment\nDivision (TELM, the remainder of the former SMC/CU contingent in Los Angeles).\nServices, Program Control and Contracting activities are provided through matrixed support.\nSpace Experiments\n\nReview\n\nBoard (SERB)\n\nLaunch\n\nProcess\n\nEach year, the experiment\nsubmission process begins with individual research agencies (typically service\nlaboratories\nor research institutions) ranking their space experiments\nfor submission to the respective services.\nThe\nservices then submit their rankings to the DoD SERB for consolidation,\nwhich usually occurs in May of each year.\nThe DoD SERB ranks the experiments based on the their assessment of the experiments'\nmilitary relevance, along\nwith other factors, such as experiment\nquality, maturity, and internal service priority.\nSTP is then tasked to fly the\noptimum number of highly ranked experiments the budget will allow.\nSpaceflight\n\nOpportunities\n\nOnce an experiment\n\nmakes the priority\n\nlist there are three general\n\nways which it can gain spaceflight.\n\nMission\n\ndesign and planning effort is initiated to study the most cost effective means for spaceflight, attempting to match up\nflight opportunities\nwith specific experiments.\nFor experiments\nwith unique orbital requirements\nthat can best be\nmet by free-flying spacecraft, STP contracts for spacecraft development,\nexperiment\nintegration, and launch service.\nSTP also flies experiments as secondary payloads (,piggybacks) on spacecraft of various agencies, including NASA\nand DoD, and various countries, including Russian and French. The third way in which STP gains spaceflight for\nSERB ranked experiments\nis through a collaboration\nwith NASA to fly experiments on the Space Shuttle. Some\nexperiments can be located in the payload bay and either retained within the bay or ejected for orbital flight. Other\nexperiments are flown in the mid-deck area of the Space Shuttle crew cabin.\nSince the beginning of the program in 1965, 30 piggyback missions have been flown, 27 free-flyer satellites\nhave been launched, and 53 Shuttle flights have carried STP experiments.\nThe total number of individual\nexperiments\nflown to date is 373. Launch vehicles used so far have included the Space Shuttle, Scout, Ariane,\n\nDelta, egasus, and\nP\nProton, Taurus. vehicles\nHost\ncarrying\nseries, and RESURS.\n\nEleven missions\n\nhave suffered\n\nSome examples\nsystems are:\n\nof how STP spacecraft\n\nSTP experiments\nlaunch failures.\n\nhave played\n\na significant\n\nhave included\n\nDSCS, SPOT, the STEP\n\nrole in the development\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSpacecraft Charging at High Altitudes (SCATHA)\n- Measured\nthe conditions of the plasma surrounding\nthe spacecraft.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nOften, tectmology\n\nproven through\n\nSTP experiments\n\nevolves\n\nsurfaces\n\nspace\n\nCombined\nRelease and Radiation Effects Satellite (CRRES) - Collected data on charged particles,\nelectric and magnetic fields, and waves in the near-earth environment.\nSTACKSAT - Collected data on communications\ntransceiver and solid-state recorder devices.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nthe charge on spacecraft\n\nof military\n\ninto a new realm of capabilities.\n\nand\n\nThe knowledge\n\ngained from STP experiments on radiation belts, satellite charging, and rubidium atomic clocks contributed to the\ncreation of the Global Positioning System (GPS), which provides precise navigation information to a variety of\nmilitary and civilian users.\nOperational\n\nMissions\nOperating\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n*\n*\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nOperating Piggybacks\nPOAM II - The Polar Ozone and Aerosol Monitor is returning\nunprecedented\ndetail.\nMAHRSI\nMiddle\nAtmosphere\nHigh\nResolution\nSpectrograph\nconcentration\nthermosphere.\n\nof the hydroxyl\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSWIM - Solar Wind\nweather conditions.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCCGEO - Satellite\ndetect the build-up\n\nRecent\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFreeflyers\n\nAPEX\n- Provides\nspaceflight\nfor three experiments:\nPhotovoltaic\nArray Space Power Plus\nDiagnostics\n(PASP-Plus);\nCosmic\nRay Upset\nExperiment\n(CRUX);\nThin Film Ferroelectric\nExperiment (FERRO).\nRADCAL - Provides a radar calibration target for approximately\n70 C-band sites around the world\nSTEP\nMission\n0\nProvides\nspaceflight\nfor the Technology\nfor Autonomous\nOperational\nSurvivability\n(TAOS) experiment.\nSTEP Mission 2 - Provides spaceflight\nfor the Signal Identification\nExperiment\n(SIDEX) which\nevaluates multi-integrated\nsmall signal detection methods.\n\nShuttle\n\nradical\n\nInterplanetary\n\nand the nitric\n\nMeasurements\n\noxide\n\ndata\n\non the\n\nInvestigation\n\nin the middle\n\nwill be used to develop\n\nozone\n\nhole\n\nmeasures\n\natmosphere\n\nin\nthe\n\nand\n\nlower\n\nways to predict\n\nspace\n\nCharge Control Experiment\nat Geosynchronous\nOrbit demonstrates\nof charges on spacecraft and then discharge the satellite.\n\nthe ability to\n\nExperiments\n\nRME-III - Radiation Monitoring\nEquipment III gathered data on the ionizing radiation environment\nin the Space Shuttle as a function of geographic location, altitude, spacecraft shielding, and spacecraft\norientation.\nWill result in improved\nrisk assessment\nmodels for crew and equipment\nradiation\nexposures in low earth orbit.\nCREAM - Cosmic Radiation Effects and Activation\nMonitor measured radiation effects in the crew\ncompartment\nas a function\nof time, orbital location\nand shielding.\nData will improve\nspace\nenvironment\nand radiation shielding models used to predict single event upset rates in electronics\nand\nbackground\nrates in sensors.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nHERCULES/MSI\n- Provided test and evaluation of a muitispectral\nimager/geolocator\nsystem.\nThe\ngeolocator will determine surface location of each image taken by the multispectral\nimager within 2.5\nnautical miles.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPlanned\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSTL - Space Tissue Loss experiment studied the micro-gravity\ninduced tissue loss phenomena\nof\nexposed tissue cultures.
