b'Staging Airliner Service\nAndrew S. Hahn *\nNASA Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA, 23681\n\nThere is a general consensus building that historically high fuel prices and greater public\nawareness of the emissions that result from burning fuel are going to be long-term concerns\nfor those who design, build, and operate airliners. The possibility of saving both fuel and\nreducing emissions has rekindled interest in breaking very long-range airline flights into\nmultiple stages or even adopting in-flight refueling. It is likely that staging will result in\nlower fuel burn, and recent published reports have suggested that the savings are\nsubstantial, particularly if the airliner is designed from the outset for this kind of operation.\nGiven that staging runs against the design and operation historical trend, this result begs for\nfurther attention. This paper will examine the staging question, examining both analytic and\nnumeric performance estimation methodologies to quantify the likely amount of fuel savings\nthat can be expected and the resulting design impacts on the airliner.\n\nNomenclature\nD\nL\nMTOW\nMZFW\nOEW\nPRE\nR\nSFC\nT\ntB\nTOW\nV\nVEMPX\nVEOPX\nWFB\nWFR\nWFTOT\nWP\nX\nZFW\n\nA\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\nDrag\nLift\nMaximum Takeoff Weight\nMaximum Zero Fuel Weight\nOperating Empty Weight\nPayload Range Efficiency, R*WP/WFB\nRange\nSpecific Fuel Consumption, WFB/(T*tB)\nThrust\ntime, Block\nTakeOff Weight\nAircraft Velocity\nNangia Emissions Efficiency parameter\nNangia Value Efficiency parameter\nWeight of Fuel, Block, the fuel consumed over a flight\nWeight of Fuel, Reserve\nWeight of Fuel, Total, the fuel loaded onto the aircraft\nWeight of Payload\nLinear coefficient of the Breguet Range Equation, V*L/(SFC/D)\nZero Fuel Weight\n\nI. Introduction\n\nCONSENSUS is building that both aircraft manufacturers and airlines are facing an ever more difficult future.\nDramatically rising fuel prices and the possibility of new regulations to limit Global Climate Change are\naltering the balance of priorities that have shaped the airliner\xe2\x80\x99s design and operation until now. These changes are\ndriving a fresh reassessment of the characteristics desired when providing long-range air transportation. Recently,\nthe possibility of altering both the design and operation of large airliners away from the historical trend of ever\nincreasing stage lengths to that of a series of short stages has been proposed.\nIn his paper titled \xe2\x80\x9cEfficiency Parameters for Modern Commercial Aircraft,\xe2\x80\x9d1 R.K. Nangia builds upon the work\nof J.E. Green2-3 and proposes two main hypotheses. The first is that approximately half of the fuel used when flying\nlong ranges in one stage can be saved if the trip is broken into three stages and the aircraft is redesigned for this\n*\n\nAerospace Engineer, Aeronautical Systems Analysis Branch, Mail Stop 442, AIAA Associate Member.\n1\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\noperation. The second is that a new metric, or figure of merit, should be used to ensure that aircraft designs reflect\nthe coming reprioritization of desired characteristics.\nThis paper will examine both hypotheses using significantly different methodologies and data sources and will\npresent all of the results in context.\n\nII. Staging Long-range Airline Service\nThere has always been a demand for very long-distance travel. For most people throughout history, the cost and\ninconvenience of the travel modes available at the time has meant that this demand has gone mostly unfulfilled.\nHowever, as the relative cost and average speed of the available travel modes have improved, more people have\nchosen to take these long trips. When the aircraft was first introduced, the technology was too immature to meet any\nsignificant demand. The aircraft were not capable of carrying passengers far enough, fast enough, or economically\nenough to entice many people to choose them over other available modes or even to make the trip at all. Aircraft\ntechnology improved rapidly, but still, there were short periods of time when the technology didn\xe2\x80\x99t allow for single\nstage service and airlines were willing to make significant operational concessions to enable very long-range travel.\nWhile there are many historical examples of multiple stage service up and down the American continents, one\ncould argue that each stop along the way was a destination in and of itself, and so doesn\xe2\x80\x99t technically count as\nstaging.\nHowever, a clear example case of staging, where a minority of stages could be justified as demanded travel, has\noccurred. In 1935, Pan American Airlines instituted their \xe2\x80\x9cChina Clipper\xe2\x80\x9d passenger and airmail service from San\nFrancisco, CA, to Hong Kong, China.4 The Martin M-130 flying boat was nowhere near capable of making the trip\nin one stage, and the obvious option of following the continental coastline added so much distance that both time\nand cost were unappealing. Fortunately, the Pacific Ocean does have a few small islands at regular intervals, more or\nless along a line from San Francisco to Hong Kong. Pan American absorbed the cost of building and operating\nservice bases at these remote islands in order to capture the available demand until the start of WWII forced the\ncessation of operations. The route had six stages, namely San Francisco to Honolulu, to Midway, to Wake, to Guam,\nto Manila, and finally to Hong Kong. This operation shows that an airline is willing to adopt even extreme forms of\nstaging if it makes economic sense. During the intervening war years, aircraft technology improved dramatically,\nmaking this kind of operation unnecessary to service the demand.\nAnother example of the extremes that airlines are willing to consider is the British Shorts company\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to\nbuild a staged airliner for Imperial Airways.4 The Atlantic Ocean does not have the evenly spaced islands that the\nPacific Ocean does, making the option of landing to refuel much less attractive. Instead, Shorts designed and tested\nthe Mercury-Maia composite aircraft, which was literally a small seaplane attached to the top of a much larger flying\nboat. The Maia would takeoff with the Mercury attached above and give the Mercury a good flying start so that it\nwould be able to begin the trip with a useful load with which it was physically incapable of taking off.\nUnfortunately, the Mercury-Maia operation proved uneconomical and was abandoned. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t until the Boeing\n314 Clipper came into service that there was an aircraft capable of crossing the Atlantic Ocean with the right\ncombination of speed, range, and economy, but it did so in a single stage.\nClearly, airlines are willing to consider unusual operations, including staging, if it captures travel demand at a\nprofit. Currently, there are few staged airline operations, and these are relegated to only the longest of routes, such as\nLondon, UK to major cities in Australasia or New York, USA to cities in India.\nNangia correctly observed that the historical trend has been towards ever greater stage lengths. Jenkinson reports\nthat the average international stage length had increased steadily by a total of 84% between 1960 and 1990.5 This\ntrend appears to be driven by fundamental market forces, and so will probably continue until the ultimate goal of\nsingle stage to any city pair in the world is a reality.\nBoth Green and Nangia have suggested that the new realities of high fuel prices and Global Climate Change are\nmaking this kind of operation unsustainable and that the strategy of staging long-range service can save a great deal\nof fuel as well as the emissions that come from burning it.\nA. Analytic Analysis and Results\nBoth Green and Nangia have developed analysis methods that are based on the Breguet Range Equation. I won\xe2\x80\x99t\ngo into detail about the analysis here, as the original papers do a much better job of outlining it than I would.1-3 What\nis important to understand about their methods is that they rely heavily on very coarsely correlated historical data,\nnon-dimensionalization to reduce variation due to scale, and averaged values to reduce variation due to state changes\nover time. This is a classic analytic approach that seeks to make an analysis tractable by reducing the data and\ncomputational resources required.\n2\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nBoth applied their analytic methods to the question of fuel efficiency as a function of range, on a hypothetical\n479 passenger aircraft required to complete a total trip distance of 15,000 km. The analysis was done for aircraft\ndesigns that performed both one stage and three stage operations. Each aircraft was specifically designed for the\nstage lengths required, specifically 15,000 and 5,000 km respectively.\nGreen\xe2\x80\x99s analytic method indicated that making the trip in one stage, instead of three, required Operating Empty\nWeight (OEW) to increase by 41%, TakeOff Weight (TOW) to increase by 76%, and Weight of Fuel, Block (WFB)\nto increase by 40%. These are relative measures, which illustrate important relationships, but it is also illustrative to\nhave some absolute measures for further comparison as well. The metric used by Green and Nangia, Payload Range\nEfficiency (PRE), is a good measure of fuel efficiency and, with a few unit conversion factors applied, is equivalent\nto the commonly used Seat-Nautical Miles per Gallon metric. It is important to realize that the PRE is an average\nvalue over the stage length, and so is only accurate for the stage length in which it was calculated. Green\xe2\x80\x99s results\nfor PRE are that the single stage aircraft attained 5,581 km, while the three stage aircraft attained 7,832 km.\nNangia reported that he found a few errors in Green\xe2\x80\x99s analysis and corrected them in his own analysis. Nangia\xe2\x80\x99s\nanalytic method indicated that making the trip in one stage, instead of three, required OEW to increase by 126%,\nTOW to increase by 125%, and WFB to increase by 103%. Nangia\xe2\x80\x99s results for PRE are that the single stage aircraft\nattained 3,944 km, while the three stage aircraft attained 8,000 km. Figure 1 shows both Nangia\xe2\x80\x99s and Green\xe2\x80\x99s\nresults for PRE as a function of aircraft design range.\n\nFigure 1. Payload Range Efficiency as a function of Design Range from Green and Nangia.\nDespite some disagreement about the actual values of the single stage penalty, both analyses indicate that the\npenalty is substantial. If correct, these results indicate that changing the design and operations of large, long-range\nairliners to multiple stages would have a large positive impact on fuel consumption, operational cost, and emissions.\nThe larger this impact is, the more likely that any negative aspects of staging would be more than outweighed; so\naccurate quantification is crucial.\nB. Numeric Analysis and Results\nI applied the standard conceptual design approach used at NASA Langley for the evaluation of new\ntechnologies, configurations, and operations of aircraft. This involved collecting publicly available reports and data,\nformulating the analysis plan, choosing a validation aircraft for tuning the analysis to an accepted standard,\nredesigning to a baseline aircraft from which to base relative comparisons, performing many redesigns to populate a\n3\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\ndatabase, understanding the results in the database, redesigning to correct mistakes, and finally reporting out the\nresults with interpretations that are relevant for the intended audience.\nThe method used for redesign is a computer program named FLOPS (Flight Optimization System).6-8 It is an\naircraft design synthesis code that breaks historical data and engineering methods down to fine detail and captures\nthe multi-disciplinary interactions of these analyses through a time step integration over a mission. FLOPS has the\nability to optimize an Objective function subject to equality and inequality constraints through a list of design\nvariables under the designer\xe2\x80\x99s control. This is a capability far beyond simple resizing. Resizing is the act of\nconverging to a new, self-consistent design. For any given set of requirements, there may be many such designs\npossible. Constrained optimization is a process by which the design space is explored and the best design, as defined\nby the Objective function, is reported out as the solution, while ensuring validity through the specified constraint set.\nThis numeric analysis approach has several advantages over the analytic approach besides the ability to\noptimize. The single biggest advantage is that the simplification through non-dimensionalization and averaging\ntakes place at the lowest levels in the analysis, which allows a much more complex recombination of characteristics\nto be analyzed. With the analytic approach, the method tends towards overgeneralization because the details that\ndetermine the values are obscured. The values are only valid over the range of variation of the vehicles that were\nused to determine them and frequently the designer is unaware of the ranges of validity. In cases where new vehicles\nare being evaluated, if the characteristics, or any combination of characteristics, fall outside of the validity range of\nthe database, then there is a real possibility that the analysis will yield incorrect results. The numeric approach, on\nthe other hand, still suffers from some of the same database dependencies as the analytic methods, but by breaking\nthe analysis down into much smaller and more detailed pieces, the numeric approach is able to assemble the results\nto cover combinations of parameters that do not exist in the original databases. Another advantage is that the detail\navailable makes the result more transparent. Knowing why an answer is coming out the way that it is can be as\nimportant as knowing what the answer is. Having the finer detail available aids both in assessing the validity of the\nanswer as well as understanding what may be driving the answer.\nWhile the type of approach used will not guarantee that any given answer will be accurate, I believe that the\nnumeric approach provides the best chance at correctly answering questions such as what are the potential benefits\nof staging airliner service?\n1. Research and Planning\nThe hypothesis that there are large benefits from the staging of long-range airliner service has been most\nprominently espoused by Green and Nangia. Since all analysis methods and models are simplified representations of\nreality, they inevitably contain errors and comparing results from different analyses can be inconclusive. I did not\nwant the veracity of this study to hinge on the reputations of the individuals or the heritage of the methods. Instead, I\nfelt that the core of their hypothesis could be best approached by determining a minimum benefit using methods\nwith no modeling error, then tuning an existing conceptual model to minimize modeling error, accepting the\nvalidation vehicle as the baseline vehicle, and finally performing a series of redesigns for populating the database.\nIn this case, using published data for existing aircraft required no modeling, and so was free from modeling error.\nThe computer model that I used for the redesign cases did have error, which I then minimized through calibration.\n2. Validation Vehicle\nAfter identifying that the characteristics desired for the study were the capability of very long-range operations\nand carrying a large payload; and deciding that a modern twin-engine configuration would be most relevant, I chose\nthe Boeing 777-200 with the High Gross Weight Option model of airliner for validation. While smaller than the 470\npassenger vehicles chosen by Green and Nangia, the B777-200HG is capable of carrying 305 passengers in a 3-class\nconfiguration the full 15,000km. Since it is at Maximum Takeoff Weight (MTOW) at this condition, the B777200HG can be considered a near-optimal, modern, twin-engined validation aircraft for the analysis at this stage\nlength. Unfortunately, the B777-200HG is substantially over designed for the 5,000 km range, making it a poor\nchoice for validation at that stage length. There weren\xe2\x80\x99t any aircraft available at this short range that met all of the\ntraits necessary for a validation aircraft. The closest was the Boeing 737-900. The B737-900 is a significantly\ndifferent aircraft, being more cramped (2 class seating), smaller, slower, and having a much less advanced engine.\nStill, it is almost capable of making the 5,000 km range with 177 people on board and represents a real data point for\nan airliner designed to this short range. While it can\xe2\x80\x99t be considered a validation aircraft, it can be used as a less\nconclusive, but significant reference aircraft. Figure 2 shows the PRE for of these existing aircraft over the ranges of\ninterest. It is important to note that there is no possibility of modeling error in these values. It is also important to\nnote that these results are conservative as there is no redesign from one range to the next.\nFigure 3 shows the payload/range diagram of the B777-200HG, along with the combinations of payload and\nrange used.9 Similar diagrams were used for all of the Boeing vehicles in the study.10,11\n\n4\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nFigure 2. Payload Range Efficiency as a function of Design Range for Existing Boeing Aircraft.\n\nFigure 3. Payload as a function of Stage Length for the Boeing 777-200HG.\nI utilized a FLOPS B777-200 conceptual design model that was created for a previous study. The model will\nexecute an optimization where the Objective is to minimize TOW by modifying the design variables of wing area\nand engine thrust, while maintaining validity with many constraints. Examples of active equality constraints are\nconstant payload weight and makeup, passenger comfort, stability and control, and technology level. There are many\ninactive inequality constraints, any of which may become active as the design space is explored, but the most\nimportant inequality constraint is the active second segment climb gradient that is required by Federal Air\nRegulations and is sizing the wing area and engine thrust. The model required minor tuning in order to accurately\n5\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nreflect the published Boeing values for TOW, OEW, and Weight of Fuel, TOTal (WFTOT). Given the lack of\ndetailed weight, aerodynamic, and propulsion calibration data, it is not possible to accurately assign calibration\nfactors to individual sources of error. This means that judgment needs to be applied to make the adjustments without\nsignificantly impacting the underlying trends during redesign. Two errors needed to be reduced during calibration.\nThe first error was that the model\xe2\x80\x99s OEW was approximately 1% light, so I decided that distributing a 3%\nincrease across the wing, fuselage, tails, and landing gear weights, would be a neutral way of accounting for this\nerror. This strategy was used because experience has shown that these items are more likely to be in error to this\ndegree than the other items that make up the OEW and that distributing the error evenly would not unduly change\nthe underlying weight trends.\nThe second error was that the model was consuming too much fuel. It is difficult to determine the source of the\ndiscrepancy, because there are several factors that can affect fuel consumption, and the lack of reliable detail data\nmeant that the cause could not be accurately isolated. Rather than leaving the error in, I decided that reducing the\noverall fuel consumption estimate by 7.7% was the best strategy available. Since this correction represents a slope\nchange, it does alter the underlying trend somewhat, but experience has shown that this is the best way to calibrate\nregression models.\nWith these two changes, the FLOPS model matched the validation vehicle very well.\n3. Baseline Vehicle\nIn most studies, the validation vehicle can\xe2\x80\x99t be used as the baseline for comparison because it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t meet\nmission requirements and/or doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the right level of technology. This usually means that the validation\naircraft is redesigned in a series of steps to become an optimal and valid design for the mission requirements and\ntechnology timeframe specified. In this study, the validation vehicle is perfectly adequate to answer the question at\nhand and fits the range and technology level that both Green and Nangia used. There is a small issue in that my\nmodel only carries 65% of the passengers, which does introduce inconsistency due to scale effects.\n\nFigure 4. Payload Range Efficiency as a function of Design Range for Hahn Optimistic Redesigned aircraft.\n4. Populating the Database\nThe first task was to evaluate the Boeing 777-200HG over the ranges desired to establish the minimal benefit\navailable from staged operations using existing aircraft. Using the published OEW and calculating the Weight of\nPayload (WP) based on the number of passengers and 95.3 kg (210 lb) for each passenger with baggage, the Zero\nFuel Weight (ZFW) can be calculated. Where the ZFW line crosses each range line, a TOW can be found from the\npayload-range diagram (Fig. 3). The difference between ZFW and TOW is the Weight of Fuel, Total (WFTOT),\n6\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nwhich includes the Weight of Fuel, Reserve (WFR). Since PRE is calculated using the WFB, the WFR must be\nsubtracted from WFTOT. The payload-range diagram does include reserve fuel in the TOW, but doesn\xe2\x80\x99t state what\nthe WFR is. I chose to use the WFR/MTOW regression from Nangia, which appears to be approximately constant at\n4.4%, to estimate WFR for each stage length. The PRE was then calculated at each stage length. (Fig. 2)\nThe second task was to establish any additional benefit available from a redesign from the high-confidence\nbaseline. I performed an optimal sensitivity using FLOPS at design ranges of 5,000 and 15,000 km. An optimal\nsensitivity is when an individual constraint is changed and the vehicle is re-optimized. This analysis yields better\nresults than the common sensitivity practice, because a new best design is found while maintaining validity through\nmaintaining all constraints. The common sensitivity practice is merely a resizing of the design, which does not\nguarantee validity or optimality. Figure 4 shows that after calibration, the Hahn Optimistic Redesign 15,000 km\naircraft has the same PRE as the validation aircraft, as intended.\nFigure 4 also shows that the redesigned 5,000 km aircraft is an improvement over the clearly non-optimal\nBoeing 777-200HG, which is as expected. It is also somewhat of an improvement over the reference Boeing 737900. While a welcome outcome, there is no obvious relationship that should exist, so no definite conclusion can be\nmade from this observation other than to say that it is in the reference\xe2\x80\x99s neighborhood.\n\nFigure 5. Four View Geometry Comparison between Boeing 777-200HG and Hahn Optimistic Redesign\naircraft.\n5. Understanding Results\nAfter examination, I noticed that there was a problem with the model that became obvious only at the short stage\nlength. The model uses a fixed set of Tail Volume Coefficients to size the vertical and horizontal tails. These\ncoefficients are much more sensitive to changes in wing geometry than fuselage geometry, and since the fuselage\ngeometry was fixed, the tails were tracking the wings as they shrank. Even a cursory examination reveals that this is\nan unrealistic behavior and that the optimization was being more strongly driven to small wings and tails than it\n7\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nshould have been. (Fig. 5) This meant that the potential benefits through redesign were being significantly\noverstated. This design was overly optimistic, and so will be referred to from now on as the Hahn Optimistic\nredesign.\n\nFigure 6a,b. Morris and Ashford Tail Volume Coefficient Correlation with Geometry Parameter.\n\n8\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n6. Correcting Errors\nThis unrealistic tail sizing is a common problem that can be addressed through a better method of conceptual tail\nsizing devised by Morris and Ashford of Douglas Aircraft.12 Figures 6a and 6b show the Douglas method, which\namounts to a correlation between Tail Volume Coefficient and a non-dimensional geometric parameter. As one can\nsee, the validation aircraft, the B777-200HG, falls in line with the correlation, whereas the Hahn Optimistic redesign\nis far from acceptable. Through iterative manual sizing of the tails, I was able to bring the Tail Volume Coefficients\ninto similar positions to the trend lines as the validation aircraft.\nFigure 7 shows a top view of the Hahn Optimistic redesign on\nthe left and the Hahn Realistic redesign on the right. The first item\nof note is that the tails on the Hahn Realistic redesign are indeed\nsmaller than those on the validation aircraft, but not nearly as small\nas those on the Hahn Optimistic redesign. This is because, while the\nwing is substantially smaller, the fuselage has not changed at all and\nso it has the same polar moment of inertia and destabilizing\ninfluence that it had on the calibration aircraft, whose tails were\nsized by far more sophisticated methods and had passed\ncertification trials. Tail Volume Coefficient is insensitive to these\nissues and so tends to undersize the tails. The second item of note is\nthat the wing of the Hahn Realistic redesign is much smaller than\nthat of the validation aircraft, but slightly larger than that on the\nHahn Optimistic redesign. This is because the optimizer was able to\nreduce the Objective on the Hahn Optimistic redesign more by\nreducing the wing-tail combination, even if the wing was\nindividually less efficient. Since this effect is greatly reduced on the\nHahn Realistic redesign, the wing needed to be more efficient and\nFigure 7. Top\nView\nGeometry\nso was made larger.\nComparison between Boeing 777The scale of the impact on PRE from proper tail sizing was\n200HG, Hahn Optimistic Redesign,\nsurprising. Using the B777-200HG at 5,000 km as the basis for PRE\nand Hahn Realistic Redesign\nwithout redesign, then the Hahn Optimistic redesign indicated that\naircraft.\nthere was as much as a 26% improvement available for exploitation.\nThe Hahn Realistic redesign indicates that only 16% is actually\navailable, which is a drop in potential of 38%. (Fig. 8)\nThis example illustrates some of the advantages of the Numeric Analysis approach. The transparency promoted\nby the detailed buildup allowed a significant error to be caught, and the understanding provided gives confidence\nthat the model is performing well. Also, the method is able to balance different characteristics that may not have\nexisted in the original regression data in this proportion.\nC. Comparison Of Outputs, And Interpretation\nUsing PRE as a metric for comparison across all three studies, it can be seen in Fig. 9 that there is a great deal of\ndifference in opinion between Green, Nangia, and Hahn as to what the potential benefits are from staging.\nThe Boeing aircraft are the only aircraft considered in this paper whose predicted performance is free from\nmodeling error. Since the B777-200HG can just meet the 15,000 km stage length at its MTOW, it can be considered\nto be nearly optimally designed for this combination of range and payload. At the 5,000 km range with the same\npayload, the aircraft is operating considerably below its MTOW and so pays an OEW and WF penalty for having\nexcess capacity that is not used. Even so, the benefit from staging is a significant 17% increase in PRE, due solely to\nthe change in operation.\n\n9\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nFigure 8. Payload Range Efficiency as a function of Design Range for Hahn Redesigned aircraft.\n\nFigure 9. Payload Range Efficiency as a function of Design Range for All Three Studies.\n10\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nThe Boeing 737-900 is included as another point of reference that represents a vehicle with no modeling error. It\nnearly meets the 5,000 km stage length at MTOW and so can be considered to be nearly optimal for this stage length.\nThere are several problems with making direct comparisons though. The Boeing 737-900 is a very different aircraft\nthan the Boeing 777-200HG. It is much smaller and slower, has a less efficient engine, and is more cramped with 2\nclass accommodations. Still, one might assume that a Boeing 777-200HG class aircraft could do as well when\nredesigned optimally for the 5,000 km stage length.\nThe Hahn Realistic aircraft family uses a baseline that was tuned and optimally designed to be the same as the\nBoeing 777-200HG. By tuning the model, modeling error at this point is eliminated. While this tuning is no\nguarantee that there will not be significant modeling error introduced when redesigning to the shorter stage lengths,\nit does provide a solid anchor from which to proceed. Indeed, a significant modeling error was found in the Hahn\nOptimistic redesign and corrected on the Hahn Realistic redesign aircraft. While there is no conclusive proof that\nthis design is accurate, it does have a PRE similar to the B737-900, which was as expected.\nNangia\xe2\x80\x99s 15,000 km stage length aircraft has a PRE that is quite similar to that of the Boeing 777-200HG\nvalidation aircraft, which is encouraging. However, Nangia\xe2\x80\x99s 5,000 km stage length aircraft has nearly double the\nPRE of the Boeing 737-900 reference aircraft.\nGreen and Nangia both agree on the maximum PRE attainable at 5,000 km, but disagree strongly at 15,000 km.\nGiven that Nangia has used a similar analysis to Green and has both identified and corrected errors in Green\xe2\x80\x99s\nanalysis, I can only assume that these errors make Green\xe2\x80\x99s results unreliable.\nThis still leaves the large difference between Nangia\xe2\x80\x99s 5,000 km aircraft and the Hahn Realistic redesign\nunexplained. One potential source of error that may be inadvertently skewing the results may be an artifact of\nNangia\xe2\x80\x99s historical regressions of weight fractions and technology constants. Given the extremely sparse data\navailable for regressions, the tendency is to use it all even if it may constitute a wide range of technology levels or\nharbor hidden assumptions. As an example, short-range aircraft tend to be more densely loaded than long-range\naircraft. This is because passengers are willing to endure lower comfort levels for short periods of time to get a\nlower ticket price, and the aircraft tend to carry cargo whenever conditions permit to maximize revenue. Figure 10\nshows additional Boeing aircraft as well as loadings for the same aircraft to illustrate this point.\n\nFigure 10.\n\nPayload Range Efficiency as a function of Design Range for Boeing Aircraft.\n11\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nThe extreme example of varying loading to raise PRE is the domestic variant of the Boeing 747-400, which can\nhold up to 628 passengers in 1-class accommodation. This strategy limits the maximum stage length to just 1,575\nkm, but yields a good PRE of 5,052 km. The Boeing 747-400LR, on the other hand, holds just 400 passengers at a\nstage length of 13,334 km, yielding a rather poor PRE of 3,211 km. It appears that the B747-400 has been pushed to\nthe limits of its technology, which has exaggerated the PRE penalty to an exceptional 57% increase for single stage\noperation. (Fig. 10) Of course, the B747-400 was not chosen for the validation aircraft precisely because of these\nand other issues. For example, one wonders how the passengers would feel about being loaded onto that cramped\naircraft for the ninth time to finish their 15,000 km trip.\nThe Boeing 777-200HG 2-class aircraft also illustrates that higher PRE is possible if the passengers are willing\nto sacrifice some comfort. While nowhere near as cramped as the B747-400 Domestic, this aircraft also shows a\ngreater PRE than the Hahn Realistic optimally redesigned aircraft, which maintains the baseline\xe2\x80\x99s 3-class\naccommodation. This is an expected result. It can be shown that the denser an aircraft is, the more efficient it is.\nPassengers constitute a very low-density load, so any improvements here are likely to have a greater impact on PRE\nthan anything else. Simply put, a kg of passenger has very different multi-disciplinary impacts on the aircraft than a\nkg of cargo or fuel. Since drag is proportional to wetted area, the denser cargo and fuel loads constitute less of a\npenalty to carry. Indeed, the wing usually has excess fuel volume available for all but the longest stage lengths, so\nparasite drag remains unchanged as fuel is added. Also, fuel is a particularly efficient mass to carry. Higher\npassenger and cargo weight is concentrated on the centerline, which raises wing bending moments. Fuel can be\ncontained entirely in the wing, which reduces wing bending moments. While there is a tendency to trade these\nmasses off one for one, this can add a high degree of error into the analysis that can lead to erroneous conclusions.\nExtending the trend to the 1-class loading, we see that the PRE is improved still more, although significantly lower\nthan Nangia\xe2\x80\x99s estimate. Taking this train of thought to its logical conclusion, I loaded the Boeing 777-200HG for a\ntakeoff at a payload that yielded Maximum Zero Fuel Weight (MZFW). This loading is equivalent to that of 598\npassengers and their baggage being somehow accommodated in the current fuselage. This unrealistic loading\nyielded a PRE very similar to Nangia\xe2\x80\x99s estimate, which indicates that either his payload makeup (denser cargo being\nadded) or his accommodation (passenger density) is changing as stage length changes. Because of the course nature\nof the high level regressions used, it is difficult to say what is driving the result.\nWhile it is clear that this level of PRE is attainable for short stage lengths, is this a valid result for this study?\nThe only way to achieve the PRE predicted by Nangia at a fixed payload weight is to substitute denser cargo for\npassengers and/or reduce passenger comfort. It is undesirable for the airline to substitute low value cargo for high\nvalue passengers, as this would reduce revenue. It is undesirable for the passenger to endure more cramped\naccommodation because the total time spent on the aircraft is actually higher when staging than not. While the first\nstage may be bearable, each successive stage will become less so, unless the passengers are allowed to disembark at\nthe end of each stage for a reasonable time period. Even so, the cumulative effect of spending more time on the trip\nand more time in the more cramped aircraft will probably more than offset any efficiency increase. Also, the greatest\nbenefit only occurs at passenger densities that are illegal because egress requirements in the Federal Air Regulations\ncould not be met.\nSince this level of PRE is only possible if some of the original equality constraints of the study are violated, I\nfeel that the results from the Hahn Realistic redesign are the most valid. The final results are: making the trip in one\nstage instead of three required OEW to increase by 41%, TOW to increase by 82%, and WFB to increase by 29%.\nThe PRE results are that the single stage aircraft attained 3,773 km, while the three stage aircraft attained 4,883 km.\nIt is interesting to compare these results of redesign to those available through operation only. The Boeing 777200HG 3-class aircraft results are: making the trip in one stage instead of three required OEW to increase by 0%,\nTOW to increase by 42%, and WFB to increase by 17%. The PRE results are that the single stage attained 3,715 km,\nwhile the three stage aircraft attained 4,340 km.\nTherefore, approximately half of the total improvement to PRE from operating with three stages is due to the\noperational improvement and half is due to redesigning the aircraft to take advantage of this new operation.\nIt is also important to realize that this is an optimistic, academic study that assumes that usable airports are\nplaced at even intervals along the flight path in still air. As any of these conditions varies from the ideal, the\npotential benefits from staging will erode.\nD. Negative Aspects of Staging\nThese studies have focused on the benefits of staging airliner service with a very simple metric, PRE. There are\nalso many reasons why staging is undesirable. While I have not quantified all of these negative aspects, they bear\nmentioning.\n12\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nFirst, there will be a negative impact on safety. While there are many hazards that the airline industry overcomes\nwith stunning effectiveness, a great deal of their success can be traced to the fact that most airline flights fly above\nand avoid through route planning, most serious weather conditions. By requiring the airliner to descend through the\nlower atmosphere to a fixed location, the airlines lose this advantage. Also, the takeoff and landing phases are by far\nthe riskiest phases of the flight, which are tripled by staging.\nSecond, total travel time is increased. Even if the system runs perfectly, this is a direct result of increasing the\nproportion of time spent in climb, descent, approach, taxi, and layover. The block time for the single stage aircraft is\n17.18 hours, while the block time for the three stage aircraft is three times 6.00 hours, or 18 hours. Even considering\nunusual operations, the additional time to refuel would be at least 30 minutes per stage. For a three stage trip, this\nwill add one hour to the block time, yielding a total of 19 hours. Experience with international flights has shown that\nlayovers of three hours are common, while layovers of six hours are not uncommon. The potential for greatly\nincreasing the trip time is clearly undesirable.\nThird, terminal area noise and emissions pollution is increased. Since the staged aircraft is smaller, both its\nindividual noise and emissions signatures are likely to be reduced, but not by a factor of three. Since the takeoffs and\nlandings are tripled, terminal area pollution must go up significantly.\nFourth, schedules will be much more susceptible to unplanned delays. Airlines already have a great deal of\ntrouble dealing with disruption due to weather, congestion, and mechanical trouble. All of these are more prevalent\nat the terminal areas than they are enroute. Tripling the takeoffs and landings will much more than triple the\nlikelihood of delays from these sources.\nLast, the staged aircraft will either be less durable or heavier and costlier than my estimate indicates. This is\nbecause one factor that I don\xe2\x80\x99t control for is the effect of fatigue cycles. Both the airframe and engine are susceptible\nto the number of load cycles that they experience. In the case of the airframe, the fuselage is pressurized and\ndepressurized on each flight. For the staged aircraft, there are three times the cycles per trip and either the fuselage\nwill have to be strengthened for this duty or its life will be only one third of the single stage aircraft. This is far from\nan academic theory. Island hopping airlines such as Aloha Airlines and JAL have experienced catastrophic fatigue\nfailures in their fuselages. Also, the staged aircraft\xe2\x80\x99s wings will be exposed to the turbulence of the lower\natmosphere more. This means that they will be put through more and greater magnitude load cycles, which will\nrequire structural reinforcement. Last, the engines of the staged aircraft will be subjected to more full throttle\noperation during takeoff, effectively tripling the number of cycles and length of time at full throttle per trip.\nThese serious issues all reduce the attractiveness of staging airliner service. The benefits of staging have to be\nsubstantially more important than these penalties for an airline and aircraft manufacturer to be willing to adopt\nstaging as an operational model. It is unclear as to whether the idealistic 29% fuel saving of the Hahn Realistic\nredesign aircraft is enough to justify staging.\n\nIII. New Design Metrics\nThe other main hypothesis put forward by Nangia is that the new emphasis on cost and pollution requires new\nmetrics to ensure balanced designs. Nangia correctly points out that PRE is narrowly focused and proposed two new\nmetrics that should be better. The first is the Nangia Value Efficiency parameter, VEOPX, which he claims is a\nmeasure where, \xe2\x80\x9cHigher value is better for lower structure weight, costs (acquisition and operating) and landing\nnoise.\xe2\x80\x9d The second is the Nangia Emissions Efficiency parameter, VEMPX, where, \xe2\x80\x9cHigher value is better for lower\nnoise emissions, and operating costs.\xe2\x80\x9d I will not comment on these claims, but a further investigation of VEMPX will\nhighlight an important point.\nA fundamental difference between the Analytic Analysis approach and the Numerical Analysis approach is not\nso much that one uses non-dimensionalization while the other doesn\xe2\x80\x99t, but rather the level at which the nondimensionalization takes place. The desire to non-dimensionalize is understandable; however, it should be\nunderstood that the very act of non-dimensionalization discards scale information in an attempt to find similarities to\nexploit. When done at a high level, the tendency is toward redundant information, rather than capturing new degrees\nof freedom.\nWhen Nangia wanted to increase the degrees of freedom for his new design metric, he collected PRE, the linear\ncoefficient of the Breguet Range Equation, and payload fraction to create the non-dimensional metric VEMPX,\n\n" PRE %" WP % " PRE %\nVEMPX = $\n\'$\n\'=$\n\'( PayloadFraction)\n# X &# MTOW & # X &\n\n!\n\n13\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n(1),\n\nwhere PRE is defined in Eq. (2), X is defined in Eq.

Equations (4) and (5) are very common substitutions, which are valid under steady state,\nunaccelerated flight conditions such as cruise. Essentially, Eq. (4) sets lift equal to weight while Eq. (5) sets drag\nequal to thrust.\n\nSFC =\n\nWFB\n(T * tB )\n\n(6),\n\nwhere SFC is the Specific Fuel Consumption, and tB is time, Block.\n\nX=\n\n(V * MTOW ) = (V * MTOW * tB)\n" WFB * T %\n$\n\'\n# T * tB &\n\nWFB\n\n(7)\n\nSubstituting Eqs.

(9) into Eq. (1) yields Eq. (10). VEMPX simplifies to the well-known non-dimensional metric of\npayload fraction, but in this case it is squared.\nThe preceding analysis !\nillustrates how parameters that are non-dimensionalized at a high level may appear to\nhave different degrees of freedom, but in reality often do not.\nInstead of devising new non-dimensional metrics to capture the multi-disciplinary nature of balanced aircraft\ndesign, we at NASA have taken advantage of the optimization capability of our Numerical Analysis approach. The\nbalance comes from the flexible interplay of a multitude of small disciplinary analyses, while subject to constraints,\nto minimize a specific Objective function. Historically, we have minimized TOW, as it had a strong correlation with\nLife Cycle Cost (LCC), and this was the Objective used in this study. As the conditions that prompted Green and\nNangia to pursue the possibility of staging, namely increasing fuel prices and concern about Global Climate Change,\nbecome a reality, the correlation between TOW and LCC is becoming less valid. I agree that a new Objective needs\nto be found that better represents the new reality. What we need is to find an objective with intrinsic value that takes\ninto account the economic challenges that will drive airliner manufacturers\xe2\x80\x99 and operators\xe2\x80\x99 decisions to ensure that\nthe technologies and operations proposed are attractive to them.\n\nIV. Conclusion\nTwo main Nangia hypotheses have been investigated. The first hypothesis, concerning the likely fuel\nconsumption benefits from the staging of airliner service has been quantified, and my results indicate that using\nthree stages for a total of 15,000 km would likely yield a 17% improvement from operation alone, a further 12%\nimprovement from redesign for the 5,000 km stage length, resulting in a total possible improvement of 29%. This\nresult differs substantially from the previous work of Green and Nangia. While I can not be certain as to why this is,\nresults using published Boeing payload-range diagrams indicate that the previous work may not have controlled for\npayload density, skewing their results.\nWhile it is likely that staging airliner service can save a substantial amount of fuel, there are serious negative\nimpacts that have not been quantified. The greater the fuel savings, the greater the likelihood that staging will\novercome these negative impacts. Given that my best estimate is less than a third of the earlier estimates, the\nlikelihood that staging will still be attractive is significantly diminished.\nThe second hypothesis, concerning the development of new, high level, non-dimensional metrics to promote\nmore balanced aircraft design has been examined, and it is shown that there are inherent pitfalls to this approach.\nWhile non-dimensionalization is a useful technique when applied to low level analyses, there is a tendency towards\nseemingly unrelated metrics having redundant information at high levels. This tendency toward high level\nredundancy is shown through the specific example of the simplification of the proposed Nangia Emissions\nEfficiency parameter, VEMPX, to the well-known non-dimensional parameter of payload fraction, squared.\nThe basic approaches of Analytic Analysis and Numerical Analysis are compared on this specific study. Both\napproaches have strengths and weaknesses, but the transparency and flexibility of the Numerical Analysis approach\npromotes the discovery of errors and understanding of how parameters are driving the result as well as allowing for\ntighter control over the study\xe2\x80\x99s execution.\n\nAcknowledgments\nI would like to thank Fayette Collier for allowing me to spend the time and effort needed to produce this paper,\nJeffrey Berton whose initial efforts gave me the kind of courage to commit that can only come from knowing the\nanswer beforehand, and Philip Arcara for providing the original FLOPS model in my hour of need.\n\nReferences\n1\n\nNangia, R.
