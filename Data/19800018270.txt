Cost and price determinations were made for annual\nproduction volumes of 1000, 25,000, 100,000 and 400,000 units. The\ngenerated numbers were used to compare the relative cost and selling\nprice of the engines intended for use in solar power conversion\nunits. The following engines were evaluated:\nBrayton Engine - A 10 kW subatmospheric engine with a\nrecuperator, as designed by Garrett AiResearch Manufacturing\nCompany of California. The engine was upgraded to a 20 kW\ndesign; increases in material and labor costs were calculated by\nusing a factor equal to the cube root of 2 0 (1.26) for the\n.0\nmaterial required, as suggested by the manufacturer.\n\n-\n\nRated at 30 kW for continuous operation, this\nStirling Engine\nengine designed by United Stirling in Malmo, Sweden utilizes a\nP-40 design modified for solar power conversion use.\nExisting engine designs were evaluated.\nmodify the designs to reduce costs.\n\nYo attempt was made to\n\nThis study estimated the cost of direct labor, material and\npurchased parts to generate a cost number. A figure of $lO.OO/hour\nwas applied for direct labor. Estimates were made of the tooling,\ncapital equipment, and factory area required in determining the\nselling price of the engines.\nThe manufacturers of the Brayton and Stirling engines were\ncontacted in order to obtain the detailed information (drawings,\nspecifications, etc.) from which to make cost estimates. The\nmanufacturers agreed to supply the necessary information, provided JPL\nwould execute an Agreement of Confidentiality and/or a Secrecy\nAgreement that would preserve the proprietary rights of the companies\ninvolved. As a result, JPL cannot release detailed cost information\non parts, components or assemblies. The only information that may be\npublished is the final cost and selling price numbers of a complete\nengine.\nRepresentatives from both United Stirling and Garrett AiResearch\nManufacturing Company of California have reviewed and concurred with\nthe JPL approach to the manufacturing process selected\n*"Required Selling Price" is the price that would be required to meet\nThis includes direct\noperating costs and all indirect and financial costs (profit, taxes,\netc.).\n\n- costs and to make a reasonable profit.\nall\n\nfor each part, component, etc. Additionally, these representatives\nreviewed the cost numbers generated by JPL for direct labor and\nmaterial, tooling and capital equipment.\n\n2\n\nSECTION I1\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nThe evaluation of the Brayton and Stirling engines was performed\nby examining either detailed drawings, actual parts, or both, in those\ncases where b:\noh drawings and parts were available. The study\nevaluated the costs of direct labor and direct material only. C o s t s\nwere determined for annual production volumes of 1000, 25,000, 100,000\nand 400,000. All costs are expressed in 1979 dollars.\nEach engine part, component, assembly (major and minor), and its\nfinal assembly was examined and evaluated to determine the cost of its\nmaterial and the method of manufacture based on the particular annual\nproduction volume under review. In estimating the costs of engines\nproduced at the rate of 1000/year, it was assumed that most of the\nitems would be purchased froan small shops and assembled in an in-house\nfacility\n\n.\n\nFor production runs of 25,000 unitslyear, it was assumed that a\nmake or buy decision would be made to obtain the lowest cost based on\na trade-off of capital investment versus labor cost. Again, the\nassembly would be performed in-house. It should be noted that a\nproduction or 25.000 engines per year requires an engine be produced\nevery \xe2\x82\xacour minutes based on an eight-hour working day.\nAs the production rate increases to 100,000 unitslyear, i t was\nassumed that most items would be made in-house with the necessary\ninvestment in tooling and capital equipment. Assembly would be\nperformed in-house. This rate would require an engine be produced\nevery minute based on an eight-hour working day, With production at\n400,000 units per year, multiple and duplicate facilities would be\nrequired which would have to operate two eight-hour working shifts per\nday.\n\nFor low production volumes of 1000 to 25,000 unitslyear, the\nengine manufacturing costs are considered to he labor intensive,\nwhereas the manufacture of engines at higher production volumes would\nbe capital intensive. This could result in lower unit costs for\nmaterials and labor. Estimates were also made for the probable cost\nof the tooling, the capital equipment and the factory area that would\nbe required \xe2\x82\xacor each of the production volumes under consideration.\nRequired selling prices were determined by using a modified\n"Interim Price Estimation Guidelines" (IPEG) computer program which\nwas developed by JPL for use in the Low-Cost Solar Array program.*\nThe modified IPEG provides for indirect labor ana material, factory\narea, amortization of tooling and capital equipment, financing, taxes,\ninflation, profit, etc.\n\n3\n\nSome of the assumptions which were used in t h e modified IPEG are\nlisted in Table 1.\nTable 1\nRequired Selling Price Assumptions\nFinancing\n\n-\n\n75% Equity\n25% Debt\nIncome Tax\n\n-\n\nDepreciation\n\n14.5%\n9.0% Interest\n\n50%\n\n- Straight\n\nLine\n\nNiscellaneous Costs\n15% Contingency (During Construction)\n10% of Operating Costs\n5% of Revenues\n\nNo Sales or Shipping Costs\nNo R&D Amortization\n\nInflation Kate\nProfit\n\n-\n\n6%\n\n- Approximately\n\n4\n\n12%\n\nSECTION I11\nRESULTS\n\nThe cost estimates for both the Brayton and Stirling engines in\nthe various annual production quantities are shown in Tables 2 through\n5. (Results are in 1979 dollars.) Estimated costs of Stirling\nengines at the lower annual production rates are substantially higher\nthan those for Brayton engines. At annual production volumes above\n50,000 units, costs of both engines are similar, although the Stirling\nengine costs are somewhat lower.\n\nA curve illustrating the cost reductions obtained by increases\nin annual production volumes is presented in Figure 1. The costs of\nthe Stirling engine decrease dramatically with increases in annual\nproduction volume due to reductions of both material and labor costs.\nMaterial and labor cost reductions are primarily influenced by what is\ncalled the "cold part" of this Stirling engine which is similar to an\nautomotive internal combustion engine. Figure 2 is a bar chart\nillustrating the cost reductions obtained with increases in annual\nproduction volumes. Figure 3 is a bar chart showing engine costs per\nk peak for each annual production volume. Figure 4 illustrates the\nW\nrequired selling price of the engine versus annual production volume.\nFigure 5 is a bar chart illustrating the required selling price of the\nengine per kW peak versus production volumes.\nBoth AiResearch and United Stirling have indicated that\nmodifications could be made to their engine designs to reduce the\nestimated costs.\n\n5\n\nTable 2.\n\nEngine Cost Estimate\n1000 Unitslyear\nBRAYTON\n$\n\nRaw Material and/or\nPurchased Parts\n\nLabor Hours\nLabor Cost @ $lO.OO/Hour\n\nSTIRLING\n\nnim&T\n$\n\n1,430.65\n\n135.89\n1,358.90\n\n31.99\n319.90\n\n--\n\nMiscellaneous\n\n3,709.62\n\n200.00\n\n1,750.55\n\n5,268.52\n\n88 00\n\n176.00\n\nCapital Equipment\nToo 1 ing\n\n1,800,000.00\n1,200,000.00\n\n3,361,000.00\n2,531,500.00\n\nTotal Capital Equipment 6 Tooling\nCapital Equipment & Tooling\nCost/Unit\n\n3,000,000.00\n3,000.00\n\n5,892,500.00\n5,893.OO\n\nTotal Engine Cost\n(Labor 6 Material)\nEngine Cost/kW Peak\n\nTable 3.\n\nEngine Cost Estimate\n25,000 Unit s/Year\n\nBRAYTON\n\nSTIRLING\n( 30 kWp 1\n\n(2o-kwp)\nRaw Material and/or\nPurchased Parts\n\n$\n\nLabor Hours\nLabor Cost @ $10.00/Haur\n\n1,382.74\n21.88\n218.80\n\n--\n\nMiscel laneous\nTotal Engine Cost\n(Labor & Material)\nEngine Cost/kW Peak\n\n$\n\n1,662.11\n12.14\n421.40\n125.00\n\n1,601.54\n\n2,208.51\n\n80.00\n\n74.00\n\nCapital Equipment\nTooling\n\n3,427,950.00\n3,189,165.00\n\n28,600,000.00\n9,573,000.00\n\nTotal Capital Equipment & Tooling\nCapital Equipment & Tooling\nCost/Unit\n\n6,617,115.00\n265.00\n\n38,173,000.00\n1,527.00\n\n6\n\nTable 4, Engine Cort Eitimate\n100,000 Uni tr/Ycar\nBA O\nRm N\n\nSTIRLING\n\nnmq3\n\n(2Okwp)\n$\n\nRaw Material and/or\nPurchared Parts\n\n1,317.78\n\n$\n\n12.53\n125.30\n\nLabor Hours\nLabor Cost @ $lO.OO/Hour\n\n12.12\n121.20\n\n--\n\nMi sce1 1aneous\n\n1,055.77\n\n30.00\n\n1,504.08\n\n1,206.97\n\n75.00\n\n40.00\n\nCapital Equipment\nTooling\n\n20,775,575.00\n9,081,800.00\n\n70,565,000.00\n22,229,000 .OO\n\nTotal Capital Equipment 6 Tooling\nCapital Equipment & Tooling\nCost/Unit\n\n29,857,375.00\n299.00\n\n92,794,000.00\n928.00\n\nTotal Engine Cost\n(Labor 6 Material)\nEngine Coot/kW Peak\n\nTable 5.\n\nEngine Cost Estimate\n400,000 Unitslyear\n\nBRAYTON\n\nSTIRLING\n\n73iniTg\n\n( 0\n2 )\nRaw Material and/or\nPurchaeed Parts\n\n$\n\n1,271.24\n\n$\n\n1,010.61\n\n9.49\n94.90\n\nMiecel laneoue\n\n9.67\n96.70\n\n--\n\nLabor Hours\nLabor Coot @ $lO.OC/Ilour\n\n25 00\n\n.\n\n1,366.14\n\n1,132.31\n\n68.00\n\n38.00\n\nCapital Equipmnt\nTooling\n\n54,694,000.00\n24,057,800.OO\n\n187,635,000.00\n75,695,000.00\n\nTotal Capital Equipment 6 Tooling\nCapital Equipment 6 Tooling\ncost /Unit\n\n78,751,800.00\n197.00\n\n263, 330,000*00\n658.00\n\nTotal Engiae Cost\n(Labor 6 Material)\nEngine Cost/kW Peak\n\n7\n\nn\n\nP\nY\n\n0\n\ncy\n\nU\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n5\n3\nm\n\n\\\n\nm\n3\nC\nF:\n\n4\n\nm\n0\n0\n\na\n,\n\nC\n\nr!\n\naJ\n\nLd\n\n7\n\nM\n\nI\n\n8\n\n5269\n\nSTIRLING ENGINE\n\n(30 kW PEAK)\n\nBRAYTON ENGINE\n(20 k PEAK)\nW\n\nc2209\n\n$1504\n11132\n\n0\n0\n\n2\nc\n\n-\n\nc\n\nFigure 2 .\n\n-\n\nEngine Cost versus Annual Volume\n\n$176\n\nSTIRLING ENGINE\n(30 kW PEAK)\n\nBRAYTON ENGINE\n(20 kW PEAK)\n\n$74\n\nEi.\n\nc\n\nFigure 3.\n\nW\nEngine Cost per k Peak versus Annual Volume\n\nI:\n\n--\n\nSTIRLING ENGINE\n\nBRAYTON ENGINE\n\n(3fA kW PEAK)\n\n(20 kW PEAK)\n\nr_\n\nFigure 4.\n\nEngine P r i c e versus Annual Volume\n\n$431\n\nBRAYfON ENGINE\n(20 kW PEAK)\n\nFigure 5 .\n\nEngine P r i c e per k Peak versus h n u a l Volume\nW\n\n10\n\n'
