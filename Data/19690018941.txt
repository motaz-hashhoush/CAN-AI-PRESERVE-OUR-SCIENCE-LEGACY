E. Stoddard\nINTRODUCTION\n\nEmission of infrared radiation from solids is generally studied\nt.\n\nin one of two ways: first, the sample, in the form of a slab, is\nheated from one side to a desired temperature and infrared emission\nfrom the other side is collected in a spectrometer which measures\nthe radiation spectrum. Second, the sample is irradiated by a black\nbody and the reflected radiation is collected and analyzed. Kirchoff\'s\nlaw, relating emissivity to the measured reflectivity, applies in\nthis case if the black body and sample surface temperatures are the\nsame. Emission from the sample is given by the calculated emissivity\nand the Planck distribution function. These two methods yield the\nsame results when properly applied.\nNeither of these methods, however, measures infrared emission\nfrom a solid under the common circumstance that the solid is illuminated\nby light from the sun on the same surface from which emission is observed.\nThe emission is generally assumed, in this case, to be that measured by\n\ni\nthese methods from a sample\'at the temperature of the illuminated surface. The purpose of this research is to make a preliminary investigation of whether or not this assumption is valid. Is there luminescence in the far infrared when a solid is illuminated by visible light?\n\n2\n\n+.,..ryr..fr^.rr +^1aR`^ettr`^\xc2\xb0\n\n\t\n\n;.sw\t\n\n...._.^ _ ..^\t\n\n_ -^ ,...-_\xe2\x80\xa2. _4S^ ._ .+^+.,e^+*,.++\'.:.rr^ \t\n\n"" "^T\'. .4* \t\n\n^.., T^-"^.s.\t\n\n--y+.^--\t\n\n+r\n\nThe excitation of a solid produced in either method of measuring\ninfrared emission, for temperatures corresponding co terrestrial or\nlunar conditions, consists almost entirely of lattice vibrational\nenergy. When a solid is illuminated by visible light, on the other\nhand, the solid is raised to excited electronic states. To the extent\nthat these states are de-excited by their coupling to the lattice some\nof the excitation energy diffuses among the lattice vibrations, resulting in the emission of infrared radiation. Were the illumination\nstopped, then the lattice energy would assume the equilibrium frequency\nspectrum corresponding to the sample temperature. During illumination,\nhowever, the frequency spectrum at the illuminated surface is conceivably quite different, resulting in anomalous infrared emission, or\nluminescence:\nLuminescent infrared emission from an illuminated solid would\ndepend upon the mechanism of coupling between excited electronic states\nand lattice vibrations ; and up:^n the a ".\t\n\nk.h with which lattice vib-\n\nrations are coupled to one another to bring about their equilibrium\nfrequency spectrum. As an hypothesis, the electronic states are presumed to be strongly coupled to those lattice vibrations whose frequencies\nare the "characteristic frequencies" of the lattice, and only weakly to\nothers. The energy input to the Lattice would then be peaked about\nlattice vibrations of these frequencies. If coupling of lattice vibrations to one another is not too strong the resulting vibrational spectrum\nduring illumination will retain peaks about the characteristic frequencies,\nwith these peaks also in the spectrum of emitted infrared.\n\n3\n\nEvidence is sought for this hypothesis in the rate of increase\nof infrared emission, in the wavelength region of the lattice char-\n\nacterio tic frequencies, at the beginning of visible illumination.\nThe vibrational spectrum peak would be established concurrently with\nthe excitation of electronic states, so that luminescent, infrared\nradiation generated by these lattice vibrations would rise\n\nin intensity\n\nat the same rate as the reflected visible radiation. Thermal infrared\nradiation rises more slowly in response to the increase in temperature\nof the sample. Direct spectral\n\nanalysis\n\nof the emitted infrared,\n\nparticularly at the low temperatures employed, is beyond the present\nfacilities of this experiment.\n\nAPPARATUS\nR\n\nA schematic, cutaway drawing of the apparatus is shown in figure\n1. Part of a two liter Liquid nitrogen resevoir is shown at the top,\nwithin an outer vacuum shell enclosing the entire apparatus. The\nexperiment is designed for a range of temperatures, with a low of\nappvoximately -1.80\xc2\xb0C, for several reasons. The low temperature allows\nreproduction of lunar as well as terrestrial temperature conditions.\nAlso, since the ambient thermal radiation from a solid drops rapidly\nwith temperature, the background above which luminescence is to be\nobserved is greatly ,;educed at the lower temperature. Additionally,\na wide temperature range is desirable since the de-excitation of the\nsolid after absorption of visible radiation likely depends upon the\ndegree of lattice excitation. The mechanism of luminescence may thus\nbe temperature dependent.\n\n4\n\n.\n\nC\n\nThe sample, figure I t\n\nis enclosed by materials at liquid nitrogen\n\n!temperature. Most of this enclosure consists of aluminum coated with\nParson\'s Black to be almost totally absorbing. The optical path indicated by the horizontal dashed line through the vacuum shell is closed\nto infrared radiation by a one centimeter long cylinder of fused quartz\nwhich is cooled within a housing attached\n\nto the main aluminum block.\n\nThe quartz is nearly opaque to radiation of wavelength greater than 4\n\nmicrons and, due to its low temperature, radiates little infrared. The\npath for a ,second external source is\nin the cut--away region. This path\nberyllium window and is\nGreater\n\nlocated at 90\xc2\xb0 from the one\n\nis generally closed by a cooled\n\nthen used for x -ray\n\ndetail of the\n\nsample is spring clipped\n\nshown,\n\nirradiation of the sample.\n\nsample mounting is shown in figure 2. The\n\nto a copper plate for temperature uniformity.\n\nThis plate is backed by a stainless steel okie with a recess for a thermocouple and a 100 ohm heating coil. This assembly is supported by three\nteflon covered rods from a back plate attached to the main aluminum cold\nblock. A metal bellows joins the recessed plate and the back plate,\nand is connected by metal capillary tubing to the outside of the vacuum\nshell. When the bellows are evacuated through the tubing, the sample\nholder assembly is spring loaded back against the teflon supports to\nisolate the sample from the cold aluminum block. When the tubing is\n"\t\n\nexternally switched to connect to helium at 20 psi gauge pressure, the\nbellows extend to force the copper sample plate against the aluminum.\nThe sample may thus be cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature with the\nbellows pressurized, or warmed by the heater when isolated by evacuation\nof the bellows.\n\n5\n\nt-\n\nRadiation from the camplc is reflected downward through a filver\nwheal, by a gold plated mirror, as shown in figure 1. The filter\nwheel, provides limited spectral information for radiation from the\nsource# it is f\'>Cted with three cooled infrared filters, for the\nbands 3.2 and 6.6 Microns, 8.6 to 10.7 microns and 10.6 to 20 microns\nrespectively, and a blame for total radiation. The wheal, is rotated\nfrom outside the vacuum shell from below as indicated, with a teflon\nV\n\nshaft coupling.\nRadiation passing the filter wheel is collected in a polished\ncone and delivered to a cooled, Epply wire-wound thermopile.\nOperation of the complete assembly is indicated by the dashed\nline in figure 1. An external source of radiation is directed upon\nthe sample within the cooled enclosure. Radiation ,rom the sample\n\ngenerated by this external source is reflected through a filter wheel\nfor spectral analysis and detected by the thermopile. External, cirvaitry consists of an operational amplifier and an X-T recorder to\npresent the detector signal, a DC power supply for the sample heater\n\nand a millivolt recorder to measure the thermocouple emf.\nThe primary source of external, radtation used to date is an\n.Edmund "Tru--Focus," 150 watt projection lamp, The Ai power for this\nlamp is controlled by a darkroom timer which has been modified to\nprovide an output signal when\n\nswitched on\n\nor off,to mark the\n\nperiod\t\n\nof illumination on the detector signal. recorder. An x-ray source has\nbeen\n\nused\n\non a few occasions.\n\n6\n\nk\n\nCALIBRATION\n\nApproximate values for the sensitivity of the detector for\nradiation from the sample, and for the intensity of external radiation incident upon the sample are necessary for semiquantitative\nresults.\nh\n\nThe design estimate of the detector sensitivity was made from\n\nthe manufacturers suggested value of 0.1 volt per watt per cm 2 of\nradiation incident upon the detector. This value may be expressed\nin terms of radiation from the source rather than radiation incident\nupon the detector. The collecting cone over the detector effectively\nenlarges its size to that of the illuminated portion of the sample,\nThe angle factor for \'this onmple--detector configuration, that is,\nthe fraction of radiation emitted by the sample which reaches the\ndetector,is calculated to be 2.5%. For design purposes, then, the\ndetector sensitivity was estimated to be 2.5 x 10 -3 volt per watt per\ncm2 of energy radiated by the sample within the pass band of the filter\nbetween sample and detector.\nThe measured detector sensitivity exceeds this estimate by almost\nan order of magnitude, The actual sensitivity was determined by measuring the rise in detector signal with a known increase in sample\nI\n\ntemperature. The signal was nulled with the sample at low temperature\nand measured after the sample and holder had reached equilibrium at\na higher temperature. A signal of 40pvis observed, for example, with\nan increase of sample temperature from -181\xc2\xb0C to -86\xc2\xb0C and with the\n10.6 - 20 micron filter in the radiation path. Assuming the sample\nemissivity to be unity for this calculation and the filter to pass 80%\nof the radiation within its pass band, then the radiation per unit area\n\n7\nr\n\nof sample which passes the filter at these two temperatures is 1.4\nx 10" 5 and 2.1 x 10,3 watts per cm 2 respectively. The sensitivity\nis thus 0.019 volts per watt per cm2 . The same value is obtained,\nas expo ed, with the filter removed.\nThe experimental procedure for determining detector sensitivity\na\nwould be in error were the temperature of the thermopile reference\njunctions to rise during the prolonged period during which the sample\nis at elevated temperature. Such an effect would decrease the signal\nbelow-the correct value. This possibility was ruled out by placing\nan aluminum disc in the filter position, with a polished face toward\nthe detector. After. equilibration,the 10.6 - 20 micron filter was\nrotated into position and the signal measured immediately. As before,\nthe signal was constant at 40pv.\nThe intensity of external radiation at the position of the sample\nwas measured with a simple radiation .probe. The probe was constructed\nof a 1/2" square of 21 mil copper sheet, painted with Parson\'s Black on\nthe front face and with a thermocouple soldered to the rear. It was\nmounted in the position of the sample, and the dewar evacuated to insulate the probe during illumination. When illuminated, a linear initial\nrise in temperature of the probe is observed with a theoretical rate\nFA/MC, where F is the incident intensity and A, M and C are the probe\narea, mass and specific heat respectively. The measured intensity of\nthe Edmund projection lamp at the sample position is 0.4 watts per cm2.\n\n8\n\nRESULTS\n\n1\n\n4\t\n\nPerformance of the apparatus was studied by removing the sample\nto expose the sample support plate to external. radiation. The gold\nsurface of this plate has very high reflectivity 4md low emissivity\nso that radiation reaching the detector under this condition is a\nbase for comparison with signals observed from mineral, samples.\nTypical results are shown in figure 3, in which traces of the recorder\ndetector signal as a function of time during and after illumination\nby the Edmund lamp are presented. The plate temperature was -168\xc2\xb0C\nduring these ;guns.\nNo filter was interposed between the sample and detector in figure\n3A. Filters were present in cases B, C and D with the wavelength pass\nbands indicated. The zero of time.is the beginning of illumination and\n"end" denotes termination of illumination.. The scale on the vertical\naxes is the output voltage of the detector and changes by a factor of\n\n200 from the first to the last two traces.\nTraces A and B of figure 3 are interpreted to represent radiation\nfrom the lamp which passes the one centimeter quartz input filter and\nis reflected by the plate to the detector. Some of this radiation lies\nin the pass band of the 3.2 -- 6.6p filter as expected. The rise and\n\ndecay of these traces is exponential with a time constant of 0.9 seconds.\nb\n\nTraces C and D of figure 3 show that no detectable increase in radiap\t\n\ntion of wavelength between 8.6 and 20p is generated within the interior\nof the apparatus during illumination. In particular, no discernable rise\nin temperature of the quartz input Filter occurs which would radiate into\nthe interior. These traces also demonstrate that the two infrared filters\npass a neglegible fraction of the incident visible light entering the\ninterior through the quartz filter.\n9\n\nSamples were prepared from three widely differing rock types:\n\nquartz morizonite, dunite and\n\na tektite supplied by Dr. E.C.T. Chao,\n\nU. S. Geological Survey. Each was out to a slab 1/16" thick and 1"\'\nsquare, with the side fitting against the sample plate polished. The\nsystem was typically equilibrated overnight at a low temperature, after\na\n\nwhich the temperature of the sample mounting plate was approximately\n-1800 C. Each sample was illuminated by the Edmund lamp for various\nintervals of time at this temperature and the detector response recorded\nwith various filters in the optical path. The sample assembly was then\nthermally isolated by evacuation of the bellows and raised to various\ntemperatures as high as 0 0C. Illumination was repeated at each of\nthese higher temperatures. The results for each sample are very similar,\nso that only those for the last sample studied, the tektite, are reproduced here.\nFigures 4 and 5 show the rise in detector signal in response to\nradiation from the sample passing the 8.6 - 10.7\xc2\xb5 and 10.6 - 20\xc2\xb5 filters,\nfor illumination at sample temperatures of -180 0 C and 0 0 C, respectively.\nThe solid curves are particular recorder traces and the dashed\ncurves visual averages of several traces. Illumination began at the\nzero of each curve and continued approximately 10 seconds. These results\nare characteristic of those obtained for all three samples for various\nperiods of illumination from 3 to 20 seconds, and for sample temperatures\nintermediate between -1806C and O\xc2\xb0C.\nAttempts were also made to observe infrared radiation from the\nsample using ultraviolet and x-ray excitation. The intensity of the\nmercury arc, ultraviolet lamp is approximately 0.06 milliwats per cm\n\n1\t\n\n10\n\nI\n\nat the Fample position, compared to the 0.4 watts per cm 2 Edmund\nlamp intensity. The x-ray beam was generated at a distance of\napproximately 10" from the sample by a 25 ma current of 50KV electrons. No infrared radiation was observed with excitation from\neither of these sources.\nD\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe shape of the curves in figures 4 and 5 suggest that they\narise from thermal radiation emitted by the sample as its temperature\nrises during illumination. No signal increase with the time constant\nof the detector, as in figures 3A and 3B,are observed.\nThe thermal behavior of the sample may be readily calculated with\ncertain simplifications. The relatively slow signal decay after illumination corresponds to a heat flux into the copper mounting plate of\nsome 0.05 watts per cm 2 when the sample is at its maximum temperature\nin figure 4B. This , flux is much smaller at the beginning of illumination,\nand is sufficiently small compared to the incident 0.4 watts per cm2\nthat the sample may be approximated as an insulated slab during illumination. The characteristic time for heat flow in such a slab is Z2\nwhere k is the slab thickness and\n\nK\n\n/Tr2K,\n\nits diffusivity. The tektite sample\n\nis 0.06 cm thick, so that this time is of the order 10 milliseconds for\n\na reasonable value of\n\t\n\nK.\n\nSince this time is short compared to the rise\n\ntime of the signal, the model of an insulated slab which is isothermal\n\n1)\n\nthroughout is taken to represent the sample.\n\n11\n\nWriting Q for the incident radiation faux, and p,k and C\nfor the sample density, thickness and specific heat, respectively,\nthe sample temperature satisfies\ndT tR\ndt p?,C\nThe variation of C\n\nwith temperature\n\n(1)\n\nis important\n\nat the low temperatures\n\nused. This variation is assumed to be adequately given by\n\nthe\n\nEinstein\n\n10\n\nrelation:\nC = A\t\nT2\n\nwith\n\nexp\t\nexp (a/T) -1 ]\t\n[\n\n? A exp (--a/T)\t\n\nT2\n\n(2)\n\nthe approximation which neglects the term --1 0 appropriate for low\n\ntemperatures where a/T is large. The constants A\n\nand a are\n\ntaken as\n\nadjustable parameters to gave the best fat. Substituting the approximation to C into equation 1) and integrating,\n\nexp (-a/T)- wxp (-a/To) = Qat/p2A \t\n\n(3)\n\nwhere To is the sample temperature at the beginning of illumination\nand T its subsequent temperature in degrees Kelvin.\nThe curves of figure 5 were made at higher temperature where the\napproximation of equation 2)is not justified. In these cases, however,\nthe rase of sample temperature during illumination is reduced due to\n\nt\n\nthe larger specific heat at higher temperature, and the variation of\n\nI\n\n12\n\nspecific heat with temperature is also reduced. C is accordingly\ntreated as a constant and equation l) integrates directly to\n\nT - -. t\t\npZC\n\n(4)\n\nwhere T is measured in degrees Centigrade from zero at t = 0.\nEquations 2) and 4) approximate the rise in sample temperature\nduring illumination for the conditions of figures 4 and 5 \t\n\nAssuming\n\nU\n\nthe sample to radiate as a black body, the thermal radiation reaching\nthe detector through the 10.6 -20p filter is given by the Planck\nformula as a function of the calculated temperatures, Comparison between the model and experiment is then posaible using the detector calibration discussed earlier and correcting for the detector time constant.\nThe parameters A and a are required to give a best fit to the curve of\nfigure 4B by use of equation 3), and to the curve of figure 5B by use\nof equation 4) with the value of C calculated from equation 2).\nFigure 6 shows the fit using a = 700\xc2\xb0K and A = 1.25 x 10 6 joule\ngm per deg. The lines are the average signals, redrawn from figures\n4B and 5B, and the circled points were calculated from the model. The\ndegree of fit achieved is taken to indicate that the observed signals\ncan be entirely understood in terms of increasing thermal radiation\nfrom the sample as its temperature rises during illumination.\nWere prompt, luminescent radiation within the filter pass band\nsuperimposed on the thermal radiation from the sample, then the resulting\nrise in detector signal would appear as in figure 7. Figure 7A has been\n\n13\n\n}\n\ndrawn for the cases that the luminescent radiation is 5 x 10"5f\n1 x 10`" 4 and 5 x 10" 4 watts per cm 2 from the sample surface within\nthe 10.6 - 20u band, and for the sample initially at -180\xc2\xb0C, The\nsignal calculated from the model with no luminescence is shown for\ncomparison. It is estimated that luminescent radiation of 1 x 10"4\nwatts per cm2 would have given an observable reversal of slope at\nthe beginning of illumination of the form shown. Since the intensity\nof illumination was 0.4 watts per cm 2 , the upper limit for luminescence efficiency at --180\xc2\xb0C is established to be approximately 0.02\npercent for the process considered in this report. Since the spectrum\nof the Edmund lamp is similar to that of solar radiation this upper\nlimit applies to the case of solar illumination as well. Such a\nluminescent contribution is probably neglegible for lunar applications.\nA luminescent contribution of this magnitude would not be detectable in this experiment for the case that the sample is at 0\xc2\xb0C because\nof the greater thermal radiation. Figure 7B shows this case for several\nvalues of the intensity of prompt luminescence. The upper limit is\ntaken as 1 x 10" 3 watts per cm2 in this case, or an upper limit for\nluminescence efficiency of 0.25 percent. For the case of sunlight\nilluminating the earth, this luminescent contribution would amount to\ninfrared radiation between 10.6 and 20p of some 3 x 10- 4 watts per cm2.\nSince thermal radiation at terrestrial temperatures exceeds this amount\nby two orders of magnitude such a luminescent contribution would be\t\nneglegible for terrestrial applications.\n\n}\t\n\n14\n\n4\n\nrtAitth 14Mwwwr^s\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nIT)\n\n15\n\nSAMPLE\n\n_._, ._m\n\nFILTER\nWHEEL\n\nIEFtMOPILE\n\n0,\n\nFIGIJ\'RE 1\nA SCHEMATIC, CUT-AWAY DRAWING OF THE DETECTOR APPARATUS \t\n15\n\nr\n\nCOLD BLOCK\t\n\nOPTICAL PATH\n\nt\n\nBELLOWS\n0\n\nHEATER A\nTHERMOCO\n\nTOP\n\nSAMPLE PLATE\n\nOAPI LLAR\nOR\nSUPPORT\nRODS \'-a\n\nSIDE\nFIGURE 2\nA SCHEM&TIC, CUT-AWAY DRAWING OF THE SAMPLE MDUNTING\n\nt\n\n\t\n\nR\n\n0\n\nla\n\nMV\t\n\nASV\t\n\n2\t\n\n)AV\t\n\n0.2\t\n\n10\'\t\n\n10\n\n6\t\n\n10.1\t\n\nEND\t\n\nV\n\n6\n\nEND\n\n0 b 10 SEC\t\n\n0 6 10 SEC \t\n\n0 6 10 SEC\t\n\n0 6 10 SEC\n\nNO FILTER\t\n\n3.2--6.6/A\t\n\n8,6-10.7#\t\n\n10.6-20,c\n\n(A)\t\n\n(8)\t\n\n(C)\t\n\n(D)\n\nFIGURE 3\na\nCURVES SHOWING TYPICAL RESULTS OF THE RECORDER DETECTOR SIGNAL WITH NO\nFILTER (A) AND AT DIFFERFITIr WAVELENGTHS (B),-(C), (D)\n\nr\t\n\n17\n\n,uv\n\n)JV\n\n30 1\n\n301\n\n2\n\n20\n\n10\n\ne\n\nEND\n0\n\n10\t\n\n20 SEC\n\n18.6-10.7/4\n(A)\t\n\n0\t\n\n10\t\n\n20 S EC\n\n10#6- 20\nT = -1 AO\'C\t\n\nt^1)\n\nFIGURE 4\n` CURVES\n\nSHOWING RISE IN DETECTOR SIGNAL IN RESPONSE TO RADIATION AT\nDIFFERENT WAVELENGTHS WHEN T = -180\xc2\xb0C\n\n80\n\npV\nSol\n\npV\n\n60\n\n60\n\n40\n\n40\n\n20\n\n20\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\t\n\nit\t\n\n20 SEC\n\n0\t\n\n6.6 - 10.7\'a\n(A)\n\n10\t\n\n20\t\n\n30\t\n\n10.6 \xe2\x80\x94 20A\nT a 01C\n\nCB)\n\nFIGURE 5\n\nCURVES SHOWING RISE IN DETECTOR SIGNAL IN RESPONSE TO RADIATION AT\nDIFFERENT WAVELENGTHS WHEN T = 0 C\n\n19\n\n40 SEC\n\n\t\n\nf\n\n\xc2\xb5V\n80\n\n1.\n\nAV\n60\n\n30\n\nJ\n\n20\n\n40\n\n10\n\n20\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\t\n0\n\n0 5 10 15 20 SEC\n\n10 SEC\n\n5\t\n\n\t\n\n10.6 --20 lu\n\n10.6 \xe2\x80\x94 20,u\n\t\n\nT s 0*0\n\nTx-160C\n\n(A)\n\n\t\n(6)\n\nFiGUR8 6\n\nAVERAGE CURVES (LINES) SHOWING BEST FIT RELATION TO POINTS DERIVED FROM\nMATHEMATICAL MODEL\n\n20\n\n.r\n\n\t\n\npv\n\n\t\n\n,tv\n\n12\n\n60\n\n10\n\n50\n\nD\n\n40\n\n01\n\nC\n\n30\n\n6\n\n8\nA\n\n4\n\n20\n\n2\n\n10\n\n0\t\n\n1\t\n\n2\t\n\n3\t\n\n4\t\n\n\'0\t\n\n5 SEC\t\n\nI\t\n\n2\t\n\n3\t\n\n8.6 \xe2\x80\x94 20^\t\n\n5 SEC\n\n6,6 \xe2\x80\x94 20,P\n\nT V \xe2\x80\x94180*C\t\n\n4\t\n\nTs 00C\n\n(13)\n\n(A)\t\n\nFIGURE 7\nCURVES SHOWING RISE IN DETECTOR SIGNAL WHEN LUMINESCENT RADIATION\nWITHIN FILTER PASS BAND IS SUPEIUMPOSED ON THE THERMAL RADIATION\nFROM THE SAMPLE, WHERE (A) T = 180\xc2\xb0C acrd (B) T = 0\xc2\xb0C\n_- -\t\n\n21\n\n4^\n\n'
