The interface adapter is comprised of several main components, including an RF signaling receiver, a microcontroller and associated circuitry for decoding and processing the received signals, and programmable impedance matching and line interfacing circuitry for interfacing a wireless communications headset system base to a communications system. A signaling transmitter, which is preferably portable (e.g., handheld), is employed by the wireless headset user to send signals to the signaling receiver. In an embodiment of the invention directed specifically to push-to-talk (PTT) signaling, the wireless headset user presses a button on the signaling transmitter when they wish to speak. This sends a signal to the microcontroller which decodes the signal and recognizes the signal as being a PTT request. In response, the microcontroller generates a control signal that closes a switch to complete a voice connection between the headset system base and the communications system so that the user can communicate with the communications system. With this arrangement, the wireless headset can be interfaced to any communications system that requires PTT signaling, without modification of the headset device. In addition, the interface adapter can also be configured to respond to or deliver any other types of signals, such as dual-tone-multiple-frequency (DTMF) tones, and on/off hook signals. The present invention is also scalable, and permits multiple wireless users to operate independently in the same environment through use of a plurality of the interface adapters.", "title": "Communications interface for wireless communications headset", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-24T08:29:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20080007026, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Seibert, Marc A."}, "organization": {}}, "id": "27fff9d686a14d799b53c43e0e62b333"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20080007026, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Culotta, Jr., Anthony Joseph"}, "organization": {}}, "id": "f1b09b5a22bd4530a68fee04c5fdcdae"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other - Patent", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20080007026, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20080007026, "id": "a2a0684ce84547ca80c0bb16be2fd2d6", "publicationDate": "2004-06-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20080007026.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20080007026/downloads/20080007026.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20080007026/downloads/20080007026.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20080007026/downloads/20080007026.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
