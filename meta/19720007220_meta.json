Both flight and control samples were evaluated. Some conclusions resulting from a comparison of the flight and control samples were: (1) Solidification in neither the flight nor control samples was truly directional. (2) Apparent intermittent contact of the melt with the container in the flight samples led to unusual nucleation and growth structures. (3) There was greater uniformity, on a macro scale, of both pores and structural features in the flight sample; presumably the result of the reduced gravity conditions. (4) It seems quite feasible to produce enhanced dispersions of gases and dense phases in a melt which is solidified in reduced gravity. (5) A two-stage heating/cooling cycle may help directional solidification. (6) Sample materials should be selected from materials in which the dispersant fully wets the matrix material. (7) Experiments should be conducted in two modes: (1) where the melt is in good thermal contact with the container, and (2) where the melt is in a free-float condition.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19720007220, "id": "6e3cb7858fb5424fabc2e7e9cfcb8ea7", "publicationDate": "1971-08-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19720007220.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19720007220/downloads/19720007220.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19720007220/downloads/19720007220.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19720007220/downloads/19720007220.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
