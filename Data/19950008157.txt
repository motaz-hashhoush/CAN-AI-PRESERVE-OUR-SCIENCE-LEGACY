Morfidl\nMax-Planck-Institut fiir extraterrestrische Physik\n85740 Garching, Germany\nABSTRACT\nIn a ground-based definition study, a concept for a new type of microgravity experiment is\ndeveloped. We formed a new state of matter: a crystalline lattice structure of charged micron-size\nspheres, suspended in a charge-neutral plasma. The plasma is formed by a low-pressure radiofrequency argon discharge. Solid micro-spheres are introduced, and they gain a negative electric\ncharge. They are cooled by molecular drag on the ambient neutral gas. They are detected by laser\nlight scattering and video photography. Laboratory experiments have demonstrated that a twodimensional non-quantum lattice forms through the Coulomb interaction of these spheres.\nMicrogravity is thought to be required to observe a three-dimensional structure.\nINTRODUCTION\nAccording to theory, plasmas can crystallize as they cool. What makes a crystal extraordinary is\nthat virtually every known plasma, astronomical and man-made, is a gas-like fluid, not a solid.\nConsider individual charged particles: those with identical charges repel one another and attempt\nto maintain a separation between themselves, But they cannot move infinitely far apart if they are\nelectrically or magnetically confined in a volume. Nor can they move apart if there is a neutralizing\nSuch OCPs have\nbackground of the opposite polarity. This is called a one-component plasma (OCP).\nbeen studied in other experiments, as we will review in Section III. We interest ourselves here in a kind\nof plasma that is closely related to the one-component plasma, bdt differs in the way that the\nneutralizing background behaves.\nUsually in a plasma the thermal energy is high enough that the plasma behaves like a gas, with\nrandom particle velocities and trajectories with long mean-free-paths. This is called a \xe2\x80\x9cweaklycoupled plasma,\xe2\x80\x9d and it is like a gas. By cooling the particles and lowering thc thermal energy,\naccording to theory, the charged particles in a plasma will adopt fixed positions with a uniform\nhs\nseparation in order to minimize their potential energy. T i is a crystal, and it is the extreme case of a\n\xe2\x80\x9cstrongly-coupled plasma.\xe2\x80\x9d It arises from the internal electrostatic interaction between particles and\nthe containment of an external potential well.\nThe OCP can undergo phase transitions between gaseous, liquid and solid states. These states differ\nfrom ordinary states of \xe2\x80\x99matter in that the particles are much larger (micron size) than atoms, they are\nPresented at the Second Microgravity Fluid Physics Conference, Cleveland, June 21 1994.\nemail: john-goree@uiowa.edu\n\n325\n\nspaced more widely (hundreds of microns) and their inter-particle interaction is strictly classical\nelectrodynamics. The thermodynamics is quantified by the density of the grains and by their\ntemperature, which are combined into the dimensionless parameters\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99= Qp2/ (kB T A)\nK = A /hD,\n\nwhere Q, is the charge on the particles, T is their temperature, A is the typical inter-particle spacing,\nand AD = (EokTi/nie2)1/2 is the Debye shielding length. Physically, I\xe2\x80\x99is the ratio of the electrostatic\npotential energy to the thermal kinetic energy of a grain. By cooling the particles, one increases r.\nWe cool the grains by drag on rarefied neutral gas in the plasma.\nMonte Carlo simulations predict that, in the absence of additional disruptive forces, the OCP\nbehaves as a:\ngas\nliquid\nsolid\n\nfor I < 2\n\xe2\x80\x98\nfor I\xe2\x80\x99> 2\nfor I > 178.\n\xe2\x80\x98\n\nFor high values of I?, the OCP is a solid crystal, sometimes referred to as a \xe2\x80\x9cWigmr crystal,\xe2\x80\x9d which is\na non-quantum ordered structure in the cases we will consider.\n\nA plasma containing micron-size grains has several advantages in forming a crystalline lattice: the\ncharge QP is typically thousands of electron charges so it is easy to make I large, and the individual\n\xe2\x80\x98\ngrains are big enough to be imaged photographically.\nOne can compute Q, from plasma theories that were originally developed for charged bodies such\nas spacecraft and dust particles. [l-21 The sphere collects both electrons and ions, and so it gathers a\nnet current until a steady state is reached where electron and ion currents exactly cancel. This steady\nstate Q, is negative, since electrons are faster than ions and must be repelled to reduce the electron\ncurrent to equal the ion current. The negative charge is just like that of an object in a space plasma.\nIts value is given by Q, = C V , where C = 4 n. , r, is the capacitance of a sphere of radius r,, and Vf is\nE\nits steady-state electric potential.\nIn our experiment the problem is complicated from that of the simple OCP\xe2\x80\x98model because the\nneutralizing background of electrons and ions is free to respond to the electric potential of the\ncharged grains. As a result, I\xe2\x80\x99 is not by itself a sufficient thermodynamic parameter to describe the\nphase transitions. Farouki and Hamaguchi [3] recognized this, and introduced K as the other\nthermodynamic variable. Together, r and K are a complete set of variables for the thermodynamic\nsystem, equivalent to using to the temperature and density as the variables. Farouki and Hamaguchi\nhave also developed a Molecular-dynamics simulation of the phase transition from solid to crystalline\ndusty plasmas. [3,4] They have also introduced the idea that the negatively-charged grains are not\npurely repulsive, because they are surrounded by a net positively-charged cloud of ions in a Debye\nsheath, which also interact as the grains are brought within one Debye length of one another. [4]\nBased on the OCP theory and the results of Farouki and Hamaguchi, it is expected that room\ntemperature is cool enough for our spheres to crystallize, if they have charges of a thousand electron\ncharges, or more.\n\n326\n\nWe have carried out laboratory experiments that have demonstrated the formation of a 2dimensional crystal, verifying in part the theories. These lab experiments are described below, and in\na forthcoming paper. [SI\nAPPARATUS DESIGN\nOur laboratory definition studies reveal that a design using an RF powered plasma is feasible\nbecause it levitates and confines dust particulates for hours. [5] In fact, we chose the RF design\nbecause it is known from its commercial use in plasma processing of materials that it easily levitates\nnad confines charged grains. [6] In the laboratory, gravity causes the particulates to be confined in a\nthin horizontal layer. In a microgravity environment we expect that they will disperse throughout the\ncentral region of the plasma. Drop-tower and parabolic flights may be used to test this assumption.\n\nRF discharge operation is understood well. Electric sheaths form at the two electrodes, and their\nthicknesses oscillate with the applied rf voltage. The sheath edges collide with the electrons in the\nplasma -and accelerate them stochastically to the energies required to sustain the plasma by electronimpact ionization of the neutral gas. RF power is applied continuously to sustain the discharge in a\nsteady state. Ions and dust particles move too slowly to respond to the RF electric fields; instead they\nrespond to a time-average DC electric field that forms naturally. This DC electric field points\neverywhere outward from the center of the plasma, providing stable confinement of the negativelycharged dust particulates. Dust is confined in the large central region of the plasma, where the field is\nless than 1 Vkm, small enough not to tear apart a lattice.\n\nW\nThe F design will allow an adjustable RF output power. This will allow a variable plasma density,\nwhich is useful for multiple experimental runs to test the density dependence in theories involving I?\nand K. A generator with a maximum output of 10 W should allow plasma densities of 5 lo1*~ m - ~ .\nThere are two practical difficulties of using an RF discharge that we must evaluate during the\nlaboratory definition study stage. These are thermal gradient forces and ion-drag forces. Either of\nthem could disrupt crystal formation. Thermal gradients within the gas can disrupt the crystal\nformation due to the \xe2\x80\x9cthermophoresis force\xe2\x80\x9d [7] of the gas on the particles. During the laboratory\nexperiments we will quantify this effect and arrive at engineering criteria for thermal design of the\nflight hardware. Ion-drag forces [8] arise from the ions that are strbaming from the center of the\nplasma toward the negatively-biased electrodes. The ions are scattered by Coulomb collisions with the\nmassively charged grains, and they impart some momentum to the grains. Expressions have been\ndeveloped for ion drag for an isolated grain, 181 but it is unknown how substantial this force will be\nfor ions passing through a cloud of grains, as in our experiment.\n\nRESULTS OF LABORATORY DEFINITION EXPERIMENTS\nA macroscopic Coulomb crystal of solid particles in a plasma has been observed in our laboratory\ndefinition experiments. Images of a cloud of 7-pm \xe2\x80\x9cdust\xe2\x80\x9c particles, which are charged and levitated\nin a weakly-ionized argon plasma, reveal a hexagonal crystal structure. The crystal is visible to the\nunaided eye. The particles are cooled by neutral gas to 310 K, and their charge is >9,000e,\ncorresponding to a Coulomb coupling parameter I\xe2\x80\x99>18,000. For such a large I? value, stronglycoupled plasma theory predicts that the particles should organize in a Coulomb solid, in agreement\nwith our observations.\n\n327\n\nA low-power argon discharge at 2.05 f 0.05 mBar was formed by applying a 13.56-MHz signal to\nthe lower electrode of a parallel-plate reactor. The lower electrode is a disk 8 cm in diameter, while\nthe upper is a ring, with inner and outer diameters of 3 cm and 10 cm, respectively. The electrode\nseparation is 2 cm. The dc self-bias of the lower electrode was -14.5 f 0.5 V, measured at the\nelectrical feed-through. The rf power was 0.4 f 0.3 W.\nA few milligrams of particles were placed in a sieve above the hole in the upper electrode. This is\nagitated to release particles into the plasma. The particles are 7.0 pm diameter\nmelaminetformaldehyde spheres, with a size distribution of M.2 pm.\nThe particles were seen as a thin disk-shaped cloud, levitated above the center of the lower\nelectrode, near the sheath-plasma boundary. Particles were organized in approximately 18 planar\nlayers (= 6 layers of two-particle agglomerates and = 12 layers of single particles), parallel to the\nelectrode. The diameter of the cloud was approximately 3 cm. Observations were made using a sheet\nof HeNe laser light to illuminate a plane. The sheet has a thickness of 110 f 23 pm and a breadth of\n2 cm. It is adjustable to various heights above the lower electrode. Scattered light is viewed at 90"\nthrough a hole in the upper electrode. Individual particles were easily seen with the unaided eye and\nwith a CCD video camera fitted with a macro lens. A 200-mm macro lens with extension tubes\nprovided xl magnification for the data shown below, while a long-distance microscope lens with a\nx 1 3 magnification revealed that the particles in the plasma were either individual grains or\nagglomerates of two grains. The latter were found to populate the lower lattice planes of the cloud,\npresumably due to their greater mass to charge ratio.\nAn image of the particle cloud in a single plane reveals an organized structure with nearly uniform\nparticle spacing. The image area is 7.7 x 7 . 7 mm2 and contains 724 particles. Assuming equal\nparticle spacing in all directions, this corresponds to np = (4.3 f 0.2) x lo4 cm3.\n\nA numerical analysis of this image verifies it as a "plasma crystal." We identified the particle\nlocations and to describe the Voronoi (Wigner-Seitz) cells). The cells are mainly six-sided, with\nnearly equal areas and uniform spacing. The mean separation A (lattice constant) between the\nparticles is 250 pm. The measurements were compared with a synthetic random particle distribution\nusing the same properties - number and density - as in the experiment, This simulates a dusty plasma\nin its "gas phase".\nThis result showing the structure is from a single video frame. The dynamics of this structure are\nrevealed by the video, which showed the individual particles oscillating gently about fixed\nequilibrium centers in what appeared to be a Brownian motion. Occasionally a grain diffused through\nthe structure, visibly perturbing the position of the nearest particle.\nIn order to estimate the coupling parameter, r, we need to know the particles\' kinetic energy (or\ntemperature) and charge. The particles are cooled by the neutral gas. Based on frame-by-frame\nmeasurements of the mean particle velocity, we estimate the particle kinetic temperature to\nTp = 310 K, which is close to room temperature. Particles were also found to be at room temperature\nin the discharge of Boufendi et al. [9], who used laser-Doppler velocimetry to detect particles that\nwere much smaller than ours, and reported a correspondingly smaller value of I?.\nWe estimate the grain charge to lie between the extreme values -9,000 2 Qp/e 2 -28,000. The\'\nshielding length is estimated to lie in the range 60 pm I h I400 pm, resulting in 4 2 K 2 0.6. The\n\n328\n\n,\n\nCoulomb coupling parameter is then estimated to be >18000. Our observation of a crystalline\nstructure is consistent with this large value of r.\n\nNEED FOR MICROGRAVITY\nOur experiment reveals that the dust cloud is crushed. It is much wider than it is high. This is\nthought to be due to a combination of gravity and the ion drag force. For spheres of the size we are\nusing, it is inevitable that gravity will be a significant, and likely dominant, factor in this crushing.\nTo avoid the crushing, the global electric force that confines the grains in the plasma must be\nstronger than gravity. This is necessary so that particulates will be distributed uniformly throughout\nthe vacuum vessel and don\'t pile up at the bottom due to gravity. Quantitatively, the potential energy\ndifference across the vacuum vessel, Mgol, must be much smaller than the confining electric potential\nin the main field-free plasma region, Qp$ which is Qp kBT,/ e. Thus, the microgravity acceleration\ngomust satisfy\ngo << Qp kBTe 1e Mp\'\n5=\n\nNow assuming a 20-pm radius plastic sphere, T, = 1 eV, and a floating potential of -10 V, this\nreduces to go c< 0.667 cm s - = 7 x lom3\n~\ng.\n\n,\n\nA second reason that gravity can disrupt crystal formation is that it competes with the local\nelectric field. To achieve 3-D crystallization, the gravitational must be small compared to the local\npressures on a grain. Electrostatic pressure is responsible for lattice formation, while gravitational\npressure can inhibit it by crushing the lattice into a 2-D structure.\nTo summarize the anticipated microgravity requirements:\ng of reduced gravity.\n* The experiment requires << 7 x\ng of microgravity, which will be inadequate to assure a uniform\nParabolic flights provide =\ndensity of spheres in the plasma.\n* Spaceflight will provide\ng, which is adequate.\nCONCLUSIONS\nGround-based definition studies now in progress are revealing the soundness and feasibility of\nmicrogravity experiments for forming 3-D crystalline structures of charged microspheres levitated in\na charge-neutral plasma. These experiments are expected to offer new opportunities for basic physics\n(WIgner lattice studies) and engineering (dust contamination during microelectronics processing).\nThis work was funded in the U.S. by NASA Microgravity Science and Applications Division grant\nNAG8-292.\n\n329\n\nREFERENCES\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n\n5.\n6.\n7.\n8.\n9\n\nE.C.
