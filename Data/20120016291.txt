b'Software\nStereo and IMU-Assisted\nVisual Odometry\nfor Small Robots\nThis software performs two functions:\n(1) taking stereo image pairs as input, it\ncomputes stereo disparity maps from\nthem by cross-correlation to achieve 3D\n(three-dimensional) perception; (2) taking a sequence of stereo image pairs as\ninput, it tracks features in the image sequence to estimate the motion of the\ncameras between successive image pairs.\nA real-time stereo vision system with IMU\n(inertial measurement unit)-assisted visual odometry was implemented on a single 750 MHz/520 MHz OMAP3530 SoC\n(system on chip) from TI (Texas Instruments). Frame rates of 46 fps (frames per\nsecond) were achieved at QVGA (Quarter\nVideo Graphics Array i.e. 320\xc3\x97240), or 8\nfps at VGA (Video Graphics Array\n640\xc3\x97480) resolutions, while simultaneously tracking up to 200 features, taking\nfull advantage of the OMAP3530\xe2\x80\x99s integer\nDSP (digital signal processor) and floating point ARM processors. This is a substantial advancement over previous work\nas the stereo implementation produces\n146 Mde/s (millions of disparities evaluated per second) in 2.5W, yielding a\nstereo energy efficiency of 58.8 Mde/J,\nwhich is 3.75\xc3\x97 better than prior DSP\nstereo while providing more functionality.\nThe focus is on stereo vision and IMUaided visual odometry for small unmanned ground vehicle applications. It is\nexpected that elements of this implementation will carry over to small unmanned\nair vehicles in future work. Because the\nobjective is to advance the state of the art\nin compact, low-power implementation\nfor small robots, highly efficient algorithms that have already been field tested\nhave been chosen. This system combines\nthe sum of absolute differences (SAD)based, local optimization stereo with twoframe visual odometry using FAST features (Features from Accelerated\nSegment Test). By exploiting the dense\ndepth map to provide stereo correspondence for the FAST features, it achieves\nvery respectable position errors of 0.35%\nof distance traveled on datasets covering\n400 m of travel. The algorithms used by\nthis system were heavily tested in previous\nprojects, which gives a solid basis for their\nimplementation on the OMAP3530. In\nthe future, cost/performance trade-offs\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, October 2012\n\nof algorithm variants may be explored.\nThe novelty of this system is the parallel\ncomputation of stereo vision and visual\nodometry on both cores of the OMAP\nSoC. All stereo-related computation is\nhandled on the C64x+ side of the OMAP,\nwhile feature detection, matching/tracking, and egomotion estimation is handled\non the ARM side. This is a convenient division of processing, as stereo computation is entirely an integer process, well\nsuited to the integer only C64x+, while\nseveral parts of visual odometry involve\nfloating point operations. The TI codec\nengine\xe2\x80\x99s IUniversal wrapper was used to\nintegrate the ARM and DSP processes.\nThis work was done by Larry H. Matthies of\nCaltech and Steven B.

The\nprogram is configurable in terms of tile\nsize, spatial resolution, format of input\ndata, location of input data (local or distributed), number of processes run in\nparallel, and data conditioning.\nThis software can dynamically generate\nglobal images of various temporal and\nspatial resolutions without having to go\nback to the original data files, reading and\nconditioning, and re-projecting the\nsource values. It can be utilized to efficiently generate global imagery of various\ntemporal and spatial resolutions based\nupon cylindrically projected tiles that\nhave been created from swath and gridded data sets.\nThe package supports JPL\xe2\x80\x99s Physical\nOceanography Distributed Active Archive\n\nCenter\xe2\x80\x99s (PO.DAAC) State of the Ocean\nWeb page (http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/\nsoto), a Google Earth-based Web interactive visualization tool.\nThis work was done by Charles K.

The\niPhone app (Satellite Insight) was created\nfor the GOES-R Program. The app describes in simple terms the types of data\nproducts that can be produced from\nGOES-R measurements. The game is easy\nto learn, yet challenging for all audiences.\nIt includes educational content and a\npath to further information about GOESR, its technology, and the benefits of the\ndata it collects.\nThe game features action-puzzle game\nplay in which the player must prevent an\noverflow of data by matching falling\nblocks that represent different types of\nGOES-R data. The game adds more different types of data blocks over time, as long\nas the player can prevent a data overflow\ncondition. Points are awarded for\nmatches, and players can compete with\nthemselves to beat their highest score.\nThis work was done by Austin J. Fitzpatrick,\nNancy J.
