This conversion was accomplished by adjusting the incident sunlight and view angles and by applying a pixel-by-pixel correction for atmospheric effects. Seasonal color changes of the area can be better observed when such normalization is applied to space imagery taken in time series. In normalized imagery, the grey scale depicts variations in surface reflectance and tonal signature of multi-band color imagery can be directly interpreted for quantitative information of the target.", "title": "Normalization of satellite imagery", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-14T12:18:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19900064323, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Kim, Hongsuk H."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD, United States"}}, "id": "a5235c2253a644f7a89e7f8e7a8580d0"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19900064323, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Elman, Gregory C."}, "organization": {"name": "Ressler Associates, Inc.", "location": "Laurel, MD, United States"}}, "id": "1da41368eeab43c380ac1bd099e34811"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19900064323, "publications": [{"volume": "11", "submissionId": 19900064323, "issn": "0143-1161", "id": "9c2e98eb6ea14fcfad3611139f0d060a", "publicationName": "International Journal of Remote Sensing", "publicationDate": "1990-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
