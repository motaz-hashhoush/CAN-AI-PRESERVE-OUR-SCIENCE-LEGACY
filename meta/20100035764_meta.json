From sphygmograms produced by conventional sphygmographs, it is very difficult to differentiate the systolic and diastolic blood-pressure pulses and to correlate these indices with the standard clinical values. It is nearly impossible to determine these indices when the subject is under physical or emotional stress. The solution: An electronic blood-pressure system, basically similar to conventional ausculatory sphygmomanometers, employing a standard occluding cuff, a gas-pressure source, and a gas-pressure regulator and valve. An electrical output transducer senses cuff pressure, and a microphone positioned on the brachial artery under the occluding cuff monitors the Korotkoff sounds from this artery. The output signals present the conventional systolic and diastolic indices in a clear, graphical display. The complete system also includes an electronic timer and cycle-control circuit.", "title": "Blood-Pressure Measuring System Gives Accurate Graphic Output", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-25T00:30:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other - NASA Tech Brief", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20100035764, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20100035764, "id": "7d95ccb4f4d34909b77d5b53045a20a9", "publicationDate": "1965-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20100035764.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20100035764/downloads/20100035764.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20100035764/downloads/20100035764.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20100035764/downloads/20100035764.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
