Fifty-three tests were conducted in an attempt to characterize the blowby of\ncommercial pyrovalves. Those pyrovalves used on NASA spacecraft are well\nrepresented, and the test data reported provide a basis for evaluating the performance of\nsimilar valves in other propulsion systems.\nThe three test series conducted are subsequently described. All testing was done in the\nsame test facility, with periodic changes that enhanced th.e test methodology.\n\n1.1\n\nSERIES A: OEA VALVES\nThirty-four tests evaluated OEA valves with clearance-fit of rams in sleeves; O-rings\nwere not used in order to maximize the amount of blowby. The radsleeve bore\nclearance was varied in an attempt to correlate blowby mass with clearance.\nMeasurement of blowby constituents also allowed the correlation of other parameters,\nsuch as mole fraction of hydrogen gas, that has been shown to accelerate the\ndecomposition of hydrazine.\n\n1.2\n\nSERIES B: CONAX VALVES\nSixteen tests evaluated 0.25-, 0.375-, and 0.5-in. Conax valves with interference-fit\nr d s l e e v e systems that are intended to reduce blowby.\n\n1.3\n\nSERIES C: INTERFERENCE-FIT RAM EVALUATIONS\nEleven tests with a pyrovalve simulator evaluated a new interference-fit radsleeve\ndesign developed at WSTF. Four tests of the new design and seven tests of a baseline\nConax-type radsleeve design were conducted.\nThe goal of this testing was to develop a database that provides pyrovalve system\ndesigners information for minimizing blowby of hot pyrotechnic product gases into a fuel\nline and, thereby, minimize the attending risk of catastrophic fuel decomposition.\n\nNASA WHITE SANDS TEST FACILITY\nPYROVALVE BLOWBY TESTS\nSPECIAL TEST DATA REPORT\nWSTF # 03-37670\nNovember 26,2003\n\n2.0\n\nTEST DOCUMENTS\nL\n\nJSC Form 2035 (Appendix I) and WSTF Document No. TP-WSTF-854A\'\n3.0\n\nTEST SYSTEM DESCRIPTION\nj\n\n. .\n\n. ..\n\nTheWSTF Blowby Test System uses a high-speed data acquisition system, a gas\nchromatograph, and a mass spectrometer, residual gas analyzer (RGA). Typical\nmeasurements include pressures and temperatures above and below the ram,\naccelerometer signals from the valve body, initiator voltage and current readings, and a\nVISAR data signal. Figure 1 shows the test system and Figure 2 shows the pyrovalve\nsimulator components showing both single- and dual-port heads that were used.\nFigures 3 and 4 are schematics of the test system as modified and used for tests of Conax\nvalves at design temperature extremes in February 200 1.\n4.0\n\nTEST PROCEDURES\nFigure 5 shows a flow chart for pyrovalve blowby evaluation. Although not part of the\nactual blowby measurement process, pretest valve measurements are taken to allow\nposttest investigation of valve-to-valve performance variations. These measurements\ninclude the radsleeve clearance, ram starting position, and cylinder diameter.\nBrief descriptions of individual steps taken during testing are given here in sequence.\nThe steps necessary to assure personnel protection that do not affect data quality have\nbeen eliminated for purposes of clarity.\n\n1. Disassemble test article, measure dimensions, and clean parts to Class 100 condition.\nReassemble in Class 10,000 clean room, without O-rings for the worst-case condition.\n2. Place test article in test system and attach all connections for data measurement.\n1\n\nSaulsbeny, R., R. Moreland and K. Rathgeber.
