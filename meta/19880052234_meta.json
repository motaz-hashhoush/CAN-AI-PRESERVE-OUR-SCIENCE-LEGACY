Using the Ekman profile, the ability of the various models to reproduce the modes arising from the parallel and inflection point instability mechanisms was tested by comparing the results from the spectral models with the results from larger models used by other investigators. It was found that the truncated spectral models used in this investigation yielded preferred values of orientation angle and aspect ratio that agreed with those produced by the larger models, as well as with the observations data taken on September 1981 during the West-German KonTur experiment.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"volume": "45", "submissionId": 19880052234, "issn": "0022-4928", "id": "56ec34e1a5144628af6f2de1c35c613d", "publicationName": "Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences", "publicationDate": "1988-03-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
