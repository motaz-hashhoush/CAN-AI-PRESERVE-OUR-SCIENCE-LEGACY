The data are part of an investigation  into the design of a new prosthetic valve which will be a central-flow device, like the real valve and unlike previous central-occluding prostheses. Since the maximum stress on the heart valve is induced when the valve is closed and subject to diastolic back-pressure, it was  decided to determine the valve geometry during diastole. That is, the molds were formed by pouring the rubber down the excised aortas, causing the valves to close. The molds were made under different pressures (20-120 torr); photogrammetry served as a vehicle for the assessment of the mold topography through the following outputs: digital models, surface profiles, and contour maps.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19750052764, "endDate": "1975-03-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "American Society of Photogrammetry, Annual Meeting", "location": "Washington, DC", "id": "a8d204eab30e409bb961933a96260ec7", "startDate": "1975-03-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19750052764, "id": "652dcc9eade248d59773d9b4f9270caf", "publicationDate": "1975-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
