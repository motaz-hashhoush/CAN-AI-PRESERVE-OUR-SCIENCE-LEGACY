This innovation, currently in development, combines the capabilities of space simulation chambers, the user-friendliness of modern-day electronics, and the modularity of plug-and-play computing. The Mobile Chamber is a customized test chamber that can be deployed with great ease, and is capable of bringing payloads at temperatures down to 20 K, in high vacuum, and with the desired metrology instruments integrated to the systems control. Flexure plans to lease Mobile Chambers, making them affordable for smaller budgets and available to a larger customer base. A key feature of this design will be an Apple iPad-like user interface that allows someone with minimal training to control the environment inside the chamber, and to simulate the required extreme environments. The feedback of thermal, pressure, and other measurements is delivered in a 3D CAD model of the chamber's payload and support hardware. This GUI will provide the user with a better understanding of the payload than any existing thermal-vacuum system.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20120016280, "id": "7e18e94216e74a1a9c1b4745c2a7b80e", "publicationName": "NASA Tech Briefs, October 2012", "publicationDate": "2012-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20120016252, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "NASA Tech Briefs, October 2012", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20120016280.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20120016280/downloads/20120016280.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20120016280/downloads/20120016280.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20120016280/downloads/20120016280.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
