Mashkovich\'s book "Tested on Oneself". *\nit is a documentary book which in the popular-scientific genre\nrecounts the story of the difficult work of scientists, engineers,\ndoctors and re&_drchers. In other words, it tells of those who are\ncreating and testing complicated space technology and who are preparing for the flights of astronauts.\nThe journey into space begins on earth. The author invites\nthe reader to embark upon an unusual cosmic campaign. Many undoubtedly remember the graphic description of weightlessness by\nTsiolkovsky: "Anything which wasn\'t fastened to the rocket flew\nfrom its place and hung in the air without touching anything else;\nand if by chance they touched they would still exert no pressure\non each other or on the support. We too did not touch the floor\nand assumed any position or direction: we stood on the floor, on\nthe ceiling, or on the wall; we stood perpendicularly or inclined;\nwe floated in the middle of the spaceship like fish, but effortlessly,\nand touching nothing."\nBut still, why does man lose his orientation in space, why\ndoes he perceive neither an up nor a down? What is the cause of\nthis? To these and many other questions aviation medicine gives\nanswers. T. V. Mashkevich tells of the pioneers in this field of\nstudy, of academician L.A. Orbel, of professors V.V. Strel\'tsov\nand M.P. Brestkin. In the forefront of the field of space medicine,\none of the first scholars was a young military doctor, O.G. Gazenko,\nwho is now the director of the leading institute of medical and\nbiological problems of the Ministry of Health Sciences of the USSR,\nand a member of the USSR\'S Academy of Sciences.\nSciences\nIn recent years, under the direction of O.G. Gazenko, several\n\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _- - \' -_ _ _~~"__~_~~ .\n..J..~\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n~\n\n.......\n\n-it..J\n\n...... _,\n\n__\n\n__\xe2\x80\xa2_ _ __\ni \xe2\x80\xa2.\n\n_~"""-"-~-\'~--\xc2\xb7""\'\n\n~\n\nSb--\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n.

"Today" say Oleg Cc=org1yev1ch\n"the question of\nwhether or not man will ever land on Mars does not exist for me. I\nsimply do not see any reason why he can not be there.
