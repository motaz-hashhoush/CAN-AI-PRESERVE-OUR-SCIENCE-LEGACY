The ATLAS-2 flew on the Space Shuttle Discovery's mission SST-56, launched on April 8, 1993. The videotape consists of an animated tour of the instruments that were included as part of the mission. The first half of the tape shows the various instruments, pointing to each in turn and identifying each by the associated initialisms. The instruments identified were: the Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy (ATMOS), Millimeter Wave Atmospheric Sounder (MAS), Shuttle Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet/A (SSBUV/A) spectrometer, Solar Spectrum Measurement (SOLSPEC) instrument, Solar Ultraviolet Irradiance Monitor (SUSIM), Active Cavity Radiometer (ACR) and Solar Constant (SOLCON).) The second half of the animation shows the same tour without the pointing or the identification of the instruments.", "title": "Atlas 2 Animation", "stiType": "VIDEO", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-19T19:07:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Video", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2012-04-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20000063386, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20000063386, "id": "664cb007fb1e400ab7ab3be1082a28fa", "publicationDate": "1993-03-30T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
