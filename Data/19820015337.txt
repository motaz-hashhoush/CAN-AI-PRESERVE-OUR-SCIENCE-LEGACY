Morris\nTechnology\nManager, Commercial\nBoeing Vertol Company\nPhiladelphia,\nPennsylvania\n\nChinook\n\nhelicopter\nfrom Sumburgh to the Dunlin platform.\nThe 234\nhandling qualities and flight control systems have been designed\nto accommodate\nthis type of mission under IFR, VFR, day, and\nnight conditions.\nThis paper willdescribe\nthe 234 flight control system, the criteria which led to this system, and the\nresults of testing the aircraft.\n\nAbstract\nThe Boeing 234 is the commercially\ncertified\nderivative\nof the\nCH-47 Chinook.\nThe automatic\nflight control system and flight\ndirector with coupler have been designed to reduce pilot workload for missions of approximately\nsix hour duration\nduring\nVFR, IFR, day and night conditions.\nThe AFCS system for the\n234 is essentially the same system as developed for the CH-47D.\nwhich has airspeed hold, attitude hold, and maneuver enhancement in all three axes. The system also has the capability\nto\ncouple to the Sperry Helcis flight director system which provides for enroute navigation and landing approaches.\nCertification testing has been completed,\nby both the FAA and CAA, to\nFAR Part 29 for Transport\nCategory Rotorcraft\nand BCAR\nSection G: Rotorcraft.\nThe aircraft was certified\nfor civil\noperation\nin June 1981.\nIntroduction\nThe Boeing 234 is the commercial\nderivative\nof the CH-47\nChinook tandem rotor helicopter\nwhich has accumulated\nover\none and half million hours of flight.\nThe aircraft (as shown in\nFigure 1) is designed to carry 44 passengers for a distance of\n574 nautical miles with IFR fuel reserves at its maximum\ninternal load gross weight of 48,500 pounds.\nFAA and CAA\ncertification\nwas received in June of 1981. Revenue service\nwith the initial customer,\nBritish Airways Helicopters\n(BAH),\nbegan on July 1, 1981.\n\nFigure\n\nFlight\n\n2.\n\nControl\n\nTypical\n\nSystem\n\nOffshore\n\nOil Mission\n\nDevelopment\n\nCriteria\n\nDevelopment\nof the 234 flight control system encompassed\nthree considerations\nwhich had to be satisfied in order to\nachieve a satisfactory\nsystem for civil operation.\n\nFigure\n\n1. Boeing\n\n234 Heicop\n\nThe first consideration\nwas that the applicable civil regulations\nhad to be satisfied since it was a program requirement\nto be\ncertified\nby FAA and CAA. The relevant FAA documents\nwere\nFAR Part 29 and the interim I FR standards dated December 15,\n1978. The applicable\nCAA documents\nwere BCAR Section G:\nRotorcraft,\nand for IFR working papers, number 612 (Instrument Flight) and number 615 (Automatic\nFlight Control and\nStability\nAugmentation\nSystems).\nThese defined a minimum\nlevel of flight characteristics\nduring normal and degraded mode\noperations,\nthe criteria used to judge the system during certification flight testing, and a minimum\nlevel of reliability\nfor\nsystem operation.\nTable I summarizes\nthe pertinent\ncriteria (in\na general sense) to which the 234 was certified\nand shows that,\nfor the basic stability\nand controllability\ncriteria, the FAA and\nCAA requirements\nare very similar.\nFor AFCS failures, the\nCAA requirement\nis significantly\nmore stringent with a maximum time delay of five seconds compared to the FAA maximum of three seconds. With regard to what failures are to be\nevaluated, the FAA is more stringent with their 10mg probability\nof occurrence\ncompared to the CAA requirement\nof 10m7.\n\nter\n\nFigure 2 shows a typical offshore oil mission for the 234 in\nwhich advantage is taken of its range capability\nto go directly\nfrom Aberdeen, Scotland to the Dunlin oil platform.\nThis\nreplaces the previous practice of flying fixed wing from Aberdeen to Sumburgh\nin Shetland Islands, and then flying by\n\n15\n\nllllllllllllllllIIlII\nIIIII I\nII\n\nTABLE\n\nI.

On the CH-47C a Pitch\nStability\nAugmentation\nSystem (PSAS) was incorporated\nwhich\nadded the features of airspeed and pitch attitude feedback for\nimproved pitch stability.\nThe CH-47D and 234 are the current\nstep in the automatic\nflight control system (AFCS) development.\nAs shown on Table II, continuous\nairspeed and pitch attitude\nhold and stability\nhas been added; bank angle hold logic has\nbeen changed from a wings level hold to a capability\nto hold\nany bank angle; heading and altitude hold and maneuver enhancement\nin the pitch, roll, and yaw axes has been added.\nCross coupled feedbacks\nhave been added to the pitch, roll, and\nyaw extensible\nlinks for improved\nfailure characteristics.\nWith\nthis generation\nof the Chinook\nautomatic\nflight control system\na hands off capability\nhas been obtained.\n\nQUALITIES\nCERTIFICATION\nFOR VFR AND IFR FLIGHT\nCAA\n\nFAA\n\nThe rotorcraft\nshall be safely\ncontrollable\nand maneuverable\nMust be able to trim out steady\nforces\nNo undesirable dirontinuitier\nin control\n\nforce gradients\n\nStatic Longitudinal\nStabilitv\n\nMust demonstrate\nstatic longitudina, stability from hover\nthrough VNE\n\nMust demonstrate\nstatic longi.\ntudinal stability from hover\nthrough VNE\n\nstatic Lateral\nDdrectiona, Stability\n\nMust demonstrate\nstatic lateraldirectional\nstability throughout\nIF R envelope\n\nMust demonstrate\nlateral dirertiona, stability throughout\nIFR\nzelope\n\nDynamic\n\nMurt demonstrate\ndynamic\nstability characteristics\nStabihty level varies with\nfrequency of oscillation\n\nMust demonrtrate\ndynamic\nstability characteristics\nStability\nlevel varies with\nfrequency of oscillation\n\nMust demonrtrate\nfailures with\ntime delays varying from normaI\npilot reaction to 3 seconds,\ndepending on flight condition\n\nMust demonstrate\nfailures wiIh\ntime delays varying from 1.5\nseconds to 5 seconds. dependin!\non flight condition\xe2\x80\x99\n\nAFCS\n\nF\n\nStability\n\nFailures\n\nExtremely\n\nremote\n\nTABLE\n\nII.\n\nThe second consideration\nwas that two specific operational\nrequirements\nhad to be satisfied.\nThe first requirement\nwas\nto provide for an approximate\nsix hour flight over water\nduring IFR and VFR, day, and night conditions.\nThe second\nwas to be able to operate in adverse atmospheric\nconditions\nspecifically\ncross winds of up to 50 knots.\nThis criteria is\nespecially necessary for operation\nin the North Sea, where in\nwinter months it is not unusual to have winds UP to 50 knots.\n\nFLIGHT\n\nCAPABILITY\n\nCH.47B\nISAS)\n\nAl, Axes\n\n-\n\nAll Axes\n\nHold and Stability\n\nHold\n\nRoll Atlitude\n\nNO\n\nHold\n\nAny Sank\nAngle\n\nAny Bank\nAngle\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nContinuous\n\nContinuou\n\nNO\n\nNO\n\nNO\n\nAirspeed\n\nHold\n\nNO\n\nNO\n\nAbout\n\nAltitude\n\nHold\n\nNO\n\nNO\n\nNO\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYaw iTurn\nEntry Only)\n\nYaw (Turn\nEntry Only\n\nYaw (Turn\nEntry Only1\n\nPitch, Roll.\nand Yaw\n\nPitch, Roll\nand Yaw\n\nCross Coupled Feedbacl\nfor Improved Failure\nCharacteristics\n\nNO\n\nNO\n\nNO\n\nPitch, Roll.\nand Yaw\n\nPitch.

Slow Speed Controllability\nConclusions\n\nDevelopment\nof a flight control system for today\xe2\x80\x99s helicopters must consider the certification\ncriteria for the countries\nin which it is to be operated; diverse operational\ncriteria\nwhich include I FR, VFR, long duration\nmissions, and high\nwind conditions;\nand addition\nof pilot aids such as a flight\ndirector and coupler to minimize the overall niission workload. For the Boeing 234 these criteria and needs have resulted in an AFCS with airspeed and attitude\nhold and\nmaneuver enhancement\nand a flight director with a coupling\ncapability.\n\nATTITUOE\n\nFigure\n\n14.
