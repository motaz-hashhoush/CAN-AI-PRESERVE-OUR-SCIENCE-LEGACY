The emerging responsive systems demand fault-tolerant and real-time performance in parallel and distributed computing environments. The design methodologies for fault-tolerant, real time and responsive systems will be presented. Novel techniques of introducing redundancy for improved performance and dependability will be illustrated. The methods of system responsiveness evaluation will be proposed. The issues of determinism, closed and open systems will also be discussed from the perspective of responsive systems design.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"volume": "30", "submissionId": 19910048574, "issn": "0165-6074", "id": "1c8b612cd5ac4c4baa6aa81ec5b82154", "publicationName": "Microprocessing and Microprogramming", "publicationDate": "1990-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
