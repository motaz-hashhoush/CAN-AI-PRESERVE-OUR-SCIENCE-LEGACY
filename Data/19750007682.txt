For archival keeping these\nfilms should contain less than 5 micrograms of thiosulfate\nper square inch.\n\nClass II films are represented by medium grain (0.5 to 1.04\ngrain diameter),\n\nfor instance aerial film.\n\nArchival keeping\n\nrequires less than 20 micrograms of thiosulfate per square\ninch.\n\nFor internal purposes Eastman Kodak uses the term "commercial\nquality" and this refers to films with less than 100 micrograms of thiosulfate per square inch.\n\nThis is taken to mean\n\n5 to 15 years keeping.\n\nThe relationships discussed above are plotted in Figure 1.\nThis graph should not be considered as authoratative since\nit only attempts to show roughly how residual fixer content\nrelates to keeping quality.\n\n1000\n\nu , ,\',u1,\'\n\nI\n\nIIJ\n\n*\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n.\n\nI\n\nll\n\nTTTT\n\nI\'\n\nStain\nFormation\n\n100\nS\n\nI0\n\n10\n\n"\n\nNo Stain\nFormation\n\nUi\n\n1\n\nI\n\n@i o mit\n\nL\n\nU .11111\n\n1\n\na\n\nli\na\n\nti\n\n10\n100\n1000\nMicrograms S2 03 /square inch\n\nFIGURE 1.

A. Mattey & R. W. Henn, Photo, Science & Eng., 10, 202 (1966).\n\n4\n\ntime the test is made after processing has been shown not\nto be a variable for this test, as have the time intervals\nbetween steps.\n\nTreatment times in each of the chemicals\n\nmust meet a certain minimum but are otherwise non-critical.\n\nThe test sample is first immersed in silver nitrate-acetic\nacid solution.\n\nThe reference sample is immersed at the\n\nsame time.in a blank solution of acetic acid.\nand tank immersion are practical.\n\nBoth tray\n\nThe silver stain will\n\nappear quickly, within about 5 seconds, and the reaction\nwill go to completion in\n\n2 minutes.\n\nsamples is considered 2.5 minutes.\n\nMinimum time for all\nWe generally used\n\n5 minutes.\n\nIn the second step, each specimen is briefly dipped in\nwater (optional) and then put into sodium chloride for\n5 minutes.\n\nThe purpose of the sodium chloride is to pre-\n\ncipitate unreacted silver.\n\nReaction time is approximately\n\nthe same as for the silver nitrate solution, but a minimum\ntime of 5 minutes was observed for simplicity.\n\nAfter another optional water dip the samples were put into\na solution of sodium thiosulfate.\n\nThis third step \'should\n\nconvert all silver to a soluble complex.\n\n5\n\nStated minimum\n\ntime is 2\n\nminutes, and again a 5 minute minimum was observed\n\nfor convenience.\n\nThe third solution was followed by a 5 minute wash.\nsamples are then dipped in photo-flo and dried.\n\nThe\n\nTemperatures\n\nof these operations are not critical and solutions were at\nroom temperature.\n\nNothing is said about solution life or exhaustion and there\nare certain precautions to observe.\n\nSilver nitrate should\n\nbe kept in brown bottles and may be checked by pouring a\nfew drops into tap water or some sodium chloride solution.\nWhen a cloudy precipitate forms the solution is OK.\nchloride should last indefinitely.\n\nSodium\n\nThiosulfate will slowly\n\ndisproportionate and also become saturated with silver\nions.\n\nThus the optional dip in water to prevent too much\n\ncarry-over will help lengthen solution life.\n\nThe composition of each solution is as follows:\nSolution A (test)\nWater\n\n750.cc\n\nAcetic Acid (Glacial)\n\n30.0cc\n\nSilver Nitrate\n\n10.0gm\n1.0 liter\n\nWater to Make\n\n6\n\nSolution A (reference)\n\nWater\n\n970\n\ncc\n\n30\n\ncc\n\nAcetic Acid\n\nSolution B\n\nWater\n\n750.0cc\n\nSodium Chloride\n\n45.0gm\n\nWater to Make\n\n1.0 liter\n\nSolution C\n\nWater\n\n750.
