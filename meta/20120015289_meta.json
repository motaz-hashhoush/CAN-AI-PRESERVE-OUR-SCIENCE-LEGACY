Using both imaging and radiometric techniques, several satellite missions presently study solar dynamics in the EUV, including the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), Hinode, and the Solar-Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO). The EUV wavelengths of interest typically span 9 nm to 31 nm, with the shorter wavelengths being associated with the hottest features (e.g., intense flares and bright points) and the longer wavelengths associated with cooler features (e.g., coronal holes and filaments). Because the optical components of satellite instruments degrade over time, it is not uncommon to conduct sounding rocket underflights for calibration purposes. The authors have designed a radiometric sounding rocket payload that could serve as both a calibration underflight for and a complementary scientific mission to the upcoming Solar Ultraviolet Imager (SUVI) mission aboard the GOES-R satellite (scheduled for a 2015 launch). The challenge to provide quality radiometric line spectra over the 9-31 nm range covered by SUVI was driven by the multilayer coatings required to make the optical components, including mirrors and gratings, reflective over the entire range. Typically, these multilayers provide useful EUV reflectances over bandwidths of a few nm. Our solution to this problem was to employ a three-telescope system in which the optical components were coated with multilayers that spanned three wavelength ranges to cover the three pairs of SUVI bands. The complete system was designed to fit within the Black Brandt-IX 22.-diameter payload skin envelope. The basic optical path is that of a simple parabolic telescope in which EUV light is focused onto a slit and shutter assembly and imaged onto a normal-incidence diffraction grating, which then disperses the light onto a 2048 2048 CCD sensor. The CCD thus records 1D spatial information along one axis and spectral information along the other. The slit spans 40 arc-minutes in length, thus covering a solar diameter out to +/- 1.3 solar radii. Our operations concept includes imaging at three distinct positions: the north-south meridian, the northeast-southwest diagonal, and real-time pointing at an active region. Six 10-second images will be obtained at each position. Fine pointing is provided by the SPARCS-VII attitude control system typically employed on Black Brandt solar missions. Both before and after launch, all three telescopes will be calibrated with the EUV line emission source and monochromater system at NASA's Stray Light Facility at Marshall Spaceflight Center. Details of the payload design, operations concept, and data application will be presented.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20120015289, "endDate": "2012-06-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "National Science Foundation", "location": "Arlington, VA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "580f220a82984b24afb6d7164b69ecf2", "id": "cf38d3eab91f42ca9286dc4b7878a56f"}], "name": "Solar Heliospheric and Interplanetary Environment (SHINE) 2012", "location": "Maui, HI", "id": "580f220a82984b24afb6d7164b69ecf2", "startDate": "2012-06-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20120015289, "id": "a696d31b8ce24cf2a35123393f8b8424", "publicationDate": "2012-06-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20120015289.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20120015289/downloads/20120015289.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20120015289/downloads/20120015289.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20120015289/downloads/20120015289.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
