The first goal of the project is to establish a permanent manned base on the Moon for the purposes of scientific research and technological development. The knowledge gained from the establishment and operations of the lunar base will then be used to achieve the second goal of Project Artemis, the establishment of a manned base on the Martian surface. Throughout both phases of the program, crew safety will be the number one priority. There are four main issues that have governed the entire program: crew safety and mission success, commonality, growth potential, and costing and scheduling. These issues are discussed in more detail.", "title": "Project Artemis", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T14:15:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19910008828, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Birchenough, Shawn"}, "organization": {"name": "Massachusetts Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Cambridge, MA, United States"}}, "id": "f4944d14d762461eb0f26dde962ecbe5"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19910008828, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Kato, Denise"}, "organization": {"name": "Massachusetts Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Cambridge, MA, United States"}}, "id": "900500a8602e4391bfbd7b1052d875c5"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19910008828, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Kennedy, Fred"}, "organization": {"name": "Massachusetts Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Cambridge, MA, United States"}}, "id": "db2073a5305d4da6826e68bbc50acddf"}, {"sequence": 3, "submissionId": 19910008828, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Akin, David"}, "organization": {"name": "Massachusetts Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Cambridge, MA, United States"}}, "id": "e81a0f327f9a44539b7324b84ddc6f90"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19910008828, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19910008828, "id": "025a43aca1944ea98079f0480bbe9b6c", "publicationName": "USRA, Proceedings of the 6th Annual Summer Conference: NASA(USRA University Advanced Design Program", "publicationDate": "1990-11-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19910008828.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19910008828/downloads/19910008828.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19910008828/downloads/19910008828.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19910008828/downloads/19910008828.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
