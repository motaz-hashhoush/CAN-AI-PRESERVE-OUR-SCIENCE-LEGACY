b'Eye Surgery Light During eye surgery, the surgeon\nuses an illuminating instrument called an opthalmoscope for close examination of the retina or\nthe interior of the eye. Ordinarily, electric power\nfor the head-mounted light is supplied through a\ncord from an overhead swivel arm or a floor\npedestal. Within limits of cord length and swivel\narm movement, the surgeon has considerable\nfreedom of motion. But when more than one\nopthalmoscope is involved, tangling and interference of the power cords becomes a problem.\nSt. Luke\'s Hospital, Cleveland, Ohio asked\nLewis Research Center for assistance in finding\na solution. Lewis responded with a batterypowered system that totally frees the surgeon of\nattached cords and swivels.\nBorrowing from space technology, Lewis\nused small, lightweight nickel-cadmium batteries\nthat can deliver high intensity light for an hour\nand can be recharged overnight. The Opthalmoscope Powerpack consists of eight batteries in\nthree containers affixed to a webbed belt, and a\nnovel on-off switch equipped with a springloaded plexiglass "flapper." The belt pack is\nworn underneath the surgical gown and the\nflapper permits the doctor to activate the switch\nby elbow pressure (upper photo).\nLewis built five units and they have been in\nservice at St. Luke\'s Hospital for a year. Used\nfor routine examinations as well as for surgery,\nthey have demonstrated excellent reliability.\n\n'
