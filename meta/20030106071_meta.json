SLI, part of NASA's Integrated Space Transportation Plan (ISTP), was restructured in November 2002 to focus the overall theme of safer, more affordable space transportation along two paths the Orbital Space Plane (OSP) and the Next Generation Launch Technology programs. The Orbital Space Plane program has the goal of providing rescue capability from the International Space Station by 2008 or earlier and transfer capability for crew (and contingency cargo) by 2012. The Next Generation Launch Technology program is combining research and development efforts from the 2d Generation Reusable Launch Vehicle (2GRLV) program with cutting-edge, advanced space transportation programs (previously designated 31d Generation) into one program aimed at enabling safe, reliable, cost-effective reusable launch systems by the middle of the next decade. Lockheed Martin is one of three prime contractors working to bring Orbital Space Plane system concepts to a system design level of maturity by December 2003. This paper and presentation will update the aerospace community on the progress of the OSP program, from an industry perspective, and provide insights into Lockheed Martin's role in enabling the vision of a safer, more affordable means of taking people to and from space.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20030106071, "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics"}}, "meetingId": "7feba3ff43d44958b949c8a0c1d8feb3", "id": "b642e8b6cb604a67b570271d2bb231db"}], "name": "Space 2003", "location": "Long Beach, CA", "id": "7feba3ff43d44958b949c8a0c1d8feb3", "startDate": "2003-09-24T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20030106071, "id": "7c68bda7d48b4c578f33b6382199e855", "publicationDate": "2003-09-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20030106071.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20030106071/downloads/20030106071.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20030106071/downloads/20030106071.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20030106071/downloads/20030106071.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
