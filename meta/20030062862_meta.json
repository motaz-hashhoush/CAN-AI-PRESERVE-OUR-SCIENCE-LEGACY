A key example is carbon nanotubes (CNTs) which exhibit unique electrical and extraordinary mechanical properties and offer remarkable potential for revolutionary applications in electronics devices, computing, and data storage technology, sensors, composites, nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS), and as tip in scanning probe microscopy (SPM) for imaging and nanolithography. Thus the CNT synthesis, characterization, and applications touch upon all disciplines of science and engineering. This presentation will provide an overview and progress report on this and other major research candidates in Nanotechnology and address opportunities and challenges ahead.", "title": "Nanotechnology: Opportunities and Challenges", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-21T04:33:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20030062862, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Meyyappan, Meyya"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Ames Research Center", "location": "Moffett Field, CA, United States"}}, "id": "b16ce49461c04135b0fb0c66b9000e9a"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-04-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20030062862, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20030062862, "id": "f6f7318e1a704769833ce7a97139617c", "publicationName": "National Educators' Workshop: Update 2002 - Standard Experiments in Engineering, Materials Science, and Technology", "publicationDate": "2003-05-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20030062842, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "National Educators' Workshop: Update 2002 - Standard Experiments in Engineering, Materials Science, and Technology", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20030062862.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20030062862/downloads/20030062862.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20030062862/downloads/20030062862.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20030062862/downloads/20030062862.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
