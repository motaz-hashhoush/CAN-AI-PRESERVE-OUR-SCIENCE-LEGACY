This form of rocket propulsion uses a laser beam from a remotely-located laser to heat a propellant gas, which is then expanded in a conventional way to produce thrust. This propulsion scheme has the potential for producing high specific impulse (greater than 1000 s) at moderate to high thrust (1000 lbs). Laser propulsion can thus fill a niche in propulsion for spaceflight missions which can be filled by no other practical scheme. The system analyses and some of the experimental and theoretical studies which have been performed are briefly reviewed. Production of thrust by a pulsed laser has been demonstrated on a laboratory scale at an Isp of 1000 s in hydrogen. While more work is needed, it seems apparent that laser propulsion has an important and unique capability which should be pursued, and should be considered for space missions in the 1990's and beyond.", "title": "Laser propulsion", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T02:55:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19840054192, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Kemp, N.
