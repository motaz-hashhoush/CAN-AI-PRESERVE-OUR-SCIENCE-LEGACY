The goal of this research was to develop models to predict the probability of crew injuries. The initial velocity conditions for the X-38 with chute deployed were 10 ft/s vertical and 57 ft/s longitudinal velocity. An MSC/NASTRAN structural model was supplied by JSC and was converted to a dynamic MSC/DYTRAN model. The MSC/NASTRAN model did not include seats or floor structure; thus, the acceleration of a lumped-mass attached to the bulkhead near each assumed occupant location was used to determine injury risk for each occupant. The worst case for injury was nondeployment of all gears. The mildest case was nondeployment of one main gear. Although a probability for minor injury was predicted for all cases, it is expected that the addition of energy-absorbing floor structure and seats would greatly diminish the probability of injury.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20000032581, "id": "f2cd6db3924249c4a9223f36b1dbe93b", "publicationDate": "2000-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20000032581.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20000032581/downloads/20000032581.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20000032581/downloads/20000032581.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20000032581/downloads/20000032581.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
