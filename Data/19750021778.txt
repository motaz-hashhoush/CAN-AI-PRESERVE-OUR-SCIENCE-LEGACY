b'DECENTRALIZED REGULATION OF DYNAMIC SYSTEMS\nKai-ching Chu\nIBM Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, New York 10598\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIn classical control and decision-making problems, the system is handled in a centralized\nfashion, namely, there is a single supervisor who handles all the information processing and decision\nmaking for the entire system. The decisions of control policies and their implementation are all\nmade according to the preference of this central supervisor.\nBy contrast, when a large-scale system is considered, such as those arising from the studies of\nsocio-economic problems and electrical power systems, information processing and control policy\ndecision are delegated to a set of agents. Generally, these agents have different information, different permissible control notices, and different preference orderings. These agents may act in complete independence; some may coordinate or supervise the actions of others and hence they form a\ncertain hierarchical decision structure in the system. The behavior of the entire system will result\nfrom the interaction of all the decisions by these agents. Such an environment is called here decentralization decision making.\nThis paper deals with a special class of decentralized control problem in which the objectives\nof the agents are to steer the state of the system to certain desirable levels. Such a problem is\ncalled the decentralized regulation problem. Each agent is concerned about certain aspects of the\nstate of the entire system. The following defines notation:\n\nState:\n\nxT = (x l T, x2 T, . . . , x n T )\nT\n\nT\n\nT\n\nT\n\nControl: u 1 = (u t l , u 2 l , . . . , u n \' )\n\nx^R\nut<ER\n\nl\n\nWli\nl\n\n.\n\nThe state variables are affected by the individual controls by the following differential equations: .\n\n(1)\n\nx n =f n (x,u) .\nThe objective of agent i is to use control w?- to affect the system so that state Xj can approach a certain desirable level as time /-*\xe2\x80\xa2\xc2\xab>. Without losing generality, we can assume that such desirable\nlevels are zero for all agents.\n\n131\n\nThe information available to agent i at any time is assumed to be a mapping of the present\nstate x to his data space, that is, for the /th agent information:\ny^h^x),\n\nhi:7f.Rnf^RPi.\n\n(2)\n\nControl strategy is assumed to be of a feedback form from information y^ to MZ-, that is,\nControl: u t = 7 / [/2 / (x)],\n\nfi:RPi^Rm(\n\n(3)\n\nThe mapping 7: above is chosen from the permissible set of functions iy Two sets of questions arise from the above function:\n(1 ) Stabilization: Given the structure (ff, hj, P,-), is it feasible to find J72-| such that Xj -*\xe2\x80\xa2 0 as\n/ ->\xe2\x80\xa2 \xc2\xb0\xc2\xb0 for all /\'? If it is not feasible, what kind of structure modification will enable us to make it\nfeasible?\n(2) Optimization: When it is feasible to regulate all the states, x^ -*\xe2\x80\xa2 0 as t -*\xe2\x80\xa2 \xc2\xb0\xc2\xb0, what will be\nthe optimal {7^} to achieve such goals with respect to certain performance criteria? What is the\nimpact of various information structures to the performance of regulation?\nTo be more specific, we shall limit ourselves to linear time-invariant systems:\n\nn\nx = A x + ^2 8\n\n(1)\'\n\nwhere\nxT=(xJ,...,xJ)\n\n(2)\'\n\nand\n"/ = Fpi\n\n(3)\'\n\nwhere Fj is a constant real matrix of appropriate dimension.\nSTABILITY AND COORDINATION\nAgent / applies control iij = FjZj to regulate the state x;- so that its desirable level Xj = 0 will be\nachieved and maintained. Because the actions by all agents are coupled, the ability of agent / to\nregulate state Xj depends on the actions of the other agent. On the other hand, a control Uj of\n\n132\n\nagent / supposedly to decrease the deviation of Xj from zero may affect the other system statevariables Xf. This paper discusses the interactions of these individual regulation actions.\nIndividual Stability\nSystem state variable Xf is said to be individually stable with feedback control gain Ff if agent /\napplies the control Uf =FfXf and all other agents take no actions (F,- = 0 Vj ^ i) and t -> \xc2\xb0\xc2\xb0 implies\nXj -+ 0. The collection of all such Ff is denoted by Sj.\nCollective Stability\nSystem state variable x is said to be collectively stable with feedback control gains (Ff, . . . , Fn)\nif, for all /, agent / applies control Uj = F^y^ and t -\xc2\xbb\xe2\x80\xa2 oo implies Xf -\xc2\xbb\xe2\x80\xa2 0 for all /. The collection of all\nsuch (FfX . . . , xFn) is denoted by Sc.\nThe following two observations can be made:\n(1) Fj E Sj V i does not imply (FjX . . . xFn) \xe2\x82\xacE Sc\n(2) Ff \xc2\xa3 Sf Vi does not imply (F-x . . . xFn) \xc2\xa3 Sc.\nThese two facts are easily demonstrated by the following scalar example:\n\nXj = -xl + ax2 + Ui + w2\nx-2 = \xe2\x80\x94x2 + a x l + \xc2\xab! + \xc2\xab2Both ul and \xc2\xab2 influence x t and x2 \xe2\x80\xa2 Agent 1 has access only to information x j and agent 2 has\naccess only to information x 2 , that is, UY =f i x l and w 2 = f 2 x 2 . For collective stability, the\nexample requires that/i +/2 < 1 -a. For individual stability, it requires that/, < 1 -a and\n/2 < 1 - a. Set S { ,S 2 , and Sc are illustrated in figure 1 (a) and (b). When -1 < a < 1, S1, X S2 <\xc2\xa3SC\nand when 1 < a, Sl X 52 C S\xc2\xa3. For -1 < a < 1, when both agents use their Ff C Sj purposely to\nregulate their state, it is possible that none of them will achieve that goal. For 1 <a, any individual\naction Fj C 5" will guarantee the results Xf -> 0 as t ->\xe2\x80\xa2 \xc2\xb0\xc2\xb0 for / = 1 and 2. For 1< a, it may also be\ninteresting to note that it is possible to have Fj \xc2\xa3 Sj for both / = 1 and 2 while xl j2 -> 0 as t -\xc2\xbb\xe2\x80\xa2 \xc2\xb0\xc2\xb0.\nIf Fj C Sf for all / implies (FjX . . . xFn) C Sc, the system is called coordinated. In a coordinated system, each agent need only to assess his stability regime Sj. If each of them pick an Fj C Sj,\neveryone will achieve Xj -*\xe2\x80\xa2 0.\nA noncoordinated system can be made coordinated by imposing constraints on the permissible\ncontrol policies each agent can use. Such constraints should be imposed by a certain central\ncoordinator (planner). For instance, in the example given above, when -1 <a < 1, if both agents\nare first forbidden to pick a feedback gain ~> (1 ~a)/2, the system becomes coordinated.\n\n133\n\nThe concept of coordination in a system is important. In a coordinated system, agents have \xe2\x80\xa2\ngreater degree of autonomy. Both the decision of his control policy and implementation of such\ncontrol can be done by total decentralization. In a noncoordinated system, the solution of all control policies for each agent may require the help of a central coordinator, which may involve very\ndifficult computation. Substituting u^ - F^y^ and y^ = H^x into x \xe2\x80\x94 Ax - "LB-u^ it becomes\nx=(A+I.B i F j H i )x\n\n(4)\n\nObviously, the condition for collective stability is that all eigenvalues of A + 25^/7^ have negative\nreal parts.\nA more basic question to ask is that, for given structure matrices (Aj, Bf, HJ), is it ever possible\nto find matrices (F t , . . . , Fn) that stabilize the system? Fisher and Fuller (ref. 1), McFadden\n(refs. 2, 3), and Aoki (ref. 4) have all tried to answer this stabilizability problem in certain aspects.\nThe general stabilizability problem for system equation (4) has been solved recently by Wang and\nDavison (ref. 5). The problem of finding conditions on (Aj, Bj, Hj, Fj) such that the system is\ncoordinated, controlled by agents and can fully be decentralized is still open.\nOPTIMIZATION OF DECENTRALIZED CONTROL\n\nWhen the system can be stabilized collectively, we would like to consider how to optimize the\nchoice of (F1 , . . . , Fn). Costs are associated with the deviation of the states from their desirable\nvalues and the magnitudes of the control "forces." The objective of the central coordinator\n(planner) is to choose (Fl , . . . , Fn) to minimize these costs. Suppose that the costs are described\nby the following quadratic loss function:\n\nwhere Q > 0 and R; > 0 V i. Since\nx = Dx\n\nwhere\nD = A + ^BiFiHi\n\n(6)\n\nx=eDtx0\n\n(7)\n\nwe have\n\nwhere x0 is the state deviation at t \xe2\x80\x94 0. Then\n\n134\n\n-\n\ntrace fr"" ^\'(p\n\n+L H F R f J\n+ LH^F^RffJ^1 dt xx 0 M .\ndt xox\n\n(8)\n\nIt can be shown that, if D is stable, / can be expressed as (ref. 6)\nJ = ^ trace (Kx0x0T)\n\n(9)\n\nwhere\nKD + DTK +Q + \xe2\x80\xa2LHiTFiTRiFfli = 0 .\n\n(10)\n\nSince D is linear in \\Fj\\, K solved by equation (10) is a rational function of \\Fj\\. The determination of optimal (F\\ falls in the framework of classical nonlinear programming.\nIt can be shown (ref. 7) that the gradient at the optimal choice of \\F^ must satisfy\n\no = ~r - RffliLHT + BJK.LH? \xe2\x80\xa2, i= \\ , . . . , n\n\n(1 1 )\n\nwhere\nLD T + D L + x 0 x 0 T = Q .\n\n(12)\n\nThe necessary condition of optimality (eqs. (10)\xe2\x80\x94 (12)) is given here as the generalization of the\nsingle-agent output optimization problems studied by Levine and Athans (ref. 8). Note that sometimes the initial value xo is not known exactly. The product XQXO in equations (9) and (12) should\nbe replaced by its expected value. Furthermore, if we wish to find the optimal iFj\\ independent of\nthe initial states, we could use an approach by assuming that the initial state is random and distributed uniformly in a sphere, namely, the expected value ofx o x o \' is expressed as an identity matrix.\nWhat is expressed in equations (10), (1 1), and (12) is the necessary condition of optimal\nit is entirely possible to have more than one solution to such conditions. In any case, the determination of optimal JF^ involves many structure parameters and we cannot possibly expect elegant\nsolutions unless the system is of very low dimension or of high dimension with nice structures (e.g.,\nin symmetry or repetition).\nSince in practice only a high-dimension system justifies decentralized control, we should\nexamine in the sequel some examples of high-dimension decentralized problems where the system\nis nicely structured. With such a system, we will be able to derive some results and to understand\nthe relations between structure and control system behavior in more explicit terms.\n\n135\n\nSPECIAL LARGE-SCALE SYSTEMS\n\nSequential Systems (ref. 9)\nThe system can be decomposed into a sequence of subsystems, all identical in structure (see\nfig. 2JL The interactions among subsystems depends only on the distance, that is, the difference in\nthe subsystem indices.- .\n.- v\n\xc2\xbb\n\n"*\n\nt\n\nSubsystem i: state Xj and control u^\nx\n\n\xe2\x80\x94 ( . . . , Xj_\\, Xj , X j + j , . . . )\n\n(13)\n\n(14)\n\nyf= Li Hi-*,- .\nj\nill\n\n(15)\n\nFor simplicity, the number of subsystems in the string is assumed to be infinite so that there are no\nends in the string and the roles of all subsystems are identical. If a system comprises a large but\nfinite number of subsystems, it can be treated as if the number were infinite by assuming fictitious\nsubsystems at both ends of the string.\nSince all subsystems are identical, the feedback gains used in each control can also be assumed\nidentical, that is,\nUj = Fyj for all /\n\n(16)\n\nBilateral transformations can be used to convert the sequential subsystems into a lumped system in\nthe z domain:\n\n>X(z) = * ? -\n\n(17)\n\n| M ./J4[/ ( Z )= E^-\'\'\n\n(18)\n\netc.\n\nOptimal conditions of F can be obtained by converting equations (9), (10), (11), and (12) into\nappropriate counterparts involving a z transformation (ref. 9).\n\n136\n\nLarge-Scale Systems in Arrays\nThis configuration is illustrated in figure 3. It is similar to the sequential system in the previous\nsection, except that the subsystems are distributed in two-dimensional arrays. If the structures and\ninteractions of all subsystems are all identical subject only to index translation, double bilateral\n^-transformation techniques can be used to solve the optimization problem. Such models could\nrepresent situations of street traffic control, huge electric network control, etc.\nRegulation of Vehicular Strings (ref. 10)\xe2\x80\x94 A string of high-speed, densely packed vehicles are\nmoving along a certain guideway. It is desirable to keep the spacings and velocities of all vehicles\nin the string as close as possible to certain predetermined values (see fig. 4). The position deviation\nof the &th vehicle from its predetermined reference is denoted by xk. The dynamics of the fcth\nvehicle can be described by the second-order, normalized differential equation:\nx k + ax k = u k ;\n\n- < \xc2\xbb < & < oo.\n\n(19)\n\nThe total information data for the kth vehicle is denoted by a vector yk given by\n\n;\n\n- oo < k < oo .\n\n(20)\n\nThe structure of equation (20) includes the following special cases:\n...\n(0 yk T = , k _\\,x\n(x\n\n(ii) y k T = (xk, x k ]\n(iii)\n\nyJ--\n\n(V) ykT\n\n= (Xj, Xj I - oo < / < oo) .\n\nThe linear feedback control used by each vehicle is of the same form:\nuk=Fyk ;\n\n-\xc2\xab><\xc2\xa3<\xc2\xab>.\n\n(21)\n\nThe regulation cost is assumed to be of the following form where the magnitude of the control\nforces and relative vehicle position errors are penalized.\n-\n\n(22)\n\n137\n\nResults\xe2\x80\x94 If a = 1, q = 10, and the information is given as\nT*\n\n) \xe2\x80\xa2\n\n(23)\n\nThe optimal control for each vehicle is\n\nwhere\n/o =-4.06 , /, -1.43 ,\n\ngo\n\n= 1.94 , g, = 0.52 .\n\n(24)\n\nThe associated minimal cost is\ny* = 7.59.\n\n(25)\n\nFigure 5 represents the stability region as well as the sensitivity of/ to various choices of feedback\ngains. Figure 6 shows the behavior of a string of 10 vehicles when the optimal control scheme is\napplied. The position of each vehicle is plotted relative to a coordinate system moving with the\ndesired velocity. At t \xe2\x80\x94 0, all vehicles are subject to random perturbations in position and velocity.\nAlso, vehicle 5 is constantly driven with a sinusoidal disturbance force. For comparison, figure 7\nshows the response of the 1 0 vehicles when the controllers chosen are too sensitive to the motion of\nthe neighboring vehicles \xe2\x80\x94 the result is a chain collision.\nINFORMATION STRUCTURE DESIGN\n\nStructure Design versus Stabilizability\nThe problem of Stabilizability for a given structure (A, Bj, Hj) was discussed under Stability\nand Coordination. A more basic problem is how the information structures Hj influence the Stabilizability. In other words, if a system cannot be stabilized initially by the imposed decentralized\nscheme, what kind of change in information structure can induce Stabilizability?\nExample\xe2\x80\x94 In the vehicular string regulation problem presented earlier, it can be shown that, if\nthe information of vehicle k\'s state xk is available to him, the system can be made stable by appropriate choice of the feedback gains. If the information available to the controllers is only velocity\ndata with no position data, the entire system can never be stabilized by any choice of feedback\ngains.\nExample \xe2\x80\x94 Assignment Problem (ref. 3)^ In a special decentralized regulation problem,\nx = ZBU \xe2\x80\xa2\n\n(26)\n\nIf control agent / knows only about the /th component of x, the feedback will be of the following\nform:\n138\n\n(27)\nhence\nFl\n\n0\n\n,B n ]\n\n(28)\n0\n\n\'-. F.\n\nA nonstabilizable system could possibly be stabilized by permiting the information available to each\nagent. It has been shown that if the matrix [B l , B^ , . . . , Bn] is nonsingular, it is always possible to\nstabilize the system of equation (28) by an appropriate permutation of the information structure,\nthat is.\n\nwhere P is a permutation matrix (refs. 3, 11).\n\nStructure versus Regulation Performance\nAs expressed in equation (5), the regulation performance of the entire system is given by a\ncertain cost function J. When the regulation is feasible (stabilizable), it is interesting to ask how\neach piece of information contributes to the optimization of/. A useful concept of the value of\ninformation can be defined. Simply speaking, the value of information can be visualized as the\ndifference between the optimal J* with the given information and the optimal J* obtained without\nthat particular information.\nReconsider the vehicular string regulation problem. A list of certain information structures\nwith the optimal J* of each is given below (see also fig. 8).\nInformation available to the kth vehicle\n\nOptimal\nJ*\n\nCase A: x k _ { ,x k ,x k + l , xk.{, x k ,x k + }\n\n7.59\n\nCase B:\n\nx^_\\,x^, xk+ j\n\nCase C:\n\nx^, x^\n\nCase D:\n\nx^\n\nCase E:\n\n|0l (nothing)\n\nCase F:\n\njx.-, x- I - oo < / < oo J.\n\n11.30\n\n8.13\n11.81\noo\n\n7.54\n\n139\n\nIf each vehicle is provided with its own state information xk, -7?\xe2\x84\xa2 is 1 1 .8 1 . The following are\nvalues of certain added pieces of information for the kfh vehicle:\n(i) xk\n\n3.68\n\nJ*(D)-J*(O\n\n(ii) x^ andx k + l\n\n.50\n\nJ*(D)-J*(f)\n\n(iii) *A>1>*A:+1\'*A>1\'*A:+1\n\n.54\n\nJ*(C)-J*(A)\n\n(iv) x k _i andx\xc2\xa3 + 1\n\n.03\n\n7*(iii)-/*(ii)\n\n(v) jxy, Xj I for all I / - k \\ > 2 }\n\n.05\n\nJ*(A)-J*(F).\n\nFor regulating this vehicular system, the controller\'s own velocity data xk is much more\nimportant than the data x k _\\ and x k + \\. Moreover, the remote input data {*,\xe2\x80\xa2, Xi for \\j \xe2\x80\x94 k I > 2Jdo not significantly add to the optimization of the regulation performance. If trie structure in\ncase A is adopted, despite the fact that much less information is required than for case F, the performance index value is very close to the ultimate minimum.\nIn real implementation of various control schemes, it is important to consider the cost of\ninstalling various measurement and control mechanisms and the feasibility of establishing various\nlinks for data and controls. The concept of information value discussed here provides a quantitative\nmethod for measuring and comparing the relative merits of different information structures and\nhence the usefulness of the different information provided.\n\n140\n\nREFERENCES\n1.
