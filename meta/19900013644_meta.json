A continuous spectrum of intent-latency modes of the subject's coordinated gaze through verbal feedback could be demonstrated. It was also demonstrated that the intent to counteract any perturbation of head-eye movement, i.e., the mental set, permitted the subjects to manipulate consciously their vestibular ocular reflex (VOR) gain. From the data, it is inferred that the VOR is always on. It may be, however, variably suppressed by higher cortical control. With appropriate training, head-mounted displays should permit an easy VOR presetting that leads to image stabilization, perhaps together with a decrease of possible misjudgements.", "title": "Voluntary presetting of the vestibular ocular reflex permits gaze stabilization despite perturbation of fast head movements", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T15:18:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19900013644, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Zangemeister, Wolfgang H."}, "organization": {"name": "Hamburg Univ."}}, "id": "0c8be43aea77412b98806048ec9571b1"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19900013644, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19900013644, "id": "ac9a9066bb474a198bf0396ae248f393", "publicationName": "NASA, Ames Research Center, Spatial Displays and Spatial Instruments", "publicationDate": "1989-07-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19900013644.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19900013644/downloads/19900013644.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19900013644/downloads/19900013644.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19900013644/downloads/19900013644.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
