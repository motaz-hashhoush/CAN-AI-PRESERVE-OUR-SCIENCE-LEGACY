This work has culminated in the manufacturing and commercialization by Barringer of the Ionscan 350 instruments, now in use by various law enforcement agencies worldwide. Although IMS exhibits a very strong and distinctive response toward some nitrogen containing drugs, e.g., cocaine, like all separation techniques it has inherent limitations, namely moderate resolution and low chemical signal to noise ratio which may affect the reliability of IMS-based drug detectors. A program is in place at the Laboratory and Scientific Services Directorate (LSSD) to investigate the applicability of various digital signal processing (DSP) techniques to IMS output signals. The application of neural network techniques to overlapping IMS peaks is presented.", "title": "IMS R and D program at Canada customs", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T23:29:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19950026852, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Pilon, Pierre"}, "organization": {"name": "Revenue Canada", "location": "Ottawa Ontario, Canada"}}, "id": "65870867486d49a0ac9ff761a1630bbb"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19950026852, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Mungham, Tony"}, "organization": {"name": "Revenue Canada", "location": "Ottawa Ontario, Canada"}}, "id": "8cd722d23fcb4354af3b39e971b7bb4c"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19950026852, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Ng, Lay-Keow"}, "organization": {"name": "Revenue Canada", "location": "Ottawa Ontario, Canada"}}, "id": "8bd4172f8f54486387c2c79f8160f659"}, {"sequence": 3, "submissionId": 19950026852, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Lawrence, Andre"}, "organization": {"name": "Revenue Canada", "location": "Ottawa Ontario, Canada"}}, "id": "a6ae41ac15004320a164e68407394a72"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19950026852, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19950026852, "id": "97f9a7efbaef490e957fdda4a492719f", "publicationName": "NASA.
