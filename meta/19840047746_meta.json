This dedicated VLBI system consists of 4 one meter antennas for each TDRS positioned on orthogonal 6000 km baselines and uses a GPS signal for clock synchronization and calibration of measurement error sources. The performance of the VLBI system is compared with the current BRT system for support of TDRSS navigation. The criteria for evaluating the system performance is the TDRSS OD accuracy and the resulting navigation accuracy for two typical TDRSS users represented by a TOPEX type orbit and a Space Shuttle orbit. Based on the anticipated characteristics of a 1990 era VLBI system a factor of 20 improvement can be expected in the TDRSS OD accuracy. This translates into accuracy improvements ranging from factors of 3 to 10 for typical TDRSS users.", "title": "Performance of a dedicated VLBI system for TDRSS navigation", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T02:31:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19840047746, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Ellis, J."}, "organization": {"name": "California Institute of Technology, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Navigation System Section, Pasadena", "location": "CA, United States"}}, "id": "f5fe3e4f52ed497bb68b534c89345235"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19840047746, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19840047746, "id": "6cf7e2f9d4644b6ebf070da91cd28e8a", "publicationDate": "1984-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
