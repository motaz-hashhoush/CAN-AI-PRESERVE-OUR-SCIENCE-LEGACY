b'Tech House The members of the Swain familyDr. Charles "Bill" Swain, wife Elaine, daughter Carol, 17, son "Chuck", 12, and dog Susie\n-have an interesting assignment. They are\nactive participants in an important NASA\nresearch program involving the application of\n\'\nspace-age technology to home construction. b\nTransplanted Floridians, the Swains now reside in NASA\'s Tech House, l o ~ a t e d Langley\nat\nResearch Center, Hampton, Virginia. Their job is\nto use and help evaluate the variety of advanced technology systems in Tech House. A\ncontemporary three-bedroom home, Tech\nHouse incorporates NASA technology, the latest\ncommercial building techniques and other\ninnovations, all designed to reduce energy and\nwater consumption and to provide new levels of\ncomfort, convenience, security and fire safety.\nTech House equipment performed well in\ninitial tests, but a house is not a home until it\nhas people. That\'s where the Swains come in.\nNASA wants to see how the various systems\nwork under actual living conditions, to confirm\nthe effectiveness of the innovations or to determine necessary modifications for improvement.\nThe Swains are occupying the house for a year,\nduring which NASA engineers are computermonitoring the equipment and assembling a\nrecord of day-to-day performance.\n.\nTech House is a laboratory rather than a\nmass production prototype, but its many benefits may influence home design and construction. In a period of sharply rising utility costs,\nwidespread adoption of Tech House features\n\ncould provide large-scale savings to\nhomeowners and potentially enormous national\nbenefit in resources conservation.\nMost innovations are aerospace spinoffs:\nSome of the equipment is now commercially\navailable; other systems are expected to be in\nproduction within a few years. Around 1980, a\nTech House-type of home could be built for\n$45-50,000 (1 976 dollars). It is estimated that\nthe homeowner would save well over $20,000\n(again 1976 dollars) in utility costs over the\naverage mortgage span of 20 years.\nTech House is designed to use only one-third\nthe energy of a comparably-sized home. Among\nthe energy-saving features are solar collectors\nfor heating the home and providing domestic\nhot water; a roof radiator system for summer\ncooling; super-efficient insulation, including\n\nheat-blocking material up to six inches thick,\ndouble-paned windows and thermal shutters;\nexterior design features that admit or reduce\nsun heat, depending on the season; a highefficiency fireplace that cuts chimney loss of\nheat; and a computer-directed comfort control\nsystem that heats or cools only the rooms in\nuse at a given time.\nTech House uses less than half the water of\na comparable home. It has a partial recycling\nsystem that collects waste water from the\nshower, bathtub and washing machine and reuses it for toilet flushing. Special nozzle inserts\nin shower heads and a smaller than usual\ncommode also trim water usage.\nSecurity and safety measures include nonflammable insulation; fire-retardant materials in\ncurtains, furniture and carpets; a sophisticated\n\nfire detection system; a tornado warning device;\nand several innovations, including unique locks\nand break-in detectors.\nThe Tech House project is sponsored by\nNASA\'s Technology Utilization Division. The\nstudy and design for the Tech House was supported by a great many organizations, including\nNASA field centers, the Department of Housing\nand Urban Development, the National Bureau\nof Standards, the Consumer Products Safety\nCommission, the National Association of Home\nBuilders Research Foundation, Old Dominion\nUniversity, Hampton Institute, and Technology\nand Economics Inc. The basic Tech House design\nwas contributed by the architectural firms of\nForrest W. Coile & Associates and Charles W.\nMoore & Associates.\n\n(4\n\n'
