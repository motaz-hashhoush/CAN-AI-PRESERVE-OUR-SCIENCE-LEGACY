Surge pressures occur when propellant flow is initiated following the actuation of an isolation valve separating an upstream high pressure fluid from a downstream low pressure manifold. By design, the PACE propulsion subsystem mitigates surge pressures using an orifice, or a cavitating venturi, placed upstream of each thruster bank isolation latch valve. Venturi sizing is a balancing act due to the competing performance   goals   of   staying   within   the   margins   of   an   acceptable   pressure   loss   and maintaining surge pressures below the proof pressure rating of the subsystem components. Subsystem pressure loss is dependent upon the venturi throat diameter and is higher for smaller venturi sizes. A venturi with a smaller throat diameter incurs an increased pressure loss   through   the   orifice   resulting   in   a   reduced   thruster   inlet   pressure   and   diminished thruster performance. The PACE propulsion subsystem surge analysis and testing supports system optimization, i.e. pressure drop minimization, while still meeting the surge pressure requirements to maximize overall system performance. In this paper a new approach to surge pressure analytical gauging is discussed, as well as its accuracy when compared to traditional surge testing campaign.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "US", "submissionId": 20205005043, "endDate": "2020-08-28T04:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"organizationId": "71fb4af96d4a59b5a0a2084db7b4ce35", "meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "Reston, Virginia, United States"}}, "meetingId": "d1ea983e0c1f429881b1f24a3f2004bd", "id": "e317e2b4e4304f7ca3508b956728cc69"}], "name": "2020 AIAA Propulsion and Energy Forum", "location": "Virtual", "id": "d1ea983e0c1f429881b1f24a3f2004bd", "startDate": "2020-08-24T04:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20205005043, "publisher": "", "id": "81a788a7d6a940a8a8d1baca04fe380d", "publicationName": "", "publicationDate": "2020-08-24T04:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "name": "AIAA Paper Final.docx", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20205005043/downloads/AIAA%20Paper%20Final.docx", "pdf": "/api/citations/20205005043/downloads/AIAA%20Paper%20Final.docx.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20205005043/downloads/AIAA%20Paper%20Final.docx.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
