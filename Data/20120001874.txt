When the controllers indicate normal operation, the solid rocket boosters ignite and\nthe shuttle blasts off. Initially, the SSMEs throttle down to\nreduce stress during the period of maximum dynamic pressure, but soon after, they throttle up to propel the orbiter\nto 17,500 miles per hour. In just under 9 minutes, the\nthree SSMEs burn over 1.6 million pounds of propellant,\nand temperatures inside the main combustion chamber\nreach 6,000 \xcb\x9aF. To cool the engines, liquid hydrogen circulates through miles of tubing at -423 \xcb\x9aF.\nFrom 1981to 2011, the Space Shuttle fleet carried\ncrew and cargo into orbit to perform a myriad of unprecedented tasks. After 30 years and 135 missions, the feat of\nengineering known as the SSME boasted a 100-percent\nflight success rate.\n\nBenefits\n\nPartnership\nIn the 1970s, the SSME was designed under contract\nto NASA by Rocketdyne, now part of Pratt & Whitney\nRocketdyne (PWR), a United Technologies Company\nbased in East Hartford, Connecticut. Working with\nMarshall Space Flight Center, PWR developed the most\nefficient rocket engines in existence, with ultra-high-pressure operation of the pumps and combustion chamber,\nwhich allowed expansion of all hot gasses through a higharea-ratio exhaust nozzle.\nSoon after developing the highly efficient shuttle\nengines, PWR started creating highly efficient gasification\nsystems. Gasification is a chemical process that converts\ncarbon-containing materials such as coal, petcoke (a waste\nproduct from oil refineries), or biomass (organic material from plants or animals) into synthesis gas, or syngas.\nAfter the material is pulverized, it mixes with oxygen and\nsteam at very high temperatures. The resulting syngas\xe2\x80\x94\ncomprised of carbon monoxide, hydrogen, carbon\n130\t Energy and Environment\t\n\nA Space Shuttle Main Engine, built by Rocketdyne under\ncontract to NASA, undergoes test firing in 1981. Marshall\nSpace Flight Center was responsible for the shuttle\xe2\x80\x99s propulsion\nelements, including the main engines.\n\ndioxide, and methane\xe2\x80\x94can be burned as a fuel to create\nelectricity, or further processed to make products such\nas substitute natural gas, chemicals, fertilizers, or liquid\ntransportation fuels.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe started looking at alternate forms of energy and\nalternate ways of using coal during the 1970s energy\ncrisis,\xe2\x80\x9d says Don Stevenson, program area manager\nfor Clean Fossil Fueled Energy Technologies at PWR.\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy applying our rocket engine expertise, we are able\n\nIn the 1980s, PWR built its proof-of-concept gasifier,\nbut due to a lack of funding, the company temporarily\nshelved the technology. Years later, interest in the technology resurfaced, so PWR pursued new partnerships with\nthe U.S. Department of Energy, ExxonMobil Research\nand Engineering, and Canada\xe2\x80\x99s Alberta Innovates, to\ndesign, develop, and test the technology. By 2009, PWR\nhad begun operating a pilot plant at the Gas Technology\nInstitute in Des Plaines, Illinois, and in June 2011, test\nresults established the gasifier\xe2\x80\x99s successful performance\nand operation over a range of conditions.\nPWR\xe2\x80\x99s experience developing rocket technology\nwas instrumental in improving gasification technology.\nStevenson says, \xe2\x80\x9cThe result is a much more compact,\nefficient, and lower-cost system.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSeveral aspects of the compact gasification system have\nbeen influenced by the company\xe2\x80\x99s experience with rocket\nengine design and development. The main component,\nhowever, is the rapid mix injector. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it weren\xe2\x80\x99t for the\ninjector, which we think is the key secret ingredient, this\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be possible,\xe2\x80\x9d says Stevenson.\nPWR\xe2\x80\x99s rapid mix injector allows the gasifier to mix the\ncarbon-based material, oxygen, and steam more efficiently\nat higher temperatures so the reaction can happen more\nquickly. PWR\xe2\x80\x99s experience with rocket engines, which\ntypically run at 5,000 \xcb\x9aF or more, provided the expertise\nneeded to build a gasifier system capable of withstanding\nextreme temperatures.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe modeling and analysis required to understand\nhigh heat loads for rocket engines is something that we\nhave directly applied to the gasifier. Others in the field\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t have that expertise, so they have been reluctant to\ngo to the higher efficiencies because they can\xe2\x80\x99t handle the\ntemperatures,\xe2\x80\x9d says Stevenson.\nSpinoff 2011\n\nIn addition to the smaller size, another advantage of\nPWR\xe2\x80\x99s system is lower costs, compared to the prevailing\ngasifier technology. According to the company, the capital cost to build a commercial-scale compact gasification\nplant using PWR\xe2\x80\x99s technology is estimated to be 10\xe2\x80\x9320\npercent less than conventional gasification plants. Another\nmain advantage is that the system is expected to reduce\ncarbon dioxide emissions by up to 10 percent, compared\nto standard gasification technologies\xe2\x80\x94which are already\nthe cleanest coal-based power systems available. For each\nSpinoff 2011 \t\n\ncommercial system deployed, it is equivalent to removing\n50,000 cars from road.\nThese advancements hold real promise for the energy\nand chemical processing industries. According to the\nGasification Technologies Council, worldwide gasification capacity is projected to grow 70 percent by 2015,\nwith 80 percent of the growth occurring in Asia. In fact,\nPWR has already granted a license to Zero Emission\nEnergy Plants, Inc. (ZEEP) of Katy, Texas, for commercial implementation of the compact gasifier system.\n\xe2\x80\x9cZEEP has a unique energy plant concept, and they want\n\nEnergy and Environment \t 131\n\nEnergy and\nEnvironment\n\nRocketdyne, now part of Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne (PWR), used its rocket engine expertise to advance gasification technology.\nCompared to standard gasification systems, PWR\xe2\x80\x99s technology is more compact, efficient, and lower cost.\n\nto make our technology a centerpiece. They were willing\nto come in with an early license, and that provided some\nadditional financial resources to support the development,\xe2\x80\x9d says Stevenson.\nIn the future, PWR expects to license the technology\nto various national and international entities such as\noil refineries, electric power, liquid fuels, and chemical\nplants. The next step in the commercialization efforts is\nto demonstrate the gasifier at a commercial scale over a\nlong period of time. To this end, PWR is beginning to\nwork with partners to build a commercial-scale plant in\neither Asia or North America.\nPerhaps the greatest benefits of using more efficient,\ncost-effective gasifiers to produce electricity, however, will\nbe for the environment. As Stevenson says, \xe2\x80\x9cOne of the\nindustry\xe2\x80\x99s challenges has been how to continue to use coal\nin an environmentally friendly way. Once gasification can\nbe brought in as a cost-effective mechanism for a means\nto producing electricity, we can replace coal-fired power\nplants and make a huge improvement on the global emissions problem.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWhile the demand for energy continues to rise, coal\ncontinues to be a major source of energy, so Stevenson\nfinds gasification of coal offers the opportunity to\ndramatically reduce carbon dioxide emissions into the\natmosphere. By using a gasifier, the carbon dioxide can\nbe captured much more efficiently. \xe2\x80\x9cExtensive research\nis being conducted in North America, Asia, and Europe\nto pump captured carbon dioxide underground and\nstore it or use it to enhance oil recovery. There are some\nmajor pilot projects taking place to prove the technology\nfor carbon sequestration, which will ultimately be the\nkey enabler for near-zero emissions from these types of\nfacilities,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.\nStevenson suggests this type of innovation, similar to the\ninnovation required to build the SSMEs, is what will help\nto meet the world\xe2\x80\x99s energy and environmental goals. v\n\n'
