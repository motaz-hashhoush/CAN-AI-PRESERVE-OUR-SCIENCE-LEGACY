The refined mesh must be able to adequately capture the diffraction behavior, so that the plane wave front bends as it passes through the slit. Given that the coarse and refined meshes are sufficiently accurate, the phase errors introduced during the problem solution will be a function of th sound speed on the two grids plus the coarse/refined grid interaction errors.", "title": "Model problem", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T16:53:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19920002511, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Perkins, A.
