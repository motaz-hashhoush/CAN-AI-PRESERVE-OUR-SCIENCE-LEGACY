This results in difficulty being encountered in\nachieving precise control over the slave arm.\nAdditionally, the size and weight of the sleeve tend to\nintroduce operational problems. This can be more fully\nappreciated when it is realized that the sleeve must be\nsupported by an operator substantially throughout the\nperformance of a given task, thus the operator is subjected to fatigue. Fatigue becomes particularly significant in time-delayed manipulation tasks where an operator must hold a segment of the sleeve in a stationary\ninterim position during \xe2\x80\x9cwaiting periods\xe2\x80\x9d, sometimes\nfor many minutes.\nFurther, motion biases which tend to occur in various\njoints at some arm orientations frequently introduce\ndifficulty in achieving desired motion, without application of excessive force. Such tends to result in false or\nunwanted motion being introduced into the slave arm.\nFinally, since the operator\xe2\x80\x99s arm is, in effect, captured\ninside the sleeve and can only be removed by placing\nthe sleeve in predetermined orientation, the operator\nmay not remove his arm without transmitting control\nsignals to the slave arm. This limitation has a propensity\nto become particularly serious as emergency conditions\nare encountered during periods of operation of the system.\nIt is therefore the general purpose of the instant invention to provide an improved articulated controller\narm configured and dimensioned to form a miniature\nkinematic replica of a remotely related slave arm which\novercomes the aforementioned difficulties and disadvantages, without diminishing the effectiveness thereof.\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n1. Field of the Invention\nThe invention generally relates to manipulator systems and more particularly to an improved, highly effi- 15\ncient controller arm for use in achieving real-time control over a remotely related articulated slave arm.\n2. Description of the Prior Art\nMaster-slave systems, sometimes referred to as remote control manipulators, often are employed in a 20\nvariety of fields. For example, master-slave systems\nfrequently are used for handling radioactive material,\ntoxic material or other dangerous substances located\nbehind a wall designed to protect an operator of the\nsystem. For example, see U.S. Pat. No. 3,815,761. An- 25\nother field in which a master-slave manipulator system\nis sometimes employed is in underwater exploration.\nFor example, see US. Pat. No. 3,414,136, in which such\na system is described. Another field in which masterslave manipulator systems are employed is in the explo- 30\nration of celestial space. For example, see U.S. Pat. No.\n3,893,573.\nIt should therefore be apparent that the prior art is\nreplete with master-slave manipulator systems characterized by a controller subsystem employed in dictating 35\nOBJECTS AND SUMMARY O F THE\noperation of a slave arm.The master-slave manipulator\nINVENTION\nsystem which embodies the principles of the instant\nIt is an object of the invention to provide an iminvention is related to a manipulator system disclosed\nand claimed in U.S. Letters Patent Application, Ser.\nproved controller a m which overcomes the aforemenr\nNo. 436.313. filed Jan. 24, 1974, entitled \xe2\x80\x9cAN AN- 40 tioned disadvantages and difficulties.\nIt is another object to provide an improved articuTHROPOMORPHIC MASTEWSLAVE MANIPUlated controller arm for controlling a remotely related\nLATOR SYSTEM\xe2\x80\x99, now U.S. Pat.
