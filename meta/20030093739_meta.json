Results of this integration may be utilized for global change analysis, as well as for the validation of new instruments or for new data analysis. Furthermore, future multiple satellite missions will include many different sensors carried on separate platforms, and the amount of remote sensing data to be combined is increasing tremendously. For all of these applications, the first required step is fast and automatic image registration, and as this need for automating registration techniques is being recognized, it becomes necessary to survey all the registration methods which may be applicable to Earth and space science problems and to evaluate their performances on a large variety of existing remote sensing data as well as on simulated data of soon-to-be-flown instruments. In this paper we present one of the first steps toward such an exhaustive quantitative evaluation. First, the different components of image registration algorithms are reviewed, and different choices for each of these components are described. Then, the results of the evaluation of the corresponding algorithms combining these components are presented o n several datasets. The algorithms are based on gray levels or wavelet features and compute rigid transformations (including scale, rotation, and shifts). Test datasets include synthetic data as well as data acquired over several EOS Land Validation Core Sites with the IKONOS and the Landsat-7 sensors.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "France", "submissionId": 20030093739, "endDate": "2003-07-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "IGARSS 2003", "location": "Toulouse", "id": "2bbc997240cb4fcdb083fbef1cbb0587", "startDate": "2003-07-21T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20030093739, "id": "be54d952b8144c4ab46ab63f3b2f8f1b", "publicationDate": "2003-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
