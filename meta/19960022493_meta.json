An evolutionary approach and well differentiated product/service portfolio was required, to minimize system upgrade costs and market penetration, respectively. The evolved system definition serves to minimize equipment cost/size/mass for short/medium range aircraft, by reducing the antenna gain requirement and relaxing the performance requirements for non safety-related communications. A validation program involving simulation, laboratory tests, over-satellite tests and flight trials is being conducted to confirm the system definition. Extensive market research has been conducted to determine user requirements and to quantify market demand for future Inmarsat Aero-1 AES, using sophisticated computer assisted survey techniques.", "title": "Evolution of the INMARSAT aeronautical system: Service, system, and business considerations", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-17T09:58:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19960022493, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Sengupta, Jay R."}, "organization": {"name": "International Maritime Satellite Organization", "location": "London,  United Kingdom"}}, "id": "8e9763baf2af4311852c85a5bb18eb07"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19960022493, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19960022493, "id": "93c588df7a2a4fc0871db9d7f4e6cb95", "publicationName": "Proceedings of the Fourth International Mobile Satellite Conference (IMSC 1995)", "publicationDate": "1995-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19960022452, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Proceedings of the Fourth International Mobile Satellite Conference (IMSC 1995)", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
