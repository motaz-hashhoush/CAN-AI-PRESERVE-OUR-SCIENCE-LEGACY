The preliminary analysis indicated that the SST pattern and the coastal shape caused the MABL to deepen eastward and southward, which is in good agreement with the suggestion of Atlas et al. (1983). Also, good agreements were found between the lidar data and the NOAA P-3 and dropsonde date, e.g., the boundary heights, the dominant scales of motion, and the heat flux ratio between the top of MABL and the sea surface. The planetary boundary layer (PBL) height measured by lidar was found to be in good agreement with that measured by the dropsonde temperature profile. Assuming a linear heat flux profile in the clear PBL, the heat flux ratio between the PBL top and the surface may be estimated from the ratio of the entrainment zone to the completely mixed boundary layer height. The heat flux ratio estimated by lidar measurements was found to be in good agreement with that derived from the gust probe data.", "title": "Air-Sea Interaction During Cold Air Outbreaks", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T13:34:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19850006092, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Chou, S."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD, United States"}}, "id": "1e41d1ac44b64fe6a501ba4a119f0afb"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19850006092, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Yeh, Y."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD, United States"}}, "id": "f037315080bb4e2da4c1e12f2009b260"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19850006092, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Firestone, J."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD, United States"}}, "id": "0b1a484d9b6e4b4fb85b63192d8edffe"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2014-09-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19850006092, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19850006092, "id": "def96b8a85d24d3e8a75e32d6100b346", "publicationName": "Global Scale Atmospheric Processes Res.
