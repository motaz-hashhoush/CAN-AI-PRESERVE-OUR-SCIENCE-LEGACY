Since failures are out-of-tolerance performance, the probability of failures and their occurrence is the difference between high and low quality systems. Failures can be described at 3 levels: the system failure (which is the detectable end of a failure), the failure mode (which is the failure process), and the failure cause (which is the start). Failure causes can be evaluated & classified by type. The results of typing flight history failures shows that most failures are in unrecognized modes and result from human error or noise, i.e. failures are when engineers learn how things really work. Although the study based on US launch vehicles, a sampling of failures from other countries indicates the finding has broad application. The parameters of the design of a propulsion system are not single valued, but have dispersions associated with the manufacturing of parts. Many tests are needed to find failures, if the dispersions are large relative to tolerances, which could contribute to the large number of failures in unrecognized modes.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "China", "submissionId": 19990054828, "endDate": "1997-08-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "Space Propulsion Primary and Upper Stage Propulsion Systems: From Launch to Space", "location": "Beijing", "id": "9e2249a03f4c4a25a83645ad0afa338b", "startDate": "1997-08-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19990054828, "id": "351f845b6731460e89d93de47cfa99c6", "publicationDate": "1997-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
