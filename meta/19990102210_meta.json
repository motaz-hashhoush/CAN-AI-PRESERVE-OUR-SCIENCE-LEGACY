Three different interface shapes: a) a planar interface, b) an equidistant hemispherical bumps train tAx interface, and c) a train of right angled steps, are used in this comparative study. The ratio of the super-saturation to the diffusive flux at the step position is used as a control parameter. The value of this parameter can vary as much as 50% for different geometries. An approximate analytical formula is derived for the right angled steps geometry. In addition to the kinetic models, this formula can be utilized in macrostep growth models. Finally, numerical modeling of the diffusive and convective transport for equidistant steps is conducted. In particular, the role of fluid flow resulting from the advancement of steps and its contribution to the transport of species to the steps is investigated.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 19990102210, "endDate": "1999-01-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics"}}, "meetingId": "ee02eebbfed44e9385102e26163eeb29", "id": "72f889cf84034cab85df0af88c09db71"}], "name": "Aerospace Sciences", "location": "Reno, NV", "id": "ee02eebbfed44e9385102e26163eeb29", "startDate": "1999-01-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19990102210, "id": "0946787d7e8a40bab928945526c255c6", "publicationDate": "1998-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
