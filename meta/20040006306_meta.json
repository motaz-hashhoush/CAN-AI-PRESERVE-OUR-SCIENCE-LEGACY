The AC/ATM Project is developing new communications technologies and tools that will improve throughput in the U.S. Air Traffic Control System. The goal of the AC/ATM Project is to enable a communications infrastructure providing the capacity, efficiency, and flexibility necessary to realize benefits of the future mature Free-Flight environment. The capabilities and scope of communications technologies needed to accomplish this goal depend on characteristics of the future Free-Flight environment. There are many operational concepts being proposed for a future ATM system to enable user flexibility and efficiency. GRC s focus is on developing new technologies and techniques to support the digital communication of information involving airborne and ground-based users. However, the technologies and techniques must be integrated with the systems and services that industry and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) are developing. Thus, GRC needs to monitor and provide input to the various industry and FAA organizations and committees that are specifying new systems and services. Adoption of technologies by the FAA is partially dependent on acceptance of the technology by the aviation community. The commercial aviation community in particular would like to adopt technologies that can be used throughout the world. As a result, the adoption of common or at least compatible technologies by European countries is a key factor in getting commitments to those technologies by the US aviation community. GRC desires to keep informed of European activities that relate to aviation communication technologies, particularly those that are being supported by Eurocontrol.", "title": "Industry Support", "stiType": "CONTRACTOR_OR_GRANTEE_REPORT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T11:30:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Contractor or Grantee Report", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20040006306, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20040006306, "id": "aa330f9e34a7407bb80711b750d010c9", "publicationDate": "2003-12-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20040006306.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20040006306/downloads/20040006306.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20040006306/downloads/20040006306.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20040006306/downloads/20040006306.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
