b'THE TIMS INSTRUMENT\n\nCHECK STANICH\nDAEDALUS ENTERPRISES, INC.\nP.O. BOX 1869\nANN ARBOR, MICHIGAN 48106\nI expect that most of the audience is composed of TIMS data users and many\nof you may not be familiar with the instrument itself. I plan to introduce\nDaedalus Enterprises, Inc., give background/history on the design and\ndevelopment of TIMS and to cover some of the detailed design considerations.\nI will provide you with some insights into the design decisions that have\ntaken place and discuss some of the limitations of the system. When I have\ncompleted my talk, I would hope that you will be more comfortable with the\nterminology, concepts, and use of the TIMS airborne line scanner. Possibly\nsome of the information that I will present could find some use in the\napplication of the system.\nFor those of you not familiar with Daedalus, we were founded in 1968 and are\nnow a publicly-held corporation chartered to pursue all aspects of remote\nsensing of the environment. We are internationally recognized as the major\nmanufacturer of commercial, airborne optical/mechanical scanner systems.\nOur systems have been comprised of passive and active systems covering the\nultraviolet to the infrared wavelengths and usually are instruments covering\none to twelve separate spectral channels. We have designed and delivered\nsystems for four NASA centers: NSTL, MSFC, J S C , and ARC.\nThe TIMS (Thermal Infrared Multispectral Scanner) system components consist\nof a scan head/spectrometer and associated electronics.\nIt was designed as a geologic instrument. In silicate rocks, there is a\nbroad minimum in emissivity between 8 and 11 pm and the depth and position\nof the band is related to the crystal structure of the constituent minerals.\nEarly attempts to use multispectral image data in this region met with only\nlimited success. In the early seventies, a 24-channel scanner was built for\nNASA and some promising results were obtained in the thermal infrared region\nover the East Tintic Mountains in Utah. This scanner reportedly proved to\nbe unreliable and was subsequently dismantled.\nAfter beginning discussions in 1979 with Alex Goetz at JPL, Daedalus was\nawarded a design study contract for the spectrometer portion of the system\nin November of 1980. The design consideration given the highest priority\nwas system radiometric sensitivity because the contrast in spectral\nemittance among rocks is usually less than 15%. After the completion of\nthis design, a contract was received from NASA/NSTL to proceed with the\nfabrication of the complete system. Before the system was completed, the\nfunds allocated by NASA for the project were depleted. Daedalus then\ncompleted the system using its own funds and it was test flown and delivered\nin March of 1982.\nThe system has been maintained and modified by NASA since then and possibly\nsome of the information that I will present may not apply to the current\nTIMS configuration.\n\n5\n\nA NASA/NSTL Learjet has been specially modified to accommodate the TIMS\nsystem. The system normally is flown using this aircraft although it has\nalso been operated in the NASA/ARC C-130 aircraft. The scan head and\nspectrometer are mounted in the unpressurized tail cone of this aircraft and\noperate through a hole cut through the skin. The fact that the system would\nbe exposed to the environment outside the skin of the aircraft was an\nimportant consideration in the design process.\nWe feel that the system is quite compact considering the achieved\nsensitivity. The scan head/spectrometer is slightly over three feet long,\n30 inches high and weighs over 220 pounds. The temperature over which the\nscan head/spectrometer can operate is very large. The number of spectral\nchannels covered is six ranging from 8 . 2 pm to 1 2 . 2 pm. The original\nspecification of the system required a sensitivity of less than . 3 K in each\nof the bands. When the system was delivered to NSTL, all bands had a\nsensitivity of less than .2K with the exception of band 6 .\nThe entrance aperture to the primary optics is 7.5 inches in diameter\nresulting in an effective collecting area of 36 sq. inches. The system has\na variable scan rate which is switch selectable by the operator. The scan\nrates can be varied from 7 . 3 to 25 scans/second by adjusting the rotation\nrate of the scanning mirror to accommodate the different speeds and\naltitudes of the aircraft.\nThe digitized field of view contains 638 pixels and covers 76.56 degrees.\nThis digitized field of view is adjusted according to the roll attitude of\nthe aircraft in order to stabilize the image. The unvignetted field of view\nrelates to how large the total optical view can be before an obstruction to\nthe optical path is encountered. Comparing the digitized field of view with\nthe unvignetted field of view would indicate that the system can accommodate\napproximately 1.5 degrees of roll before a pixel from the edge of the scene\nwill be lost. However, a total of +- 15 degrees of roll can be handled\nbefore stabilization of the scene pixels is lost.\nThe system digitizes each pixel to 8 bits, and the detector analog signals\nare sampled every 2 . 0 8 milliradians. The instantaneous optical field of\nview is 2 . 5 milliradians as determined by a field stop aperture which is\ncommon to all of the spectral channels. This common aperture ensures that\na l l of the channels are in spatial registration. The output data rate\nvaries from 44 to 150 kbits/sec and each scan line of each channel contains\n750 words. The output data is recorded on a wide band instrumentation tape\nat a density of 10,000bits per inch per channel.\nThe scan head contains the primary collecting optics of the system and the\ntwo thermal reference sources, determines the instantaneous field of view,\nreceives the motor drive signal for the scanning mirror, and provides an\noptical and mechanical interface to the spectrometer. The spectrometer\ncollimates the optical energy received from the primary, disperses it using\na diffraction grating and focuses the energy onto a series of liquid\nnitrogen cooled detectors.\nThe electrical output of the detectors is coupled to the digitizer where the\namplitude is adjusted, bandwidth limited, sampled, digitized, and monitored.\nThe digitizer also receives various housekeeping information about the\n\nsystem and aircraft and combines this with the video data from the detectors\nand conditions it for use by the tape recorder.\nThe control console is used by the operator to monitor system activities and\nto control the system functions. The scan speed selection by the operator\nis distributed to the various units from the control console. The console\nalso accepts the signals from the scan motor encoder and the gyro to perform\nthe roll stabilization. Controls for the two thermal reference sources are\ncontained in the control console.\nThe assemblies of the scan head are the dc motor, the mirror and the\nencoder. All timing related activities are synchronized to the encoder\nincluding the digitization and tape recorder speed. A gyro is used to\ndetermine the roll attitude of the aircraft. The thermal reference sources\nare mounted on each side of the scan head and consist of large copper plates\nwhich are painted black with a paint that has a high emissivity throughout\nthe spectral region. One reference can be set to either above or below the\nscan head ambient temperature while the other one can only be set to a\ntemperature above the scan head ambient.\nEach reference is actively\ncontrolled and the source temperature is independently measured and inserted\ninto the housekeeping data associated with each channel.\nThe spectrometer contains the dispersing optics and the array\nphotoconductive cooled detectors. A set of six electrical preamplifiers\nmatched to each element of the array and are mounted onto the side of\nspectrometer. The spectrometer is sealed and purged with a supply of\nnitrogen gas during each flight.\n\nof\nare\nthe\ndry\n\nThe TIMS optical system consists of a 19 cm diameter Newtonian reflector\ntelescope mounted behind an object-plane 4 5 O\nflat scanning mirror and\nfollowed by a Czerny-Turner spectrometer.\nThe primary optical system uses a f1.9 parabolic primary mirror with a field\ndetermining aperture located in its focal plane. An off-axis parabolic\nmirror is used to collimate the energy emerging from the aperture which is\nthen dispersed by the diffraction grating and re-imaged on the detector\narray by a fast f0.6 germanium lens. All of the primary optical elements,\nthe field stop, the off-axis collimator, and the detector dewar are mounted\non sliding blocks controlled by InvarR metering rods to provide the active\nthermal compensation for scan head ambient temperature changes. The three\nelement germanium imaging lens is also internally thermally compensated for\nchanges in ambient temperature.\n\n7\n\n'
