When this approach was reviewed by the Flat-Plate Solar\nArray ( FSA) Project, development was begun on new materials that would reduce\nthe cost and quantity of material required for encapsulation.\nDuring development of these materials, the PV ino^jstry improved module\ndesign by eliminating metal substrates and incorporating glass superstrates to\nprovide a hard, easily cleaned for surface. Use of glass superstrates created\nnew material problems. Bonding some encapsulating materials proved to be a\ndifficult problem. Eliminat ; on of visual defects, such as voids and bubbles,\nbecame necessary because of increased market sophistication. Long - term corrosion concerns became important now that thin, water - permeable polymer materials\nwere being %teed to reduce cost. Discussion of these problems will start with\nequipment development, because improved equipment was necessary to the subsequent materials development effort. While the development was being pursued,\nsome module design and processing problems became evident. Because these problems have a bearing upon the reliability of the lamination process, they will\nalso be discussed.\n\nA.\t\n\nEQUIPMENT DEVELOPMENT\n\nWhen modules were being assembled by casting with silicones, there were\nhigh material and labor costs an d low equipment costs. Material cost reduction\nwas sought in the development of new materials. Labor cost reduction, however,\nis dependent upon the development of better processes and the introduction of\nequiptnent specifically designed to use the new materials and processes. The\nproce ,^u that seemed most suitable for the new materials was a lamination process.\nA typical laminated module i s shown in Figure 1. Initial FSA Project involvement with lamination occurred in late 1978 at RCA Laboratories (RCA).\nRCA double - glass lamination experiments showed that an autoclave was\nexpensive and introduced air into module edges during cooldown ( Reference 1).\nLate 1978 was also the time of contract initiation with ARCO Solar, Inc., to\ndevelop a laminator that would reduce the near-term costs of PV modules. By\nJuly 1979 a double-chamber vacuum laminator was developed, tested and put into\nproduction ( Reference 2). This laminator is shown in Figure 2 and used a proven\nthermoplastic, polyvinyl butyral (PVB), which requires humidity- and temperaturecontrolled storage and handling. Other problems with PVB were high cost and\nhigh viscosity at the 1500C process temperature.\nAn answer to these problems was sought in a material that would cure at\nprocess temperatures. One possible solution was to develop a \xe2\x80\xa2 hermosetting\npolymer, but these polymers place more stringent temperature requirements on a\nlaminator. The original ARCO Solar laminator used long, slender tungstenfilament lamps as a heat source and shiny alumin um strips to adjust for\nuniformity. This approach works well with a thermoplastic - like PVB, but was\nconsidered to be too variable and limited for research into thermosetting\nmaterials and substrate module designs.\n\nq\n\n1\t\n\nt\n\n0",i^INA[.

Original ARCO Solar Laminator\n\n2\n\nA resistive strip heater was considered as a possible inexpensive, improved heat source. Wire-wound strip heaters are commonly made with surfacetemperature variations of ins@ than + 2% (when measured on top of a 0 . 125-in.thick glass plate). Another well controlled heat source would be a heated oil\nsystem. This system also wouia have the capability of cooling down the product\nbefore opening the laminator.\nThe Process Development Area ( PDA) of th-s Project received two ARCO\nSolar - developed laminators at the end of the contract. One of these laminators\nwas modified for use with a strip heater (Figure 3). This configuration, with\na boost-and-buck autotransformer power supply, as shown in Figure 4, was used\nsuccessfully for some p>,ocess verification and materials survey experiments.\nAssessment of future research needs and present equipment capabilities led to\nadditional . nodifications of the laminator.\nExperience with the laminator showed that the heavy aluminum base plate,\na large thermal mass, caused control - response problems. The 0.25-in. Transite\nplate also caused some control problems, because it eras close to the controller\nthermocouple. Thermal mass keeps the chamber temperature high during the\nunload - load cycle, which can start the cure cycle earlier than desired. The\ncontroller temperature must be manually adjusted to prevent the temperature of\nthe laminant adhesive - encapsulant from overshooting. An inexpensive, mechanically stiff thermal insulation system that would not out-gas during exposure\nto processing temperatures as high as 175 0C was required. Figure 5 shows the\nlaminator modifications required to achieve the desired P hermal isolation and\nimproved controllability. An unusual material application was the use of glass\nmarbles as insulation. Table 1 shows typical laminant and controller temperature readings before and after t..,t thermal isolation modification. There was\nan improvement in warm-up time and in tracking. This design pt^esents a nearly\nbalanced thermal load above and below the trip heater ( Figure 6) that should\nallow good tracking, regardlPRs of the desired time - temperature cycle.\n\nAREA FOR SUPERSTRATE OR SUBSTRATE\nLAMINANT STACK\n\nRESISTANCE STRIP HEATER \xe2\x80\x94\nb in 1 i`APERED GLASS PLATE\n-----14 in TRANSITE INSULATOR\n\nTRANSITE STAND OFF BLOCKS\nt\t\nORIGINAL SHELF IN CHAMBER\n\nl\t\n\n3!4 in ALUMINUM BASE PLATE\n\nCONTROLLER\n\nTHERMOCOUPLE\n\nCHAMBER WALL\n\nO`,\n1UNGSTEN FILAMENT LAMPS\n(ORIGINAL HEAT SOURCE)\n\nFigure 3.

Balanced Thermal Load on Strip Heater\n\nAdditional laminator changes that were implemented included:\n(1)\n\nAppling a vacuum to the top chamber of a double-chamber vacuum\nlaminator just before raising the upper chamber (lid) to remove a\ncompleted module (see Figure 3). This allows the silicone-rubber\ndiaphragm to be attached to the upper chamber, which reduces\nhandling and keeps the diaphragm weight off the laminant stack\nduring evacuation of the lower chamber.\n\n(2)\n\nAttaching the controller thermocouple to the bottom of the 0.125-in.\naluminum platen by laminating. This was done and this improved\nthermal coupling enhanced the performance of the laminator.\n\nOne measure of the utility of the present laminator is its acceptance by\nother researchers. Test programs now scheduled on the laminator include:\n(1)\n\nNew encapsulating materials evaluation.\n\n(2)\n\nSubstrate encapsulation studies.\n\n(3)\n\nPreparation of water permeation study samples.\n\n(4)\n\nEvaluation of module design developed under JPL contract.\ni\n\n6\na\n\n(5)\n\nEncapsulant - to-metal primer - compound research.\n\n(6)\n\nPreparation of electrostatic sasdples.\n\nBecause of the equipment development success, a new, larger laminator is\nbeing designed to explore problems inherent in fabricating thy\' larger PV modules\n,ivisioned tar the mid - 1980s. A G -ft square laminator area is anticipated that\nwould be compatible with the 1.2-m square designs or any smaller configurations.\nThe most expensive part of a large laminator is the chamber that must withstand\nthe atmospheric pressure load. Presently, the lowest - cost vacuum chamber that\nhas been considered uses standard hemispheric pressure vessel - end caps costing\nabout $ 300 each ( including a 2-in. - wide flange). The stand for the chamber\nwould be a short cylinder from the same supplier.\nSupport and insulation of the platen was also a problem, and the use of\nmarbles seems to be an inexpensi , e choice because about $^00 of marbles would\nprovide support, thermal isolation, and have the added advantage of easy\ntransport and modification of the chamber. Marbles also reduce the volume of\nthe vacuum chamber and thereby reduce pump - down time and energy.\n\nB.\t\n\nMATERIALS RESEARCH\n\nDesign of a PV module that will withstand 20 years of exposure to a\nvariety of terrestrial environments creates many problems. An FSA Project cost\nallocation of $14/m 3 for encapsulation, superstrate or substrate and edgeseal / gasket places an additional burden on the encapsulation materials, because\nthe glass superstrate alone has a projected cost of about_ $ 1(1%.\nDetails and background on early materials research efforts have been\npublished ( References 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7). A detailed discussion of present\nencapsulation materials will be published soon ( Reference 8). This report\ncovers the application testing of developed materials and other requirements\nfor successful vacuum lamination.\n\n1.\t\n\nEth)!,,ne Vinyl\n\nAcetate System\n\nThe first new lamination material developed by the FSA Project was\ncompounded by Springborn LaLoratories, Inc. (SLI) from an ethylene vinyl acetate\n(EVA) feedstock avai\'_ able trom Du Pont. Compared with PVB, EVA costs about onethird as much, has much lower viscosity at process temperature, and has no\nhumidity - control requirement during processing.\nEarly laminator experience uncovered problems with curing and adhesion of\nFVA. The original material from SLI also would adhere to itself, or block.\nSubsequent material delivered from Du Pont did not block, and had one waffled\nsurface, which enhanced air removal during vacuum pumpdown.\nThere is more than one correct cure cycle for EVA Like most polymers\nwith peroxide promoters, it is good practice to raise t , bond-line temperature rapidly to avoid peroxide decomposition before an adequate cure has been\nobtained. One cure cycle that has been proven uses two steps, one at 1000C\nfor evacuation and adhesicn, the other at 150 0 C for long-term oven cure.\n\n7\n\nF\n\nThis cycle provides a high throughput with only one laminator. A description\nof the cure cycle used for materials testing is:\nEvacutation for 5 min, then 25 min of cure with the top chamber bled to\natmosphere. During the 25-min cure, the first 8-10 min is required to\nraise the encapsulant temperature to 160 0C, where it is maintained to\nthe end of the cycle. Modules are then removed without being cooled.\nModules fabricated with this cure cycle show even and complete curing and\nno bubbles.\nAdhesion is a more difficult. problem. \'"here are many chemically ditferent\n-solar cell surface (oxidized\ninterfaces in a lsminant stack: glass-EVA, I. \t\nsilicon or some antireflection (AR) costing), cell back-surface metallizationEVA, EVA-back sheet, and EVA-bus bars (copper or tinned copper). Each of these\ninterfaces is important, because mechanically good adhesive bonds will often\nfail by delamination aftor exposure to humidity in the field. Water vapor will\npermeite through polymers and, if there is a non-chemically bonded surface,\nwater may collect and cause failure by displacement. Tables 2, 3, and 4 provide\ndetails of some of the research efforts in adhesion.\nA material survey was made using EVA and EMA oncapsulants and Korad 63000,\nScotchpar 20CP and Tedlar 20OBS 30WH as back sheets,. \'table. 2 shows the detailed\nresults of this survey. rrimed and unprimed surfaces and a new Du Pont Adhesive, 68040, were investigated. This survey showed good Qlass bonding with\nSL1 Primer A11861-1, and showed the need for a primer. ine only back sheet\nthat adhered to EVA was Tedlar with Adhesive 68040. Earlier tests showed good\nmechanical bonding to :entreated Tedlar but poor humidity performance.\nBecause the glassy -to-KVA interface bonding problem seemed to be solved\nwhen all samples exhibited adherent and persistent bonds, the focus of the\neffort was shifted to back-sheet adhesion. An additional series of tests (see\nTable 3) confirmed the good results of Tedlar with the Du Pont Adhesive 68040.\nKorad 63000 may be a useful material, but cure temperatures during lamination\ncaused some degradation. Additional tests on this acrylic sheet may be run.\nA polyester film, Scotchpar 20CP, was interesting, because it would be less\nexpensive than a polyvinyl fluoride+ film, such as Tedlar. This test series\nshowed that a new primer or adhesive was needed for the Scotchpar film.\nFortunately, E. F. Plueddetiann of Dow Corning Corp. had already developed\nand patented a primer for polyester films. Table 4 shows the excellent results\nachieved using this primer, EVA and Scotchpar. Because Project material cost\nobjectives can be met using a polyester film, additional application research\nefforts in back sheet adhesion were not pursued.

However,\nadhesion after cold-water soak was poor. This problem is being investigated.\nThe same primer that was used to bond EVA to a polyester was also tried\nin bonding EMA to a polyester. This system also degraded after long-term\nsoaking in cold wa t-er. Korad 63000 has adhered to EMA, but the resulting back\nsheet was brittle.\n\n11\n\nC.\t\n\nTESTING METHODS\n\nThe original lamination materials development was started with a process\nverification test program.\nThe EVA verification effort was based on a Spectroldb, Inc., process\n(Reference 9), which had a laminant material eequence of:\n(1)\n\n1/8-in.\t tempered glass.\n\n(2)\n\n0.005-in. Craneglas 230.\n\n(3)\n\n0.018-in. clear EVA.\n\n(4)\n\nCells.\n\n(5)\n\n0.005-in. Craneglas 230.\n\n(6)\n\n0.018-in. white-pigmented EVA.\n\n(7)\n\n0.005-in. Craneglas 230.\n\n(8)\n\n0.003-in. Mylar.\n\nFour minimodules (Serial Nos. M-1 to M-4) were successfully laminated,\nusing this process and the cure cycle described above. An evaluation of the\nmodules by a quality-assurance inspector showed some small bubbles at the\njunctions of the cell interconnect and the 0.010-in.-thick copper parallel bus\nbars and some delaminated areas because of incomplete solder-flux removal.\nAdhesion of the EVA to the glass superstrate was excellent; the peel test\nsamples broke before peeling. The reason for this strong bond was the use of\nPrimer A11861-1. Peel tests were not made of the EVA-to-Mylar bond because it\nwas so poor. Even though there were eome problems, the basic lamination process\nwas considered to be verified because there was good EVA-glass adhesion and no\ncell cracking.\nDuring the process verification testing, the number of sheets of Craneglas 230 was varied to determine process sensitivity. As a result of these\ntests, i^ was found that only the Craneglas sheet between the cells and the\nwhite-pigmented EVA was necessary. Individual module designs may require more\nsheets of Craneglas. Another area of investigation was the use of pigmented\nEVA. A simpler lamination process was found by using all-clear EVA and a whitepigmented back sheet.\nA gel test, recommended by SLI, was made on EVA coupon samples produced\nwhen the original four modules were made. Because unpolymerized EVA is soluble\nin toluene, weighted samples were placed in 60 0 C toluene for 2 h, and the\nresultant solution and sample was poured through weighed filter paper. After\nfiltration, the samples were dried in a 90 0 C circulating - air oven for 5 h.\nThe percentage of EVA remaining is a measure of the degree of gelation or polymerization during cure. SLI specifies a nominal 80% gel with 652 as the lower\nlimit. The gel test on the samples produced above showed better than 952\ngelation.\n\n12\n\nA\n\nPeel-test samples were prepared by cutting through the layer to be tested\nusing a 0.25-in. wide template. The desired layer wan then peeled back by\ncutting when necessary. Peel strength was measured using a Unitek Micropull I,\nModel 6-092. Several adherent samples had a cohesive strength above the 5-lb\nlimit of the test equipment; so these samples were tested using a calibrated\nspring scale. After some testing, it was noted that if a peel-test sample\ncould be easily prepared the sample had substandard adhesion. Some thin film\nsamples were so adherent or so brittle that a sample could not be prepared.\nThese situations are noted in the attached tables.\nPerforming a peel test after lamination should be considered an only a\ngood screening test; it is not sufficient for material selection.. Plueddemann\nrecommends a 7-day soak in room-temperature water as an additional test, with\nfinal peel tests demonstrating cohesive failure rather than adhesive failure\n(Reference 10). All of the laminants made at JPL have been subjected to the\n7-day room-temperature water-soak test. Table 4 summarizes the results of\n7-day room temperature water soak tests.\n\nD.\t\n\nOTHER LAMINATION-RELATED EFFORTS\n\nThe first lamination efforts were mechanically successful but visually\nunsuccessful. Many bubbles and voids were found that were related to solder\njoints. Another visual problem was cell misalignment and \xc2\xbboor placement. Both\nof these problem areas were not caused by the lamination process but would have\na profound effect on the marketability and field service-life of the fina\'i\nlaminated product.\n\n1.\t\n\nSolder-Flux Removal\n\nRemoval of soldering flux residues is an established process in the\nprinted-circuit-board and electronic-assembly industries. The quality of the\nlamination process is dependent upon chemical bonding of all surfaces within\nthe laminant, so very clean cell-string assemblies are required. Proper removal\nof flux residues requires solvents that can remove both polar and non-polar\nsoluble contaminants, so use of proprietary flux-removal solvents was indicated.\nBecause cell interconnects provide flux traps (especially the Motorola Inc. and\nARCO Solar combination bus bar-interconnect designs), it was decided to try\nultrasonic cleaning followed by vapor degreasing. Six cell-string assemblies\nfor minimodules and four assemblies for 1 x 4-ft modules were first cleaned in\nKester 5345 Rosin Residue Remover using a Sonix IV Model 99-104 Ultrasonic\nCleaner. Subsequently, these same cell-string assemblies were cleaned in\nKester 5120 vapor degreasing solvent using an Electrovert, Inc., Degrestil\nModel LCD-18 vapor degreaser. The assemblies were first introduced to the\nvapor zone, then were dipped in the cold-solvent tank and finally were removed\nslowly through the vapor zone. These cell strings showed no delaminated areas\nor bubbles after being laminated with EVA. Cell strings that were (nly swabcleaned for flux removal showed both bubbles and delamination when laminated\nusing identical process parameters.\n\n13\n\nBecause flux is such a concern, one contractor is exploring ultrasonic\nbonding (Reference 11), tieing prepunched aluminum interconnects that are\nattached to el%ctroplated copper cell metallization with a seam welder. Others\nare examining fluxless bonding concepts, such as vapor-phase solder reflow.\n\n2.\t\n\nMaterial Handling\n\nSeveral operations are required between cell stringing and lamination.\nTypically, these are:\n(1)\n\nAttach (solder) bus bars to cell-string ends.\n\n(2)\n\nElectrical test.\n\n(3)\n\nFlux removal.\n\n(4)\n\nApply primer.\n\n(S)\t\n\nLay up laminant stack.\n\nDuring these operations, proper material handling is important to avoid\nbreaking cells or straining the cell interconnects. Those operations that\nrequired dipping in a solution and vertical withdrawal for draining (e.g., flux\nremoval and primer application) were especially difficult. There was no simple\nway to support the cell strings without interfering with the action of the\nliquids. Lack of proper support strains the interconnects, which affects\nmodule layup and may also lead to later thermal-cycling fatigue failures.\nIf the cell strings are cleaned right after their assembly, the flex\nremoval operation would be simpler. After cell stringing, the parallel bur\nbars must be attached. If these are soldered, it -nny be possible to remove the\nflux from the bus-bar enis without Dandling the whole assembly. Another\napproach would be to ultrasonically bond or to spot weld the interconnects to\nthe bus bars.\nApplication of a primer by dipping the cell string assembly is the most\nfeasible operation, but with 4-ft-long cell strings it is awkward. The priming\noperation must come after all joining operations, because the primer binds to\nsurfaces and may inhibit mechanical adhesion. The Encapsulation Task of the\nFSA P:o ,ject is exploring inclusion of the primer in EVA so that glass and cellstring-assembly priming may be unnecessary.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe following conclusions can be drawn from efforts to date:\n(1) Vacuum lamination is an acceptable process for manufacturing voidfree PV modules, if matched with correct materials and used with a\nqualified cure cycle.\n\n(2)\n\nConceptual design of a large (4 x 4-ft) vacuum laminator indicates\nthe potential for an inexpensive piece of capital equipment.\n\n(3)\n\nMaterial research by the Encapsulation Tabk of the JPL FSA Project\nhas been applied to actual laminated systems with good results.\nOne laminant system has been developed that shows excellent adhesion and resistance to delamination after being soaked for 7 days\nin cold water.\n\n(4)\n\nGel tests are useful in determining proper cure cycles.\n\n(5)\n\nPeel tests are only partially useful. Most laminant systems exhibit\neither very low or very high adhesion after a 7-day soak in cold\nwater. The soak test may not be a sufficient predictor for 20-yr\nservice life; however, it may be considered as a screening test for\nsystems that should receive additional effort.\n\n(6)\n\nComplete removal of solder flux is presently considered to be\nnecessary to ensure long-term laminant adhesion. A process change\nto avoid solder flux is thereby encouraged.\n\n(7)\n\nHandling damage to cells and interconnects is a major problem that\nrequires more process and automation effort.\n\n15\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.\n\nD\'Aiello, R.
