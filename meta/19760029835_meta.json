Space Tug must be capable of steady-state and transient thermal operation during any given  mission for durations of up to seven days and potentially longer periods of time. Maximum flexibility and adaptability of Space Tug to the mission model requires that the vehicle operate without attitude constraints throughout any specific mission. These requirements were translated into a preliminary design study for a geostationary deploy and retrieve mission definition for Space Tug to determine the thermal  control design requirements. Results of the study are discussed with  emphasis on some of the unique avenues pursued during the study, as well as the recommended thermal design configuration.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19760029835, "endDate": "1975-08-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "AAS, AIAA, IEEE, ORSA, and IMS,"}}, "meetingId": "28d612340b8b4966835cd6fb10b5efe8", "id": "90a513eb8a13414cbc6e1a0874768190"}], "name": "Meeting on Space Shuttle Missions of the 80''s", "location": "Denver, CO", "id": "28d612340b8b4966835cd6fb10b5efe8", "startDate": "1975-08-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19760029835, "id": "d456c75cb01f421585e11bc09a794b4c", "publicationDate": "1975-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
