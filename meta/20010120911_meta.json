A prime candidate for in situ food production is the growth of higher level plants. Research in the area of plant physiology is currently underway at many institutions. This research is aimed at the characterization and optimization of gas exchange, transpiration and food production of higher plants in order to support human life in space. However, there are a number of unresolved issues involved in making plant chambers an integral part of a closed life support system. For example, issues pertaining to the integration of tightly coupled, non-linear systems with small buffer volumes will need to be better understood in order to ensure successful long term operation of a Controlled Ecological Life Support System (CELSS). The Advanced Life Support Division at NASA Ames Research Center has embarked on a program to explore some of these issues and demonstrate the feasibility of the CELSS concept. The primary goal of the Laboratory Scale CELSS Project is to develop a fully-functioning integrated CELSS on a laboratory scale in order to provide insight, knowledge and experience applicable to the design of human-rated CELSS facilities. Phase I of this program involves the integration of a plant chamber with a solid waste processor. This paper will describe the requirements, design and some experimental results from Phase I of the Laboratory Scale CELSS Program.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "Germany", "submissionId": 20010120911, "endDate": "1994-06-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "24th International Conference on Environmental Systems", "location": "Friedrichshafen", "id": "fcf592c28d2d4c4b9798fbad6623d78c", "startDate": "1994-06-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20010120911, "id": "22dadc3402814045ba713b3be238eefe", "publicationDate": "1994-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
