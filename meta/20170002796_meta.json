This revolutionary spacecraft design can have a thickness of tens of microns with a surface area of square meters to maximize area-to-mass ratios for exceptionally low-mass spacecraft. Communications satellites, solar power satellites, solar electric propulsion stages, and solar sails can benefit from Brane Craft design. It also enables new missions that require low-mass spacecraft with exceptionally high delta-V. Active removal of orbital debris from Earth orbit is the target application for this study.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20170002796, "id": "02b5cafa8916428fbcb6368a28d219dd", "publicationDate": "2017-01-31T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20170002796.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20170002796/downloads/20170002796.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20170002796/downloads/20170002796.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20170002796/downloads/20170002796.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
