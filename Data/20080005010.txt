The cutting assembly\nutilizes two parallel extension beams which are shorter than\nthe diameter of a central bore of an annular solid propellant\ngrain and can be loaded into the central bore. The assembly\nis equipped with retaining heads at its respective ends and an\nadjustment mechanism to position and wedge the assembly\nwithin the central bore. One end of the assembly is equipped\nwith a cutting blade apparatus which can be extended\nbeyond the end of the extension beams to cut into the solid\npropellant.\n9 Claims, 3 Drawing Sheets\n\nc\n\nU S .

During radial cutting of the propellant grain 100,\nmovement of blade 18 into the propellant 100 imparts a load\nin the opposite direction, i.e., towards the distal retaining\nhead 16. Configuring the curvilinear surface of the distal\nretaining head 16 to be complementary to the inner surface\nof the propellant grain 100 optimizes interfacial contact and\nhence, distribution of this load Over a greater portion of thi\nThe retaining heads may include a\npropellant grain\npadding\nsuch as rubber, on the\nsurfaces,\nIn the illustrated embodiment, an adjusting mechanism 20\nis interposed between the extensionbeams 10 and the distal\nand without\nretaining head 16, B~ way of\nlimitation, the adjusting mechanism 20 can have a stud 2oU\nwith a Screw threaded outer surface region in cooperative\nengagement with a screw-threaded aperture of the traversing\nbar 12, as is shown in FIG. 3. Reference numerals 20b and\n20c designate a nut and bushing, respectively. Rotation of\nthe screw-threaded adjusting mechanism in the appropriate\ndirection moves the screw away from the traversing bar 12,\nthereby increasing the distance between the distal and proximal he ads.\nAs shown in FIG. 2, a screw jack 22 is positioned on the\nplatform 14 and cooperatively engaged with the blade 18 via\nan optional load cell 24 and bracket 26. Reference numeral\n28 designates set screws for attaching block 30 to the blade\n18, The load cell 24\nthe force applied to the blade\n18 to monitor for irregularities and permit repeatability of\nthe testing. A suitable load cell 24 is an Omegadyne LC4022K with a DP 25-5 meter and PT106F-10-6s connector. The\nscrew jack 22 is driven by an air motor, although other\nmotors and driving mechanism may be used and would be\napparent to those skilled in the art when considered in\nconjunction with this disclosure. For example, an electric or\nhydraulic motor may be used. A flow control valve may be\nused to provide variable control over the rate at which the\nscrew jack 22 is rotated. The motor may be equipped with\na gear reducer to control torque. Design of a suitable gear\nreducer is within the purview of those skilled in the art. As\nis evident from this description, the illustrated embodiment\npermits the operator to control the cutting operation from a\nremote location.\nIn a preferred embodiment, the blade 18 is made of 17-4\nPH stainless steel, and has a curvilinear edge, which preferably is complementary to the bore-defining inner surface\nof the propellant grain 100. As shown in FIG. 4, the blade\n18 preferably has a flat back with a double bevel. Preferably,\nthe length of the lower bevel (A) is 0.125 inch; angle B is\n8 to 12 degrees, preferably 10 degrees; and angle C is 5 to\n9 degrees, preferably 7 degrees.\nA preferred cutting operation will now be explained with\nreference to FIG. 5. Prior to making a radial cut with the\nassembly, longitudinal cuts are made into the propellant\ngrain 100 manually, with the longitudinal cuts being spaced\nby a distance no greater than the width of the cutting blade\n18 so as to avoid tearing of the propellant 100. As shown in\nFIG. 5 , the distance Z (i.e., between the non-cutting edge of\nthe blade 18 and the edge of the propellant 100) was about\n1.55 to 1.60 inches, whereas the distance W (between the\ncutting edge of the blade and the edge of the propellant 100)\nwas about 1.25 inches. The length of the blade was about\n9.75 inches. In this manner, a radial cut of substantially\nuniform thickness was obtained using as little as 204 lbs. of\ncutting force.\n\nThe cutting blade 18 is extended past the ends of the\nextension beams and into the solid propellant 100 to cut into\nthe propellant 100. The cutting blade 18 is driven and\ncontrolled by the screw jack mechanism 22 and the load\nexerted can be monitored by the load cell 24.\nThe foregoing detailed description of the preferred\nembodiments of the inventionhas been provided for the\npurposes of illustration and description, It is not intended to\nbe exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise embod.ments disclosed. Many modifications and variations will be\napparent to practitioners skilled in this art.
