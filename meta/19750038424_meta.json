It is shown that aircraft of 100 to 200 passenger capacity provide the best return on investment in high density markets. The various STOL propulsive lift concepts have the same general trends with field length; their wing loadings are 20 to 30 pounds per square foot higher than the nonpropulsive lift concepts. A comparison of the aircraft under consideration shows that no one aircraft concept will be optimum for all future operational environments.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19750038424, "endDate": "1975-02-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics"}}, "meetingId": "39e1c7a07ba54d1da6924329b3ddfffc", "id": "ce7981705ac342b1a48510adc6826453"}], "name": "American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Annual Meeting and Technical Display", "location": "Washington, DC", "id": "39e1c7a07ba54d1da6924329b3ddfffc", "startDate": "1975-02-24T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19750038424, "id": "bb9d899044614e46958d8ad71251a119", "publicationDate": "1975-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
