Cooper\nGeorge S. Deiwert\nNA$,k Ames Research Center\nMoffett Field, CA 94035\n(415) 694-6213\nIn a multi-ti_"_d ballistic missile defense (BMD) system, the boost-phase is highly\nleveraged because of the greater effectivenessof a single kill. In order to increase\nthe effectiveness of a BMD, it is therefore of extreme importance to understand in\ndetail the observable phenomena associated with a booster and any methods by\nwhich boosters might be more quickly and confidently recognized,tracked, and\nultimately destroyed. The objective of this task was to assist in this detailed\nunderstanding by 1.) developing computer codes capable of simulating flow fields\naround hard-bodies as well as the flow within and eround rocket plumes; and 2.)\nproviding the atomic and molecular chemistry database necessary to accurately\npredict the properties (including radiative intensity signals of these hot interacting\nflow fields.\nTheroretical research in Aermhermodynamics and Computational Chemistry was\nperformed. The Aerothermodynamics research concentrated on developing the\ncapability to simulat9 the combined hard-body flow-field and exhaust plume rocketpropelled missiles. This involved the development of appropriate two- and threedimensional flow solvers coupled with realistic chemistry models for these hardbody configurations with propulsive plumes. The coupling of proper chemistry\nmodels with a reliable flow solver allows an accurate assessment of the importance\nof flow-field fluid dynamics on the distribution of chemical species, their\ntemperatures and thereby the radiation signatures. The efforts of this part of the\nstudy were aimed at these two aspects.\nNozzle/plume flow codes which simulate flow past the hard-body and include fully\ncoupled interaction between the plume and external flow field, have been\ndeveloped and applied to the altitude flight regime and speeds of interest for boost\nphase detection studies. The codes treated both equilibrium and perfect air for\nfully three dimensional configurations (1-3), and chemically reactiing hydrogen-air\nmixtures for axisymmetric flows (4). A three-dimensional adaptive grid capability\nwas developed (5) which permitted efficient and accurate flow-field simulations.\nThese simulations were performed for a Titan 2nd stage configuration for altitudes\nup to 60 km and nozie-to-free-streampressure ratios of several thousand. The\neffect of altitude, pressure ratio and hard-body interaction on the fluid dynamic\naspects of the plume flow-field (temperature, structure, etc.) have been assessed.\nIn addition to these studies, a non-equilibrium radiation code (NEQAIR) (6) was\nenhanced to treat arbitrary gaseous mixtures, including hydrogen and\ncarbonaceous species, to provide detailed spectral resolution from the vacuum UV\nto the far IR wavelengths,and to include the effects of self-absorption. This code\nwas, in turn, used to identify the spectral signature in the nose stagnation region of\nmissile hard-body (7) as predicted by a new two-dimensional flow code (8,9) for air\n\nin thermo-chemical non-equilibrium. These highly successful studies were\nperformed beyond the initial scope of the proposed research.\nThe Computational Chemistry research focused on determining the atomic and\nmolecular database necessary to compute the hot flow-fields around vehicles\ntrave,ng at all speeds and the flow in and around rocket plumes at any altitude of\ninterest. The database generated during this task includes real gas properties for\nboth high and low density flows under equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions\nand focused on the following areas:\n1. Data required to predict both the equilibrium and non-equilibrium\nspectral radiative intensity for wavelengths between the UV and near IR;\n2. Data required as inputs for the Navier-Stokes equations, Monte Carlo\nand Molecular Dynamics methodsto solve for the vehicle and plume\nflow-fields. Tnis data included transport properties, collision crosssections, and reaction rate cross-sections.\nRadiative transition probabilitles have been determined for the First Positive,\n_econd Positive, Wu-Benesch, and Infrared systems of N2, the First Negative,\nSecond Negative, and Meinel Systems of N2+, the Beta, Delta, and Gamma\nsystems of NO, and the First Negative and Second Negative systems of 02+ (10).\nResults have also been obtainedon systems of OH, AIO, ZrO, HCI, AIBr, AIH, AIF,\nand AICI.\nReaction rate constants for the following reactions involving air species have been\ncalculated and compared with experimental data (10):\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n\nN2+O\nO2+N\nNO+N\nNO+O\n\n.....\n.....\n.....\n......\n\nNO+N\nNO+O\nN2+O\nO2+N\n\nPotential energy curves and collision integrals have been calculated for ground\nstate interactions of N-N, O-O, N-O+, N-N+, and O-O+. All nine of the collision\nintegrals needed to determine transport properties to second order have been\ncalculated and tabulated for translational temperatures from 250 to 100,000 K.\nPlots summarizing the calculated potential energy curves and transport properties\nare given in publication 10.\n, Accession\nFor\nNTIS\nGRA&I\nDTIC TAB\n_ounced\nJust 11"Ioat Ion\n\nBy\n\n=\n\n_-Avallablllty\n\ntDlst\n\ni\n\n[]\n\nC odors\n\nSpeol-1\n\ni\n\ni\n\nJ\n\ni i\n\nL __\n\nPUBLICATIONS:\n(1) Feiereisen, W.J. and Venkatapathy, E., :"Computations of Ideal and Real Gas\nHigh Altitude Plume3 Flows, "AIAA Paper 88-2636, June 1988.\n(2) Venkata.pathy, E. and Feiereisen, W.J., "3-D Plume Flow Computations with an\nUpwind Solver," AIAA Paper 8.8-3158, July 1988.\n(3) Venkatapathy, E., Feiereisen, W.J., and Obayashi, S., "Computational Studies\nof Hard -Body and 3-D Effects in Plume Flows," AIAA Paper 89-0129, January\n1989.\n(4) Lee, S-H., and Deiwert, G.S., "Calculation of Non-equilLbrium Hydrogen-Air\nReactions with Implicit Flux Vector Splitting Method," AIAA Paper 89-1700, June\n1989.\n(5) Djomehri, M.J. and Deiwert, G.S., "Three-Dimensional Self-Adaptive Grid\nMethod for Complex Flows," NASA TM 101027, November 1988.\n(6) Park, C., "Nnn-Equilibrium Air Radiation (NEQAIR) Program: User\'s Manual,"\nNASA TM-86707, July 1985.\n(7) Collins, R., Kim, A., Loda, R., and Levin, D., "An Examination of Hard-Body\nRadiation from ICBMs," IDA Paper P-2092, September 1988.\n(8) Candler, G.V., and Park, C., "The Computation of Radiation {rom NonEquilibrium Hypersonic Flows, " AIAA Paper 88-2678, June 1988.\n(9) Candler, G.V., "On the Computation of Shock Shapes in Non-Equilibrium\nHypersonic Flows," AIAA Paper 89-0312, January 1989.\n(10) Cooper, D.M., Jaffe, R.L., Langhoff, S.R., and Partridge, H., "Real Gas\nProperties of Air and Air Plus Hydrogen Mixtures," NASA Technical Memorandum\n1031, October 1988.\n\nII\n\nPERSONNEL:\nDr. David M.
