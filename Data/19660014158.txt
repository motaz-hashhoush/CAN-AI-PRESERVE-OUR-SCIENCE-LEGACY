Lunar Landing Research Vehicle\n\nviii\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe mission of the Lunar Landing Research Vehicle (Figure 1) is to accomplish basic\nresearch on lunar landing and training problems. The basic goals in this vehicle design\nwere to simulate lunar gravity, to provide the "feel" of operation in a vacuum, and to\npreserve the basic geometry of a true lunar landing vehicle.\nThe height, base width, and landing gear configuration are generally comparable to an actual\ntwo-man lunar landing vehicle. The a i r f r a m e is of simple welded aluminum tubing t r u s s\nconstruction. Although this structure is not aerodynamically clean, the design provides p e r formance capabilities adequate f o r the initial research tasks to be accomplished. The\nactual dimensions and weights are given in Table 1, Physical Characteristics.\nThe jet engine is installed vertically and is able to f l y the vehicle to some prescribed\nattitude then the thrust can be cut back to five-sixths\' earth gravity, allowing the vehicle\nto react as if under the influence of the gravity on the moon.\nThe unique feature in the design of this vehicle is the method of automatically providing\nt h i s five-sixths\' earth gravity thrust. Mounted within the a i r f r a m e is a two-axes gimbal\nring within which is mounted the jet engine. In o r d e r f o r the jet thrust vector to counteract five-sixths\' earth gravity, the thrust vector passes through the vehicle center of gravity and is gyro- stabilized to an earth vertical, regardless of vehicle attitude. Provision\nis also made in the automatic control to tilt the engine to counteract vehicle drag as well.\nThis is done to give the pilot the "feel" of operating in a vacuum, that is, without any\naerodynamic effects.\nIn this lunar mode of operation, the descent velocity is controlled by two throttleable\nhydrogen peroxide lift rockets operated by the pilot. There are also rocket motors to\nprovide attitude control f o r each of the three vehicle axes.\nThe landing legs are easily removable to facilitate testing o alternate gear designs. The\nf\nshock absorbers are the conventional air-oil type utilizing a snubber arrangement to minimize rebound effects. They have rubber shock mounts to give them some slight lateral\nflexibility to absorb lateral shock loads. Also, they are fitted with pads as ground contacting elements; however, incorporation of c a s t e r s can be accomplished simply. A\nmuch more detailed description of the vehicle can be obtained from Reference 1 o r 2.\n\n1\n\nThe metering pin design for this strut w a s based on two different conditions. Condition\none was a straight vertical velocity of ten feet per second without any horizontal velocity.\nCondition two w a s a vertical impact velocity of six feet p e r second in combination with a\nhorizontal velocity of three feet per second.\nEven though there is a variance in the total energy of these two conditions, there is one\nstrut that does approximately the same amount of work f o r either condition. Since the\nimpact velocities of the two conditions a r e significantly different, the metering pin\ndesign has to be a compromise between the two conditions. Thus, although the strut\ndoes not have a high efficiency for either condition, it will satisfy both conditions.\nThis report covers a study to investigate the landing dynamics of the Lunar Landing\nResearch Vehicle. This study was made to determine the effects of certain combinations o landing variables on the strut, the leg, o r the vehicle landing performance, and\nf\nto define the limitations of the vehicle under a variety of realistic landing conditions.\nIn addition to horizontal and vertical impact velocities, the other variables which a r e\ncovered in this report are pitch attitude, pitch rate, engine mode o r thrust, ground\nslope, and ground friction coefficient.\nThese parameters a r e varied individually and in combinations that give realistic landing condition. The results have been grouped to show the effect of the initial landing\nconditions.\nThe computer program used in this study is f o r planar motion which means that the\nmotion of the vehicle is restricted to one plane. Because of this, the investigation into\nleg orientation is restricted to 2-2 o r 1-2-1 yaw.\nAppendix A contains the tables of the critical values f o r all the s e r i e s . It is f r o m these\ntables that the operational profiles were plotted. The curves represent an interpolation\nof this data. Thus, if a point is barely within the limits, the curve is drawn close to\nthis point so that the point is also barely within the profile. In a s i m i l a r manner for a\npoint just outside the limits, the curve would be drawn to barely exclude that point.\nThe study described by this report was made by the Analytical Mechanics Department\nof Bendix Products Aerospace Division, The Bendix Corporation, South Bend, Indiana\nunder the supervision of Mr. R. J. Black with Mr. D. C. Irwin as Project Engineer.\nThe computer work was done by Mr. J. Cadoret.\n\n2\n\nTABLE I\nPHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS\n\nDimensions, feet (meters) Overall length . . . . .\n..............\n.....,.,........ ...\nOverall width.\nOverall t r e a d . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nHeight with footpads attached and s t r u t s extended\n(plus 0.62 f t (0.19 m) if c a s t e r s a r e attached;\nminus 1.17 ft (0.36m) if s t r u t s a r e fully retracted):\nOverall. . . . .\n..................\nCenter of gravity. . . . .\n.............\nCockpit floor . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n..\n\n.\n\n.\n\n..\n\n.\n\n..\n.\n\nWeights, pounds (kilograms) P r i m a r y structure including engine gimbal ring\nLanding gear (plus 38 lb (17.2 kg) when c a s t e r s\nreplace the pads) . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nManual controls . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nControl avionics and wiring , . . . . . . . . .\nJet-engine system including hydraulics . . . . .\n......\nRocket system . . . . .\nFlight instruments, radar sensors, wiring,\nand console . . . .\n... ..\nElectrical system\n..\n.\n.\nEjection-seat parachute and breathing oxygen .\nDrogue parachute and attachments .\n..\nResearch instrumentation and telemetry system\nCommunications\n... . .... ...\nNormal empty weight . . . . . . . .\n..\nUseful load at takeoff:\nPilot . .\n.\n..\nJ P 4 fuel (430 l b (195 kg) less 6 min of idle\nat 8 lb/min (3.6 kg/min)) . . . . . . . .\nHydrogen peroxide (672 lb (305 kg) less 60 lb\n(27.2 kg) f o r preflight checks). . . . . .\n... .... .......\nHeliumgas\nEngine o i l . . . . .\n....\n. .\n.\n.. .. ..\nTotal useful load\nTakeoff weight\n. .. .. ... ..\n\n.\n\n.......\n\n. . . 22.50 (6.85)\n. . . . . . . . . . 15.08 (4.60)\n. . . . . . . . . . 13.35 (4.07)\n\n. . . . . . . . . . 10.00 (3.05)\n. . . . . . . . . . 6.50 (1.98)\n. . . . . . . . . . 5.83 (1.78)\n\n. \'. . . . . . . . .\n.\n.\n..........\n.\n. ...........\n. ..........\n..........\n. ......\n..........\n. ..\n.. ...... ........\n..... ... .... ..., . .....\n, . . . . . . . . .\n... ...........\n.. . .......\n..\n. ..\n.\n..........\n.\n. .. ..........\n..... ...... .......,.. .....\n... ........\n.\n..........\n.\n.\n..\n......... .\n. . ..\n... . ..........\n. .... .. . ..........\n.. .. . .\n.. .........,\n\n...\n\n500 (227)\n\n...\n\n140 (64)\n\n.\n\n612 (285)\n\n...\n45 (20)\n. . . 160 (73)\n. . . 800 (363)\n. . . 370 (168)\n. . . 115 (52)\n. . . 115 (52)\n. . . 135 (61)\n...\n20 (9)\n. . . 105 (48)\n...\n5 (2)\n. . . 2510 (1139)\n. . . 185(84)\n. . . 382 (173)\n..\n\n...\n5 (2)\n...\n8 (4)\n. . . 1192 (548)\n. . . 3702 (1687)\n\n3\n\nCOMPUTATIONAL PROCEDURES\n\nA detailed description of the equations of motion is presented in Appendix B. The following brief discussion outlines the steps the computer goes through in order to generate a\ncomplete operational profile.\n\nThe equations of motion of the LLRV system were programmed on a Bendix G-20 computer. A step-by-step time solution was carried out for various initial conditions using\na computational time increment of .002 seconds and a type-out time increment of .02\n\nseconds. In addition to the dynamical solution, all critical variables such as stroke load,\nhorizontal load, stroke, and vehicle stability angle were checked at each time increment.\nIf any exceeded allowable limits, a diagnosis of the particular problem a r e a was automatically printed out by the computer.\nIn order to obtain the operational boundaries of the system, an a r r a y of vertical and horizontal initial impact velocities was s e t up f o r computation. The a r r a y was s e t up in a\ns e r i e s of rays in the V v (vertical velocity) and VH (horizontal velocity) plane. The computer would begin at a specified initial point and compute a complete simulated landing.\nIf the landing was satisfactory, the computer would automatically advance to the next\nset of velocities on the original ray. This would continue until there was a transition\nfrom a successful to an unsuccessful landing. At this point, the computer would switch\nto the next adjacent ray at the s a m e level at which it was working on the f i r s t ray. Depending upon whether o r not a successful landing was found at this point, the computer would\neither proceed to a higher o r lower velocity on this new ray. This would continue until\na transition was again found. This process was continued throughout the complete array,\nthus establishing the operational limitations,\nThe computer program used in this study was previously developed by Bendix Products\nAerospace Division for i t s own preliminary investigation into the alightment dynamics\nof this vehicle which was reported in Bendix Report No. SD-63-2 (870).\n\n4\n\nOPERATIONAL PROFILES\n\n-vH\n\n-\n\n___)\n\nFigure 2. 2-2 Yaw\n\n+vH\n\n-vH\n\nt\n\n__t\n\n+VH\n\nFigure 3. 1-2-1 Yaw\n\nI n referring to the legs of the vehicle by number, the following system was used. F o r\n\n2-2 yaw orientation, (See Figure 2) leg one is the leading leg for position horizontal velocities and leg two is the leading leg for negative horizontal velocities. Therefore, with\n2-2 yaw, reference to leg one o r leg two really refers to a pair of legs.\nThe 1-2-1 yaw orientation (See Figure 3) has leg one as the leading leg f o r positive horizontal velocities and leg three as the leading leg f o r negative horizontal velocities. The\nmiddle legs are referred to as Leg 2. Here reference to Leg 1 o r 3 r e f e r s to just\none leg and reference to leg two would r e f e r to a pair of legs.\nIncluded on the operational profile graphs is the notation f o r the failure mode that determines the boundary of the profile. This notation is "L" f o r excessive axial load, "H"\nf o r excessive horizontal load, "B" f o r strut bottoming, and "T" f o r vehicle toppling. The\nnumber with the letter r e f e r s to the g e a r number using the system described above. Thus,\nif the axial load in Leg 1 is excessive, it is noted as "1L" on the graph.\nIt was considered that a desired operational boundary should include the points of\nV v = 10 ft./sec., VH = 0; and VV = 6 ft./sec., VH = f 3 ft./sec. These three points will\nbe referred to as the "required" points and used as a measure of the s i z e of the operational profiles.\n5\n\nStandard Series\nThe "standard" s e r i e s r e f e r s to Series 1, 2, and 7. These s e r i e s all have a\nlevel vehicle without a pitch r a t e landing on level ground and consider the footpads as\nnonsliding. Series one and two have 2/3-g thrust with Series 1 having 1-2-1 yaw\nand Series 2 having 2-2 yaw. Series seven has 5/6-g thrust with a 2-2 yaw orientation,\nSeries 1 (1-2-1 Yaw, 2/3-g Thrust). - The operational profile f o r Series 1 is limited\nin its entirety by the axial load on either leg one or leg three. This profile is symmetrical about zero horizontal velocity with the right side (positive horizontal velocities) being\nlimited by the axial load on leg one and the left side (negative horizontal velocities) being\nlimited by the axial load on leg three. With nonsliding footpads, any horizontal velocity\nwill tend to tilt the vehicle up on the leading leg, hence this leg will do a g r e a t e r percent\nof the total work than any o the other legs. The profile is determined by when this energy\nf\ninput becomes too large and causes excessive axial load.(See Figure 4)\nThe landing velocity range f o r this series is good and contains the "required" points.\n\nSeries 2 ( 2-2 Yaw, 2/3-g Thrust) - The operational profile f o r Series 2 is also symmetrical about zero horizontal velocity and is limited by the allowable loads on the vehicle. For vertical velocities over four feet per second, the allowable axial load is exceeded, This is caused by the vehicle tipping up on two legs and these legs doing a l a r g e\npercentage of the work. When the energy input into these legs gets too l a r g e the result\nis excessive axial loads. F o r vertical velocities less than four feet p e r second and at\napproximately horizontal velocities of five feet p e r second, the allowable horizontal\nfootpad load is exceeded. (See Figure 5)\nThis profile has an even bigger range than Series 1 and therefore it also contains the\nrequired" points.\n\n"\n\nSeries 7 (2-2 Yaw, 5/6-g Thrust) - This Series 7 profile is very close to the Series 2\nprofile and the comments on Series 2 apply to Series 7. (See Figure 6)\nLandings with Initial Vehicle Pitch\nThere are six series (5, 6, 10, 11, 15, and 16) to investigate landings f o r a vehicle with\nan initial pitch angle. F o r 2/3-g thrust, Series 10 and 11 have a small (*3") pitch angle\nand Series 5 and 6 have a large (*So)pitch angle. For 5/6-g thrust, S e r i e s 15 and\n16 have a large pitch angle. These s e r i e s all have nonsliding footpads, level ground,\n2- 2 yaw orientation, and no initial pitch velocity.\n\nA symmetrical vehicle with initial back pitch (positive pitch angle) and positive horizontal\nvelocity will react the same as forward pitch (negative pitch angle) and negative horizontal velocity. Similarly, back pitch and minus horizontal velocity will give the s a m e results as forward pitch and positive horizontal velocities. Because of this, S e r i e s 5, 10,\nand 16 are the m i r r o r image of Series 6, 11, and 15, respectively. Therefore, these are\ncomments only on Series 6, 11, and 15, and these comments can be applied (remembering the above) to Series 5, 10, and 16.\n6\n\nSERIES 1\n1-2-1 Yaw\n2/3\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n2\n\n0\n\nVH\n\np:\n\n2-2\n\nThrust\n\n4\n\n0\n\n6\n\n- Ft/Sec.\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nVH - Ft/Sec.\n\nFigure 4.

Standard Series With Lunar Mode\n\n7\n\nS e r i e s 6, 11, and 15 have an initial back pitch. With back pitch and positive horizontal\nvelocity, the trailing legs will impact the ground f i r s t ; and with negative horizontal velocity, the leading legs will impact the ground first.\nSeries 11 (3" Back Pitch, 2/3-g Thrust) - The operational profile f o r S e r i e s 11 has\nthe general shape of a trapezoid. The sides are limited by the horizontal load on the\nleading legs due to the horizontal velocity and the pitch motion induced.\nThe top of the profile is limited by the impact velocity of leg one. (See Figure 7) The\nimpact velocity of this leg consists of two components, the translational and rotational\nvelocity of the vehicle, Roughly speaking, if the impact velocity of any leg exceeds ten\nfeet per second, the allowable axial load in that leg will be exceeded. A three degree\npitch angle reduces the operational landing velocity\'s limits from that of a level vehicle\n(Series 2) considerably. This reduction is to such an extent that none of the "required"\nlanding velocities a r e contained in this profile.\nSeries 6 (6" Back Pitch, 2/3-g Thrust) - The operational profile f o r S e r i e s 6 is altered\nfrom that of Series 11 but the limiting factors are the same. That is, the sides of the\nprofile a r e limited by the horizontal loads on the leading legs and the top by the impact\nvelocity of leg one. (See Figure 8)\n\nA s in the case of three degree pitch, none of the "required" landing velocities are inside of this profile for a vehicle with an initial six degree pitch angle.\nSeries 15 (6" Back Pitch, 5/6-g Thrust) - The only change in the initial condition f o r\nSeries 15 from Series 6 is the increased thrust from two-thirds to five-sixths g. This\nmakes the operational profile f o r Series 15 bigger than f o r S e r i e s 6 but with the s a m e\nf\nshape, Again, none o the required landing velocities are included in this profile. This\nis indicated in Figure 9.\nThe operational profiles f o r Series 10, 5, and 16 appear as Figures 10, 11, and 12\nr e8pec t iv e ly\n\n.\n\nLandings on a Small Ground Slope (3 ")\nSeries 12, 13, and 14 cover that phase of the study investigating the effect of a small\nground slope of t h r e e degrees.\nSeries 1 2 (Level Vehicle, 2/3-g Thrust) - The operational profile f o r S e r i e s 12 is very\nclose to the one f o r S e r i e s 11, with the top of the profiles almost identical. The sides of\nprofile twelve are limited to under four feet p e r second f o r downslope horizontal velocities and over t h r e e feet p e r second f o r upslope horizontal velocities.(See Figure 13)\nSeries 11 and 12 a r e limited by the s a m e factors, which were horizontal load on the leading leg f o r the s i d e s of the profile and the impact velocity of leg one f o r the top d the\nprofile.\nOne of the required landing velocities is inside of the operational profile. That one is\nthe vertical velocity of six feet p e r second with a negative horizontal velocity of t h r e e\nfeet p e r second.\n8\n\n1H\n\nvH - Ft/Sec.\n\nvH- Ft/Sec.\nFigure\n\nFigure 7.

At vertical velocities under 1.5 ft./sec. and horizontal velocities over 4 ft./sec. the vehicle toppled backwards. Since the horizontal load on Leg 2\nin this region is near o r over i t s allowable, this portion of the curve blends in with that\nportion that is limited by horizontal load only.\nMost of the down-slope (positive VH) horizontal velocity side of the "triangle" is limited\nby excessive axial load caused by the high impact velocity of Leg 1. At vertical velocities\nless than 3 ft./sec. and horizontal velocities g r e a t e r than 3.5 ft./sec. the profile is\nlimited by the horizontal load on Leg 1.\nThe top vertice of this triangle is in a region where three loads are near their limit.\nThese are the horizontal loads on Legs 1 and 2 and the axial load of Strut 1. Again, none\nof the required landing velocities are included in this profile.\nLandings with Pitch Velocity\nSeries 8 and 9 cover the effect of landing with a pitch velocity of plus o r minus threetenths of a radian p e r second. Series 8, which has a back pitch velocity, is the m i r r o r\nimage of Series 9, which has a forward pitch velocity. A back pitch velocity with positive horizontal velocity will give the s a m e r e s u l t s as forward pitch velocity with negative\nhorizontal velocity.\nExcept f o r this r e v e r s a l of pitch velocity direction, Series 8 and 9 have identical\ninitial landing conditions of non-sliding footpads, 2- 2 yaw orientation, five-sixths g thrust,\nlevel ground, and level vehicle, The level vehicle means that even though the vehicle is\nrotating, all four legs contact the ground simultaneously.\n\n-\n\nS e r i e s 9 (.3 Radians p e r second forward Pitch Velocity, Five-sixths g Thrust) The\noperational profile for series nine is large, having high horizontal velocity capability\nin the s a m e range as Series 7, which is the comparable Series without pitch velocity.\nThe maximum vertical velocity reached is under nine feet p e r second compared to ten\nfeet p e r second f o r Series 7.

There is another part of the profile limited by the axial load on leg one\nwhen the high axial load is due to a n excessive energy input into leg one. (See Figure 13).\nThe vehicle tips up on leg one since it is moving and pitching in that direction, so that\nalmost all the energy goes into this leg. The right side of the profile is limited by the\nhorizontal load on leg one caused by the horizontal velocity and the pitching motion. P a r t\nof the left side of the profile is limited by the axial load on leg two. This high axial load\nis caused by high energy inputs into leg two.\nIn this portion of the profile, the pitching direction is towards leg one with the horizontal\nvelocity in the direction of leg two. This r e s u l t s in a relatively high axial load on leg one\nwhich l a s t s only a short time.

This pitching is caused primarily by the horizontal\nloads, so f o r increasing p the pitching moment increases, making higher axial loads in\nthe forward struts.\nThe strut is bent by the horizontal ground loads. In the following discussion, the term\n"spring-back" r e f e r s to that time when the strut after being bent to a maximum begins\nto "spring- back" to i t s original configuration.\nThe axial load is increased when the leg springs back. The s t r u t axial load due to springback is not a s great as that due to the pitching moment. F o r Lc between 0.5 and 1.0, the\nleg springs back at about the s a m e time as the peak load load is occurring due to pitching of t h e vehicle. This increases the peak axial load f o r this range of p but it is not\na s great a s the peak axial load f o r nonsliding footpads caused by increased pitching of\nthe vehicle. (See Figures 18 through 21)\nFrom Table 2 it can be seen that the horizontal load becomes a maximum\nat p = 1.0, actually g r e a t e r than for nonsliding footpads. FH is almost a direct measure\nof bending of the strut. For both P = 1.0, and p = 10, the footpad could be considered\na s not sliding. Since the bottom of the s t r u t does not move in either case, a measure of\nTable 2.

In both cases, the amount of rotation at the peak, FH is about the same,\nso the difference in the two conditions is the translation of the strut. Because of the\nhigher horizontal loads on the r e a r legs for higher I.1 the translational movenient is\nmore f o r p = 1.0, causing a greater bending of the front leg and hence higher FH in\nthe front leg.\nFrom this data it was decided ground friction coefficients of 0.75 and 1.0 would give the\nbest information on the effect of sliding. It is anticipated that a coefficient under 0.5\nwould result in sliding out of the vehicle without exceeding the horizontal loads. That is,\nthe profile would be independent of the horizontal velocity. Higher horizontal velocities\nwould merely increase the slide-out distance. Also, for coefficients exceeding 1.0, the\noperational profile would be close to the nonsliding case.\nIn Figures 22 and 23, the positive horizontal velocity side of the profiles three and\nfour a r e shown and the negative velocity side would be symmetrical to this.\nThe initial conditions for Series 3 and 4 vary from those of Series 2 only in that\nthe footpads a r e allowed to slide f o r Series 3 and 4, while f o r Series 2, the footpads\nwere considered as nonsliding.\nSeries 3 ( p = .75). - The allowable loads on the vehicle determine the operational\nlimits f o r this profile. F o r vertical velocities above seven feet p e r second there is\nvery little change from the nonsliding case (Series 2 . F o r positive horizontal velocities,\n)\nthis portion of the profile is limited by the axial load on leg one. F o r vertical velocities\nfrom four to seven feet p e r second, the profile is limited by the horizontal load on Leg\n1. This excessive load is due to the horizontal velocity and the pitching motion induced.\nFor vertical velocities under four feet p e r second, the vehicle slides out to a stop without exceeding the loads o r toppling. A s indicated in Figure 22, page 34, this was checked\nup to a horizontal velocity of nine feet p e r second.\nSeries 4 ( p = 1.00). - The operational profile for Series 4 has very little change from\nthe nonsliding case (Series 2) f o r vertical velocities above seven feet p e r second. For\nvertical velocities from seven feet per second down to two feet per second, the profile i s\nlimited by the horizontal load on Leg 1. The limit is about four and one-half feet p e r\nsecond, which is l e s s than f o r the nonsliding case. This was indicated in our preliminary\nanalysis of coefficients o r friction; however, the change is small and still allows horizontal velocities up to 4.5 feet per second.(See Figure 23)\nBoth Series 3 and 4 meet all three o the required landing velocities.\nf\nUltimate Load Series\nSince the landing velocity range o this vehicle was limited mostly by the allowable loads\nf\non it, it was decided to investigate the range of landing velocities using the ultimate load\nas a limiting factor instead of the limit load. Ultimate load is 150% of limit load. This\nwas done f o r a vehicle with an initial back pitch of six degrees landing on level ground\n(Series A) and landing on a three degree ground slope (Series B).\nSeries A and B Increase Load to Ultimate (150% Limit).\n\n- S e r i e s A and B have the\n17\n\n. .\n\nSERIES 3\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nVH\n\n6\n\n-\n\n8\n\n10\n\n0\n\n2\n\nFigure 22.

The reasons f o r reaching the ultimate load in Series A and B are the same as the reasons f o r reaching the limit load in\nSeries 6 and 14. The increase i n load extends the operational limits of the profile but\nretains the original shape; however, the "requirements" of landing capabilities at\nV v = 10 ft./sec., VH = 0 ft./sec., and V v = 6 ft./sec., VH = 3 ft./sec. are not met\neven using ultimate loads.(See Figures 24 and 25)\nThere was one region where an increase in loads did not increase the profiles. That was\nf o r low (under two feet p e r second) vertical velocities and high (over four feet p e r second)\nhorizontal velocities in the direction of the striking leg. In this region the profiles a r e\nlimited by vehicle toppling and a change in loads has no effect on this p a r t of the profile.\nOn the comparison plots of A and B with 6 and 14, respectively, the profile f o r yield load\n(135% of limit) load has been drawn.

An investigation w a s conducted to see how s e v e r e a n engine failure (\'0\' g lift) would be on the landing profile. Since this would be an emergency condition, the investigation was made using\nultimate loads. The two series covering this phenomena are f o r a level vehicle landing on\nlevel ground. Series C has a 2- 2 leg orientation and Series D has a 1- 2- 1 leg orientation.\n\nThese profiles a r e symmetrical about VH = 0 and only half of the profile is drawn. Both\nprofiles indicate a capability of eleven feet per second vertical velocity without a horizontal velocity. This eleven feet p e r second compares to a vehicle hovering two feet off the\nground with an instantaneous l o s s of power o r lift. In such an event, the vehicle would\nimpact the ground in approximately one-third of a second at about eleven feet p e r second\nvelocity.\nSeries C (2-2 Yaw). - As can b e seen in Figure 28, this profile was limited by\nthe horizontal load on leg one vertical velocities up to four feet p e r second. F o r vertical\nvelocities from four feet per second to around eleven feet per second, strut bottoming\nw a s the limiting factor. At the very top, excessive axial load determined the profile.\nThis profile is fairly large and contains all the required points. It should be remembered\nthat this profile is for ultimate loads.\nSeries D (1-2- 1 Yaw). - F o r this configuration, a small horizontal velocity tips the vehicle\nup enough s o that one s t r u t is bottomed out by excessive energy input. This occurs at\nabout two feet per second horizontal velocity f o r vertical velocities up to eleven feet p e r\nsecond. The top of the profile is limited by excessive axial load.(See Figure 29)\n1- 2- 1 Yaw Investigation\n\nIn general, the 1- 2- 1 yaw landing would be m o r e stable but throws m o r e of the load and\nenergy into one leg than a 2-2 landing. Since the operational limits have been defined by\nloads, the 1-2-1 yaw landings have a smaller range than the 2-2 landings. S e r i e s E and\nF are f o r a vehicle with a pitch angle of six degrees landing on level ground (E) and landing on a ground slope of three degrees (F). Series J and K are f o r a vehicle with a pitch\nangle of three degrees landing on level ground (J) and landing on a ground slope of three\ndegrees (K).\nSeries E (6" Pitch, 0" Ground Slope). - Series E indicates limits of roughly three feet\np e r second vertical velocity and horizontal velocities of three feet p e r second in the\ndirection of the striking leg and four feet p e r second in the other direction. The profile is limited by axial load with most of the profile limited by the impact velocity of\nLeg 1. (See Figure 30)\nSeries F (6" Pitch, 3" Ground Slope). - Series F never exceeds two feet p e r second\nvertical velocity. The horizontal velocity limit is three feet p e r second in either direction. Most of this profile is limited by the impact velocity of Leg 1. F o r z e r o horizontal velocity the vehicle is limited to less than one foot p e r second.(See Figure 31)\n\n20\n\nPitch Angle\n0\nGround Slope 0\nPitch Velocity 0\nThrust\n0\nNon-Sliding Footpads\n\nVH - Ft/Sec.\nFigure 28.

The reason f o r this can be seen by an examination of the case when the\nvehicle is allowed to f r e e fall pivoting about the number t h r e e leg. Upon contact of Leg\n1 for Series E, the center of gravity drop is .99 feet and the loss of potential energy\nis\nM g h = 105.5 x 10.67 x .99 = 1110 foot-pounds.\nThis potential energy is converted to kinetic energy in the form of angular rotation about\nthe number three leg.\nThe moment of inertia about leg three is\n\nI = Io +\n\nm12\n\n= 1720\n\n+\n\n105.5 (11.75)2 = 16,300 slug-feet2\n\nEquating the kinetic energy of the rotational motion to the l o s s in potential energy gives\n2 M g h\n1/21 w 2 = M g h o r w2 =\nI\n\nJ\n\n2(11 10)\n= .136 o r o = .37\n16,300\nThe velocity of the number one leg is .37 x 18.9 = 7 feet p e r second.\n=\n\nIn a similar manner f o r Series F the velocity of leg one is 8.47 feet p e r second.\nThis is the overriding factor influencing the impact velocity of Leg 1. F o r the actual\nprofiles, adding to this a r e the translational velocity of the vehicle and the additional\nangular motion due to the f o r c e s on Leg 3.\nSeries J (3" Pitch, 0" Ground Slope, 2/3-g Thrust). - The allowable axial load, i n either\nLeg 1 o r Leg 3,limited the entire profile. The sides are limited to between t h r e e and four\nfeet per second horizontal velocity due t o excessive energy input into the forward leg in\nthe direction of the horizontal velocity. The top of the profile is limited to slightly over\nsix feet per second vertical velocity due to the impact velocity of Leg 1. (See Figure 32)\nSeries K (1-2- 1 Yaw, 3" Pitch, 3" Ground Slope, 2/3-g Thrust). - A s with S e r i e s J, the\nlimit axial load in either Leg 1o r Leg 3 determined the entire profile. The horizontal\nvelocity limits are about three feet p e r second downslope and three-and-one-half feet\np e r second upslope due to the excessive energy input into the leading leg. The allowable\nvertical velocity is limited to less than t h r e e feet p e r second f o r horizontal velocities\nbetween plus and minus two feet p e r second due to the high impact velocity of Leg 1.\n(See Figure 33)\n\nI\n\n22\n\nSERIES J\n3" Back Pitch\n0 Ground Slope\n\nVH\n\n- Ft/Sec.\n\nFigure 32. 1-2-1 Yaw With 3" Pitch\n\nSERIES K\n3" Back Pitch\n\n3" Ground Slope\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\nVH\n\n0\n\n2\n\n- Ft/Sec.\n\n4\n\n6\n\nFigure 33. 1-2-1 Yaw With 3" Pitch and 3" Ground Slope\n\n23\n\nLanding on a 15" Ground Slope\nSeries G (0" Pitch, 15" Ground Slope, 5/6-g Thrust). - The investigation into the landing\nvelocity range on a fifteen degree ground slope was limited to a 2-2 yaw orientation. For\nthis configuration the conversion of potential energy into kinetic energy gives an impact\nvelocity of about six feet per second. This is with the vehicle rotating in the 2-2 plane\nwith two legs on the ground and impacting the other two legs after rotating fifteen degrees.\nIn the ac\'tual profile with the top limited by the impact velocity of these legs the initial\ntranslational velocity is about eight feet per second and only about four feet per second\nwhen leg one impacts. This means that the legs that initially contact the ground absorb\na significant amount of energy before the other s e t of legs impact.\nThe sides of the profile a r e limited by the horizontal loads on the leading legs.\nT h i s profile indicates a good range f o r a fifteen-degree ground slope; however, none of the\nrequired points a r e contained in this profile.(See Figure 34)\n\nSeries H (2-2 Yaw, 15" Forward Pitch, 15" Ground Slope, 5/6-g Thrust). - This profile\nis limited by the allowable loads on the vehicle. F o r downslope horizontal velocity it is\nlimited at approximately four feet per second and f o r upslope velocities, it is limited at\nover five feet per second. The vertical velocity is limited to slightly over nine feet per\nsecond from z e r o horizontal velocity to almost four feet p e r second upslope velocity.\nThis profile has a wide range of landing velocities and contains the "required points" of\nV v = 6 ft./sec., VH = i 3 ft./sec.\nIf the V v , VH axis is rotated counterclockwise 15", this profile closely resembles Series\n2, zero-degree ground slope, and z e r o pitch angle. (See Figure 35)\n\nObstacle Impact Runs\nSix runs were made w h e r e a p a i r of legs struck an obstacle six inches high. Three runs\nwere made with the leading legs striking the obstacle and three with the trailing legs\nhitting the obstacle. The critical values f o r these runs a r e shown in Table 3 .\nThese runs indicated very little difference from the comparable nonsliding footpad c a s e\n(Series 2). In either case (with o r without the obstacle) the footpads could not move. The\nonly difference occurs when the footpads climb over the six-inch obstacle. During this\ntime period t h e r e is a force tending to r e t a r d the movement of the footpad over the\nobstacle: however, this f o r c e is relatively small (defined as the coefficient of friction\ntimes the force normal to this ledge) and lasts f o r a short time interval s o the overall\neffect on the vehicle is small.\n\n24\n\n.\nTable 3.

This reduction is especially large if most of the energy o r loads\ntransmitted to one leg versus being transmitted to two legs.\nThis means that the effect of yaw is significant in a l l c a s e s but most significant when\ncombined with pitch and/or ground slope. This is illustrated in Figures 36, 3 7 , and 38.\nIn the comparison of Series 1 and 2, while the profile for Series 1 i s reduced substantially from that of Series 2, both profiles contain all the required points s o they a r e\nconsidered to have a large landing velocity range. (See Figure 39.)\nEffect of Thrust\nAs can be seen in Figures 40 thru 43, the difference in the operational limitations\nf o r a 2/3 o r 5/6 g thrust is small. This is t r u e for a pitched vehicle o r for a vehicle\nlanding on a s m a l l ground slope.\nEffect of Pitch\n\n2-2 Yaw - The f i r s t comparison is f o r level ground, nonsliding footpads, and a 2-2 yaw\norientation. This is a comparison of Series 2, 11, and 6 as shown in Figure 44. A\nthree-degree pitch angle (Series 11) considerably reduces the operational limitations\nof the z e r o pitch (Series 2) profile. The s t e p from three degrees to six degrees does\nnot produce as pronounced a change as the initial three degree step but does shrink the\noperational range of the horizontal velocities even further. Figure 45 is a s i m i l a r\ncomparison except that the engine thrust is 5/6 g in Figure 45 (Series 7 and 15) and\n2/3 g in Figure 44.\nWithout any vehicle pitch all of the required points are within the limits of the profile,\nbut with a three- o r six-degree pitch, none of the required points were met. In examining these profiles it should be pointed out that for z e r o pitch angle the excessive s t r u t\naxial load is caused by excessive energy input while for a pitched vehicle, the excessive\naxial load results from a high impact velocity.\n\n27\n\nI\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n~\n\nV\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\nH - Ft/Sec.\n\n-2\nVH\n\n0\n2\n- Ft/Sec.\n\n4\n\n-\n\n6\n\nFigure 37.

Effect of Pitch, 2-2 Yaw\n\nI\n\n-6\n\n.\nWith a small ground slope, the effect of vehicle pitch on the operational profile is to\nalter the shape from an approximate trapezoid ( z e r o pitch angle) to an approximate\ntriangle (6" pitch angle). Thus the horizontal velocity range is reduced by vehicle pitch\nbut the maximum vertical velocity is about the same. (See Figure 46.)\n1-2-1 Yaw - Any pitching of the vehicle with this leg orientation reduces the landing\nvelocity limitations. The limiting factor with these conditions is either the leg off\nof the ground at the time of initial vehicle contact will impact the ground at a high\nvelocity or the leg making the initial ground contact w i l l have to absorb a high percentage\nof the total vehicle energy.\n\nAs can be seen in Figure 47,a 1-2-1 leg orientation combined with a pitched vehicle will\ngreatly curtail the landing velocity capability of the vehicle.\nThis reduction in landing velocity range is increased if the landing conditions a r e\ncompounded by landing on a s m a l l ground slope. (See Figure 48.)\nEffect of Ground Slope (3")\nAlthough the ground slope of three-degrees is termed small, it reduces the limits of the\noperation profiles considerably. Comparing Series 2 with 12 (Figure 49) or Series 7\nwith 13 (Figure 50) illustrates this reduction. In the upper portion of the profiles the\nreduction is due to the high impact velocity of Leg 1. The level ground s e r i e s is limited\nin this region from an excessive energy input while the s e r i e s with ground slope is\nlimited from an excessive impact velocity.\nThe limits on the "sides" of the profile, due to horizontal load, are also reduced. This\nis caused primarily from the vehicle being tipped up on two legs for a longer period of\ntime for the ground slope series than for the level ground s e r i e s .\nFor a vehicle with large back pitch (6")the effect of ground slope i s negligible. This\nis illustrated by the comparison of Series 6 (level ground) to Series 14 (3" ground slope)\nin Figure 51. These profiles a r e very close. For horizontal velocities in the direction\n\nof the leading legs, the vehicle is tipped up on these legs in either case s o that the\nhorizontal load inputs are very close. The portion of the profiles limited by the impact\nvelocity of leg one is altered by the three-degree ground slope but the change i s not\ngreat.\nEffect o Pitch Velocity\nf\nI the vehicle lands on all four legs the fact that it is pitching does not have a big\nf\ninfluence on limit landing velocities. The profile f o r a pitching vehicle flattens a t high\nvertical velocities. The rotating velocity adds to the translational velocity of the\nvehicle giving an impact velocity o ten feet p e r second for one s e t of legs f o r transf\nlational velocities less than ten feet p e r second. The changes in the horizontal velocity\nlimitations a r e insignificant. (See Figure 52.)\n\n31\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\n0\n2\nVH - Ft/Sec.\n\n-2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nFigure 47.

Effect of Pitch Velocity\n\n33\n\nEffect of Sliding Footpads\nThe sliding footpads do not affect the operational limits for vertical velocities above\nseven feet per second. In this region, the limit axial s t r u t load defines the profiles\nand the effect of sliding footpads is negligible. For vertical velocities under seven\nfeet per second, the profiles are changed considerably when the effect of sliding footpads\nallows the vehicle to slide out and not exceed the horizontal footpad load. This is true\nf o r Series 3 ( p = .75), and would be amplified even more for lower coefficients-offriction.\nFor some coefficients-of-friction the profile could be reduced as shown by Series 4,\n1.00. However, this is s m a l l and the range of horizontal velocities is s t i l l large,\nabout 4.5 feet per second.

Effect of Sliding Footpads\n\n34\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nFor normal landing conditions of a level, nonrotating vehicle landmg on level ground\nthe landing velocity range is adequate. This is basically t r u e any time all four legs\ncontact the ground initially. Thus landing on a ground slope is not too s e v e r e if the\nvehicle is pitched to contact all legs upon initial ground contact. This is also true\nof a rotating vehicle landing on level ground.\nWhen only one or two legs of the vehicle strike the ground initially, the landing velocity\nrange of the vehicle is considerably reduced. This would occur with a pitched vehicle\nlanding on level ground o r level vehicle (with the gravitational field) landing on a ground\nslope. These conditions place a high percentage of the work into one o r two legs thus\nreducing the landing operational range.\nThroughout this study, including the various parameter changes, the limitation of the\nvehicle, almost exclusively, has been the loads on it. While there could be changes i n\nthe strut to reduce the axial load on the legs, this would not affect the horizontal footpad load, Thus, increasing the strut length to reduce the axial load on the leg would\nnot change the horizontal footpad load appreciably. This indicates that to increase the\ncapability of the vehicle would require an increase in the allowable loads.\nThe series run using ultimate loads instead o limit loads indicated that this increase\nf\nthe velocity range approximately twenty p e r cent. While this increase did not include\nall the required points for all conditions, i t should be considered a major increase in\nthe capability of the vehicle.\nOf course, if any major change was undertaken to increase the allowable loads o the\nf\nstructural part of the vehicle, then the s t r u t configuration should be investigated. This\nwould cover not only increasing the capability of the s t r u t s but also investigating changing the geometry of the legs to improve the landing performance of the vehicle.\n\n35\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.\n\n2.\n\nBellman, Donald R.; and Matranga, Gene J.:\nDesign and Operational Characteristics of a Lunar Landing Research Vehicle\nNASA FRC report NASA TN D-3023, 1965\n\n3.\nI\n\nLevin, Kenneth L., and Decuvel, Roland:\nProblems of Earth Simulation of Manual Lunar Landing.\nPreprint No. 2691-62, ARS, Nov. 13-18, 1962\n\nBlack, R.

A s is indicated theX-Y coordinate system chosen\nis parallel ( X ) and normal (Y) to the ground surface.\n\nThe vehicle motion is assumed confined to translation and rotation in the plane of i t s\napproach path which is the X-Y plane.\nThe only force acting on the vehicle during landing are gravity, thrust of the engine,\nf\nthe shock absorber forces, and the force due to bending o the shock absorber.\nThe axial load in the s t r u t consists of three parts: 1) hydraulic load, 2) air load, and\n3) friction o the internal parts. The formula for the total axial load in the shock absorf\n3 .2\n2\nb e r is: FS = P ( A H ) s /2(cAo) + F A + FF\nThe f i r s t expression is the formula f o r hydraulic load. The air load, FA, a t any stroke,\ns, is dependent on the extended air p r e s s u r e and the stroke s. F o r this study the extended air p r e s s u r e was not changed so that the air load becomes a direct function of\ns and was put into the computer in the form of a table. The friction load FF was\nassumed equal to zero. The horizontal load (FH) due to bending of the strut was calculated from the graph shown in Figure B-2. The formula f o r this graph is given by:\nF o r -ABS a I A B\n\nFH =\n\n- KMT/(L - s)\n\nand f o r a > AB\n\nFH = [- KMT * A B\n\nand f o r a <- AB\n\nF H = [KMT\n\n*\n\nAB\n\n-\n\nKBT ( a- AB) ] / ( L - s)\nKBT ( a + A B ) ] / ( L - s)\n\nFigure B-2.

Footpad F o r c e Diagram\n\nThe time interval of t = .002 seconds proved to be sufficiently s m a l l to adequately\ndescribe the vehicle motion f o r all cases.\nThe method of calculating a and FH were changed to handle those runs where the\nfootpads were allowed to slide. In o r d e r to check for sliding, the f o r c e s normal to\nthe ground, FGT, and along the ground, FGH, had to be calculated. The condition of\nsliding is FGH = p FGV. F o r FGH less than pFGV the footpads would not slide.\nThe computations w e r e made on the assumption that the footpads did not slide and\nFGH was compared to pFGV. I FGH was l e s s than pFGV, the assumption was\nf\ncorrect and the calculations f o r that time interval completed and the program continued\nf o r the next time interval.\n\nIf FGH was g r e a t e r than pFGV, then sliding would have occurred, which means that\nthe position of the footpad has to be found. This can be done by finding the c o r r e c t angle\n65\n\nthat the strut would be bent to fulfill the condition of sliding. The measure of bending\nof the s t r u t , a , had been calculated on the assumption that the footpad did not slide.\nNow a i s calculated so that the condition of sliding is fulfilled.\nThe average of these two values of a is used f o r the recalculations made f o r this time\ninterval. Because of the interdependency of a , FGH, and FGV, it was considered that\njust using a based on the condition of sliding might be a n over-correction of strut bending. The values recalculated f o r this time interval are &, 8, FS, FH, FGV, and FGH.\nThese new values of FGV and FGH are then tested f o r the condition of sliding and the\nprocess o revaluing a repeated until FGH = a F G V within an epsilon value. When this\nf\nhappens the program continues with the other computations and the last values of FS\nand FH a r e used in the equations of motion.\nThere were a few runs made to study the dynamic effect on the vehicle of the footpads\nstriking an obstacle. This obstacle was defined as a six-inch ledge as shown in Figure\nB-4. F o r these runs there was an additional force, FLG, along the ledge when the footpad w a s moving along and in contact with the ledge. This f o r c e would be opposite the\ndirection of movement and equal to the coefficient of friction, Y , times the f o r c e normal\nto the ledge, FGH. When this force, FLG, was acting i t was added into the equations of\nmotion\n\n\\\n\nSurface / H\nGround\n\nFigure B-4. Obstacle Impact\n\nGG\n\nNASA-Langley, 1966\n\nCR-428\n\n'
