Lyles, Chief Engineer\nSpace Launch System Program\nNASA Marshall Space Flight Center, U.S.A.\nAbstract\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Space Launch System (SLS) is gaining momentum toward the first launch of a\nnew exploration-class heavy lift launch vehicle for international exploration and science\ninitiatives. The SLS comprises an architecture that begins with a vehicle capable of\nlaunching 70 metric tons (t) into low Earth orbit. It will launch the Orion Multi-Purpose\nCrew Vehicle (MPCV) on its first autonomous flight beyond the Moon and back in\nDecember 2017. Its first crewed flight follows in 2021. SLS can evolve to a130-t lift\ncapability and serve as a baseline for numerous robotic and human missions ranging from\na Mars sample return to delivering the first astronauts to explore another planet. The SLS\nProgram formally transitioned from the formulation phase to implementation with the\nsuccessful completion of the rigorous Key Decision Point C review in 2014. As a result,\nthe Agency authorized the Program to move forward to Critical Design Review,\nscheduled for 2015. In the NASA project life cycle process, SLS has completed 50\npercent of its major milestones toward first flight. Every SLS element manufactured\ndevelopment hardware for testing over the past year. Accomplishments during 2013/2014\nincluded manufacture of core stage test articles, preparations for qualification testing the\nsolid rocket boosters and the RS-25 main engines, and shipment of the first flight\nhardware in preparation for the Exploration Flight Test-1 (EFT-1) in 2014. SLS was\nconceived with the goals of safety, affordability, and sustainability, while also providing\nunprecedented capability for human exploration and scientific discovery beyond Earth\norbit. In an environment of economic challenges, the SLS team continues to meet\nambitious budget and schedule targets through the studied use of hardware,\ninfrastructure, and workforce investments the United States made in the last half century,\nwhile selectively using new technologies for design, manufacturing, and testing, as well\nas streamlined management approaches that have increased decision velocity and reduced\nassociated costs. This paper will summarize recent SLS Program accomplishments, as\nwell as the challenges and opportunities ahead for the most powerful and capable launch\nvehicle in history.\n\n'
