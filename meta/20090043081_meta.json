The actuator effects movement of the load in a direction towards or away from the elements, by changing a position of at least one of the elements on a surface of the frame that forms the race.", "title": "Stepping flexures", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-24T19:48:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20090043081, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Vranish, John M."}, "organization": {}}, "id": "6dcfeb865e2147d19337056f519cd46a"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other - Patent", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20090043081, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20090043081, "id": "15bc9cc4f3a24a34bcf7fed4afc4e8fe", "publicationDate": "2009-03-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20090043081.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20090043081/downloads/20090043081.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20090043081/downloads/20090043081.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20090043081/downloads/20090043081.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
