Decentralized control makes a system more r e bust and less susceptible to partial failures. The problem is exacerbated on wireless ad hoc networks where host mobility can result in significant changes in the network size and topology. In this paper we propose an ecology-inspired approach to the management of the number of agents. The approach associates agents with living organisms and tasks with food. Agents procreate or die based on the abundance of uncompleted tasks (food). We performed a series of experiments investigating properties of such systems and analyzed their stability under various conditions. We concluded that the ecology based metaphor can be successfully applied to the management of agent populations on wireless ad hoc networks.", "title": "Ecology Based Decentralized Agent Management System", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T11:58:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20050137701, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Peysakhov, Maxim D."}, "organization": {"name": "Drexel Univ.", "location": "Philadelphia, PA, United States"}}, "id": "58ee6ff3ef0044a9b1c89a5ca921cd1c"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20050137701, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Cicirello, Vincent A."}, "organization": {"name": "Drexel Univ.", "location": "Philadelphia, PA, United States"}}, "id": "2580f2f082504092acd4decb1fbd2f89"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 20050137701, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Regli, William C."}, "organization": {"name": "Drexel Univ.", "location": "Philadelphia, PA, United States"}}, "id": "6bf648ad679b46af80af3282487b6807"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20050137701, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20050137701, "id": "107e3c394d4549c29f23d310df1949bc", "publicationName": "Proceedings 3rd NASA/IEEE Workshop on Formal Approaches to Agent-Based Systems (FAABS-III)", "publicationDate": "2004-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20050137691, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Proceedings 3rd NASA/IEEE Workshop on Formal Approaches to Agent-Based Systems (FAABS-III)", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20050137701.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20050137701/downloads/20050137701.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20050137701/downloads/20050137701.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20050137701/downloads/20050137701.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
