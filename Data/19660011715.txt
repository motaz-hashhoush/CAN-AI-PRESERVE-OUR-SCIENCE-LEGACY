Consideratio,_ was then given\nto other packaging techniques which _ould improve operation in this\nenvironment without resorting to hermetic seal\'ug.\nTechniques that\nrequired maintenance tools which could not be used by a suited a_tronaut were not considered in this study.\nThe study approach to the packaging problem was to first _xamine\nmethods for sealing the replaceable modules within the computer and\ndata adapter frame to provide gross protection against the high humidity,zero gravity env\'romnent and then to examine methods for providing\nadditional environmental protection on the replaceable module level,\nespecially at the connectors.\nSince any seaiing method is imperfect,\nespecially over long periods of time, _ study was made of available\ncontact materials and connection techniques to ensure proper operation\nof the module and cable connectors in the presence of the contaminants\nwhich mar.age to penetrate the equipment sealing features.\nFinally,\nconsideration was given to size andconnection constraL_ts on the replaceable module which would affect the physicalorganization\nof the\ncomputer and data adapter.\n\n1.1\n\nLimiting Exposure\nA repackaging study was performed to determin_ the feasibility\nof sealing the computer and data adapter circuits for operatio_ and\nmaintenance in the high humidity-zero gravity AES environment. The\napproach investigated _o provide operation in the adverse environment\nwas _sket sealing with a slight overpressurization\nof the units maintainoa by periodic repressurization.\nMaintenance of the circuits would\nbe allowed by resealing, purging, and-repressurization after repaii-.\nAlmost perfect purging of gasses and water vapor and very short\npurgin_; time periods are feasible by venting the sea: ,d equipment to\nspace.\nThe installation of heaters within the computer and data a_._apter\nto operate auring periods when a cover is removed and during purging\nwould provide additional assurance against the _tccumulation of contaminant gasses and vapors.\nThe circulation of hot fluid through the coolant\nsystem of the unit being purged or repaired would provide protection\nequivalen_ to heaters, as would the application of eXternal infrared\nheaters or dry air blowers.\n\n1\n\n_,\n\nTreatment\nof the internal surfaces of the computer (including\nelectrical\nconnections)\nwith hydrophobic\nfilm would tend to prevent the\ncondensation\nof moisture\non critical areas, and where moisture\ndid\ncondense it would tend to form into droplets\ninstead of thin films.\nThe\nentire interior of the computer could be treated with any of several\navailable silicone sprays on assembly,\nand solid silicone c3mpounds\ncould be applied during maintenance\nin the zero gravity environment\nwhere sprays would be impractical.\nClosed loop pressure\nsystems were considered\nbut will not be\nemphasized\nin the study.\nThe use of freon in a closed loop system (or\neven in a static system) offers several advantages\nincluding moisture\nrepellent characteristics.\nThree approaches to packaging the computer for operation and\nmaintenance\nin the AES environment\nwere examined and compared.\nThese three approaches\ndiffer in the level of packaging to which the\nsealing and purging techniques\nare applied.\nAlthough the preliminary\ninvestigations\nwere related only to the computer,\nthe concepts apply\nas well to the data adapter.\nIn the first approach the entire computer\nshown in Figure 1. Upon removing one of its\nfailed r._odule, the entire computer is exposed\nvironment.\nWhen the cover is replaced after\nand contaminants\ntrapped in the computer are\nrepressurized\nto somewhat greater than cabin\n\nis sealed as a unit as\ntwo covers to replace a\nto the adverse AES enrepair,\nthe free moisture\npurged and the computer\npressure\nwith dry gas.\n\nInthe second and thirdapproaches an attempt is made to limit\nthe degree of exposure during a maintenance actionby sealing\nvarious\nportionsofthe computer independently.Sincea triple\nmodular redundant (TMR) computer consistscf essentiallyhree individualornt\nc\npeters,each channelcan be separatelysealed so thatone thirdor less\nof the computer is exposed each time a repair is attempted. The casting ofthe SaturnV computer is designed such thateach logicchannel is\npartitionedntoeffectively\ni\nfivecellsas shown in Figure 2. Ifeach cell\nis separatelysealed,then a fifteenthr less ofthe computer is exposed\no\neach time a repair is attempted. These second and thirdpackaging\napproaches are illustratedn Figures 3 and 4, respectively.\ni\n"/Tie computer covers can be sealed by means of special gaskets\nor modified O-rings.\nGasket-sealed\nelectronic\nunits have been produced\nat IBM to provide leakage rates as low as 10-7 cubic centimeters\nper\nsecond per inch of linear seal length for ASQ-38, Gemini, and other\napplications.\nThe larger covers, especially\nthose of the first approach\nabove, would preclude leak.age rates as low as this so that periodic\n\n2\n\nScrews \\\n\n(_\n\n_\n\nGasket\n\nI\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\xc2\xa9\n\n_\n\nCoolant Connector\n\n\xc2\xa9\n\n/\n\nII\n\n0\n\n_\n\n0\n\nO\no\n\nMemory Cover\n\nPurgingConnector\n\nr\n\n_\n\nI\n\n"\n\nA,,\n\n-------_ r-\n\nl_\'igure 1.\n\nUnit Packaging\n\nApproach\n\nrepressurization\nof the computer and data adapter would be required.\nFigure 5 shows how the residual gas pressure\nof the proposed designs\nwould decrease with mission time.\nAn examination\n1)\n\nof Figure\n\n5 reveals\n\nthe following\n\ninformation:\n\nThe unit-seal\napproach affords the lowest leak rate (because\nits linear seal length to volume ratio is the smallest).\nFor\nthe same reason, the leakage rates from the memory modules are less than the leakage rates from the logic modules\nfor both the cell-seal\nand channel-seal\ndesigns.\n\n3\n\nFigure\n2)\n\n2.\n\nComputer\n\nCasting\n\nIfthe assumption is made thata module replacement\noccurs on the average of once a week during the 90-day\nmission (10logicfailures\nand 3 memory failures\nper mission),then the time periodfor which the seal is effective\n(defined the period duringwhich the residualpressure\nas\nexceeds 50 percentof the inRialoverpressure) isdetermined by the component failure\nrate of the computer rather\nthan by the leakage ratesfor both the unit-seal\nand channelsealdesigns.

If\nthis effect were taken into account, the curves of differential\npressure\nversus mission time would be grouped closer together.\n\n6\n\n1.0-\n\nFai lure\n\nComponent\n\nFigure\n\n5.\n\nInitial\n\n7\n\nLeakage\n\nRate\n\nIn addition, other maintenance features favor the cell-seal\ndesign. An average of about 9 screws would have to be removed every\ntime a failed module is replaced in the cell-seal\ndesign compared to\n23 screws for the channel-seal\nand 32 screws for the unit_-seal designs.\nThe exposed volume per repair is about as follows:\nVolume\nCover\n\nRemoved\n\nUnit\n\nExposed\nChannel\n\n(in 3)\nCell\n\nLogic\n\n1500\n\n125\n\n25\n\nMemory\n\n15n0\n\n300\n\n150\n\nGasket sea!_ have a tendency to deteriorate\nwith usage.\nEach\ntime a seal is broken and then resealed,\nthe effectiveness\nof the seal\nis compromised.\nFigure 6 is an estimate,\nbased on IBM experience,\n.of the effectiveness\nof a gasket seal versus use in the AES mission.\nRepackaging\nthe computer into independently\nsealed cells provides an improvement\nin ease of maintenance\nand in exposure to the\nAES environment\nduring relzair.\nThe average number of screws which\nmust be removed to replace a failed module is less than a third and a\nhalf, respectively,\nof that of unit and channel sealing,\nrespectively.\nThe amount of circuitry\nexposed during a repaix is less than a twentieth\nthat of unit sealing and a fifth that of channel sealing.\nThe advantages\nof cell sealing over the other two approaches\nare\nobtained at the cost of somewhat increased\nsize and weight, as indicated in Table 1. Since the advantages\nappear to outweigh the disadvantages,\nthe cell or honeycomb approach weuld be recommended\nover the other two approaches.\n\n1.2\n\nConnector\n\nSealing\n\nEven if fairly efficient protection\nof the replaceable\nmodules is\nachieved by sealing the modules within the computer and data adapter\nframe and by limiting the exposure of the modules to the high humidityzero gravity environment,\nsome free moisture and contaminants\nwill\ncollect eventually at the module connectors.\nWhatever packaging techniques are selected for AES applications,\nthe problem of sealing the\nintermodule\nand inter equipment connectors\nagainst the high humidityzero gravity environment\nwill exist.\n\n8\n\n100\n\n75\n\n0\n0\n\n25\n\nFigure\n\n6.\n\n50\n75\nNumber of Reseals\n\nSeal Deterioration\n\n100\n\nwith Use\n\nDesign analysis and exploratory testing of methods of sealing the\nconnector of a replaceable\nmodule resulted in the selection of a gasketsilicone gel technique for the representative\nmodule to be demonstrated\naccording to the study test plan. As shown in Figure 7, a silicone rubber\ngasket was cemented to the face of the female connector.\nThe female\nconnector was then loaded with a silicone gel.

The major\nproblem in thisapplicationas been the porosityof the plating,\nh\nwhich\nleavesthe porous areas of the basic materialsexposed to contamination. Resulting\ndegradationof the contactsurface can occur in two\ndifferent\nways.\nWhen the base material exposed under the pores in the gold plating are attackedby contaminantssuch as sulfur,chlorine,and nitrous\noxide,the resulting\nsulfides,\nchlorides,and nitrates\nwillmigrate\nthroughthe gold pores and spread out over the surfaceof t]_ contact,\nforming high resistancefilms. Although these creepingfilms may be\ncontrolled means of surfacelubricants choice of base material,\nby\nor\nthe primary solution\nwillprobablybe controlled\nporosity.\nThe second phenomenon which porous plating\ninvites electrois\nlytic activity at the base material\nin the presence\nof moisture and\nactive atmospheric\ncontaminants.\nFlaking of the gold plating itself\ncan result as well as formation\nof resistant\nfilms by the migration\nof\ncorrosion\nproducts to the contact surface.\nBoth types of contact degradation\ndictate that the porosity of the\ngold plating be minimizea.\nThe obvious : )proach is to increase\nthe\nthickness\nof the plating.\nHowever, Figure 10 shows that although the\nporosity does decrease\nas plating thickness\nincreases,\nthe curve levels\noff at the higher thicknesses.\nThis c::rve represents\nan average of data\nat IBM and elsewhere\nand is plotted celative to the plating porosity at\n50 mils plating thickness\nas standard\n(or unity).\nBecause of practical\nconsiderations,\nplating thicknesses\nover 150 mils are not being\nconsidered\nat IBM.\n\n16\n\n10-1\n\nS\nJ\n.s\ns\n\n_\n\nGold Alloy {5 % Platinum)\n\n10-2_\n\nE\nl0\n\nGold Alloy (6 % Platinum)\n\nt-\n\n2\no_\n\na\nU\n\n10-3_\n\n- SMSand 24-Carat Gold\n\n10"4\n\ni\n7\n\n0\n\nf\n4\n\nI\n6\n\n_\n8\n\nI\n!0\n\nExposu,ei"ime (Months)\n\nFigure 9.\n\nChange in Contact Resistance\n(Gold and Gold Alloy)\n\n17\n\nVersus Time\n\ni\n12\n\n3.0_\n\n2.5-\n\n2.0-\n\ni\n\n0\n\n.,i-.\n\no\n\n1.5-\n\n.__\n\no\n\n0\nr_\n\n1.0-\n\n0.5-\n\n0\n\n!\n\n0\n\nI\n\n50\n\n1O0\n\nI\n\n150\n\nPlating Thickness\n(Mils)\n\nFigureI0. Porosity\nVersus Thickness\nfor Gold Plating\n\n18\n\n200\n\nHowever, experience\nhas shown that other considerations\nsuch as\nproduction and testing methods tend to predominate\nover actual plating\nthickness\nin determining\nporosity at the higher thicknesses.\nFor example, an increase\nin thickness\nfrom 50 to 150 mils was obtained in one\nc_se by increasing\ncurrent density rather than increasing\nprocessing\ntime, and the resulting\nthick plating had higher porosity than the thin\nplate.\nThe degree to which porosity can be minimized\nis very sensitive\nto the cleaning and handling techniques\nused on the base material.\nPorosity of the final product can be controlled by adequate testing\nof the plating to screen out those samples\nexceeding a predetermined\nlimit.\nFor critical applications\nsuch as AES, the limit can be set much\nmore stringently\nthan the liLlits set for commercial\ngrade platings.\nVery sensitive\nelectrographic\ntestirg methods are used at IBM in which\nan electrolyte-saturated\nfilter pad is wrapped around each contact and\na small current made to flow frgm the contact through the pad. Mter a\nfixed time period, a reagent applied to the pad indicates the porosity by\ncolor test.\nProtective\ncontact coatings have been produced by welding gold\nfoil onto the base contact material\nrather than by plating.\nAlthough this\nmethod has essentially\neliminated\nthe porosity problem associated\nwith\nplating methods,\nit has not proven suitable for commercial\napplications\nbecause of the inherent cost of the process and because of the difficulty\nin _r_.ducing uniform coating thickness.\nThis technique should not be\noverlooked,\nhowever,\nfor low quantity-highly\ncritical\napplications\nsuch\nas AES.\nMultilayer platings are generally more expensive than single\nlayer platings of the same total thickness\nand are therefore\nnot favored\nfor high production\ncommercial\napplications.\nHowever,\nwhen a contact\nsurface is built up from several layers of gold plating, there will exist\nsome misalignment\nof the porosity of the individual layers and a resulting decrease\nin effective porosity over that of a thick coating deposited\nas a single layer.\nEven if the problem of porosity is solved by pursuing those methods which have been rejected for commercial\napplications\nbecause of\ncost or of the difficulties\nin mass production,\na problem may still exist\nin the form of diffusion, which in the migration of base contact material\nor impurities\nthrough the plating material itself rather than through the\npores.\nThe transferred\nmaterials\nform resistive\nfilms on the surface\nof the gold plating in the same manner as those caused by porosity.\nSome commercial\napplications use an intermediate barrier layer of\nnickel between a base material of copper and the gold p_.ating to retard\ndiffusior_. Rhodium was found to exhibit the highest retardation capability\nas a barrier layer but was considered too expensive, too difficult to\nprocess,\nand too brittle for commercial\nuse.\n\n19\n\nThe

corrosion.\nTo\nin relatively\nclose position m the\nchosen for plating and base materials.\n\nIt appears that the choice of nickel as the base material with gold\nas a thick-film\nsurface material\nis best suited for AES applications\nin\nview of all the preceding considerations.\nThe thick film should be built\nup by several successive\nelectrodeposits\nor, preferably,\nby welding\ngold foil on the nickel contact pins.\nVery stringent\nprocess and testing\nmethods must be applied, which will surely result in very high rejection\nrates.\nAlthough the resulting\nconnector\ncosts will be considerably\nhigher than the costs ol presently\nemployed commercial\nconnectors,\nthe pin corrosion\nproblem would be minimized\nfor the AES applications,\nand the costs seem to be justified for low quantity,\nhighly critical\nusages.\nThe resistanc_\n)f an electrical\ncontact is made up of two components:\n1) constriction\nresistance\ndue to the convergence\nof current\nflow lines to points of contact and 2) film resistance\ndue to impedance\nof electron flow by the surface films.\nConstriction\nresistance\nvaries pr_,arily\nwith the resistivity\nof\nthe contact material,\nthe contact load, and the contact geometry.\nFigure\n11 shows the resistance\nof several\ncontact\nmater ials measured\nwith a 1/8-inch diameter,\nspherically\nshaped gold\nprobe tip.\nThe curves indicate the manner in which constriction\nresistance\nvaries with contact load for given contact geometry and\nmaterial.\nNote that some of the curves cross,\nsuggesting\ntbat the\nchoice of contact material\nfor a given connector\ndesign may be made\non the basis of the contact load of that connector.\nHowever,\nconsideration must first be given to film resistance.\nContact films are the result of reaction of the contact material\nwith one or more contaminants\nin the environment\nor absorption\nof\nimpurities\nby the contact surface.\nIn general,\nall metals except pure\ngold will form reaction films.\nGold alloys will form reactant films in\nproportion\nto the amount of alloying material\nas indicated\nin Figure 12.\nThe

analysis\nof certain aspects of packaging and accessibility\nrequirements of man-rated\nelectronic\nequipment.\nOne of these aspects is\nreplaceability.\nRepiaceability\nis defined as the proper restoration\nor substitution\nof like modules in a system or unit in the minimum period of time without the use of any special tools.\nIn the AES computer-adapter\npackaging\nconfiguration,\ni_ was decided that all the modules were to be designed\nas pluggable units.\nEach would have a connector\non its mating face.\nThe AES equipment is basically\ndivided into five major modules:\nlogic\ncircuits,\nmemories,\npower supplies,\nfilters,\nand interfaCe drive circuits.\nAll these modules will be designed as hermetically\nsealed units.\nSimilar units, filled with a nontoxic gas, have been extensively\nused\nin the IBM designed B-52 bombing-navigation\nequipment.\nAll the logic circuits such as thning, control register,\nand arithmetic logic, will be mounted on a page similar to the ones used in the\nSaturn-V Launch Vehicle Digital Computer.\nThe page will be slightly\niarger,\nmeasuring\n4 inches square and will be mounted on a 200-pin\nconnector.\nThis assembly\nwill then be covered with a can and joined\nhermetically\nwith a tear strip.\nThe tear strip has been successfully\nused in the B-52 aircraft\nelectronic\nequipment.\nThe tear strip concept\nlends itself to manufacturing\ncheckout,\ntesting, and depot repair.\nThe sealed can could be made out of either stainless\nsteel or\naluminum.\nBefore a recommendation\nis given, trade-offs\nwould be\nmade of heat transmission,\nweight, corrosion,\nand cost.\nThe canned\npages will be packed with silicon grease,\nRTV, or sylgard to prevent\nmoisture\npenetration.\nThe hermetically\nscaled cans will be made with\nguides on each side to assist in aligning the connector\nand to assist in\nheat transmission.\nOnce aligned the page will be mated by a screw action.\nThe screw\nwill be made a part of the page assembly.\nIts purpose will be to firmly\nset the connector\nand lock it into place by means of a camming action.\nNo additional covers will be used.\nThe power supplies and filter will be approximately\n4-inch cubes.\nPower supplies will be hermetically\nsealed in either stainless\nsteel or\naluminum cans.\nModules will be made self-aligning.\nThey will be\nsecured into place either by a screw-cam\naffa_.r similar to the logic\npages, or a ball-type\ncamming arrangement\nwill be used.\nEnd item\ndesign will depend on size, weight, and accessibility\nin the vehicle.\n\n23\n\nThree double density memories will be required.\nThe memories\nwill be approximately 6 x 5-1/2 x 4-inches in size and will be mated in\nposition using a scheme similar to that used for the power supplies.\nRepairability will be the prime factor in deciding a packaging concept.\nThis is due to the high cost of the memories.\nThe present design has all modules mounted on the top face of a\nchassis.\nIntegral cooling, similar to that used for the Saturn-V LVDC,\nwill be used. The bottom face of the chassis will contain the interconnection wiring. The bottom section will be hermetically\nsealed.\nThe\nestimated weight of the entire package is 69 pounds.\nThe present packaging configuration, discussed in the prec_ :ling\nparagraph, may be slightly altered when the vehicle mounting and installation requirements\nare more completely defined. At present, the\npackage will be installed face up, rack-and-panel\nstyle. Other packaging configurations can be used, i.e., a page type package hinged on\none side or a spindle package mounted in a merry-go-round\nstyle.\nAll these form factors will be fully considered in the final design when\nrequirements\nare fully defined.\n1.5\n\nModule Size\nEvery consideration was given to designing the computer as compactly as possible without sacrificing the maintainability and reliability\nof the equipment. The present data processing equipment consists of\ntwo pieces of hare, rare, a computer unit and a data adapter unit. Every\nattempt in this program was made to combine the equipment into one\nunit and still have a small, light unit.\nThe AES computer and data adapter consist of memories, power\nsupplies, filter, logic pages, and drive circuits.\nEvery effort was\nexerted to combine circuits for minimum package density.\nDifferent\nmachine packaging trade-offs,\nwere considered.\nIt is envisioned that\nthe computer will be fabricated with integrated circuits; however, it\ncan be made applicable to the present ULD circuit family.\nOne significant parameter which is frequently used in machine\npackaging trade-offs is the ratio of required module (page) interconnections per circuit (ULD, flatpack, etc.).\nFigure 13 shows the results of available data on this parameter for Saturn-V and for the\naverage of other technologies including integrated circuits.\nBoth\ncurves show a general trend that the ratio decreases rapidly as the\npacking density increases up to about 50 circuits per module and then\ntends to level off.\n\n24\n\n3.0\n\n1\n2.5-\n\n2.0J--\n\nOm\n\nu\n\n_0\n"=\nu\n\n1.5SATURN-V Technology (TMR)\n\n\xc2\xa2)\nc\nO\nu\nI-\n\n1.0-\n\nAverage of Other Technoloc,_s\n\n0,5-\n\n0\n\n0\n\n5\'0\n\niJ\n00\n\ni\n150\n\nCircuits Per P\',ge\nFigure\n\n13.\n\nInterconne_tions\nper Circuit Versus\nCircuits per Page\n\n25\n\ni\n200\n\n"\n\nThe tota] number of pluggable interconnections\nof a machine can\nnow be found for any packing density (circuits\nper page) by multiplying\nthe total number of machine circuits\nby the interconnection\nper circuit\nvalue for that packing density.\nThe curves of Figure 13 indicate that consideration\nfor the total\nnumber of pluggable interconnections\nplaces a lower limit on tile packing density.\nThat is, interconnections\nlimit the module size to some\nminimum number of circuits\nper module.\nThe vertical displacement\nof the Satarn-V curve from the average is due to the reliability\nrequirement of the TMR machine as wel] as to the difference\nbetween Saturn\ntechnology and integrated\ncircuit technology.\nIn general,\nredundancy\ntechniques should increase\nthe number of circuits\nper page to provide\nan are_ sufficiently\nlarge enough to accomm_late\na reasorable\nblock\nof logic.\nThe curves in Figure 13 were found to be similar to recently\npublished curves by Meade and Geller 1 and by Keyes 2 . They showed\nthe i-eDtion which has been found to hold using SLT technology between\n:he number of connecting pins in a part of a computer such as a card,\nboard, or chassis and the number of logic blocks contained in the part.\nThe curve is reproduced\nas the solid line in Figure 14. Two observations were made.\nThe first observation\nis illustrated\nby the dotted line in Figure\n14. The dotted lin_ represents\nthe ratio of surface volume of a sphere,\nS = lr 1/3 62/3 V2/3, when an interconnection\nis regarded\nas a unit of\nsurface and a logic block as a unit of volume.\nThese relations\nare\nalmost identical.\nIt is as though the logic blocks were closely packed\ninto a sphere and connections\nmade to those blocks that were on the\nsurface.\nIt appears that computer interconneetions\nhave an essentially\nthree-dimensional\ncbaracter.\nThe second observation\nis based on the fact that the human eye\ncontains about 108 photoreceptors.\nIt is connected to the brain by an\noptic nerve which contains about 106 fibers.\nThe point (106 connections), (108 logic blocks) falls on the extrapolated\ncurve of Mead aria\nGeller.\nIt seems quite reasonable\nto regard a nerve fiber as a connection. The relation of a photoreceptor\nto a logic block is less clear.\nIt may be, however, that the amount of data processing\nwhich takes\nplace in Me eye _.s about what a computer designer\nwould have put\nthere.\n\n1R.M.\n\nMeade and H.

As *_..,_o_o_,,,_,1_\n......\nmodules are absorbed\ninto larger modules,\nthe number of inverters\nfeeding out of the module\ndecreases\nrapidly,\nand the curve decreases\naccordingly.\nThen, in the\ndensity region of about 0.05 to 0.10 circuits\nper page (that is, each\nreplaceable\nmodule contains from 5 to 10 percent of the total machine\nlogic), the curve flattens out as the organization\ntends toward "isolated"\nfunctional modules.\nAs the machine org\'anization\nprogresses\nfrom ten\ntowards one module per machine,\nthe curve linearly approaches\npoint 2\nwhere the number oI voters required\nhas reduced to the logic interface\n(memory and input-output).\nOne of the costs of organizing\na machine into individual replaceable modules is the increased\ncircuitry\nrequired.\nThis increase\nis due\nprimarily\nto the additional drivers and decreased\ncircuit-sharing\nimposed by the modular design.\nThe effect is small except for organizations in which the machine is broken into ten or more modules,\nas\nshown in Figure 17.\nFigure 17 is a normalized\ncurve of circuits\nper machine versus\ncircuits\nper page derived from Saturn-V computer design data.

The\ndecrease in insertion forces which it apparently affords, however,\nwould seem to indicate that page connectors with capacities of at least\n15() to 20(} pins may well be feasible.\n\n34\n\n2.0\n\nMACHINE ORGANIZATION\nThe machine orgazfizatJ.on of the Saturn-V computer and t"_2\nApGllo backup data adapter was examined to determine\nits applicability\nto the critical\nphases of the mission as well as its applicability\nto inflight maintenance\nduring the noncritical\nphases of the mission.\nConsiderable\nstudy effort was then expended on modifying those areas of\nthe maci,lne organization\nrepresenting\nserious constraints\noh the\nmission capabilities\nof the computer\nand data adapter.\nThe reorganized version of the computer system included major changes in tile\noscillator,\nmemories,\npower supplier\npower, and timing distributions,\nand internal grounding.\nA TMR/simplex\nmode was developed which\nincorporates\ncertain automatic\n_:witching features\nand provides appreciable increase\nin reli.ability over the basic TMR mode.\nA portion of\nthe organization\nstudy was directed\nat reducing the susceptibility\nof\nthe computer system, to externally\ngenerated\nvoltage transients.\n\n2.1\n\nTMR Characteristics\nOne of the primary objecti_es\nof this study was to determine\nthe\nfeasibility\nof a t,ciple modular redundancy\nconfiguration\nas a solution\nto the short-term\nreliability\nproblem in AES missions.\nTMR is a\nform of reduad,_ncy incorporating\ntwo- out-three\nvoting as shown in\nFigure 19.

Some of these signals are generated\nunder program control; others are generated\n_utomatically\nby special\nalarm detect;_on circuits.\nThe data adapter can accept and generate pulse train inputs

interrupt\nsignals which\nare flags for branching into different subroutines.\nThese functions are\nperformed\nby counters\nand associated\nlogic.\nThirty-two\ncounters\nare\nrequired.\n{\n\n,\n\nThere are 15 input counters serving various input functions.\nInput pulses occur at varying and unpredictable\nin+ervals in several of\nthe channels and are therefore\nbuffered,\none pulse per channel,\nto\nawait sampling in the processor,\nthe buffer positions\nare continuously\nsampled consecutively\nat "l-clock pulse intervals\nto determine\nwhether\nan input is present.\nA 5-bit grey code counter is used to step from input to input simultaneously\nwith normal program\ncycles in the processor.\nUpon detecting an input pulse requiring\nstorage,\nthe grey code\ncounter is stopped, and its value is transferred\ninto the five low-order\npositions of the processor\noperand address\nregister.\nThe high-order\nbits are forced to zeros.\nThis Jrms the memory address for that input counter.\nA memory-steal\ncycle is then executed incrementing\nor\nshifting the pulse into its memory location.\nThe input buffer for that\npulse is then reset to await the arrival of another input pulse.\nThere are 17 output counters serving various internal tim._ng\nand output functions.\nWhen output pulses from any counter location are\nrequired,\nthey occur at a fixed rate of 3200 pps.\nThis means that a\npulse occurs every 312 microseconds\nfrom the counter involved.\nIt is\nconvenient to service these counters using the same grey code address\ncou_ter used for T8 and the input counters.\nFor these latter counters,\nthe grey code counter steps through 16 states and repeats.\nThis operation is continuous except that every 312 microseconds\nan internally\ngenerated timing pulse occurs causing the address\ncounter to extend\nits count from 16 to 32 to service the 16 other output counters.\nEach\noutput counter has a buffer latch which ij set or reset durh_g t:m previous memory-steal\ncycle associated\nwith the counter.\nIt is also set by\nthe central processor\nPIO operation used to initially load data in the\noutput counter memory location.\nThe added 16 counts from the address\ncounter are used to sample the state of these buffer latches in the same\nmanner as for the input pulses.\nThe address counter al_o forms the\nmemory address for memory-steal\noperations\nas described\nfor the input counters.\nAny buffer latches that are set when addressed\nrequire\n\n56\n\noutput pulses to be generated\n(one per channel per address pulse).\nWhen all 16 eutput counters\nhave been sampled and processed\nas required, the address counter will again process\nthe inputs repeatedly\nuntil interrupted\nby another 3200-pps pulse.\nThis operation is repeated\nevery 312 microsecouds\nuntil the counter memory locations have been\ncleared,\nthus freeing them for l_adiag more output data.\nThe downlink implementation\nprovides for transmitting\n_ one bit\nidentifier\n(word order bit) followed _y 32 information\nbits.\nT: is information group will be two 15-bit accumulator\nwords, each followed by a\nseparate\nparity bit.\nThe downlink output is coutrolled\nby the number of synchronization pulses received from the pulse code modulator\n(PCM) telemetry\nand the manner in which the processor\nis programmed.\nTherefore,\nthe output can be one word, one word redundant,\nor two words, depending upon how the dowulink registers\nare loaded and the number of data\nsynchronization\npulses gated into the aata adapter.\nIf only one word is\nsent out, the second load PIO operation\nis still re.quired to advance the\noutput data from the load register\nto the shift register.\nThis PIO word\nwill contain all zeros.\nThe downlink operation sequence is initiated b\xc2\xa5 an input pulse\n(downlink end) which causes a processor\nprogram\ninterrupt.\nDuring\nthe interrupt\nsubroutine,\nthe processor\nperforms\na PIO ogeration to set\nthe downlink word order bit to a one or zero as required.\nThe processor then loads the first downlink word, which goes into the load register.\nThis operation\nis followed by another PIO to transfer\nthe first\ndownlink word to the shift register\nand load the second downlink word,\nif required,\ninto the load register.\nThis completes\nthe processor\ninterrupt subroutine:\nThe data remains\nin storage registers\nuntil the pulse\ncoded modulation\n(PCM) telemetry\nsends the next series of control and\nsynchronization\npulses required\nto send the data to the PCM equipme_._L.\nWhen the first 15-bit word has been transferred\nout of the shift register, a iive-stage\ncounter in the downlink timing and control logic causes\na parity bit to be generated\nfor [hat word.\nIt also causes the second\ndata word to be transferred\nfrom the load register\nto the shift register.\nWhen this second word has been transferred\nto the PCM telemetry,\nits\nparity bit is also generated\nand sent out.\nThere are two downlink data word transfer\nrates:\n51.2 kpps and\n1.6 kpps.\nThe rate used is determined\nby the rate of the synchronization pulses received\nfrom the PCM equipment.\n\n57\n\nThe data adapter contain\nthe system power supplies.\nThese\nsupplies

redundant 28-volts dc vehicle power sources.\nPower sequencing\nand input power transient\nprotection\nare provided to prevent loss of data\nstored in the central processor\nmemories.\nIn certain phases of the mission there may be relatively\nperiods when it will not be necessary\nfor the Apollo computer\nform any calculations.\nThe only use for the computer during\nJ\n\nlong\nto perthese\n\nperiods is to keep track of real time and provide continuous\ntimiug signals for other vehicle subsystems.\nSince these are only minor functions, a standby power supply is provided to furnish power only for the\nlogic associated\nwith these functions.\nDuring standby operation the oscillator\nand clock logic of the\ncentral processor\nis used to drive a group of clock drivers\nwhich are\nassociated\nonly with the standby logic.\nReal time is derived from the pulse timing logic, the lowest frequency of which is 800 cps.\nThis 800-cps signal is used as an input to\ncounter T2. The overflow of this counter is used to increment\ncounter\nT1. The two counters from the low and high-order\nbits of real time,\nrespectively.\nIt is, therefore,\npossible to record time to (1.25 x 10-3)\n(230 ) seconds or approximately\n15 1/2 days.\nTime recording\nduring standby requires the operation of the pulse\ntiming logic, counter T1, counter T2, add/subtract\nlogic, and processor memory.\nMemory must operate because the contents of counters\nT1 and T2 are stored in memory locations.\n\n>\n\nStandby power is established\nby request of the operator.\nAn interlock system was designed to prevent the operator from inadvertently\nrequesting\nthe standby mode.\nThe first step required to initiate standby\nis to insert the proper key code.\nWhen the ce_.tral processor\nrecognizes\nthis code, it prepares\nitself and the discrete outputs for shutdown.\nAfter this is completed,\nthe central processor\nsets the discrete output\nin channel 13, bit 10. This signal is an enable signal which energizes\nthe standby switch on the DSKY. Depressing\nthe standby switch in conjunction with the enable signal causes the power supply to start turning\noff main power.\n\n58\n\n2.3.3\n\nReliability\n\nModels\n\nA reliability\nmodel for t,,e basic computer subsystem\nconsisting\nof the Saturn-V computer and a redundant version of the Apollo backup\ndata adapter was derived and used as a basic reference\nwith which to\ncompare the reliability\ncharacteristics\nof the reorganized\ncomputer\nand data adapter.\nThe model includes "equivalent time" factors which modify real\ntime to include the effects of environmental\nseverity factors and nonoperating failure rates.\nThe equivalent time period of the most critical\nmission phase is defined as:\nm\n\nT c = max (T i Ki)\ni= 1,\nwhere T i is the actual time period of the ith phase, m is the number of\ncritical mission phases, and Ki is the environmental\nseverity factor\nfor the ith phase.\nThe simplex reliability\nmodel for the most critical\nmission phase is defined as\nR C = exp (- kop Tc),\nwhere k op is the operating failure rate of the equipment.\nThe equivalent operating time and standby time is generated for each of the three\nassumed duty cycles from the expressions\nn\nTE\n\n=\nop\n\nTE non-op\n\n_\n:= 1\n\nTop i K.\n\nn\n= _\nT\ni = 1, non-op\n\nwhere T E op is the equivalent\nthe equivalent mission\noperating and standby\nthe ith phase, and n is\nliability model for the\n\ni\n\nK.\n1\n\nmission\n\noperating\n\nT E non-op\n\nis\n\nstandby time, Top i and T non-op i are. the actual\ntimes, Ki is the environmental\nseverity factor for\nthe number of mission phases.\nThe simplex retot_ mission is defined as:\n\nRm = exp-(k op TE op + k non-op\nknon-op\n\ntime,\n\nis the standby failure\n\nTE non-op),\n\nrate of the equipment.\n\n59\n\nThe computer and data adapter operate effectively\nin series\nreliability\ncomputations\nso the model for the computer subsystem\nsimply\nRss\n\nfor\nis\n\n= Rco Rda,\n\nwhere R\nis the computer\nliability, c\xc2\xb0\n\nreliability\n\nand Rda is the data adapter\n\nre-\n\nThe computer is composed of a simplex oscillator,\nTM_R logic,\nand duplex memories.\nThese three elements\noperate effectively\nin\nseries so the reliability\nmodel for the computer\nis\nl\nRco = Rosc\n\nRlog Rmem.\n\nThe oscillator\nfor the Saturn-V\nmodel for this device is\nR\n\nOSC\n\n= e\n\ncomputer\n\nis simplex\n\nso the reliability\n\n- k osc T\n\nThe reliability\nof the computer\npressed\nmathematically\nas\n\nRlog = (Rtg) (RTMR)\n3\n\nlogic\n\n(including\n\ntiming)\n\ncan be ex-\n\n+ _ (Rtg)2(I - Rt)(Rsim)2 ,\n\nwhere Rtg is the reliability the simplex timing generator,RTM R is\nof\nthe reliability the TMR logic,and Rsim isthe reliability one\nof\nof\nchannelof the TMR logic.

predicted\nreliability\nof the TMR memory,\nit is required that the\nerror detection circuitry\nin the dual memory have the capability\nof\ndetecting nearly all first failures\nthat may occur in the memory module,\ni. e., 99.8 percent of all first failures.\nThe dual memory model utilized for this prediction\ncontains a minimum of error detection circuil_ry,\ni.e..\none additional memory plane, inhibit driver,\nsense amplifier,\nand\none additions2 bit position in the MBR for a one-bit parity check and\ncould not b_ expected to detect 99.8 percent of all expected fLrst failures\nin the memory module.\nA memory error detection utilizing a one-bit parity check as the\nonly means of error detection\ncould not be expected to detect more than\napproximately\n85 percent of t21e expected first failures\nin the memory\nmodule.\nOf this 85 percent,\napproximately\n86 percent comprise\na\nfailure mode where detection is repeatable,\nand approximately\n19 percent of the 85 percent involves failures\nwhich are by chance detected by\nparity checking and whose detection by parity checking is not repeatable,\ni. e., failure woutd not be detected every time an error occurred.\nTo\nbe able to predict approx;mately\n100 percent detection of the expected\nfirst failures in the memory module would require\nvery sophisticated\nmemory error detection circuitry\nwhich, in turn, would further degrade the predicted\ndual memory reliability\nnumber.\n\ni\n\ni\n\n79\n\nThe reliability\nprediction for the TMR memory was pessimistic\nin that it assumes that no compensating\nfailures can occur, i.e., failure\nis assumed if two or more bits at the same address have failed.\nThis\nis probably more realistic\nthan assuming 50 percent of these failures\nare compensating.\nThe reliability\nadvantage of Tiv.._cR\nmemories is further strengthened by the feasibility\nof a TMR/simplex\nmode of operation and by be_er\noperation in a disruptive transient environment.\nTra._.sient protection\ntechniques for TMfl memories are discussed in Section 2.10.\n\n)\n\n2.6\n\n"_ower Supplies\n\nand Distribution\n\nA guidance computer/data\nadapter designed for a long term,\nmanned mission requires an internal power system with performance\ncharacteristics\nfar surpassing\nthose required in forerunning guidance\nsystems.\nTo meet these requirements,\nthe power system must be\ndeveloped around a proven redundancy concept.\nMany design approaches have appl_.ed redundancy techniques at the component,\ncircuit,\ncr subsystem level.\nTheir relevant merits are discussed\nin the following paragraphs.\n\n2.6.1\n\nDesign Approaches\nBecause of the inflight maintenance\nrequirement,\ncomponent redundancy may not be applicable\nexcept to assure reliability\nof m individual building block used within a system.\nComponent redundancy,\nin\nthis case, would affect only the replacement\ninterval for building blocks.\nOn the other h_nd, a circuit redundancy\nconcept would be a valid approach only if the power distribution\nsystem is made highly reliable\nand various load failures\ncannot cause secondary\nfailures\nin the remainder of the system.\nBoth component and circuit redundancy\ntechniques\ncarry cost,\nweight, and volume penalties\nin their usual form.\nIn general,\ncomponent redundant circuits\nrequire four components\nfor each circuit element.\nIn addition,\nthe use cf component re_,mdancy\nfor linear circuits\nis an extremely\ndifficult design problem.\n\nx...\n\nC\'.rcuit redundant systems get.orally employ simple

For the TMR logiccircuits,\nthe power system containsthree independent\npower supplycircuits\nand three independentdistribution\nsystems. This can take the form of\na triple\nduplex or a triple\nsimplex configuration.Inthe triple\nduplex\ndesign,each of the three logicchannels receives independent\npower\nfrom two of the three power systems. In the triple-simplex\ndesign\neach logicchannelreceives independent\npower from a singlesource.\nInthe eventthatone of the power suppliesfail,the TMR logicloads\nwilloperate in duplexbut withoutthe capability making a true majorof\nitydecision. This may not be desirable\nfrom a relLgb_ity\nstandpoint.\nFor a littlextravolume, weight, and cost penalty,a triplee\nduplex design can be realized. This configuration,\nshown Lu Figure 33,\nresultsin double-sized,power supplies,but the computer adapter\nlogicconfiguration\nremains TMR, even with a power supply failure.\nA disadvantageof eitherthe triple-simplex triple-duplex\nor\nsupplyconfiguration\nisthatprotection required against\nis\novervoltage.\nA power supplyfailuremust not resultin stress failures\nwithinthe\nlogicchannel loads. For thisreason, the controlportionsof each\npower supply are made duplex redundant. The converterportionsmake\nuse of circuit\ntechniquesdevelopedfor the Saturn-V Launch Vehicle\nData Adapter power supplies. These are designed not to fail an\nin\novervoltagemode.\nTo preventpower supply I_\nad-sharingproblems, itis necessary\nfor each feedback controlloop to sample both the isolationiode input\nd\nvoltageand the respectivebus voRage. With thisarrangement, a short\ncircuitin _m individualistribution ystem willnot cause excessive\nd\ns\nvoltageriseson the other distributionines. Further precaution\nl\nagainstload sharingproblems can be takenby providingenergy coupling between primary power sources. This can be accomplished by\nusing a multiple-winding,\ncommon core filter\ninductorto couple transientenergy between independentpower lines,thereby stabilizinghe\nt\nprocess of transferring\nloads between power supplies.\n\ni\n\nJ\n\n!\n:\n!\n\ni\n\n81\n\nPS1\n\nFigure\n\n2.6.2\n\nPower\n\n33.\n\nTriplex-Duplex\n\nPower\n\nSupply Switching\n\nThere are three\nswitching arrangement\n\nreasons for providing\nbetween the primary\n\n1)\n\nTo provide proper\nsuch as destructive\n\n2)\n\n"\n"_\n\nSystem\n\nTo permit removal\nthe supply.\n\n3)\n\nTo permit removal of a section\npower failure in the load itself.\n\nsome form of a power\nsources\nand the loads:\n\nturn-on arid turn-off\nreadout memories.\n\nsequencing\n\nof a power supply because\n\n82\n\nfor loads\n\nof a failure\n\no_ the load because\n\nof a\n\nin\n\nThe switching combinations\nthat are possible between power supplies and loads require the use of remote error sensing circuits.\nThese\nshould be designed to insure proper voltage regulation\nat the various\ndistribution\nloads.\nTo switch the power supply outputs,\nthe isolation diodes shown in\nFigure 33 can be replaced\nby power transistors.\nThe base drive circuitry for these power switches requires\nsome auxiliary\nvoltage\nsources to insure sufficient forward bias for "on" switches and to prevent base-emitter\nbreakdown of "off" switches.\nThe remote sensing\nlines must also be switched or otherwise\ndisabled.\nOne of the several\ntechniques\nused for low-level analog switching may prove to be suitable.\n\n2.6.3\n\nRecommendations\nIn summary,\nthe power system described\ninciudes three simplex\npower supplies,\nduplexed into three independent\npower distribution\nsystems using power switching transistors.\nEach simplex supply includes duplex error amplifiers\nto prevent overvoltage\nfailures.\nAll\nremote sense lines are capable of being switched to permit removal of\nany power sapply or any load.\nA single power supply failure results\nin two simplex powered loads and one duplex powered load.

A reliability\nimprovement\nshould be possible\nby switching out one of the remaining\nunfailed channels after a failure\nhas occurred\nin a module and thereby operating that module simplex\nwhile the remainder\no\xc2\xa3 the computer and data adapter operate TMR.\nThe choice of which of the good channels to switch out is arbitrary\n\n,\n\n2.8.2\n\nBasic\n\nTMR/Siraplex\n\nReliability\n\nThe relir\'\nity of a TMR module in the TMR/simplex\nmode can\nbe derived by aaaing the probabilities\nof operating\nstates as was done\nfor the basic TMR mode in Section 2.1.2.\nA somewhat more rigorous\nmethod was used, however,\nas follows.\nDenote the phase or mission time period for which the reliability\nis to be calculated\nby the constant T and operating time within this\nperiod by the variable\nt. Assume that a first malfunction\noccurs at\nsome time r during the phase or mission,\nwhere 0_< r _<T.\nThe probability\nthat one or more maFunctions\nwill occur by\ntime t, assuming\nconstant failure rate X, can be represel_.ted by the\nunreliability\nexpression\nU=(l-e\nThe probability\n\n-3k\n\nt\n\n).\n\ndensity\n\n_lUI\nu -- _"j t*r\n\nof a failure\n\nat the specified\n\ntime r is\n\n= 3X e -3 kr\n\nThe probability\nthat a failure\ndr, at a specified time r is\nudr\n\noccurring\n\nwill occur during any increment\n\n= 3k e\'3krdr\n\n9"/\n\nof time,\n\nNow assume that, when the first failure occ_trs, the faulty channel of\nthe module plus one of the good channels _re switche\xc2\xa2_ off.

Accordingly,\nis\nthe contents of each memory are restored\ncorrectly\nhad a\ndisagreement\noccurred in any one.\n\n;\ni\n,\ni\n\nMemory - The memory proposed for the AF..S is a double\ndensity Saturn-V array which uses conventional toroidal\ncores.\nUnlike the Saturn-V system, the memories will not\npossess the duplex capability.\nThis scheme will be replaced with a TlVIR organization\nthat will also allow simplex\noperation of the th:\'ee redundaut computers.\nEach memory\nwill contain 8192 28-bit words and will be augmented with\nan on-board memory load capability.\nMemory cycle time\nwill be 2.5 nanoseconds.\n\n2)\n\nLogic Circuits- The logiccircuits\nhave approximately 50\nnanoseconds delay per stage. Integrated\ncircuits\nare available from many sources which would satisfy this requirement.\n\nI\n\ni\n\n1\n\n103\n\n3)\n\nJ\n\nDelay Lines - The delay lines have a 2 megacycle\nbit rate.\nThis requirement\nmay be satisfied\nin a number of ways.\nThe present Saturn-V computer uses two glass delay lhms\nwith four channel3 of mformatiou\nper line.\nFor an equivalent 2-megacycle\nbit rate, eight of these lines would be required in the "times four" computer.\nAn integrated\ncircuit\nshift register\nusing field e_fect transistors\n(FET) is available with a rehable\noperating\nrange from 50 kilocycles\nto 2\nmegacycles.\nThese shift registers\nduplicate the function of\nthe glass delay lines and have the advantage of being much\nsmaller\nand less critical to variations\nin clocking frequency.\nEach computer will use eight of these devices to provide the\nrequired arithmetic\nregisters.\n\nThese changes will allow the centrai computer to perform\ncomputations\npresently\ndone on the I/O processor\ncr the backup\ndata adapter.\nA block diagram of the information\nflow is shown\nFigure 45.

This is\ncompensated for in the number of voters required inthe interface the\nto\nrest of the system. For the system requirements, 121 interface\nvoters\nare required.\nThese are packaged separately\nfrom the six logic modules.\nTable 12 indicates\nhow the data adapter was partitioned\ninto six modules\nand the chip or flat pack component count and interconnection\nrequirements.\nIt should be noted that these modules are approximately\nthe\nsize of the computer modules.\nThis is an important\nconsideration\nff\nthe same packaging philosophy is to be applied to the whole computerdata adapter complex.\n\nJ\'\n\nThe data in Table 12 is based on partitioning\nthe data \'adapter into\nsix unique modules.\nIt is a possibility\nthat one or two of these modules\ncould be standardized\nsuch that only four module types, would be required.\nThis standardization\nwould be at the expense of a slight increase\nin module size and interconnections.\nThe obvious savings are in the\nspares required to be carried for inflight maintenance.\nTo preserve the symmetry of the replaceuble\nsimplex modules,\nthe data adapter interface\nvoters are packaged separately.\nThese circuits convert the TMR output signals to a single line.\nCircuit reliability was increased\nthrough use of redundant and/or quaded components so as not to degrade the system reliability.\nThe results of the exploratory\n(Phase I) and evaluation (Phase II)\ntesting effort described\nin Section 6 indicated that adequate connector\nsealing could be maintained\ndur} :g operation and maintenance\nin the\nhigh humidity-zero\ngravity environment\nwhen resorting\nto over-all\nunit\nsealing of the computer or data adapter.\nThe reconfigt,xed\ncomputer\nand data adapter were packaged as a unit for the AES application;\nthe\nphysical organization\nis illustrated\nby Figure 47.

computer using the\nIBM 7090 logic simalator\nto determine\nthe error detection and fault\nisolation capabilities\nof the computer.\nSince Saturn-V test programs\nwere found to be adequate for simulation\npurposes,\nthe appreciable\ntest\nprogramming\neffort which was visualized\nat the start of the study was\nnot required.\nThe test programs\nwere used to operate the logic simalator which simulated\nselected failure conditions and produced error\nsymptoms.\nError detection is accomplished\nin the Saturn-V computer by\nmeans of disagreement\ndetectors\nwhich sense a difference\nin the three\nchannels feeding a voter.\nThese disagreement\ndetectors\nconsist of\nthree-way\nexclusive OR circuits.\nSince the Saturn-V computer contains\napproximately\n200 disagreement\ndetectors,\nthe outputs of groups of\ndetectors\nare "OR\'d together to provide 13 signals to an error monitor\nregister\nin the data adapter.\nThe inputs to the detectors\nare clocked to\nallow time for the input sig,mls to reach steady-state\nconditions before\nsampling.\nThe logic simulation\nof the basic computer confirmed\nearlier\nsimulation\nresults with the Saturn-V computer that indicated a 99percent detection\nefficiency based on the disagreement\ndetectors.\nThat\nis, once the logic was screened\nfor undetected failures\ninvolving redundant logic elements\nor circuits\nwhich were included in the computer\ndesign to conserve\npower or to ensure against marginal\nconditions,\n99-percent\nof the component failures\ninjected into the simulator\nwere\ndetected by the disagreement\ndetectors\nwhen the simulator\nwas being\noperated by a standard\noperation code exerciser\ntest program.\nIn fact,\nextensive propagation\nof errors through the computer tended to be\nsensed by many detectors\neven though these detectors\nwere not directly\nassociated\nwith the logic containing\nthe fault, thus masking the source\nof the error by overdetection.\nAlthough the computer was judged on the basin of the logic simulation results to possess adequate error detection\ncapabilities,\nfault\nisolation under AES mission conditions was judged inadequate in several\nareas.\nAn assumption\nof the study was that error detection and fault\nisolation should necessarily\nbe automatic.\nSince the disagreement\ndetectors\nindicate only that there is a difference\nin the information\ncontained in the three channels and not which channel disagrees\nwith the\nother two, channel or module switching would have to be performed\nby\nthe astronaut\nto isolate the error to a replaceable\nsimplex module.\nAlso, since the voters existed at the module interfaces\nand since the\n\n123\n\ndetectors\nare\ndisagreement\nvoter failure\nthe sdsoected\n\npositioned\nat the voter inputs, only clever analysis of

a result,\ndetectors\nare\nsensing for disagreements\nbetween the simplex modules of a TMR trio\neven at times when those modules are not being used by the program,\nmaking any diagnostic\ncorrelation\nbetween the detectors\nand program\nvery difficult.\nThe "OR-ing" network which reduced the 200 disagreement\nsignals to 13 error monitor signals was found to need modification, to improve the fault isolation capabilities\nof the computer.\nSeveral identical\ndisagreement\npatterns resulted from different component failures which\ncould have been iso!ated if the respective\ndetectoz ._utputs had been\nrouted or clocked in different times to different positions in the error\nmonitor register.\nFor example,\nTable 26 shows the error patterns of some voter\nfailures which gave the same diagnostic error symptoms,\nalthough the\nfailure signals were located in different modules.\nTo unscramble identical error-pattern\nsymptoms,\nsimulation\nexperiments were performed.\nErrors were injected into the simulation\nprogram,\nand the error propag_*iou was noted.\nThis was done by observing the responses\nof the -_isagreement\ndetectors.\nFrom these results, optimum timing and placement\nof some disagreement\ndetectors\n(DD) could be determined.\nAn example of this optimization\nis shown in

Unless the transient manifests itselfas a local phenomenon\nwithin the computer, the TMR organization will be no less susceptible\nthan a simplex organization. The Gemini tests resulted in somewhat\nconflictingresults regarding the propagation characteristics of externally generated voltage transients. Is_,iating\nthe computer chassis by\nremoving ground shields in the cable apparently decreased the threshold of the transient nei_e applied to the chassis relativeto power and\nreference ground by altering the number of return paths and thereby\nchanging the distributionand concentration of currents flowing in the\nchassis. On the other hand, changes in the point of contact of the noise\ngenerator probe on the computer chassis seemea to have no affecton\nthe threshold level. An i,westigationof the propagation characteristics\nof externally generated voltage transients in computer organizations\nshould be performed ];utis beyond the scope of this study. The assumption is therefore made that additionaltransient protection must be\ndesigned into the AES-EPO\ncomputer organization, especially in the\narea of TMR memories.\n\n2.10.3\n\nSense System\n\nTests at IBM have indicatedthat the rise time of a voltage transient is probably the most criticalparameter in definingthe transient\nsusceptibility a digitalmachine - even more significantthatvoltage\nof\nlevels or durations. Rise times of the order of a few nanoseconds at\nrelativelylow voltage levels have resulted in computer failures in the\nlaboratory while longer rise times at substantiallyhigher voltage levels\nhave been tolerated. Unfortunately, transients with rise times of 50\nnanoseconds and less are apparently a common\noccurrence in operational systems.\nThe relativelypoor high frequency common\nmode rejection of the\nGemini memory\nsense system could be improved in the AES computer\norganization by careful MIB layout of the memory\nsense lines. Further\nimprovement in high frequency common\nmode rejection probably can\nbe attained, however, by reducing the bandwidth of the sense system to\na minimum\nallowed by strobe margins. Itwas found in the Gemini\ntestingthat an optimum sense system bandwidth exists such that maximum\nstrobe margins are obtained. This maximum\nstrobe margin at a\nspecificbandwidth is due to the fact that zeros read from memory\nhave\nhigher frequency components the ones. The rate of change of the area\n\n133\n\nof a zero therefore\ndecreases\nat a faster rate than the area of a one as\nthe bandwidth of the sense system is reduced.\nThe optimum bandwidth\nof the memory in Gemini was found to be approximately\n1 megacycle\nfor maximum strobe margins.\n\n2.10.4\n\nMemory\n\nStrobing\n\nA class of voltage transients\nwhich appears to be cornmon in\ndigital systems is a high frequency (20 megacycles\nor greater)\nbarst\nlasting less than 1 microsecond.\nAssuming that these bursts are\ncoupled into all three TMR channels and that they are not sufficiently\nsuppressed\nby the limited bandwidth of the memory sensing system,\nmemory errors will be generatea.\nIf each simplex memory of the TMR\nconfiguration\nis strobed at consecutive\ntime intervals\nrather than simultaneously,\nhowever, the noise burst will affect only one channel of the\nmemory,\nand no system error will occur.\nThe data from the alternately\nstrobed memories\ncould be stored in individual buffers with synchronized\noutputs.\nThis instrumentation\nwould require the reinstatement\nof the memory buffer registers\n(eliminated\nin the reorganized\ncomputer)\nand a\nslight decrease\nin computing speed.\nThe feasibility\nof the approach,\nthe\nscope of instrumentation\nrequired,\nand the resulting\ntransient\nprotection\neffectiveness\nshould be further investigated.\n\n2.10.5\n\nIsolated\n\nGrounds\n\nIsolated channel grounds in transient\nsusceptible\nareas such as\nthe memory would reduce the probability\nof system error due to an\nexternally\ngenerated voltage transient.\nThe three _.hannel grounds\nwould be routed independently\nto the computer memory frcm the cornmoll ground plane in the data adapter.\nIsolated channel grounds in a\nTMR memory would require\npulse transformers\nin the output lines of\nthe voters in the logic module driving the memory module and differential amplifiers\nin the channel inputs to the output voters of the memory module.\n\n134\n\n3.0\n\nERROR DETECTION\n\nAND DLkGNOSIS\n\nThe Saturn-V computer and a redundant version of the Apollo\nbackup data adapter were examined to determine\nthe required\norganization to allow efficient error detection and failure i_olation for inflight\nmaintenance\nin an AES-EPO mission.\nThe machine organization\nwas\nrequired to be suck as _o allow failure isolation down to each separate\nchannel,\nmodule, voter, or replaceable\nspare.\nFailure detection effici;_iency was required\nto be sufficient to assure that all channels are\noperative\nprior to a critical\nphase of the mission.\nFeasibility\nof computer programs\nto isolate these failures\nwas investigated\nas well as the\norganization\nof disagreement\ndetector\nnets.\n\n3.1\n\nApproach\nThe Saturn-V computer\nand data adapter use majority\nvoting circuits which providc correct\nsystem operation even when several randomly located failures\nexist in the hardware.\nCorrect operation is\npossible even if two failures\nexist in the same functional area of any\ntwo channels if the logic feeding the voters has failed to opposite states.\nCorrect operation is also possible if two or mo_e failures\nexist in the\nsame functional area of the three channels if the failure effects are noncontinuous and occur at d._.ferent times or if the failures\nexist at different points in the data/low\n(such as different\npositions in a shift register)\nwi,h voting between the failed positions.\nAlthough these TMR error\nmasking characteristics\nare conducive to achieving very high reliabi!ities, the problem of error detection\nand fault isolation is increased\nby\nthe very error masking features\nfor which TMR was invented.\nFailure conditions\nin the Saturn-V computer and data adapter are\ndetected by means of disagreement\ndetector\ncircuits\nlocated primarily\nat voter inputs.\nFailure isolation is accomplished\nby means of disagreement detector\nsignal data, char\',nel switching,\nm,_lule switching,\nand\ndata analysis.\nSpecial test programs\nare required to accomplish\nthe\ntask of error detection and fault isolation.\nThe functions of voting and\ndisagreement\ndetection are shown in Figure 48.\nChannel switching in the Saturn-V computer and data adapter\nprovides the capability\nof switching tt,,e TMR equipment into a simplex\noperating mode by forcing two of the three channels\ninto opposing logic\nlevels and thereby causing the third channel to control operation.\nSince\nany channel may be selected as the operating channel, three simplex\nmodes are provided.\nChannel switching may be performed\ni\', the\nlaboratory\nor on the launch pad.\n\n135\n\n[: ook;\n\nI"

therefore\nbe made to jump between channels as the data progresses\nfrom module to module as shown\nby the solid path in Figure 49. Module switching may be performed\nonly in the laboratory,\nThe approach to solving the problems of error detection and fault\nisolation to a replaceable\nmodule level was primarily\nby means of

followed wherever a choice between hardware and software existed.\nThe resulting\nmachine configuration\ntherefore does not necessarily\nrepresent\nthe optimum configuration\nfor AES\napplications\nif

Channel independency\nis obtained by forcing the voter input to a selected binary state regardless of the failed condition of the inputed logic.\nThe failed logic module\nis switched out of operation along with a good module, and the selected\nsimplex module operates with the other TMR modules.\nThe key to\nTMR/simplex\noperational\ncapabilit:_ is in the method of using disagreement\ndetectors\nto localize the failure to a module and switching\nvoltages to control the flow of data through the voter circuits.\nVoter designs using two different\ncircuit technologies\nwere studied\nfor AES channel/module\nsw\xc2\xa3 ching operations.\nThe first (Saturn V)\noperates as a current\nsummer feeding a threshold\ncircuit.\nThe second\n(integrated\ncircuit - modUied current\nswitch) operates as a logic exclusive OR function (vot = A B + B C + A C). Neither of these existing designs allow independent channel operation necessary\nfor TMR/\nsimplex mode capability,\nalthough both designs do allow simplex channel and simplex module operation.\nModule/channel\nswitching is accomplished\nat present by voltageswitch forcing of a binary one into one channel and a binary zero into\nanother.\nIn the Saturn-V instrumentation,\na binary one is forced by\ngrounding the +6 volt line to the logic AND gate preceding\nthe _]oter,\nand a zero is forced by grounding the + 12 volt input to the voter circuit.\nThe present modified current\nswitch instrumentation\nrequires\nthe outputs of preceding\nlogic NOR gates to be forced.\nA binary one is forced\nby raising the reference\nsupply of the NOR gate to the collector\nsupply\nvoltage,\nand a zero is forced by lowering the collector\nsupply to the\nreference\nsupply level.\n\n151\n\nModule 1\n\nModuel

desired TMR/simplex\nmode capability\ncan be realized\nwith\nthe present integrated\ncircuit design at the cost of additional logic and\nadditional voltage planes.\nOn the other hand, the Saturn-V instrumentation will require only a wiring modification\nconsisting\nof: l) supplying\nthe voters with three independent\n+12 volt power lines which can be\nindependently\nswitched to ground level and 2) providing a switching\ncapability\non the -3 volt line which reduces the threshold\nlevel at the\nbase of the voter transistor.\n\n3.3.2\n\nSwitchable\n\n_\'using\nthese\n\nVoter\n\nConsiderable\neffort was devoted to investigating\nmethods for\nerror correcting\ndevices in lieu of the Saturn-V voters.\nMost of\nmethods permitted\na switch down to one good channel in a trio\n\n152\n\nwhen another channel has failed,\nA constraint\nwhich was placea on the\nswitching system was that cor_trol lines be kept to a minimum.\nFor example, a control line for each individua! error correction\ndevice was\nnot considered\nto be feasible.\nA sw:i.tchir4 _,device was designed with a capability\nof automatically\nswitching from TMR operation on detection\nof an error in one channel\nto simplex operation of one of tim two remaining\nchannels.\nThis automaCic switch affects only the logic trio in which the failure occurred,\nall other trios remaining\nin the TlYIR mode.\nPropagation\nof errors\nis\nheld to a minimum by using input error correction\ntechniques\nrather\nthan outIx_t error correction.\nThis design approach has two disadvantages\ncompared to conventional majority voters.\nAn intermittent\nfailare causes switching to a\nsimplex mode an,_ does not recover its initial redundant state when the\nintermittent\nhas ended, as does a voter circuit.\nAlso, the switching\ndevice must have a preferred\nfailure mode or else it will have a reliability no greater than the majority voter.\nThis first method was then extended to give an operator control\nover the switching.\nThe logic trio would automatically\nswitch to simplex operation upon occurrence\nof an error, but upon the occurrence\nof a second error, the operator could switch all trios involved in the\nmodule to the channel that has not failed.\nAll other modules would remain in the TMR mode.\nIf the error was due to an intermittent\nfailure, the operator could\nswitch the module back to TMR mode when the period of the intermittent\nhas passed.\nThe disadvantage\nof this approach is that, to achieve an\nappreciable\nreliability\ngain over a voted system,\nthe computer would\nhave to be partitioned\ninto a large number of modules.\nThis would require a large number of error monitor indicators\nand switches,\nwhich\nthe operator would be required to use.\nTo overcome the problem of differentiating\nbetween an intermittent and a solid failure,\na third method was investigated\nin which the\noperator (or an automatic switching device) resets the switched-down\ntrio and checks to see if the error is again detected.\nThe first error\nencountered\nin each trio switches only that trio to one of the two remaining good channels.\nThe two good channe!s are compared and if a\nsecond failure occurs to make them disagree,\nan automatic\nswitching\ndevice on the trio output selects one of the two operating channels.\nThere is a 50-percent\nprobability that the automatic\nswitch will select\nthe remaining\ngood channel.\nIf it selects the wrong channel and the\noperator detects a system error, he can override the switch selection\nand select the remaining\ngood channel.\n\n153\n\nThree disadvantages\nexist in this approach.\nThe logic required\nto perform the switching function exceeds the other approaches.\nThe\nmethod corrects\nonly the first trio in any module having two channels\nthat fail.\nCertain combination\nof failures will not alert the operator,\nand a diagnostic\nroutine is necessary\nto enable the operator\nto detect\na system error.\nHowever,\nsince the system can continue t_, open\'me\neven when two channels of a trio have failed, the reliac:\'_ity of the\nsystem approaches\nthat of a majority voting system with manual replacement\nof failed modules with spares.\nAlso, eack trio is switched\nindependently\nof all other trios.\nA fourth method was examined which was very similar to the\nthird with the following exceptions.\nIf the logic circuits\nhave a preferred failure direction,\nthe fourth method will have the same prc._)ability of selecting the proper channel as the failure preference.\nThe\nAES computer subsystem\ncontains a great deal of single-line\ntransfer\nlogic which does have a high probability\nof failure in one direction.\nHowever, the logic and interface\nrequired for the fourth method is\ngreater than that for the third method.\nEach of the methods examine;l provides\nspecific advantages and\ncontains certain disadvantages.\nFurther\nstudy is required\nto select\nthe best method for the AES computer subsystem.\nThe module/channel\nswitching techniques\nconsidered\nfor AES\napplication\nwere simple and straightforward\nbut assumed the existence\nof a switchable\nvoter design.\nThe existing voter in the Saturn-V computer and data adapter is module or channel switched by forcing a\nlogical one in one channel and a logical zero in a second channel.\nSince the "votes" of these switched voters cancel, the third channel\neffectively\ncontrols the voter output providing that no faults affecting\nvoter operation exist in the equipment.\nCertain failures\ncould exist\nin the Saturn-V design which might prevent forcing the two "switched"\nchannels to the desired logical level.\n\n_..\n\nConsiderable\neffort was expended in reviewing technologies\nand\ndeveloping concepts for switchable voting circuits.\nAlthough the\nprimary\nrequirement\nwas a voter design in which the individual channel inputs could be forced to desired logic levels even in the presence\nof circuit failures,\nthe capability\nto turn off individual channels was\nconsidered\nto be a more desirable\nfeature.\nThe "off" channels would\nbe effectively\nremoved from the circuitry\nand would present neither a\nlogical zero nor a logical one to the voter.\n\n154\n\nThe Saturn-V voter is a ttiree-input\ncurrent\nsumming circuit in\nwhich the bias voltage sets the logical one threshold\nto two units of\ncurrent\nout of three.\nThis circuit could be converted\nto a switchable\nvoter of the type desired by providing means of removing power at\neach of the channel inputs and simultaneously\nchanging the bia,_ so that\nthe logical one threshold\nis set at one unit of current.\nT_:-o channel\ninputs can then be turned off, and the voter operates\nas an inverter\non\nthe third channel.\nAn intuitively\nobvious approach to switchable\nvoters was to consider logic voting as "llustrated\nin Figure 53 rather than current\nsumming as in the Saturn-V circt,_,+s. The output of the OR gate shown in\nFigure 53 is the AND siglml of channels\n1 and 2 or the AND cf 2 and 3\nor the AND of 3 and 1..\'f\none channel (say 1) is in error,\nthen the out.F\',t of the OR gate is 2 \xe2\x80\xa2 3, the logic level existing on channels 2 and 3.\nAlthough the voting function is achieved,\nno practical\nmeans has yet\nbeen discovered\nto provide the desired switching function with logic\nel;cults\nof this type.\n3\n\n2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n_ A_\n\n_\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n3\n\n2\nFigure\n\n53.\n\nLogic Voter\n\n155\n\n1"2 + 2.3 + 3.1\n\n3.4\n\nCrew Requirements\nA primary goal was defined early in the study to automate the\nerror detectic:l and fault isolation functions to the highest possible degree and thereby minimize crew requirements\nfor inflight maintelmnce.\n_Iraining, experience,\nand test information\nrequired\nby the crew to\neffect repair were made negligible by the hardware\napproaches\npursued in the study.\nMm_-in-the-loop\noperations\nrequired\nby the AES\ninstrumentation\nwere limited to reading a bank of indicator\nlights to\ndetermine\nthe location of the iailu,e\nand to making a manual replacement of the failed module.\nSemi-automatic\nrepair methods in which\nthe astronaut\nswitches in wired-in\nspare units or changes mode were\nalso investigated,\nas well as fully auto_aatic repair and mode changing.\n\n\'\n\nTest approaches\nand mechanical\npackaging approaches\nwere\ndirected towards eliminating\nthe need for special test equipment\nor\ntools to effert inflight maintenance.\nNo approaches\nwere considered\nwhich could not be used by .x suited astronaut.\n\n3.5\n\nProgramming\n\nRequirements\n\nThe test programming\nrequirements\nfor AES applications\nwere\nderived mainly from evaluation of existing Saturn-V programs\nand\nfrom simulation\nexperience\ngained on this study and previous Saturn-V\nstudies.\nAlthough the hardware\napproach to error detection and failure\nisolation taken in this study has minimized\nthe need for special test\nprograms,\nthe following sections outline the program types a,_d requirements for the general case where either a software approach might be\nemphasized\nor where a mix of the two approaches\nhas been chosen.\nThe Saturn-V\n\ntest\n\n1)\n2)\n\nComputer\n\n3_\n\nData adapter\n\n4)\n\n,.,..\n\nMemory\n\nMarriage\n\nprogr_uns\n\nconsist\n\nof four primary\n\ntypes:\n\nload and verify\nself-test\ntest\n\ntest.\n\nThe test programs\nrequired for the AES computer\nsystem would be\nsimilar except that the data adapter test and marriage\ntest programs\nwould be combined,\nsince the data adapter is packaged with the computer in the AES configuration.\nAlso, these programs\nwould be useful\n\n156\n\nmainly for laboratory\nevaluation,\nsince specia!

For the purpose of thisdiscussion,\nhowever, a logicfailure definedas a voltagechange of over 25\nis\nmillivolts.\nOf the nine representative\nmodules,\nsLx exhibited no failures until\nthe test chamber failed (a test period of over a month).\nTwo modems\nsurvived the flood and exhibited no failures\nfo_ the entire test period\n(57 days).\nOne module exhibited one failure,\nand a second module\n\n178\n\nexhibiL _!two failures after the {iood. One of t_e modules which operated perfectly up to the time of the flood had to t,e disconnected\nfollowing the test equipment failure because it began t- draw excessive\ncurrent from the power supplies.\nOne module exhibited two failure_ during the first month of testing.\nAnother module lasted 20 days of testing before experiencing\nits first\nfailure and then degraded rapidly.\nThe nintt, alodule experienced\nthree\nfailures after only a few days of test and then stabilized\nuntil the flood,\nafter which it degraded steadily.\nOnly one module out of the nine had to be removed from the\ntester due to drawnlg excessive\ncurrent,\nhcwever.\nEight finished\ntest period of 57 days.\n\nthe\n\nIn general,\nthe frequency of failures could be correlated\nwith\ndeterioration\nof the magnesium-lithium\nframe (causing the RTV seal\nto peel off the circuit board).\nThe failure mechanisms\nseemed,\ntherefore, to be moisture leakage under the edge of the RTV seal rather than\nby means of the connectors.\nDetailed examination\nand disecting of the\nfailed modules supported this conclusion.\nThe failures (defined as a change in voltage level at the test points\nof greater than 25 millivolts)\nare charted for each of the test modules\nin Figures 63 through 71. A number nf recoveries\n(return of test point\nreadings to within 25 millivolts\nof the original reading) were identified\nduring the tests and denoted by downward pointing az\'rows on the charts.\nThe chamber failure occurred\nat 936 hours.\nAs an example of how to read the charts,\nrefez :o Figure 63. No\nfailures occurred\nuntil the chamber flooded.\nThe voltage level at seven\ntest points shifted by more than 25 millivolts\nat this time.\nAnother\nfailure occurred\nat about 1125 hours but recovered\n2 days later.\nThe\ntest point levels then remained unchanged for the remainder\nof the *.est.\nThe total failures\nof all nine modules are plotted in Figure 72 as\npercentage\nof test points failed versus test days.\nThis plot is o: some\ninterest since a continuous curve drawn through the discrete\ntest data\npoints generally follows a typical logistic curve (growth modified by a\nlimiting factor).\nIf this figure does represent\na logistic trend, it indicates that additional failures would occur at a slower rate if the test\nperiod were extended for an additional period of timt.\nThe "growth"\n(exponentially\nincreasing)\nportion of the curve could be due primarily\nto deterioration\nof the magnesium-lithium\nframe,\nat,! the "co2tstraint"\n(raveling\n\noff of the curve)\n\ncould be due to the better\n\n!\n179\nI\n\np:otection\n\nafforded\n\n20-\n\n15-\n\nS\n\nlO-\n\nU-\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nI\n\no\n\no\n\n_o\n\n,\n4oo\n\n,\n6oo\n\n_\n\nI\nl_\n\ni_o\n\n,\ni_\n\nTestHours\n\nFigure 63.\n\nPhase II Module F_ilures\n\n525 Millivolts)\n\n2o-\n\n- Module No. 211\n\nI\n\nI\ni\n\n15-\n\n"_V\nE/\n\nPage Removed\n\nlO-\n\n._1\n\n.5-\n\no\n,_.\n\n_\'I\n\nI\nI\n\no\n\nFigure 64.\n\n,\n\n,\n\n200\n\n4oo\n\n_\n\n86o\n\nTest Hours\n\nPhase II Module Failures\n\n180\n\n1060\n\n(>25 Millivolts)\n\n126o\n\n146o\n\n- Module No. 212\n\n0\n\n15,\n\nI\n\n5,\n\no\no\n\n2oo\n\n_o\n\n!\n\n6oo\n\n_o\n\nlo6o\n\n1_o\n\n1_o\n\nTest Hours\n\nFigure\n\n65.\n\nPhave\n\nII Module\n\nFailures\n\n(> 25 Millivolts)\n\n- Module\n\nNo.\n\n213\n\n0=\n\n15.\n\n\'_- 10.J\n\nNo changes test point readings 25 mv\nin\n>\n\n,P\n5-\n\nO\n\nt\n\n0\n\nFigure\n\n260\n\n66.\n\nPhase\n\n4oo\n\nII Module\n\ni\n\nt\n\n6oo\n8oo\nTest Hours\n\nFailures\n\n( >25\n\n181\n\nMillivolts)\n\nI\n\nI\n\niooo\n\n)2oo\n\n- Module\n\nI\n\nNo.\n\n_4o0\n\n214\n\n0.\n\n15.\n\n10"5\nIt..\n\n5\nL\nn\n\nU\n\nFigure\n\n67.\n\n260\n\nPhase\n\n4()0\n\n600\n_\nTest Hours\n\nII Module Failures\n\n1000\n\n( >25 Millivolts)\n\n._\n\nv\n\n12_)0\n\n1400\n\n- Module No. 215\n\n20-\n\n15_\n\nL.\n\n10-\n\n5-\n\no\n0\n_.\n\n260\n\n460\n\n6bo\n\n860\n\nt "\'\nI\nobo\n\nI\n\n12bo\n\n146o\n\nTest Hours\n\nFigure 68.

Module 212 had to be discontinued\nat this time because\nits circuits\nbegan to draw excessive\ncurrent.\nFigure 84 in the Appendix shows an end view of the module and the peeling of the RTV\ncaused by the deterioration\nof the frame.\nNote the piece_ of foreign\nmatter that have fallen between the RTV seal and the logic module.\nAppendix Figure 85 is an cnlarge,nent\nof one section of the module\nshowing the exposure of the logic after loose RTV was cut away.\nAlthough physical inspection of Module 212 indicated that the excessive current drawn by this module was probably due to a failure in\nthe modute sealing, the gasket attached to the female connecto_ was\nalso found to be loose (indicating that the connector\nmight have contributed to the failure) as shown in Figure 86, in the Appendix.\nIn general,\nthe contact pins were found to be in very good shape\non all the modules at this time.\nAppendix Figure 87 is an enlargement\nof the set of pins exhibiting the worst pin discoloration.\nA chemical\nanalysis\nof the corrosion\nproducts\nidentified the blue-green\nmaterial\nas copper chloride hydrate and the black material\nas copper chloride\ncombined with a small amount of copper oxide.\n(No nickel barrier\nlayer existed between the copper pins and the gold plating on these\nconnectors).\nAt the end of test (57 days), seven of the eight remaining\nmodules\nwere removed from the fixture and again photographed\nindividually.\nModule 215 could not be removed because of adhesive corrosion.\nThe\nseven modules are shown in Appendix Figures 88 through 94.\n4.5.3\n\n._\n\nConclusions\nAlthough it was not possible _o assign the failure mechanism\n(which caused a test point reading to change by more than 25 miilivolts)\nto either the connector\nor to the log_.c module, the general correlation\nbetween frame deterioration\nand failure cccurance\nindicates\nthat most\nof the failures were due to leakage of moisture\nand contaminants\ninto\nthe logic circuits\nrather than by means of the connectors.\nThe failure\n\n186\n\nof the magnesium-lithium\n/rame_. a:,d resulting\nloosening\nseal were not
