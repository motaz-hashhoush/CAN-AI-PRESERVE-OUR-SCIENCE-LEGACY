Reece Roth\nLewis Research Center\n?National Aeronautics and Space Administration\nCleveland, Ohio\nThis paper describes a modification of the conventional Panning\ndischarge l , which is useful in generatinE ,, large volume, steady-state\nplasmas, of a type useful in plasma physics and controlled nuclear\nfusion research. The novel features of this discharge include\ninjection of the operating gas through holes in the anode ring, which\nAllows the discharge to operate in the high-power mode at much lower\nneutral background gas pressures than is customary with the conventional\nPenning discharge; operation in strong magnetic fields, up to 20 kG; and\nplacement, cf the anode ring at the midplane of a magnetic bottle\ngeometry, we;ich makes possible ion trapping; and higher ion densities\nin the magnetic bottle than is possible with the uniform magnetic field\nconventionally used. This discharge i.s easy to set up, is repeatable\nin .operation, and can be used as a means of creating a plasma in a\nmagnetic bottle or a minimum-B magnetic field geometry.\n\n"\t\n\nA schematic diagram of the discharge is shown in Fig. 1. The anode\nis operated at a positive potential between 400 and 5000 V dc. The\nanode is a circular hoop located at the midplane of an axisymmetric\nmagnetic bottle configuration. The grounded superconducting magnet\ndewars 2 , located at the magnetic field maxima, form the cathodes of the\ndischarge. The walls of the vacuum tank are at ground potential. The\nanode ring and the magnet dewars have a diameter of 18 cm. The axial\ndistance from the anode ring to the cathodes is 10 cm.\nThe gas required for operation of the discharge is admitted to the\nvacuum system through a needle valve and enters a 2-liter plf,num\nchamber, which is maintained at pressures from 1 to\nTorr. The gas\ninlet line from the plemun chamber is connected to the hollow stainless\nsteel tubing of which the anode ring is constructed. The details of\nthe anode ring are shown in Fig. 2. The hollow interior of the anode\nring serves as a manifold to distribute the incoming gas to\nholes\n0.12 cm in diameter, which spray the gas radially inward to the\ndischarge. Conventional Penning discharges are operated at relatively\nhigh background pressures of 10- 3 Torr in the high-power mode of\noperation. The neutral gas pressure on the axis of this discharge is\nno more than\nX 10-5 Torr at a gas flow rate adequate to sustain the\ndischarge in both the low- and-the high-power modes of operation.\nThese low pressures are desirable, since ions are then much less\n\n5\n\n3\n\n5\n\nlikely to be scattered out of the discharge region by collisions with\nneutral gas atoms. The characteristic e-folding decay time of the\nplasma density was measured after switching off the anode voltage.\nThis decay time was typically 7 msec in the low-power mode, and 0.2\nmsec in the high-power mode of operation.\n\nThe conventional Penning discharge is operated with a uniform\nmagnetic field along its axis. In such a magnetic field, ions are\naccelerated out of the discharge by electric fields existing between\nthe anode and the cathode. This characteristic has permitted a\nsuitably modified Penning discharge to be used as an ion source3. In\nthe present geometry, the magnetic mirrors on either side of the anode\nprovide magnetic forces which o ppose the electric forces and act to\ntrap ions in the discharge. Preliminary measurements show that the\ncharged particle density on t1re axis is an order of magnitude higher\nnear the plane of the anode than at the point of maximum magnetic\nfield. The neutral particle density varies by less than a factor of\n2 at the same locations. The discharge has been operated at steadystate magnetic field strengths of Bmay - 4.0, 8.O, 12.0, 16.0, and\n20.0 kG, at mirror ratios of Bmin\t\n. - 0.55 and 0.39. The discharge\ncharacteristics depend only weakly on the magnetic field strength\nabove Rmax - 4.0 kG. The operation of a Penning discharge in a magpetic-bottle geometry was independently arrived at by Angerth, et a1.4,\nwho reported data from transient operation of their discharge.\nIt was found that the discharge operates in two distinct modes:\na "low-power" mode, in which anode voltages of 500 to 5000 V and anode\ncurrents of 0.5 to 50 mA are observed, and a "high-power" mode, in\nwhich anode voltages of 500 to 3000 V and anode currents of 0.3 to\n9.5 A are observed. As much as 13,000 W has been dissipated in the\ndischarge, and this power dissipation has been limited only by the\ncharacteristics of the available power supply. It was found necessary\nto cool the anode ring with water and the magnet Dewars with liquid\nnitrogen at discharge levels above 500 W. These cooling provisions are\nnot shown in Fig. 2. Both neon and helium gas were used.\nSevere arcing between the anode and one or both cathodes is\nalways observed upon initiating the high-power mode of operation, and\nhas made necessary the inclusion of a ballast resistor in the anode\ncircuit. The discharge has been operated with neon gas in the steady\nstate for 35 min at a constant anode current of 2 A, and a power input\nof 1900 W. Microwave measurements of a neon plasma at an anode current\nof 6 A yielded a charge particle density at the midplane on the axis\nof approximately 5 X 1011 electrons/cm . Measurements of ion energy\nmade with a multi-grid probe located outside one of the magnetic mirrors\nyielded a positive plasma potential of 400 volts and an ion kinetic\ntemperature of an additional 200-400 eV. A neon plasma in the lowpower mode of operation had an electron kinetic tempperature of 150 eV\nand a density of approximately 5 X 109 electrons/cmj , based on the\n\nIWO\n\n3\n\nII\n\ni\n\ntransition and electron saturation regions of a Langmuir probe uncorrected for the presence of a 5kQ magnetic field. The multi-grid\nprobe revealed low-power mode ion kinetic temperatures of up to 2500\ne7. Some preliminary data on plasma turbulence frequency spectra will\nbe presented at the meeting.\n\nReferences\n1. F. Pi. Penning, and K. Nienhuis, Phillips Tech.

Woollett\nLewis Research Center\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\nCleveland, Ohio\nLinear approximations are more frequently used than not in\ndefining small amplitude plasma wave motion. I1owever, the resulting\nlinearized equations are often used without reservation in problems\nwhere the magnitude of the wave amplitude may be sizable. With\nexperiments being; conducted in plasma heating where energy addition\nis via large amplitude waves and with experiments being; conducted\nnear or at resonances which usually tar, the credibility of any\nsimple model, the evaluation of the linear approximation is paramount.\nThe starting point for a wave analysis is generally Ohms law\nand the equation of motion of a fluid element (or equation of motion\nof the species). If the non-linear terms are retained, the expressions\nare difficult to solve. To make the problem tractable, investigators\nutilize various assumptions. One such heuristic hypothesis entails\nassuming a specific structure for the non-linear wave. Experimental\ncharacteristics can be used as a guide to establish the a priori\nstructure. One typical characteristic of experimental non-linear\nsteady state systems is that numerous harmonics are present in addition to the fundamental forcing frequency. If the linear and\nassumed infinite set of non-linear waves are planer and if all are\npropagating in a given direction, the a priori structure of the nonlinear wave can be written as\n\nThis particular expression will represent the form of all oscillating\nquantities appearing in the analysis; propagation is assumed to be\nin the x direction. When the order of magnitude of the ascending\ncoefficients of the series is monotonically decreasing the expressions\nare well suited for a perturbation technique.\nApplying this perturbation expansion of the non-linear waves to\nthe equations of motion, Ohms law, conservation expressions for mass,\nspecies and charge and to Faraday\'s law, one can obtain the perturbations to the particle currents in terms of the amplitudes of the\nlinear components of the electric field.\n\n6\nAfter substituting these expressions for the currents into the\nwave equation and equatin^^ terms of equal magnitude, tidere results\na set of equations where all variables except the perturbation\nelectric fields are eliminated. This\'hierarchy of solutions starts\nwith the normal linear solutions. They can be represented in tensor\nnotation by\n\n\'\t\n\nA\t\n\nC\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nwhere A represents the order of perturbation; for A - 1, the right\nhand side vanishes. The left hand side has the identical form as\nthe linear solution regardless of ;1 . Consequently the electric\nfield of any order of perturbation can be calculated by obtaining\nthe next lower terms.\t\n\nM\n\nThe technique described above was applied to a uniform density,\n\ncold, collisionless plasma, of infinite extent, iimmersed in a uniform\nmagnetic field. Non-linear wave amplitudes were calculated for the\nfour principal first order plane waves; ordinary and extraordinary\nwaves propagatin- perpendicular to the ragnetic field, and the right\nand left hand polarized waves propagatinf; parallel to the magnetic\n\nfield.\nCalciAlations show that for both an ordinar;,- and extraordinary\nfirst order wave the second order non-linear disturbance is an extraordinary wave, i.e., it is a function of the magnetic field strength.\nIn all cases the first harmonic has the same phase velocity as the\nfundamental but twice the frequency. The magnitude of disturbances\nhigher than the second were not examined. For both the ordinary and\nthe right and left circularly polarized fundamental, the linear\napproximation is satisfactory even for large amplitude linear components. This is not the case for the extraordinary fundamental.\nhe amplitude ratio of the extraordinary fundamental is plotted in\nthe figure for densities of 10 11 , 1012 , and 101 cm-3 i The amplitude\nratio is the quotient of the amplitude of the non-linear wave to the\nsquare of the amplitude of the linear wave. There are four singularities present. The range of influence of all but the first is\nlimited to rather restricted frequency regions. At frequencies\nbelow the first singularity, the amplitude ratio of the first harmonic\nwave is fairly constant and increases as the density increases. Decreasing the magnetic field intensity will shift the first singular\npoint to lower frequencies. Concomitantly the amplitude ratio for\nfrequencies less than the first singularity increases significantly\t\n\n`\n\n7\nas the magnetic field decreases. The first singularity (when at low\n\nfrequencies) occurs at the Alfven velocity. For an atomic hydrogen\nplasma and for the range of densities and field strengths investicated, this r;;;,\xe2\x80\xa2urs around 0.2 of the ion cyclotron frequency.\nTo obtain the ratio of the amplitude of the first harmonic to\nthat of the fundamental, multiply the amplitude ratio by the amplitude of the linear wave in stat-volts/cm. Consequently for a\nfundamental of 1 stat-volt/cm, the linearity approximation is probably invalid over the regions marked by the double curve. Although\n1 stat-volt /cm is a rather large wave amplitude, such values do\nexist in high power experiments. One-tenth of this electric field\ncertainly is not unreason ble though. At these latter conditions\nfor densities of 1012 cm\' and greater., there exist extended regions\nwhere the linearity approximate is invalid.\n\na+\n\n8\n\n1e"\n\nle\n\n10\xc2\xb0 \xe2\x80\x94-\n\n04 L\n\nc0 ^-\n\n10\xe2\x99\xa6 "t!-\n\ni\n\n16"\n\nfrequency\n\n-\n\n9\nR. F. POWER TRANSFER TO ION-CYCLOTRON WAVES\nBy D. R. Sigman and J. J. Reinmann\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\nLewis Research Center\nCleveland, Ohio\n\nABSTRACT\nThe generation of ion-cyclotron waves in a plasma column is of\ninterest to experimentalists concerned with the heating of plasma\nthrough collisionless processes. One method for transferring power\nto these waves is to wrap a curre git sheet around the plasma column.\nThe current sheet has an azimuthal current density varying axially\nas eikoz and is two wavelengths long. Equations have been derived\nand calculations made from a theoretical plasma model of the effect\nof various plasma parameters on the power transferred from the current\nsheet to ion-cyclotron waves in the plasma. The analysis includes\nelectron inertia terms and radial density varia.0ions which were not\nincluded in previous work.\nIt was found that the inclusion of electron inertia terms reduces\npower transfer. Optimum coil wavelengths and optimum electron densities\nhave been calculated for several plasma configurations. For typical\nplasmas, the optimum density for power transfer is between 1 x 10 12 cm-3\nand 5 x 1012 cm-3 . Figure 1 shows peak power transfer versus electron\ndensity for a 5 em radius plasma. The current sheet had a wavelength\nof 45 em and a 10 an radius.\nFigure 2 shows the radial density distributions which were studied.\nIn general, power transfer to inhomogeneous plasmas is large when the\nvolume average density is near the optimum density computed for homogeneous plasmas.\nFigure 3 shows a typical resonance absorption curve. The halfwidth is determined primarily by the value of 11 for which peak power\noccurs. For low densities (ne l 5 z 1012 cm-3), and near the peak\npower point, r. f. power is coupled predominantly to a single plasma\nmode of oscillation. At high densities and at off-resonance points\nfor low densities the power may be distributed among several modes\nwith different axial wavelengths, thus making it difficult to measure\nplasma wave properties at off-resonance conditions.\n\n10\n\nI\n\nv\nM\nC\nis\n\nC\nv\nr\ntow,\n\n.1\n\n11\n\n0\na\n16\n\nG\n\nN\n\np\n\nIx\n\ncr\ni\n\n.\na\n\nf VVIV\n\n12\n\nLam.\n\nv\nV\nC\nQ\n\non\n\nin\n\n^E\n.)\nL\n\ntN\n\n4\n\nu\t\n\nus\n\nc\n\n3ho\n\nLn\n\nb\n\n11\n\nM\n\nNu\t\n\nq\n\n3\n\nv\t\n\n^\n\nu ^c\n\ncr-\n\nQ^ a\n\n1 a\n\nt\nc\t 3\xc2\xb0\naL\nE\n\nLL cr-\n\n^R.uuv\n\n^\n\nv\n\n^\n\na\n\nu i\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2,m\n\nbb\n\n\\ 3vs\no\n3\n^\'+\n\n^ u\n\n3C,\n\nm\n\n0\n\n0\n\nOD\n\n6\n\ncr\n0\n\n0\nfo-&/o\n\nELECTRON IMPACT CROSS SECTIONS FOR ATOMIC AND\nHYDROGEN CALCULATED BY GRYZINSKI I S CLASSICAL THEORY\nBy George M. Prok, Carl F. Monnin and Henry J. Hettel\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\nLewis Research Center\nClevelandr Ohio\nABSTRACT\nIn plasma experiments, a knowledge of the energy loss mechanisms\nis important. A major loss mechanism is the radiation produced by\ninelastic collisions of electrons with molecules or atoms. Detailed\nknowTledge of the cross sections involved is necessary to predict the\nmagnitude of this radiation loss.\nExcitation and ionization cross sections for electron scattering\nin ground state and metastable atomic hydrogen were calculated by the\nBorn approximation and by the classical theory of Gryzinski. The\nclassical theory leads to two excitation cross sections depending on\nwhether a velocity distribution or an average value was assumed for\nthe velocity of the atomic electron. Gryzinski also developed an\nexchange formula which was used for sus transitions in atomic\nhydrogen. Sample curves are presented for exchange and excitation\nof atomic hydrogen in figures 1 and 2 respectively.\nA model for applying Gryzinski\'s classical theory to diatomic\nmolecules is also presented. Since Gryzinski\'s theory is one of\nCoulomb interaction, the variation of electron energy as the molecule\nvibrates must be known for each electronic state in order to apply this\nclassical theory to a diatomic molecule. The electron energy as a\nfunction of internuclear separation for the various electronic states\ncan be described by a Morse potential curve. The energy relation\nbetween the Morse curve for the ground state and the Morse curve for\nany excited state of a diatomic molecule, such as H 2, is shown\nschematically in figure 3.\nAccording to the Franck- Condon principle, electronic excitation\ntakes place at a constant r because.this process is much more rapid\nthan the molecular vibrational motion. This means that, at any given\ninstant of time for an internuclear separatin r, an energy of\nTo(r-re )u is required to electronically excite state u. From\nit\nPit can be seen that for any given electronic excitation the\nvalue of To (r-re) \twill vary with the internuclear separation.\nBecause of this variation, application of Gryzinski\'s theory can only\nbe applied to a constant r. The probability that the internuclear,\nseparation is a given value of r can be determined from the probability\ndensity distribution of a harmonic oscillator. Thus a weighting factor\n\n14\nis determined to be applied to Gryzinski\'s cross section at a constant\nr.

Theoretical cross sections are presented\nfor both the singlet and triplet systems. The energy range is from onset\nto 360 ev.

Serafini\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\nLewis Research Center\nCleveland, Ohio\n\nABSTRACT\nThe present investigation is a preliminary attack on the problem\nof spontaneously occurring plasma oscillations and/or plasma fluctuations which have been noted to exist in steady-state plasma devices.\nThe initial plasma device chosen was an annular Hall- current plasma\naccelerator utilizing a radial magnetic field and a slightly-ionized\nlow-current argon discharge. The ultimate goal is to ascertain the\nrole of plasma fluctuations in determining the characteristics of\nthe bulk plasma behavior.\nThe approach used is similar to those used in fluid-dynamic\nturbulence investigations in which the mean-square, the frequency\nspectra, and the space-time correlations of the spectra are measured.\nThe present research is directed toward plasma fluctuations which are\nconcentrated at the low end of the frequency spectrum to minimize the\ndifficulties with the diagnostics.\nThe initial measurements of the fluctuations are being made using\nelectrostatic probes at various conditions of probe bias voltage. In\naddition to measurements of the r.m.s. magnitude, the amplitude spectra\nof the fluctu4ions have been measured from 100 cps to 600 kc. Spacetime correlations of the fluctuations have been made with a correlation\nanalyzer having a response up to 500 kc. The coherence of the fluctuations along the axial and lateral directions has been measured. The\nfluctuations possess a significant coherence in the longitudinal\ndirection for the length of the accelerator. Similar coherence exists\nin the lateral direction. No convective effects of the fluctuations\nhave been observed.\nThe present and future research is being devoted to extending\nand analyzing the previously obtained results.

F. POWER\nABSORPTION IN ION CYCLOTRON RESONANCE\nBy Clyde C. Swett\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\nLewis Research Center\nCleveland, Ohio\n\nABSTRACT\nA brief experimental survey has been undertaken to determine the\neffect of adding a variable magnetic beach to an apparatus being used\nto investigate the generation and thermalization of ion cyclotron waves.\nIn this apparatus ian cyclotron waves are generated in a hydrogenplasma column in a magnetic-mirror geometry by means of an r. f. coil,\nthe initial plasma -,olumn being a hot-cathode discharge and the complete\nsystem operating steady state. If,\' a magnetic beach - i. e., a region\nwhere the magnetic field strength decreases in the direction of wave\npropagation - is used, the energy in the wave will be transferred to\nthe ions and the ions will be heated to high temperatures. If, the\nbeach is inside of the mirrors, such ions might be contained and the\nplasma density improved.\nAdding a beach, however, is a major system change that might\nresult in the need for other modifications in the apparatus. For\nthis reason it was decided to make a quick survey to (1) determine\nthe effect of magnetic beach on r. f. power absorption, (2) determine\nif the plasma density is increased because of thermalization of the\nwaves, (3) determine if the beach is detrimental to the operation of\nthe hot-cathode discharge, (4) determine if the wavelength of the\nwaves in the beach is decreasing, thereby showing that thermalization\nis occurring, and (5) observe the effect of the beach on resonances.\nResults show that r, f, power absorption decreased about 20 percent\nwhen the field at the beach position was reduced to 89 percent of the\nmain field. No increase in plasma density could be observed and only\nslight effect on the hot-cathode discharge was apparent. Attempts to\nmeasure wavelength change in the beach failed because the magneticprobe signals appeared to be the resultant of at least two waves.\nClose examination near the theoretical resonant point shows two peaks\nin the power absorption\xe2\x80\x9e The point closest to the theoretical point\nhas been observed both with and without beach, but the peak farthest\nfrom the theoretical point has only been observed with the beach\npresent. It is an extremely sharp peak and the half-width of resonance\ncannot be measured at the present time. Possible causes for the second\npeak presently being considered include (1) striations to the discharges\n(2) reflections of the waves, (3) existence of waves other than the\n\n25\n\n26\nones expected, and (4) non-uniformities in the field. Two equipment\nmodifications appear necessary - a more uniform plasma column and a\nlonger magnetic field region for making wavelength measurements.\n\n\t\n\n27\n\ni ^..\t\n\nr{^\t\n:i\n\ni .\t\n\n+.\t\n\nt\t\n\ni..\xc2\xab\t\n\n\'\t\n\n...\t\n\n\'\t\n\nI\n\nt\t\n\n;. \'t\t\n\n..\t\n\n^.. j\t\n\n1\t\n\n:\n\n...\t\n\nf\t\n\n: +.\n\nt\t\n\n^\t\n\n^\t\n\nj\t\n\n_...._\n\nI\t\n\n..M; ..\t\n\n^\n\nt\t\n\n?\t\n\n.\t\n\nr\n\nt\t\n\nA\n\n:...\n\n^\t\n\nt\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2: \'^::I\'\t\n\nribj\t\n\n...4^l6:.\t\n\n_\t\n\n+:\n\nisi\n\nA\n\n^^>^\n\n+\n\n^+; ,^\t\n\n^ill^\n\'"\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2;\t\n\nf\'..\t\n\n^\t\n\n..\t\n\n.i\t\n\niS\t\n\n+\t\n\n^:. \'.\t\n\n..

E. Heighway\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\nLewis Research Center\nCleveland, Ohio\n\nABSTRACT\nExcept in special cases, an ion current impinging upon a cathode\nresults in an electron emission at least sufficient to neutralize the\nion current. It would seem possible that such an ion current might\nproduce an electron emission (over and above that required for neutralization) which exceeds the thermionic saturation, current. This anomalous\nemission may occur by virtue of the possibility that the ions, as they\napproach the cathode surface, lower the local work function and enhance\nthe probability of tunneling. A simplified one-dimensional model,\nwhich should afford approximate estimates of this effect, is presented.\n\ni-\n\n31\nPRECEDING PAGE B1,ANK NOT FILM\nCONSIDIUUTION OF IRREVIMSIBLE THFIii\xe2\x80\xa2iODYNAMICS\nAS At\' APPROACH TO MHU PLASMA PROBLEMS\nBy N. Stankiewicz\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\nLewis Research Center\nCleveland, Ohio\nABSTRACT\nIf it is assumed that the local entropy of a plasma is a function\nof the various averages over the distribution function, f , (jth\nspecies), then, a closed form expression for f can be ob ained. This\nexpression contains undetermined parameters which, in theory, can be\ndetermined from the coupled moments of the Boltzmann collision equation.\nThere is, however, no advantage to solving for these parameters in this\nway, and in fact the collision integrals are somewhat more complicated\nthan they would be in the usual Chapman-Enskog method of solution.\nThe advantage of this method would seem to be in identifying the\nentropy production source term which arises due to irreversible\nprocesses. This term is a product of the fluxes and the conjugate\nthermodynamic "forces" operating in the system. (These "forces" are\ngiven by taking the gradient of those undetermined parameters contained\nin the distribution function). From a consideration of this term and\nthe second law of thermodynamics it may be possible to determine limits\non the properties of a non-equilibrium process. However, the primary\ndifficulty is to find a rigorous method of identifying the undetermined\nparameters in terms of the physically applied forces (e.g. those due\nto electric and magnetic fields) which drive the system into nonequilibrium states.\n\n.,,.r\n\n33\nPR\tSIDING PAGE\n\nBLANK NOT FILMED\n\nSTATUS OF LARGE VACUUM FACILITY H 28 NH30 AND Li MPD ARC TESTS\nBy D.J.

Bowditch and A. E. Johansen\nABSTRACT\nA simple, low-power MPD arc \' termed a D.C. magnetic expansion\nthrustors has been under investigation at NASA Lewis Research Center\n(reference 1 and 2). An electrical discharge is supported in an axial\nmagnetic field between a cylindrical anode and a hollow cathode centered\non the anode axis. The thrustor is operated in a D.C. magnetic field\nwhich is typically 250 gauss with Argon propellant at mass flows varying\nfrom less than 0 9 2 mg/sec to more than 0.5 mg/sec. The propellant is\ninjected into the anode through both the hollow cathode and small feed\ntubes along the anode walls. The discharge characteristics are controlled\nby the hollow cathode flow and the anode voltage such that the discharge\ncurrent is generally 2-3 amps while the discharge voltage is maintained\nover a range of 60-170 volts ( 150-500 watts). In general, kinetic efficiency improves and specific impulse increases with higher voltage \' but\nthrust/power ratio reaches a maximum usually below 300 watts. The best\nperformance to date has been about 15% kinetic efficiency at a specific\nimpulse of 1800 sec and with a thrust/power ratio of 4 mlb /kw. The performance of various thruster sizes and coil spacings at varying powers\nand mass flows is presented along with an evaluation of various hollow\ncathode sizes and materials. One tantalum cathode with a .044+ 1 ID x .014"\nand carbon\nwall and coated on the inside with a mixture of barium \t\nran continuously for over 400 hours before be r g shut down.\nThe thrustor operates as a low -pressure thermal expansion device.\nSince no net current can flow from the thrustor the non-equilibritm plasma\nestablishes an axial electric field which couples the expanding energetic\nelectron gas to the ions. The expansion is controlled by the application\nof a magnetic nozzle. Thrust is transmitted to the device both from the\nreaction of the electrons with the magnetic field and the direct plasma\nreaction on the thrustor\'s physical structure. A detailed investigation\nof the exhaust beam has ueen carried out (reference 2). Local ion energies\nand fluxes were mapped by means of a Langmuir calorimetric probe, plasma\npotential surfaces were determined with an emitting probd, and electron\ntempex :^ture and density were measured with a Langmuir probe. Gross thrust\nmeasurements taken on a pendulum thrust stand agree favorably with the\nforce calculated by integrating about a momentum contour in the exhaust\nbeam. The presence of an ambipolar electric field was determined from\nthe emitting probe survey. Its value is shown to be in agreement with\nthat calculated from the measured electron pressure gradient. Calculation\nof the electron force on the magnetic field from electron pressure measurements and magnetic field shape indicates that about half the thrust is\napplied to the magnetic field.\n\nI\t\n\n36\nREFER LACES\n1.\nf\n\nSeikel, G.R., Bowditch, D.N., and Domitz, S.: AIAA Papr 64-677,\n(August 1964).\n\n2.\n\nBowditch, D.N.: AIAA Paper 66-195, (March 1966).\n\n37\nA LAN%IUIR CALORIMETRIC PROBE\nTO DETERMI Z AVERAGE ENERGY IN A PLASMA BEAM\nBy D. N. Bowditch\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\nLewis Research Center\nCleveland, Ohio\nABSTRACT\nA plane guard - ringed Langmuir probe, Figure 1, is described \'that\ncan simultaneously measure the current and power to the probe face.\nThis is clone by gluing a material which is both an electrical\ninsulator and thermal resistance between the probe face and a watercooled probe body. The thermal resistance is calibrated by\ndetermining the probe \' s dynamic response to step changes in heat\ninput.\nThe characteristics of thermal power to the probe versus bias\nvoltage is interpreted by use of collisionless sheath theory. If\nthe probe is assumed to be in a plasma beam with average enemy per\nion of Ue (eV) and average ion velocity Lro -> kEe , the\n\nmeasured ion power flux to the probe surface is\n-Cor VP V>p\n\nwhere j; is the beam ion current. density, 4,\xe2\x80\xa2 is the ionization\npotential, ^y, is the surface work function, ds is the probe\nsecondary emission current density .. and V and Vp are the probe\npotential and the plasma potential, respectively. In typical\nexperiments the secondary emission current, is , is both essentially\nindependent of bias voltage and small compared to the ion current,\nJt . Thus, in the ion saturation region the slope of the probe\npower versus bias voltage determines the ion current. The difference\nbetween the directly measured current and the ion current yields the\nsecondary emission current. With the aid of an independent measurement of plasma potential, Vp , typical probe characteristics such\nas Figure 2 can, therefore, be interpreted to obtain the average\nenerMr per ion in the plasma beam, Vo , and the ion current density,\nt\n\nr\n\n38\n5L.\n\nOf particular interest in Figure 2 is that the energy flux of\nthe ions in the plasma beam is only a fraction of the power received\nat the calorimeter at floating; potential where in the past calorimetric measurements have generally been performed.\nThe probe described was used in Reference 1 to examine the\nexhaust of a plasma thrustor. Langmuir calorimetric probe and\nLangimair probe measurements were combined to draw a momentum contour\naround the thrustor. To calculate the thrust the following assumptions were made: ) all the ion energy, V. , is directed energy,\n2) the exhaust contains only singularly ionized ions, and 3) the\nexhaust has cylindrical symmetry. The thrust value thus calculated\nwas only 18 per cent higher than the direct thrust stand measurement:\n\nReferences\n1. Bowditch, D.

Detailed results have been obtained for\nhelium l , argon 2 , cesium and hydrogen 3 gases. Experimental excitation\ncross sections from the ground state have been used for the helium case.\nThe semi-classical Gryzinski 4 method has been used to determine theoretically the cross-section needed for the argon and cesium calculations. It\nis generally considered that the Gryzinski method will give absolute crosssections good to within a factor of two or better. However, using this\nmethod iii an ev/ion calculation should not introduce an appreciable error\nsince one is interested in the relative rates of the processes involved\nrather than the absolute magnitude of these rates. This method has also\nbeen used to calculate excitation and ionization cross-section for interaction between electrons and the metastable 2 1S and 235 states of helium.\nThese cross-sections have been used to calculate the effects of electronmetastable atom interactions on the volume ion production processes in\nhelium 5 . An approximate theory is also presented which gives the volume\nion production cost for a general atom as a function of electron kinetic\ntemperature.

Lpran, John V. Dugan, Jr. and Lynn U. Albers\n?rational Aeronautics and Space Administration\nLewis RFIsearch Center\nCleveland, Wn\nAPSTRACT\nThe present work was undertaken to investigate the validity of local\nt,hermodynanic equilibrium (LTE) assumptions in the type of nonequilibrium\ndischarge of interest for i;:agnetohydrodynamic (MHD) power generation.\nThe two-temperature LTE theory assumes that: (a) the free electron\ndistribution function is maxwellian at a temperature Te which may be\nconsiderably higher than the gas temperature, (b) the bound electron\nstates are pc;nilated according to a Boltzmann distribution at Te and\n(c) the free electron number density Ne has the Saha value corresponding\nto Te.\nThe validity of assumptions (b) and (c) has been investigated by\nseveral workers (e.g., ref. 1). Assumption (a) has received less\nattention, however. It cannot be studied independently of the other\ntwo assumptions, because the rELtes of excitation and ionization depend\nstrongly on the distribution function of the free electrons, which in\nturn is sensitive to any departure of the bound states from equilibrium.\nThis parer reports preliminary results of an investigation undertaken\nto establish the validity of LTE for MHD plasmas. In general, the\nanalysis involves numerical solution of the Boltzmann equation for the\nfree electron energy distribution function f(u) and the steady-state\nrate equations for the bound states. The problem was attacked in the\nfollowing three stages.\nFirst, f(u) was calculated from a Boltzmann equation which included\nonly the electric field and the elastic collision terms, V e being\nobtained from the Saha equation. Typical results are shown in Fig. 19\nwhere the theory is compared with the theory and experiment of Kerrebrock\nand Hoffman (ref. 2) on a graph of electrical conductivity versus current\ndensity for Ar \xe2\x99\xa6 0.15% K at 1 atm and 15000 K gas temperature.\nThe main conclusion of these calculations was that the experimentally\nobserved dip in the electrical conductivity at 103 amps - m-2 could\nnot be explained by a non-maxwellian distribution function, as suggested\nby Kerrebrock and Hoffmann. Ref. 3 summarizes this phase of the work.\nTo investigate the effect of inelastic collisions on f(u) and\nNev a five-level model cesium atom was chosen, consisting of three\ndiscrete excited states (6P, 5D, ?S) and a lumped state which\nencompasses all higher excited states. The characteristics of this\n\n50\n\nmodel atom were explored by solving the rate equations for the bound\nlevels, assuming a maxwellian f(u). The results were in good agreement\nwith previous work of BenDaniel and Tamor (rcf. 1), despite significant\ndifferences in the excitation and ionization cross sections, and were\nrelatively insensitive to changes in the V -ding energy and degeneracy\nof the lumped state. As expected, the escape probability for resonance\nradiation is the most important parameter in determining Ne and the\nstate populations.\nFinally, the simultaneous solution of the Boltzmann equation for\nf(u) !including all relevant elastic and inelastic collision terms)\nand\t\nbound-state rate equations is being carried out numerically\nby an iterative technique. Typical results (ref. 4) are shown in\nFig. 2 for Ar + 0.15% Cs at 1 atm pressure and 1500 0 gas temperature,\nfor the case of complete trapping of resonance radiation (all other\nradiation is allowed to escape). The results show trends which are\nsimilar in some respects to Kerrebrock and Hoffman\'s data for Ar + K,\nbut the conductivity decreases monotonically wi h decreasing current\ndensity, rather than increasing again below 100 amps - m- 2 (this\ntrend in experimental data is now\'believed to be due to residual\nionization from the are heater, see ref. 5).\nFuture plans are to improve convergence in the iterative solution,\nsince some difficulty has been experienced when Te G 2300\xc2\xb0 K (the\ndashed portion of the curve in Fig. 2). and to carry out calculations for\na range of conditions of interest for MHD power generation. The investigation may also be ex- tended to the analysis of other nonequilibrium\nplasmas.\n\n5-.\n\nREFERETCES\n1. PenDaniel, D.

Dugan, Jr.\nLewis Research Center\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\nCleveland, Ohio\nArgon seeded with cesium has been extensively studied as a\npromising system for MD power generation using nonequilibrium plasmas.l\nVolume recombination coefficients oL for carrier and seed ions are\nrequired for both the electron energy balance and the generalized Saha\nequations as was indicated in Ref. 2. The purpose of this study was\n\nto present theoretical results for these coefficien} s, compare them\nwith experimental values, and point out the expected accuracy of the\n\nGryzinski cross sections in the light of recent atonic beam results.\nCollisional-radiative recombination coefficients have been\nobtained for pseudo-alkali and hydrogen atom plasmas by Bates et al\nusing a quasi-equilibrium, steady-state approximation. Byron et al\nassumed in their hydrogen calculation that the limiting step in the\n\nchain of recombination events is deexcitation of bound electrons. The\ndeexcitation rate i\xc2\xa7 obtained from the excitation ra g e by the detailed\nbalancing relation. 5 The recombination rate of Ref. 4 is simply the\nwhich accounts\nproduct of t"-,.a minimum deexcitation rate and a factor \t\nfor nonequilibrium effects. The Gryzinski formulation was employed in\n\nRefs. 3 and 4 to compute collision cross sections for excitation of\nbound electrons.\n\nByron, Bortz, and Russe11 7 calculated recombination coefficients\n\nfor atomic hydrogen, potassium, and argon for electron temperatures\nfrom 500 0 to 2000 0 K. They assumed that atomic energy levt:ls form a\n"band" above and below each e,lectroiLic quantum gap. Ref. 8 is a\n\ncalculation of the purely collisional cC for cesium via the Byron\nmethod 4 but with detailed consideration of the discrete electronic\nstates. The Gryzinski excitation cross sections were used to calculate\ntransitions between these states. The range of electron temperatures\nTe studied was Extended to include 500 0 to 10,000 0 K, values 1 of interest\nfor the NRD generator utilizing nonequilibrium conductivity.\n\nseveral sour^mes is plotted\nI`he three-body coefficient aCr\nm\nPro \t\nversus T. in Fig. 1.. For the curve Prom Ref . 8, the quaY.ttum gaps\nwhich correspond to the minimum deexcitation rates are indicated. The\n\ndashed curvy: gives the results of Ref. 7 for potassium, while the\n*Submitted to . Jotomal of Applied physics as Communication\n\n54\nbroken curves from Ref. 3 are for a pseudo-alkali atom plasma. The\ncoefficient from Ref. 3 is a function of number density Ne because\nradiative deexcitation and two-body capture are included. The results\n\nare in good agreement with those of Ref. 9 performed for a 26 level\nmodel atom including all collisional and radiation effects.\nThe agreement between theory and experiment 10 , 11 , 12 for the alkali\nfirst and total excitation cross sections is we l l within the expected\naccuracy of the slope of the Gryzinski values 3 \' g near threshold (the\t\n\nf\n\ncritical region for low electron temperatures). The first excitat;^on\ncross section (cm 2 ) for cesium is low by a factor of 3 atp^ak13,14.\nbut in the near threshold region, the Gryzinsk^ slope, 30 etl\', is\nabout one-half of the experimental value, 75 R eV- , for the first one\neV. The (Maxwel.i averaged) Gryzinski total excitation coefficients..\nhowever, are as small as one-sixth of experiment a5 for Te values from\n1000 to 30000 K. Also, radiation effects may be important in both\nrecombination experiments and NHD systems. The contribution of this\ndeexcitation mechanism depends on the superelastic collision rate and\noptical absorption cross section of the important ionizing species.2,7,8\n\nValues of CC I ec for argon were calculated in the same fashion\n\nas the cesium coefficients and are plotted versus Te in Fig. 2 and\n\ncompar..ied with the hydrogen results of Refs. 3 and 7. The neglect of\nradiative deexcitation in the collisional calculation becomes less\nimportant at high temperatures as was pointed out in Ref. 8 where the\nmean radiative transition probabilities were compared with -the superelastic collision frequencies. 8 In part it has been shown that the\npurely collisional approach is a good approximation for cesium, Pven\ndown to 1O13 cm-3 8,9 , while the maximum radiative correction for argon\nis estimated to be 50 percent at T e - 10,0000 K. However\xe2\x80\x9e the\nabsorption cross section for the argon resonance line may be relatively\nsmall which would lead to considerable energy loss by line radiation.\n\nA;^ regards seeding criteria for .nonequilibrium MHD power generation,\nrecombination rates will not be very diffe\'^ent for carrier and seed\ngases at achievable electron temperatures. 1 However, the average\nenergy lost by the free electrons in recombination will depend on the\nmechanism by which the captured electrons become deexci.ted.\n\n4^\n\n55\nREFERENCES\n1.
