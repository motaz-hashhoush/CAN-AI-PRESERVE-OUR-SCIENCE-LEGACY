Scherrer\nInstitute for Plasma Rewea rch\nStanford University\nStanford, California 94305\nand\nRobert Howard\nHale Observatories\nPasadena, California 91101\n\nThe interplanetary magnetic field originates in the sun and has been\nfound (Wilcox and Mess, 1965) to be organized into longlived and largescale sectors of predominantly unipolar fields. The magnetic field structure curotates with the sun and evolves only slowly with time (e.g. Svalgaard and Wilcox, 1975). A similar ordering of the solar magnetic fields\nhas been demonstrated (Wilcox and Howard, 1968; Severny et al., 1970;\nSc:errer, 1973). These studies reveal a large-scale pattern in the photospheric w gnetic field extending over a wide rrnge\n\nof heliographic lati-\n\ntude on both sides of the equator. The boundary between oppositely directed fields was found to be nearly north-south crossing the equator. Such\nboundari\xe2\x80\xa2.4 have been identified in computed cororal magnetic field (Wilcox\nand Svalgaard, 1974) and associated with density enhancements of the whitelight corona near the sun by Hansen et al. (1974) and further observed as\ndistinct coronal streamers between 3 and 10 solar radi i from the center of\nthe sun by Howard and Koomen (1974). All these observations have been\norganized by Svalgaard et al, (1974), into a simple model of large-scale\nsolar magnetic fields. We note that the sector structure of these flelds\nexerts a controlling ii,fluence in shaping magnetic fields from the bottom\nof the photosphere though\' the corona and into interplanetary space to\nJupiter and beyond.\nThe large--scale nature of these fields is clearly illustrated by the\nfact that the sector structure becomes increasingly more difficult to observe\n\n1\n\nA\n\nas spatial resolution increases. It is in fact maybe best observed with\nno spatial resolution at all - observing the sun as a star, with tncrensing resolution we allays find a more complicated magnetic structure; even\nthe polar regions and the classical unipolar magnetic\n\nregions\n\n(UMR s) are\n\nseen to include magnetic elements of both polarities and even to be populated by tiny bipolar features ( Busiba and Howard, 1965; Severnv,1967;\nHarvey et al .,1975). There is now a growing acceptance of a further complication, namely that most, it not all, observed magnetic flux outside\nsunspots is concentrated into very small (<1 are sec) knots, normally not\nresolved by solar magnetogeaphs. The field strength in these knots is\nvery high, of the order of 2000 gauss ( Stenflo. 1973; Frazier, 1574).\nAltbas. solar magnetographs, such as the one at Mt. Wilson, recurd ex^.i\n\ntended regions of weak \'background\' fields of onl y about 1 - 5 gauss field\nstrength, such regions should not be considered to he unipolar weak field\nareas. The magnetograph is basically a flux measuring device and will record the magnetic flux integrated over the aperture of the instrueent, if\nthe number of positive polarity ( field directed away from the sun) elements\n\n9\n\nor knots exceeds the number of negative elements, the magnetrw roph will\ngenerally measure a positive excess flux for the integrating area. It is\nthis imbalance - as seen by solar magnetographs - that has been found to\nbe ordered in large-scale sectors. It is also this imbalance that controls\nthe structure of the magnetic field in the solar wind.\nIn the present study we shall utilize solar\n\nmagnetogramis\n\nobtained over\n\nthe 15 - year inv e z. 1 1959 -1973 at Mt. Wilson Observatory t r confirm and extend previous conclusions about the sector - structured solar ougnetic fields.\nThe analysis covers 1} sunspot cycles and uses data - sola r as well as\ninterplanetary - that are obtained w.tth different techniques and with isproving quality over the years. These factors do not, however, 2-" to\nhave any significant influence on the results, which appear to be largely\nIndependent of the observing techniques and of sunspot cycle phase. The\nsolar magnetograms are used to construct synoptic maps of the magnetic\nfield distribution in heliographic latitude and longitude for each\nCarrington rotaLlon in the 15 - year interval analyzed. The heliographic\nlongitudes of the solar sector boundaries were determined by adding 60 to\n\n2\n\nthe loWituwde of Central weridias at the ties of passage by the earth\nof an I* ;rplametary sector boundary. The 4j day transit tins fro n the\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nsaw to t" earth of the solar wind plasm corresponds to about We of\nsolar rotation.

The polar field reversal near the nextstua\nof cycle 20 1:% clearly seen. We can identify the polar cap boundary as\na generally east-wet destarcation lime narkiag the poleward limit of the\nsectors. These observed properties of the large-scale pbotospberic field\nare eery much as suggested an general grounds by 8valgaard st al. (1974)\nin their discussion of large-scale solar fields.\nThe amount of information in Fitanre 1 is not exhausted by the above\ncomments, and we shall be concerned with further investigation of details\nof these elusive and extended magnetic structures. Sons of these details\nare related to differences between the appearance of the sectors at the\nvarious epochs. The overall impression is, hosaver, one of consistency\nand invariance. At all times, the sectors can be identified; they stretch\nacross the equator with no change of polarity, Lad the transit time from\nthe sun to the earth seer to be near 41 days (or 600 n4 rotation) throughout the interval 1959-1973. The sector boundaries in the upper pbotosphere\n(where the spectral line usad at Mt. Wilson - )15250 - is formed) run r.3rthsouth with no shearing or distortion by differential rotation. The field\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nstrengths in the sectors sees to be comparable to the polar fiel4i, and\nduring the descending phase of the sunspot cycle the net fluz from the\nsectors and from the polar regions are also comparable (because the areas\nare about equal) suggesting the possibility of a significant interplay\nbetween the sector and the polar fields.\nThe Wt. Wilson magmetograph records the met magnetic flux over regions\nof the order of 20 z 20 are sec as seem from the earth, equivalent to about\n1 z 1 degree of bellograpbic coordinates near the center of the disk. If\nthe flux is very large, a saturation of the instrument occurs; this bappens regularly within active regions. For the purpose of investigating\nlarge-scale fields a further averaging of the fluxes over a large area\n(4 x 10 degrees at oenter of disk) was performed. This larger area is\nlarger then most active regians, tending to lead to a cancellation of\nroot of the fluz from the bipolar regions. This can be directly verified\nby the fact fiat the net flux from the larger area - containing an average\nactive region - is about one order of magnitude smaller than the flux from\n4\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nweb pole of the bipolur active region. Occasionally the cancellation\nIm less crosplete and large, spurious fluxes row- It. Such cases of seal\'-\n\n-\t\n\n,imile imbalance should be avoided in a study of large-\xe2\x80\xa2scale fields. This\nstatement is not true a\n\nrp iori,\n\nbut sti t be verified observationally. In\n\ncomputing the average synoptic saps of Figure 1, areas where the average\nflux density exceeded 8 gauss were omitted. This corresponds to about 15e\nof the data in the sunspot zones. If these few cases of high fluxes were\nnot omitted Mi sector structure was such less distinct, if discernable\nat all. Including the strong field regions thus increases the noise\nlevel to the point where the sector structure is almost lost. Therms is,\nof course, nothing significant About the magnitude, 8 puss, of the tb reshold defining a strong field region to be omitted. With a larger nurser of\nsector boundaries this threshold could be louvred. Various other thresholds have been tried and it was found that 8 gauss gave the clearest sector\nstructure signal for the number of boundaries (9100) available for each of\nthe six average synoptic saps of Figure 1.\nA consequencw of the fact that it is necessary to omit active regions\nin order to extract a solar sector structure from the synoptic maps seems\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nto be that the sector structure is not caused by or controlled by the strong\nmagnetic fields of active regions. More directly this follows also from tte\nexistence and stability of sectors at sunspot minimum. large-scale and longlived solar magnetic fields are\n\ncomweatloaally\n\nthought to be tte dispersing\n\nremnants of the strong fields in active regions and sunspots. The follower\npart of an active region drifts polevard as it expands and weakens forming a\nunipolar magnetic region (UM), each UM has its smaller, wearer counterpart - the ghost UM - that bas leader polarity and moves toward the equatr.r.\nBoth regions are sheared by differential rotation and the result of the whole\nprocess would seem to be a\n\nzonal\n\nstructure, where leading polarity would\n\naccumulate in a belt or zone near the equator, and the following polarity\nwould form a zone polswards of the equatorial leading polarity zone. Stich\nan arrangement is precisely what is observed (e.g. Howard, 1974s) and appears\nalso superposed on the sectorial structures of Figure 1. In particular, a\nzoos of sagative (leading) polarity can be seen extending through the p \xe2\x80\xa2 .isitive sector of tbo (+,-) sector-pair during\n\n5\n\n1955-1969.\n\n\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nHarvey et al. (1975) extended their earlier (Harvey MW Martin, 1973)\nstudy of Ephemeral Regions (ER). These are very small bipolar regions\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nfound all over the solar surface; hundreds of ns are present an the sun\nat any time even in the polar regions and in coranal holes (extended cream\nof low teap_rature and density.!. The magnetic flux appeartag in the fora\noY BRs is as large as appears in regular active regions, bat the orientation\nof the line connecting the two poles of the Eats is almost random - not nearly\neast-west as for the larger active regiou&. It is not clear how the ERs are\ndispersing or disappearing - their lifetime is only of the order of } day.\nDue to the random orientation of the ERs very little order would be expected in the dispersinit flux from decaying Ephemeral Regions. The importance of the 3Rs for the present study arises frog the demonstration\nthat not all magnetic structures and phenomena necessarily derive from\nthe dynamics of existing active regions. It is becoming increasingly\napparent that alternative interpretations are viable. Maybe the various\nmagnetic structures are all symptoms or byproducts of a number of different\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nprocesses operating on a broad spectrum of temporal and spatial soles.\nSome of these processes may bo coupled in ways we at the present are con-\n\n\'\t\n\npletely unaware of. It is certainly true that the sun is more complex\non all scales that we thought just a few years ago. The concept of solar\nsector magnetism (Wilcox, 1971) and its possible interplay with other largescale fields (Svalgaard et al., 1974) isolate but one aspect of this complexity. The large scale - both spatial and temporal - of this aspect\nsuggests that a sector structure is among the fundamental properties of the sun and p7ssibly also of other magnetic stars.\nThe implication of the sector concept as stated above is that the\nsectors are not \'ust particular arrangements of remnants of dispersing\nactive regions as discussed for instance by Hansen et al. (1974), but\nare fundasr utal entities created !nd waintained independently of specific\nactive resi gns. Physical processr y that may lead to sector-like organisation of the solar 1laldsin and below the photosphere have been discussed b\xe2\x80\xa2 a number of workers W .g. Stiz, 1974; Suess, 1975; Wolff, 1975);\nwe have no assurance that the pose=bilities are exhausted by the serhanisms\nproposed so far.\n\n6\n\nWe now proceed to a Quantitative analysis of the sector signal\nIn so vividly displayed in Figure 1. The solar magnetograpb data was\naveraged over areas covering\n\n10\n\nof longitude and 1/30 of the diameter\n\nof the disk in latitude. This swans that the ordinate of Figure 1\nactually is expressed In units of sin b, where b is the heliographic\nlatitude. The contour lines were drawn from a 30 x 19 matrix of numbers\neach expressing the average flux density for that particular area,\ncharacterized by its distance from a sector boundary and from the equator.\nBecause the sectors extended up to or slightly beyond 30 0 of latitude,\nwe computed the average flux density for each average 10 0 longitude section\nbut including only areas within 32.2 0 of the equator, corresponding to 16\nstrips of each 1/30 of a diameter. In short, we are computing the i.eld\nstrength within a solar magnetic sector as function of distance from the\nsector boundary. Again, data values greater that: i 6 gauss were omitted.\nThe result is shown in Figure 2, separately for (+,-) and for (-,+) secfor boundaries,\nThe flux density seems to attain its maximum value, about n.5 gauss,\nsow tens of degrees from the sector boundary. The gradual c)iange across\nthe boundary say be related to variations in transit time or to local\ndeviations from a perfect north-south sector boundary. We shall not coswent further on this problem, but instead note that the field is not zero\nat the boundary. In both cases a field strength of -O.OB gauss is found.\nThis discrepancy might be interpreted as a systematic error in the determination of the zero-level for the solar sagnetogrmph. This interpretation\nIs supported by the finding by Scherrer (1973) that the correlation between\nthe photospberic magnetic field and the interplanetary field was best assuming a zero-level of -0.10 2 0.05 for the solar field. The average field\nstrength for the whole disk during the interval 1967-1973 was found to be\n-0,071 gauss by Howard (197401 and might be interpreted as a zero-lwvel error, Because only the line-of-sight component of the magnetic field is observed.\nouch zero-level errors could arise from systematic differences between\nthe field inclinations to the radial in the photosphere and are thus not\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nnecessarily purely instrumental, although they night very well be so.\nIt seem reasonable to conclude that the typical field strength within\n\n7\n\na -olar magnetic sector, as observed\n\nliy\n\nthe Mt. Wilson magnetograph, is\n\nr..:Aos^ 0.5 gauss. This is very similar to the typical magnitude of the\n*:\'-` , A field of the sun, i.e. the field observed using ,just integrated sunlight with no spatial resolution at all (e.g. Scherrer, 1973). We again\nremind the raider that what is roally observed in both cases is a flux\nimbalance of the order of 2 x 10 21 maxwells. Due to various systematic\nerrors (e.g. Scherrer, 1973) this flux is probably too low by a factor\nof about 2, raiaiag the typical avercge field strength to about 1 gauss\nand the fInx to 4 x 10 21 maxwells. It is interesting to note that about\n1.8 gauss is required to give the observed radial component of 4 x 10-5\ngauss of the interplanetary magnetic field near the earth assuming a simple\ninverse-square scaling, We conclude that both the solar magnetograph data\nthe interplanetary field data indicate a flux density of the order of\n7 gauss of the +pen field lines that extend into the solar wind. This\nis about one order of magnitude smaller than the probable flux density\nin the sunspot zones within t 40 0 of the equator (Howard, 1974b; Livingston\nand Harvey, 1975) iadieating that most field lines are closed very near\nthe sun and that only about 1.0\xc2\xb0 of the flu_ is making up the interplaneta n\xe2\x80\xa2\nmagnetic field.\nIt was suggested by Svalgaard et al. (1974) that although sector boundar\xc2\xb1es are north-south in the photosphere they iay be tilted away from the\nnorth-so g ith direction at some distance from VAe sun. The various observations of sector boundary indicators that were discussed in the beginning\nof the present paper say be utilized to investigate possible tilts of the\nboundaries ns a function of distance from the sun. We will disc.iss t\'_e tilt\nIn terms of the inclination of the boundary to the solar equator as measured\nat the 11Ane of the solar equator.\nWe shall first consider tines away from sunspot maximum or more precisel y away from the polar field reversal. At such times an interplanetary\nsector with the same polarity as the north(south) polar region is observed\nat the earth to be wider wh:.n\n\n%e\n\nearth is to the north (south) of the\n\nequatorial plane of the sun !nd to be narrower when the earth is to the\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nsou,O (nr,rth) of the solar equator\xe2\x80\xa2 . The ma^nitude of this RosenbergColewan effect (Rosenberg and Coleman, 1969; N&egecock, 1975) is such as\n\n8\n\nr^\n\nto indicate an inclination of about 15 0 . The streamers observed by Howard\nand Koomen (1974) between 3 and 10 solar radii from the center of the sun\nhave been an indication of about 25 0 , while the streamers observed by Hansen\net al. (1974) at 1.5 solar radii are inclined about 45 0 to the solar equator. Finally in the photosphere - at 1,0 RE) - the inclination is close to\n900\xe2\x80\xa2\nFigure 3 summarizes all these observations and leads to the suggestion\nthat the inclination of the sector boundaries changes systematically with\ndistance from the sun as shown in the lower panel of Figure 3. Since most\nof the &,ange takes place near the sun, we suggest that the sector structure\nof the interplanetary magnetic field is confined to a rather thin regimen\nnear the solar equatorial plane. The implication is that in most of the\nheliosphere the polar fields determine the polarity of the interplanetary\nmagnetic field. Near the time of polar field reversal the -ituation i4\nmuch less clear and the geometry of the field at such times remains an open\nproblem. Out-of-ecliptic spacecraft at different phases of the sunspot\ncycle should be instrumental in resolving these problems.\n\nAcknowlodgements\nThis work was supported in part by the National Aeronautics\nand Space Administration under Grant NGR 05-020-559, by the Atmospheric\nSciences Section of the National Science Foundation under Grant DES74190"\t\n\nand by the Office of Naval Research Contract N0001.1-67-A-0112-\n\n0068.\n\na\n\n9\n\n\t\n\nReferences\n\nBumtxt,\t\n\nand Howard, R,: 1965, 3rd Consultation on Solar Physics and\n- drodynaaics, Prague, 24,\n\nFer.zier, E,N,: 1974, Solar Phys,,\t\n\n38, 69.\n\nHansen, S., Sawyer, C. and Hansen, R,T,: 1974, Geophys, Res.

The sectors are clearly\nvisible in the photospberic magnetic field. \t Sector boundaries can be clearly identified as north-south running demarcation lines between regions of persistent\t ma gnetic polarity imbalances.\t These regiona extend up to about 350 of latitude on bot\nsides of the equator.\t They generally do not extend into the polar caps.\t The polar\ncap boundary can be identified as an east-west dealarcation line marking the pole-\n\nward limit ohthe sectors.\t The typical flux imbalance for a magnetic sector is\nabout 4 x 10\t\n\nmaxwells.\n\nFORM\n\xc2\xae\xc2\xae, A \t 1473\t\n\nU11CLA88IIrISD\nA& FMaradl\n\n'
