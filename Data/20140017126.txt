b'Dynamic Modeling of Ascent Abort Scenarios for Crewed Launches\nMark Bigler, NASA Johnson Space Center\nRoger L. Boyer, NASA Johnson Space Center\nFor the last 30 years, the United States\xe2\x80\x99 human space program has been focused on low\nEarth orbit exploration and operations with the Space Shuttle and International Space\nStation programs. After over 40 years, the U.S. is again working to return humans\nbeyond Earth orbit. To do so, NASA is developing a new launch vehicle and spacecraft\nto provide this capability. The launch vehicle is referred to as the Space Launch System\n(SLS) and the spacecraft is called Orion. The new launch system is being developed with\nan abort system that will enable the crew to escape launch failures that would otherwise\nbe catastrophic as well as probabilistic design requirements set for probability of loss of\ncrew (LOC) and loss of mission (LOM). In order to optimize the risk associated with\ndesigning this new launch system, as well as verifying the associated requirements,\nNASA has developed a comprehensive Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) of the\nintegrated ascent phase of the mission that includes the launch vehicle, spacecraft and\nground launch facilities.\nGiven the dynamic nature of rocket launches and the potential for things to go wrong,\ndeveloping a PRA to assess the risk can be a very challenging effort. Prior to launch and\nafter the crew has boarded the spacecraft, the risk exposure time can be on the order of\nthree hours. During this time, events may initiate from either the spacecraft, the launch\nvehicle, or the ground systems, thus requiring an emergency egress from the spacecraft to\na safe ground location or a pad abort via the spacecraft\xe2\x80\x99s launch abort system. Following\nlaunch, again either the spacecraft or the launch vehicle can initiate the need for the crew\nto abort the mission and return home. Obviously, there are thousands of scenarios whose\noutcome depends on when the abort is initiated during ascent and how the abort is\nperformed. This includes modeling the risk associated with explosions and benign\nsystem failures that require aborting a spacecraft under very dynamic conditions,\nparticularly in the lower atmosphere, and returning the crew home safely. This paper will\nprovide an overview of the PRA model that has been developed of this new launch\nsystem, including some of the challenges that are associated with this effort.\nKey Words: PRA, space launches, human space program, ascent abort, spacecraft,\nlaunch vehicles\n\nI.\n\nIntroduction\n\nWith the retirement of the Space Shuttle in 2011, NASA has been developing a new\nlaunch vehicle and spacecraft to provide the return of the United States to deep space.\nAlong with a new objective to go beyond Low Earth Orbit for the first time in over 40\nyears, the new launch system is being developed with an abort system that will enable the\ncrew to escape launch failures that would otherwise be catastrophic. In order to optimize\nthe risk associated with designing this new launch system, NASA has developed a\ncomprehensive PRA of the integrated system, including the launch vehicle, spacecraft\nand ground launch facilities. Given the dynamic nature of rocket launches and potential\nfor things to go wrong, developing a PRA model to assess the risk is a challenging effort.\nThis includes modeling the risk associated with explosions and aborting a spacecraft\nunder very dynamic conditions, particularly in the lower atmosphere. This paper\nprovides an overview of the PRA model that has been developed of this new launch\nsystem, including some of the challenges that are associated with this effort.\nII.\n\nDescription of Mission and Elements1\n\nThe analysis was based on the High Lunar Orbit (HLO) Design Reference Mission\n(DRM), which is a 14 day crewed mission planned for the early 2020\xe2\x80\x99s as Exploration\nMission-2 (EM-2). The scope of the analysis to date has been focused on the ascent\nportion of the mission, starting at approximately three hours prior to launch when the\ncrew has ingressed the vehicle and ends with successful insertion into a stable orbit.\nFuture updates to the analysis include the in-space and Earth Entry, Descent, Landing\n(EDL) and Recovery portions of the mission. The ascent abort portions of the model are\nassessed to splashdown.\nThe SLS is the heavy lift capability necessary to support a flexible path approach. The\nSLS provides the mass to orbit and energy levels necessary to place exploration elements\n(e.g. Orion) into Low Earth Orbit (LEO) for transfer to higher orbits and beyond.\nThe SLS provides an evolvable configuration to meet the needs of the capability driven\nframework in an affordable manner. The initial SLS configuration provides a liquid\noxygen/liquid hydrogen (LOX/LH2) Core Stage (CS) with two Solid Rocket Boosters\n(SRBs) to place 70 metric tons (t) into LEO. This SLS configuration also employs the\nInterim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (ICPS), a LOX/LH2 based element that provides an\ninitial capability sufficient to perform the early Tactical DRMs, such as the HLO DRM.\nTo support early operational missions, the SLS evolves with a block upgrade approach to\na 105-t mass to orbit configuration using the Core Stage with advanced boosters. SLS\nsupports longer term architectural DRMs with a 130-t mass to orbit configuration by\nadding a propulsion element to the 105-t configuration.\nThe Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) is a pressurized, crewed element that\ntransports up to four crew members (evolvable to six) from the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface to exoLEO destinations or staging points and brings the crew members safely back to the\nEarth\xe2\x80\x99s surface at the end of a mission. The MPCV provides all services necessary to\n\nsupport the crew members while onboard for shorter duration (1-21 days) missions or\nuntil they are transferred to another vehicle for longer duration missions.\nThe MPCV consists of a Crew Module (CM), a Service Module (SM), Spacecraft\nAdaptor (SA), and a Launch Abort System (LAS). The CM provides a habitable\npressurized volume to support crew members and cargo during all phases of a given\nmission - from Launch Operations to Earth Entry, Descent, Landing (EDL) and\nRecovery. The SM provides services to the CM in the form of propulsion, consumables\nstorage, heat rejection and power generation. The LAS provides an abort capability to\nsafely transport the CM away from the launch vehicle stack in the event of an emergency\non the launch pad or during ascent. The SM also provides some abort capability for\nhigher altitude aborts. The abort system was a major focus of this analysis.\nGround Systems Development and Operations (GSDO) provides common infrastructure,\nand services to perform processing, launch, and recovery of flight elements. These\ncapabilities include receiving, ground processing, integration, integrated and interface\ntesting, vehicle servicing, launch operations, recovery, de-integration, refurbishment,\ndisposal, emergency egress/escape, and contingency flight crew rescue/crew module\nretrieval operations.\nFinally, there are several different abort modes that are available to save the crew in the\nevent of a life threatening failure. MPCV Mode 1 abort (i.e., LAS Abort) capability is\nprovided by the Orion LAS and may be performed any time after the LAS is armed on\nthe launch pad until LAS jettison during CS ascent. Prior to LAS arming on the pad,\nemergency egress using a slide wire system is the only way to try to save the crew. PostLAS arming and prior to launch, both emergency egress and LAS abort are available to\nthe crew, with the choice depending on the failure. The LAS pulls the CM away rapidly\nduring early parts of ascent in the lower atmosphere.\nAt higher altitudes, the SM is used to try to save the crew. However, given its lower\nthrust capability compared to the LAS, it pulls away from the SLS much more slowly and\nalso requires the launch vehicle to terminate its thrust first prior to separation. MPCV\nMode 2 aborts (i.e., Untargeted Abort Splashdown (UAS)) are performed using the Orion\nCrew and Service Module (CSM) and may be performed any time after LAS jettison\nthrough completion of the ICPS insertion maneuver into a stable orbit. MPCV Mode 2\ndoes not use the SM thrust. The spacecraft separation mechanism springs provide the\ninitial separation impulse, after which the only active propulsion required from the SM is\na short Auxiliary (Aux) thruster burn to provide sufficient clearance of the Orion\nspacecraft from the SLS.\nMPCV Mode 4 abort (i.e., Abort to Orbit (ATO)) capability is provided by the Orion\nCSM and may be performed once sufficient orbital energy exists such that SM-only\npropulsion can place Orion in a safe obit while preserving the capability to perform an\neventual deorbit burn. MPCV Mode 4 aborts are available until completion of the\nnominal ICPS insertion maneuver into a stable orbit. For EM-2, the first MPCV Mode 4\ncapability exists prior to MPCV Mode 2 aborts impacting Africa. Unlike MPCV Mode 2\n\naborts, MPCV Mode 4 leverages the SM Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) engine and\nauxiliary thrusters after separation from SLS to achieve an orbital target.\nIn all abort cases, the MPCV landing systems (e.g., chutes, etc.) must operate to ensure a\nsuccessful abort and safe recovery of the crew. Higher altitude aborts also may require\nuse of the Thermal Protection System (TPS) and require a deorbit burn (Mode 4 aborts\nonly).\nIII.\n\nOverview of Model\n\nThe Integrated Design Analysis Cycle 2a (IDAC-2a) Cross PRA (XPRA) is a linked\nevent tree \xe2\x80\x93 fault tree model. The event trees were constructed using the SAPHIRE2 tool\nby the XPRA Team (XPRAT) based on the major mission milestones of the current EM2 mission of record\xe2\x80\x99s pre-launch and ascent phases, along with their associated aborts. A\nCross Program PRA Methodology Document3 was created to guide all participating\nprograms in development of their models for input into the IDAC-2a XPRA model. This\nmethodology document is based on standard PRA practices, including PRA practices\nused in the nuclear industry.\nFault trees developed by PRA teams from the SLS, GSDO, and Orion MPCV programs\nwere linked in the integrated model. In addition, the XPRAT created fault trees to\nintegrate the abort performance simulation results from the MPCV Flight Performance\nGroup and Human Reliability Analysis (HRA) inputs into the abort phases of the model.\nThe IDAC-2a XPRA consists of four event trees that are linked to hundreds of fault trees\nthrough decision logic and event tree rules as illustrated in Figure 1. The four event trees\ninclude major timeline events, or top events, for the pre-launch, nominal ascent, ascent\nabort, and abort EDL mission phases. Fault trees for Orion, SLS, and GSDO are mapped\nto the top events. These fault trees represent Orion, SLS, or GSDO system failures that\nresult in a LOC, a LOM, or an abort scenario. In all of the event trees, there are instances\nwhere multiple fault trees are mapped to a single top event. For these particular\ninstances, event tree rules assign specific fault trees to the corresponding top event branch\nbased on a particular failure condition that has occurred.\nThe four end-states that exist in the IDAC-2a XPRA SAPHIRE model are as follows:\nLOC, LOM, LOMAT and OK. LOC is defined as death of, or permanently debilitating\ninjury to, one or more crew members; LOM is defined as the inability to complete any\nsignificant/primary mission objective; LOMAT, which is not shown in the figure, is\ndefined as the abortable failure scenarios initiated by Orion, SLS or GSDO that occur\nduring the Prelaunch and Ascent phases that will ultimately result in either LOC or LOM,\nand is used in off-line calculations of conditional abort LOC; and OK is defined as the\nsuccessful completion of all nominal mission phases.\nKey inputs to the model are the SLS and Orion conditional ascent abort probabilities. If\nthe abort environment (e.g., debris, blast, fireball) created by an SLS failure exceeds the\ncapability of the Orion, it is captured in SLS fault tree logic that maps directly to LOC in\n\nthe integrated ascent LOC model. These conditional abort probabilities are calculated\nseparately outside the model based on off-line time-dependent analysis using a\n\nFigure 1: XPRA Event Tree Logic\ncombination of physical models, engineering-level physics models, and empirical data\nresults from historical tests to characterize the prevailing conditions to which the crewed\nvehicle is exposed. Probabilistic estimates for successful abort attempts are based on the\nfailure environment conditions, the vehicle design thresholds and capabilities, and the\namount of warning time provided.\nMPCV Guidance, Navigation and Control (GN&C) abort performance factors, provided\nvia the MPCV/SLS Abort Integration Team (MSAIT), and SLS ascent failure scenarios,\notherwise known as LOM scenarios which are mapped to Orion LOM Abortable (LOMA)\nInitial Conditions (ICs), are combined through logic and rules in the model for successful\nabort attempts. The Orion GN&C abort performance factors account for the probability\nthat the Orion could fail to successfully fly out the abort trajectory given that it has\nsurvived the initial environment generated by a major failure of the SLS, Orion, or\nground systems. Fault trees from these programs are combined and linked to the\nappropriate top event branches in the event trees. These combinations help to determine\nthe most significant integrated ascent abort LOC risks.\nAnother major input into the model is HRA. In some cases, it was determined that\nautomatic abort triggers were impractical or undesirable, thus manual aborts by the flight\ncrew or ground would be required in these cases. Human error events were identified in\n\nthese cases and the XPRAT created fault trees to integrate the HRA inputs into the abort\nphases of the model. This input is illustrated in Figure 2. Given the immaturity in the\nunderstanding of the operations of the vehicle at this early stage of the design,\n\na screening methodology was utilized by the XPRAT to quantify any human error events\nthat were identified. The screening analysis assigns conservative values to the human\nactions based on a basic characterization of the action as a function of the time available\nfor the human to identify the failure, decide what to do, and act on that decision, along\nwith consideration of adverse condition like environment and stress. Human error events\nidentified in this analysis were provided to the crew and operations for review. At this\npoint in the design, all of the assessments are considered preliminary.\nFor the pre-launch part of the model, emergency egress is also a crew survival option,\nand is the only option prior to LAS arming as described earlier. For those failures which\nwould lead to an emergency egress, an emergency egress model was included to account\nfor the LOC due to a failed emergency egress.\nEvent tree rules were used extensively in this model. There are three principle uses of\nevent tree rules in the IDAC-2a XPRA: to substitute one top event for another given a\nspecial condition, to assign different fault trees whenever multiple-split branches are used\nfor any particular top event, and to prevent the creation of nonsensical sequences and\ntheir cut sets.\nIV.\n\nApplications of the Model\n\nAs stated earlier, this model serves two important purposes. First, it is used to verify\nwhether the integrated system is meeting LOC/LOM requirements. There are several\nrequirements which the model serves to verify. These include ascent LOC and LOM\nrequirements for SLS, along with ascent LOC and conditional abort LOC requirements\nfor MPCV. Perhaps more importantly, this model also provides a capability of showing\nrisks of the integrated system that the individual program models (SLS or Orion) do not\ncapture that can support a risk-informed design process. This information can be used for\nexample to optimize the abort triggers to try to maximize the risk reduction achievable\nwith the abort system. It can also point out areas of uncertainty where our knowledge of\nthe design, operations and/or interfaces is not well understood, and more analysis and/or\ntesting needs to be performed to better understand them. It can also point out areas that\nare very sensitive to assumptions made regarding the model, for example the abort initial\nconditions associated with some failure scenarios.\nV.\n\nChallenges\n\nSeveral challenges have been encountered in the development of the ascent abort model.\nFirst, there are some issues associated with using the PRA in the design phase as opposed\nto the operational phase. For example, in trying to model human error for ascent aborts,\nHRA screening analysis was used to populate the human error events in the model\nbecause the operations and training are either very immature or non-existent at this point.\nAs a consequence, these events show up as very high risk drivers. This can have the\nunintended consequence of causing outside stakeholders to be skeptical of the PRA and\nunwilling to use it.\nTrying to integrate very complex and dynamic events, which are not well understood,\npose another challenge to this effort. For example, for some failure cases such as thrust\nvector control failures, very detailed simulations have been performed to understand the\ninitial conditions at abort so that the response of the aborting vehicle can be better\ncharacterized. However, for other failure cases such as vehicle explosions, the abort\ninitial conditions are not as well understood or easy to model. Thus, a more subjective\napproach has been used until these scenarios can be better modeled.\nFollowing a self-integration approach across these NASA programs yields some\nvariations in modeling. For example, some programs attempted to model down to a level\nof detail not supported by data. This is partially in response to the types of questions\nbeing asked of the PRA by the decision makers, for example abort trigger trade studies.\nIn these cases, the analysts use engineering judgment to come up with estimates of the\nevents. In order to deal with this situation, the analysts should consider performing\nsensitivity analyses on these events and/or look at the importance measures associated\nwith these events. For those events that are high importance and/or the model is very\nsensitive to the estimates of these events, more analysis and/or testing may be necessary\nto validate or better characterize the assumptions that went into these estimates. The\nother alternative is to model at a higher level where data exists.\n\nGiven multiple programs with or without a LOC requirement, one must assign an owner\nfor the risk. In many cases, such as pre-launch, the programs are so intimately integrated\nthat it is very difficult, if not impossible, to separate the risks and assign to the various\nprograms. For most failures, the programs have agreed to define the capabilities of the\nOrion to environment generated by SLS, which are then used to assign risk between the\nprograms, depending on the likelihood of exceeding these defined limits. However, in\nrecent iterations of the model, new situations have been identified that may need to be\ndefined in order to assign the risk to the various programs. For example, for manual\naborts where sufficient time for the crew or ground to respond to a failure is not\navailable, the program that initiates the risk becomes the owner. The other situation that\ncould arise from this LOC requirement by program is that it could actually be\ncounterproductive and actually result in a higher overall risk to the integrated system in\norder to meet the individual program requirements. So far this has not been an issue.\nFinally, reviewing a model of this size and complexity is not trivial, particularly when the\nanalysts are faced with challenging schedules and limited resources. In trying to review a\nmodel of this size, it is attempted to verify there are no errors in the integrated model by\ndoing both vertical and horizontal checks of the model, including checking for missing\nsequences, comparison with the program model LOC/LOM results, missing flag events,\nrules, basic event values, and so on. It is possible that some errors could slip through the\ncracks. The main objective is to make sure that any errors that do would not significantly\nimpact the results of the model. It is believed that all major modeling errors have been\nidentified and corrected to date.\nVI.\n\nConclusion\n\nGiven these challenges, it is believed that this model represents a very useful tool to help\nverify LOC/LOM requirements and to support trade studies to optimize the allocation of\nresources to obtain the most risk reduction within all other constraints. The model will be\nexpanded in future updates to include additional mission phases, such as in-space and\nnominal EDL, and challenges identified in the previous section will be addressed to\nimprove the overall quality of the model.\nReferences\n1.
