b"1\n\nI\n\nCENSUS BLOCK BOUNDARIES ON TACOMA IMAGE EXTRACT\n\nI\nLand Use Planning Computer technology, aerial\nphotography and space imagery are being combined in a NASA community services program\ndesigned to help solve land use and natural\nresource planning problems.\nAs urban areas grow, so grows the need for\ncomprehensive, up-to-date information on which\nto base intelligent decisions regarding land use.\nState and local planners need information such\nas the nature of urban change, where the\nchanges are occurring, how they affect public\nsafety, transportation, the economy, tax assessment, sewer systems, water quality, flood\nhazard, noise impact and a great variety of other\nconsiderations. Most importantly they need continually updated maps. Preparing timely maps,\ngathering the essential data and maintaining it\nin orderly fashion are becoming matters of\nincreasing difficulty.\nThe NASA project, which has nationwide\npotential for improving efficiency in the planning\nprocess, is a pilot program focused on Tacoma,\nWashington and surrounding Pierce County. Its\nkey element, developed by Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), is a computerized Land Use\nManagement lnformation System (LUMIS).\n\nTCOMA3X\n\nSUN JAN 309 1977 193759 JPLOa'IPL\n\nLUMIS went into operation in Tacoma on a\nlimited basis last year; it will be expanded to\nhandle additional city planning functions and it\nmay eventually include all of Pierce County.\nThe LUMIS computer stores and monitors\nland use and zoning maps, census, housing and\nother data records. It gets mapping input from\nground surveys, aerial photography (photo) and\nsatellite imagery. The system develops a geographic and analytical profile of the whole urban\narea, and planners can retrieve any portion of\nthe information, presented on a graphic display.\nLUMIS is expected to improve data reporting,\ncut down on duplication of effort and save\nconsiderable time in the planning and management processes.\nIn a companion program, NASA funded JPL\nto develop a similar Image Based lnformation\nSystem (IBIS) for coverage of broader areas.\nIBIS will get high attitude mapping input from a\nNASA U-2 research plane operated by Ames\nResearch Center and from Landsat Earth resources satellites. The system will be used by\nTacoma and Pierce County as part of a threestate natural resources inventory in Washington,\nOregon and Idaho.\n\n"
