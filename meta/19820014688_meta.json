The plan is to: examine the results of past demonstration projects to identify successful operational applications, take advantage of geographic information systems, and work toward reducing/eliminating constraints of the present system which inhibit operational use. Support for the LANDSAT program was demonstrated by sending a user representative to NOAA working in the development of a user oriented system. It is suggested that the state should reassess its position, by taking advantage of the past 8 years' experience, and coordinate efforts to enhance LANDSAT' advantages in a cost effective manner.", "title": "First down and goal to go", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-10T18:22:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19820014688, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Little, G."}, "organization": {"name": "Washington State Dept. of Natural Resources", "location": "Olympia, WA, United States"}}, "id": "6919152a64a34557b6ca74c6a8c6640c"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-04-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19820014688, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19820014688, "id": "36184c79fa8144bc96a9dcb19f1bee8a", "publicationName": "NASA.
