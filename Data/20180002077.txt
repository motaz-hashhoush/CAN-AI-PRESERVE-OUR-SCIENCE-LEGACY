The\nliquid-filled part is designated as the evaporator section where\nheat was applied.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The end of the other leg was designated as the condenser section\nwhere a coolant flow was circulated.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Tests were conducted by tilting the evaporator leg 90 degrees and\n30 degrees relative to the horizontal plane.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The liquid-filled evaporator section was divided into 7 equal-length\nsegments where various heat load distributions and heat fluxes\nwere applied.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The study consisted of employing different sequences of applying\nthe heat load distributions and heat fluxes.\n\nHP Startup in Reflux Mode \xe2\x80\x93 Ku 2018\n\n4\n\nTest Article\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The test article was a spare unit from the\nLRO flight project.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The heat pipe:\n\xe2\x80\x93 Two legs with lengths of 1168 mm and\n1016 mm, respectively.\n\xe2\x80\x93 Outer diameter: 15 mm\n\xe2\x80\x93 Vapor core diameter: 11 mm\n\xe2\x80\x93 Four flanges on the outer surface along the\naxial direction, each 111 mm wide.\n\xe2\x80\x93 Working fluid: ammonia\n\xe2\x80\x93 Fluid inventory: 52.5 grams\n\xe2\x80\x93 When the entire liquid inventory\naccumulates at the bottom of the heat pipe\nunder gravity, the liquid puddle length is\n714 mm at 298K.\n\nHP Startup in Reflux Mode \xe2\x80\x93 Ku 2018\n\n5\n\nTest Setup And Instrumentation (1/2)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The end of the 1168 mm leg was designate as the evaporator.\n\xe2\x80\x93 Evaporator length: 714 mm\n\xe2\x80\x93 The evaporator was divided into 7 segments of equal length, 102 mm\neach.\n\xe2\x80\x93 On each segment, two tape heaters were attached to the flanges on\nthe opposite sides. One on each flange.\n\xe2\x80\x93 On each segment, four thermistors are attached to the flanges on the\nopposite sides.
