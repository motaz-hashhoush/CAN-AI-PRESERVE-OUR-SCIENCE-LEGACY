Davis, Texas; and the\nHaystack Observatory in Massachusetts.\n\nFixed lasers\n\nat the Goddard center; at the McDonald Observatory\nin Texas; on Maui Island, Hawaii; at a U.S. Air Force\nsite in Florida and others operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Natal, Brazil;\nArequipa, Peru; and Orroral Valley, Australia, also\nwill acquire data.\n- more -\n\nLageos data also will be acquired by lasers in\nseveral countries in Europe.\n\nData from a trans-\n\nportable laser ranging system, currently under development for NASA at the University of Texas, will be\navailable later this year.\n\nThis highly mobile, truck-\n\nmounted, laser ranging system, designed to obtain\nprecise Lageos ranging data, will support scientific\ninvestigations in thr; continental United States.\nSeveral new space techniques provide unique\ncapabilities for measurements of key geodynamics\nparameters.\n\nFor example, crustal plate motion may be\n\naccurately measured by laser ranging to satellites,\nto retroreflectors on the Moon\n\nand by very long base-\n\nline microwave interferometry using extragalactic\nradio sources.\nThe high accuracy determination of the Earth's\ngravity field and geoid with laser tracking and altimetry from geodetic satellites provides information\nabout the density distribution within the Earth which\nis essential in interpreting geophysical data relevant\nto geodynamics and resource\n\nlocation.\n\n- more -\n\n- 5Prior to the launch of Lageos, satellite laserranging experiments were conducted by affixing laser\nretroreflectors to satellites performing a variety\nof missions.\n\nLageos is the first NASA satellite de-\n\nsigned solely for laser-ranging experiments.\nThe analysis and publication of the results portion of the investigations are generally planned for\na period of three years and are to be completed by\nJuly 1982.\nAll principal investigators will become part of\nthe Lageos Working Group chaired by the Lageos Project scientist, Dr. David Smith.\n\nThis working\n\ngroup will meet during the course of the investigations to discuss progress and/or problem areas.\n\nThe\n\ninitial meeting is scheduled for August 29 and 30 at\nthe Goddard center.\nThe Lageos investigations cover four general\ntopic areas.\n\nThese are:\n\n(1) plate tectonics; (2)\n\npolar motion and Earth rotation; (3) Earth elasticity\nand gravity fields; and (4) orbit analysis.\n\n- more -\n\n- 6The selected investions and investigators are\nas follows:\nPLATE TECTONICS\n\nLageos Study of Polar Motion, Plate Rigidity and Plate\nMotions \xe2\x80\x94 W.
