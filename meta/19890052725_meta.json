The governing equations are presented, and a similarity model that includes the effects of shear and the effects of shear and deformation on an Ekman solution is derived. It is shown that surface friction is important in frontal processes through its role in determining the dissipation and the ageostrophic terms in the vorticity and divergence equations; the former normally acts to weaken a front while the latter acts to strengthen it. The magnitude and importance of these terms vary considerably at different stages and with stratification, thermal advection, and the deformation and shear forcing.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"volume": "46", "submissionId": 19890052725, "issn": "0022-4928", "id": "8da20a03fd6a4be7a0802850d860d8bc", "publicationName": "Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences", "publicationDate": "1989-05-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
