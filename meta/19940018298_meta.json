It is expected that in the near future, the spectrum required for aeronautical communication services will grow significantly beyond that currently available at L-band. In anticipation of this, JPL is developing an experimental broadband aeronautical satellite communications system that will utilize NASA's Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS) as a satellite of opportunity and the technology developed under JPL's ACTS Mobile Terminal (AMT) Task to evaluate the feasibility of using K/Ka-band for these applications. The application of K/Ka-band for aeronautical satellite communications at cruise altitudes is particularly promising for several reasons: (1) the minimal amount of signal attenuation due to rain; (2) the reduced drag due to the smaller K/Ka-band antennas (as compared to the current L-band systems); and (3) the large amount of available bandwidth. The increased bandwidth available at these frequencies is expected to lead to significantly improved passenger communications - including full-duplex compressed video and multiple channel voice. A description of the proposed broadband experimental system will be presented including: (1) applications of K/Ka-band aeronautical satellite technology to U.S. industry; (2) the experiment objectives; (3) the experiment set-up; (4) experimental equipment description; and (5) industrial participation in the experiment and the benefits.", "title": "ACTS broadband aeronautical experiment", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T19:00:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19940018298, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Abbe, Brian S."}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Pasadena, CA, United States"}}, "id": "17b6a8ca4a9740758a18d73553f89610"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19940018298, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Jedrey, Thomas C."}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Pasadena, CA, United States"}}, "id": "ba16d131481f4b79b312741beda6911d"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19940018298, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Estabrook, Polly"}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Pasadena, CA, United States"}}, "id": "aa7410733e434a09bffe20bb93df6c94"}, {"sequence": 3, "submissionId": 19940018298, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Agan, Martin J."}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Pasadena, CA, United States"}}, "id": "97628c19348044d58806533237822955"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19940018298, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19940018298, "id": "dfd45f40be274f649b10b9ad42038b58", "publicationName": "Proceedings of the Third International Mobile Satellite Conference (IMSC 1993)", "publicationDate": "1993-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19940017957, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "MSATT Workshop on Innovative Instrumentation for the In Situ Study of Atmosphere-Surface Interactions on Mars", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19940018298.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19940018298/downloads/19940018298.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19940018298/downloads/19940018298.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19940018298/downloads/19940018298.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
