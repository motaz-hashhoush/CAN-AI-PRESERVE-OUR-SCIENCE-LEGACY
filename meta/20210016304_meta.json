As directed by the White House in 2019, the agency team is striving to return humans to the Moon and land the first woman and the first person of color on the lunar surface. NASA and its commercial partners made significant progress in the second half of 2020 and the first half of 2021 on the agency\u2019s Space Launch System (SLS), one of the key parts of the Artemis program. The team is preparing for a 2021 launch of Artemis I, the first integrated launch of the Block 1 variant of SLS with the Orion crew capsule. Hardware for the Artemis II launch, which will be the first to launch crew on SLS and Orion, is progressing through assembly, and hardware for Artemis  III has started manufacturing. Artemis IV manufacturing has also started, and engines for Artemis V are in development/manufacturing. This paper will discuss the progress made in the last year and the items currently in work on for future SLS flights and variants.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "US", "submissionId": 20210016304, "endDate": "2021-06-17T05:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"organizationId": "02ac99c3135052eca2758e9d77e4826f", "meta": {"organization": {"name": "United States Department of the Army", "location": "Arlington, Virginia, United States"}}, "meetingId": "b0b8c9a441854595b290eb0940da5019", "id": "ffba225dda2149e59e242ddc7fa0a805"}, {"organizationId": "1a9f0bc7d48852ea856e6afe8edbd9f2", "meta": {"organization": {"name": "United States Department of the Air Force", "location": "Washington D.C., District of Columbia, United States"}}, "meetingId": "b0b8c9a441854595b290eb0940da5019", "id": "c92218bc650b4e978c1cc3598224394f"}, {"organizationId": "e108c770ea045996857982831af41904", "meta": {"organization": {"name": "United States Department of the Navy", "location": "Arlington, Virginia, United States"}}, "meetingId": "b0b8c9a441854595b290eb0940da5019", "id": "f5ecc76e12f44fc8ab4bec08841c52b8"}, {"organizationId": "e53641f275f15469a1b19a8980e09171", "meta": {"organization": {"name": "National Aeronautics and Space Administration", "location": "Washington D.C., District of Columbia, United States"}}, "meetingId": "b0b8c9a441854595b290eb0940da5019", "id": "ffbc8d7d38994ddc8c268ab68cdbef1d"}], "name": "68th JANNAF Propulsion Meeting", "location": "Virtual", "id": "b0b8c9a441854595b290eb0940da5019", "url": "https://www.jannaf.org/mtgs/2021June/pages/index.html", "startDate": "2021-06-07T05:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "Askins JANNAF 2021 PAPER 05242021.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20210016304/downloads/Askins%20JANNAF%202021%20PAPER%2005242021.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20210016304/downloads/Askins%20JANNAF%202021%20PAPER%2005242021.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20210016304/downloads/Askins%20JANNAF%202021%20PAPER%2005242021.pdf.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
