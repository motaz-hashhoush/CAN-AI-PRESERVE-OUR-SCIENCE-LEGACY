Initial plans were developed in the mid-1960's for the exploration of the outer planets by utilizing the gravity-assist technique during a fortuitous alignment of the outer planets in the Grand Tour Project, however although state-of-the-art space technology could have supported the project, it was considered too expensive, therefore politically infeasible. Subsequently, the Pioneer Project was undertaken to explore the asteroid belt and the environment around Jupiter and the Voyager Project was undertaken to send two spacecraft to fly by Jupiter and utilize its gravity assist to reach Saturn. The successful Pioneer 10 and 11 missions have provided important information on the effects of the asteroid belt and the severe radiation environment around Jupiter, and Voyager 1 has collected information about Jupiter, its magnetic fields and radiation zones, and its satellites. Project Galileo is intended to be launched in January 1982 to conduct an intensive investigation of Jupiter, its satellites and immediate environment and a Saturn Orbiter dual probe mission and a Uranus orbiter are also under consideration.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19790069309, "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "International Astronautical Federation"}}, "meetingId": "c4b7035f80be4ef3891b67b03bd1ebc4", "id": "742bbd03acde4164b11c0faa9a7c0e80"}], "name": "International Astronautical Federation, International Astronautical Congress", "location": "Munich", "id": "c4b7035f80be4ef3891b67b03bd1ebc4"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19790069309, "id": "7fac56fd697a487c9b6a8c66b5cc9cb1", "publicationDate": "1979-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
