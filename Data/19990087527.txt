SHELS consists of a Marman band clamp push-plate ejection system mounted to a launch\nstructure; the launch structure is mounted to one Orbiter sidewall adapter beam. Avionics mounted to the adapter\nbeam will interface with Orbiter electrical services and provide optional umbilical services and ejection circuitry.\nSHELS provides an array of manifesting\npossibilities to a wide range of satellites.\nINTRODUCTION\nIn 1984, the NASA Headquarters\nOffice of Space Flight (OSF) established the Shuttle Small Payloads Project\n(SSPP) at the Goddard Space Flight Center to develop and operate carrier systems for low-cost and quick reaction\naccommodations\nof secondary payloads on the NASA Space Transportation System (STS). These carrier systems\nrange from the more complex such as the Hitchhiker (HH) carrier system to the self-contained\nGet Away Special\n(GAS) carrier system. To date, SSPP has flown over 285 cargo-bay payloads aboard the Space Shuttle.\nUtilizing modular hardware components,\nI-IH payloads may vary in weight and size from a few hundred pounds\nup to 5500 pounds; the former requiring the mounting provisions of a single adapter beam and the latter requiring a\nfull cross-bay bridge. HI-I payloads use Orbiter power and data services and provide experimenters with real-time\ncommand and telemetry link to a control center located at Goddard.\nOver the years, SSPP has developed adjunct systems to the HH carrier providing additional\naccommodations\nand manifesting\npossibilities\nto a wide variety of Orbiter users. The recently developed Hitchhiker-Jr.\nCarrier system, using a Hitchhiker Remote Interface Unit (HRIU) in a single five-cubic-foot\ncanister, receives Orbiter power\nand is commanded\nby and sends telemetry to the crew controlled Payload General Support Computer (PGSC) laptop. Additionally,\nSSPP has developed a small launcher system capable of ejecting 150-pound satellites (or other\nexperiments)\nfrom either a canister or a cross-bay bridge pallet.\nMore recently, SSPP has begun development\nof the SHELS launcher system. Both the NASA Explorer Program Office and the U.S. Air Force Space Test Program (STP) Office are funding the SHELS development\neffort.\nSHELS shall be capable of ejecting up to a 400-pound spacecraft and will provide the option of power and data umbilical services.\nThe Explorer Program Office wants a launch system provided that is compatible\nwith its University\nExplorer (UNEX) class missions while the U.S. Air Force STP Office has targeted SHELS\nsatellites.\nIt is anticipated that other users will step forward as the SHELS system becomes\nthe 2001 time frame.\n\n7\n\nfor a number of its small\noperational\nsometime in\n\nSYSTEM\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nTaking advantage of an array of existing modular components and Orbiter power and data services, the SHELS\nsystem development\neffort requires little in the way of new electrical hardware design. The bulk of the design effort\nis an ejection mechanism\nand launch structure. As shown in Figure 1, with existing hardware shaded, the SHELS\nsystem components include: the HH avionics and its mounting plate; the Hitchhiker Ejection System Electronics\n(HESE); the Satellite Interface Box (SIB); the SHELS support structure; and ejection system. For those spacecraft\nthat do not require umbilical service, the SIB is not required.\nAs seen in Figure 2, the HH avionics provides the interface to Orbiter power and data services and crew controlled Standard Switch Panel (SSP) switches. For umbilical users, power and data command/telemetry\nsignals are\nrouted to the spacecraft via the HH avionics and SIB. The SIB provides signal isolation protection to the HH avionics circuitry. The SSP switches are routed via the HH avionics to the HESE, which contain the PRE-ARM, ARM,\nand FIRE relays. These relays and their status provide safety inhibit and monitor functions necessary to prevent\naccidental spacecraft ejection and other related hazards.\nThe SHELS\n\nt\n\nlaunch\n\nstructure\n\nis a monolithic\n\ninvestment\n\ncast structure,\n\nwhich is cast fi\'om A356-T6\n\nslrength\n\nclass 10 aluminum alloy, and mounts directly to the sidewall adapter beam. The SHELS ejection system mounts to\nthe top of the launch structure and uses a Marman band clamp mechanism\napproximately\n17 inches in diameter. The\nejection system push plate design accommodates\nthe mounting of the umbilical power and signal connectors.\nThe\nSHELS ejection dynamics do not impart any significant tip-off or rotation about the satellite\'s ejection axis. A mission unique thermal shroud will surround the payload and mount to the support structure.\nWith its ability to be mounted to the Orbiter sidewall,\nrequires little in the way of Orbiter resources.\n\nthe SHELS design\n\nallows\n\nfor ease of manifesting\n\n=\n\nFigure 1.

The casting material is aluminum alloy A356-T6 strength class 10, fabricated\nwith rapid prototype casting techniques.\nInvestment castings traditionally have been fabricated by the lost wax\nmethod, requiring tooling to produce an injection molded, near net shape, wax pattern. Once produced, the wax\npatterns are processed by bonding preformed wax gates and risers to facilitate casting. Then the pattern is invested,\nor dropped, in a stucco solution of fractured ceramic and water. The stucco encapsulates\nthe entire wax pattern with\nceramic approximately\n.25 inch thick per side producing a casting shell. The shell is dried at room temperature then\nheated or de-waxed in an autoclave in order to melt and pour offthe wax from within the shell. Hence the term lost\nwax method. The shell is then fired in a furnace and filled with the desired molten alloy. When the casting cools\nand solidifies\n\nthe shell is broken away, the gates and risers are removed\n\nstraightened,\nsolution\ndestructive evaluation\n\ntreated to T6 condition, and inspected.\n(liquid penetrant and x-ray).\n\nand finished.\n\nThe inspection\n\nprocess\n\nThe casting is then annealed,\nincludes\n\ndimensional\n\nand non-\n\nThe rapid prototype technique varies from the lost wax method by substituting a precision crafted wooden pattern for the wax pattern. The wooden pattern is then gated, invested, dried, and burned out in a furnace at the\nignition temperature\nof the wood. After pattern burnout, the shell is cooled, flushed, and inspected to insure that the\nshell is free of debris. The shell is then processed in the same manner as a traditional investment casting.\nThe rapid prototype casting method may appear labor intensive but the wooden patterns are produced direct\nfrom a solid CAD-CAM\nmodel and routed to shape by CNC routers and conventional\nwoodworking\ntechniques.\nThe routed sections are then assembled, filleted, and inspected to prepare them for foundry processing.\nThis method\nforegoes the need for injection molding tools and provides engineers\ncompetitively\nwith conventional\nstructures at quantities of one.\n\nwith incredibly\n\ncomplex\n\nstructures\n\npriced\n\nGoddard has successfully\ndeveloped and flown numerous structural castings and one satellite that was entirely\ninvestment cast. The castings have proven cost and weight efficient and structurally robust. Cast structures provide\n100% joint efficiency and allow designers to produce complex and compact structures previously\ninaccessible\nor\nincapable of fabrication\nby welding, riveting, or machining.\nThis advantage allows designers to selectively localize\nmaterial at key structural points and use cross-sectional\ninertias to their maximum advantage.\nIn addition, high efficiency structural forms previously costly to fabricate, such as isogrid and geodesically\nstiffened lattice, become cost\ncompetitive\n\nwhen cast.\n\nCastings offer an additional\nlate directly to project savings.\n\ncost advantage\n\nby reducing\n\n10\n\ndesigning,\n\ndrafting,\n\nand checking.\n\nFewer parts trans-\n\n_._\n\n!_i\n\nSupport\n\n-i,::_i_:_: _\n._!_:,_\n\nStructure\n\nr .................\n\xe2\x80\xa2 .....\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 2,,\n\nEjection\nSystem\n\n-,\nL-\n\n.......\n\nFigure 3. Cast Aluminum Structure in 3D\nEjection\n\nSystem\n\nThe SHELS ejection system consists of a strap and shoe Marman band, ejection base and center mounted\npression spring/push\nplate assembly. The thermally isolated ejection system is mounted to the SHELS\nlaunch structure, which provides the structural interface to the adapter beam.\n\ncom-\n\nThe Marman band consists of two stainless steel tension straps and ten shoes which are loosely riveted to the\nstrap. Trunnions\nare riveted to the ends of each strap and provide a swiveled attach point for the separation bolts\nwhich tension the system. The aluminum and titanium shoes have 20 \xc2\xb0 ramp angles and low friction hard coatings\napplied to all surfaces.\nThe titanium shoes are located under each of the end trunnions due to the higher local loads\nproduced at these locations.\nWhen the separation bolts are preloaded,\nthe shoes clamp the system by riding up\nmatching ramps on the ejection base flange and payload interface plate flange. Each of the separation bolts will also\nhave a bolt force sensor to monitor band tension during assembly, testing, and under various environmental\nconditions. The Marman band will be pull tested to worst case conditions to verify no gapping occurs at the interface. A\n1.25 test factor will be used.\nThe Marman band is released by redundant, NSI actuated, bolt cutters. A nominal separation of the payload\nfrom the ejection base will occur if only one of the bolt cutters functions.\nWhen the separation bolts are cut, the\nMarman band snaps offthe flange interfaces and is held in a retracted position by six torsion spring assemblies.\nOnce the Marman band has snapped offthe flanges, a centrally located compression\nspring is free to push the payload away from the ejection base. A guide shaft riding in a set of linear ball bearings guides the push plate during\nthe stroke of the spring. The linear bearings provide a low friction, tightly controlled ejection with low tip off imparted to the payload.\nA line of balls in each linear beating also rides in a "V" groove cut down the length of the\nguide shaft. This arrangement\nprevents the spring from imparting a rotational input into the payload during ejection. Ejection velocity may be tailored to the payload requirements\nby placing different size compression\nsprings in\nthe adjustable spring housing. Presently the maximum ejection velocity for a 400-pound payload is 4 ft/sec with a\nmaximum 5 in stroke.\nAs an optional capability,\numbilical\n\nconnectors.\n\nthe ejection\n\nThe connectors\n\nsystem\n\nprovide\n\nallows for the mounting\n\npower\n\nand telemetry\n\nI1\n\nof two internal\n\nto the payload\n\nor two external\n\nwhile it is in the Orbiter\n\nlow force\nbay prior\n\ntoejection. twointernal\nThe\numbilical\nconnectors bemounted\nwould\nonadjustable\nbrackets\nontheejectionase\nb\nplate\nrightnext othecompression assembly. twoexternal\nt\nspring\nThe\numbilical\nconnectors bemounted\nwould\nto\nbrackets\nattached\ntotheoutsideiameter\nd\noftheejectionase.\nb\nElectrical\n\nSystems\n\nThe flight electrical segment provides the interface with the Orbiter for power,\nground and crew.

Once\nactivated, command (2 Kbps) and telemetry (8 Kbps) processing is controlled from the Advanced Carrier Customer\nEquipment\nSupport System (ACCESS) located in the Payload Operations and Control Center (POCC) at Goddard.\nCommunication\nof the commands\nand telemetry occurs through the Tracking and Data Relay\nSatellite System (TDRSS) and associated ground network.\nThe initial setup of the HH avionics includes health checks, survival heater activation, and then experiment\npower on, as necessary.\nAs the deployment\nwindow approaches,\nthe satellite will be deactivated.\nThen the HESE\nwill be activated via ground commanding\nand operated by the crew to deploy the satellite.\nOnce deployed, satellite\ncommanding\nwill be conducted from the experimenter\'s\nground station.\nAt mission\'s end, the HH avionics power distribution\nsystem is deactivated\ndeactivate the HH avionics from the SSP in preparation\nfor the return home.\nCarrier\n\nElectrical\n\nfrom the ground,\n\nthen the crew will\n\nDescription\n\nThe HH avionics interfaces to the Orbiter to provide electrical services to the experiments.\nThese services include: hardwire switching and displays to the HESE electronics for satellite deployment,\nreal-time command (uplink\nat 2 Kbps) and telemetry (downlink at 8 Kbps), and electrical power distribution.\nFor SHELS, the satellite power\ninterface will be limited to 280W.\nThe thermal multiplexer\n(TMUX) acts as a power distribution\nunit. It uses a single avionics power port and distributes up to 400W to multiple, thermostatically-controlled\nheater circuits. The TMUX multiplexes\nthe local beater\ncircuit temperature\ndata, monitored\nby thermistors, for transport to the ground processing system.\nThe SIB is used to isolate the satellite from the HH avionics.\nThe SIB uses one power and signal port on the\navionics to interface with the satellite. Side A of the power port (280W) is fused and diode isolated from the avionics power system. Side B is used to power the signal isolation interface electronics\nlocated in the SIB. The isolated\nsignal interfaces currently identified are 1200 baud asynchronous\ncommand and telemetry, three 0-5 V Analog telemetry inputs, three +28V bi-level / pulse outputs, and one Mission Elapsed Time Minute pulse (METMIN)\noutput.\nThe umbilical\n\ninterface\n\nis only required\n\nby an experimenter\n\nwho wishes\n\nto use the power/signal\n\ninterface\n\nwith\n\nthe HH avionics.\nThis interface design uses the NEA Electronics TM proprietary\n\'soft\' release connector technology\nat the satellite interface to the ejection system. Currently there are two umbilical connectors located within the\nejection system pedestal assembly.\nOne connector is primarily dedicated to power, the other is dedicated to signal.\nHESE provides the required number of(safety)\ninhibits and controls to prevent inadvertent satellite deployment. The crew uses three switches on the SSP to sequence the HESE through the deployment\nsequence.\nThe\nHESE is only powered during the deployment\nsequence.\nTwo NASA Standard Initiators (NSI), each with a booster cartridge, are integrated into two HH-designed\nbolt\ncutter assemblies. These bolt cutters sever two bolts to release the Marman band clamping the satellite to the ejection system\n\nstructure.\n\nThe function\n\nof the NSI\'s\n\nis achieved\n\n12\n\nthrough\n\nthe operation\n\nof the HESE.\n\nAdvanced\ndling between\nThermal\n\nCarder Customer Equipment Support System (ACCESS) (not shown)\nthe customers\nground hardware and the Orbiter data network.\n\nthe ground\n\ndata han-\n\nSystems\n\nThe thermal\ndesign\n\nprovides\n\nis passive\n\ndesign\n\nof the SHELS\n\nand is composed\n\ncasting and ejection\n\nof various\n\nsurface\n\nsystem shall be consistent\n\nfinishes\n\nincluding\n\nmulti-layer\n\nfrom mission\n\ninsulation\n\nto mission.\n\nThis\n\n(MLI).\n\nThe thermal design of the shroud shall vary from mission to mission and be driven by the particular thermal requirements\nof the satellite.

The design case is a payload\npounds and has a CG 24 inches above the separation plane. Detailed stress analysis is ongoing.\nSeveral\n\niterations\n\nwere made in the design of the launch structure\n\nto increase\n\nits stiffness\n\nthat weighs\n\n400\n\nand raise the funda-\n\nmental frequency.\nThrough experience with other sidewall mounted payloads, it was determined\nthat the frequency\nshould be well above 21 Hz, if possible, to avoid excessively\nhigh loads that could result from certain landing foreing functions in the coupled loads analysis. The ffmal design of the launch structure has a fundamental\nfrequency of\n29 Hz. Plots of the first two mode shapes are shown in Figures 4 and 5. The finite element model of the support\nstructure will be coupled with a model of the adapter beam for assessment of the stresses in the adapter beam.

Data from these tests will validate the friction and stiffness parameters used in the basic Marman band preload equations.\nSuccessful completion of these tests will allow the specific\nmass properties of each payload and the predicted accelerations\nfor that mission to determine\nband preload.\nA\nlighter payload, for example, can use a lower band preload, which decreases shock loading during band separation\nRandom\n\nVibration\n\nTesting\n\nRandom vibration testing will be performed on the ejection system to qualify the design.

The maximum expected flight levels will be\ndetermined\nfrom a random base drive analysis.\nFunctional\n\n& Gravity\n\nA large number\n\nNegation\n\nof functional\n\nTesting\ntests are planned\n\nfor the ejection\n\nsystem to assure\n\nthat the band will release\n\nfrom\n\nthe interface flanges under varying conditions and system configurations.\nSeveral functional tests, including functional tests atter each pull test, are planned: they will use different separation bolt preloads; single and double bolt\ncutter firings; and hot and cold temperature\nextremes.\nSome functional test will include the low force separation\nconnectors.\nGravity negation tests will also be performed to determine the amount of rotational tip off imparted to\nthe payload by the ejection system during separation.\nThe test will be performed with a payload mass simulator that\n\n15\n\nhas been connected with cables over a set of pulleys to a counter weight that balances the system. The cable is connected to the mass simulator at a very low-friction ball joint that is positioned at the CG of the simulator. The lowfriction ball joint allows the mass simulator to rotate when external load is applied to the system as if it were in a\nzero-gravity\nenvironment.\nA series of tests will be performed with varied conditions and configurations\nto determine\nworst case tip off rotations. These tests will help to establish design criteria for the thermal shroud and provide important information\nto payload attitude control systems.\nFUTURE\n\nENHANCEMENTS\n\nTo increase SHELS manifesting\npossibilities,\nit is advantageous to reduce SHELS from a two-beam\ntion to a one-beam configuration as shown in Figure 6 and further minimize need for Orbiter services.\n\nconfigura-\n\nBy expanding the functionality\nof the SIB, replacing the I-IH avionics with a single PGSC crew controlled\nHRIU, and adding two additional mounting plates to the SHELS casting adapter beam, it is possible to package\nSHELS on one adapter beam (Figure 7). Umbilical power and data services are now maintained\nvia the PGSC,\nHRIU expanded $IB [Multipurpose\nInterface Box (MPIB)] configuration.\nThis new SHELS configuration eliminates Orbiter services required of a ground controlled\nfiguration also enables the crew to power SHELS components,\nsurvival thermal shroud heaters\njust before\n\nsatellite\n\nejection,\n\nfurther reducing\n\nSuppo_\n\nthe need for Orbiter power\n\nservices.\n\nSwueture\n\nFigure 6.
