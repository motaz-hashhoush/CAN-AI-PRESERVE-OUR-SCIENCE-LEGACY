The purpose of the tactile paging system is to communicate to the deaf-blind people in an institutional environment. The system consists of a main console and individual satellite wrist units. The console emits three signals by telemetry to the wrist com (receiving unit) which will measure approximately 2 x 4 x 3/4 inches and will be fastened to the wrist by a strap. The three vibration signals are fire alarm, time period indication, and a third signal which will alert the wearer of the wrist com to the fact that the pin on the top of the wrist is emitting a morse coded message. The Morse code message can be felt and recognized with the finger.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19770018426, "id": "840dacf155304fdfb3d788a53312cd61", "publicationDate": "1977-05-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19770018426.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19770018426/downloads/19770018426.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19770018426/downloads/19770018426.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19770018426/downloads/19770018426.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
