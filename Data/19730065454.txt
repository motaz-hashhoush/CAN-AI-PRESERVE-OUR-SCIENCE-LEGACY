The location of the\nspacecraft must be accurately determined so that the\nscientific data it is acquiring can be matched to that\nposition. Also, the spacecraft\xe2\x80\x99s path is precisely\nmonitored because small perturbations yield valuable\ninformation about changes in the gravity field, variations\nin atmospheric density, to name but two.\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpacecraft Tracking\xe2\x80\x9d deals with this precise locating\nof spacecraft dispatched from Earth. Tracking is\ndifficult to separate from spacecraft communications\nin the sense that NASA\xe2\x80\x99s three worldwide ground-based\nnetworks perform both functions. Most NASA\nnetwork stations possess antennas that can both track\n\nand acquire spacecraft data. Despite this dual\ncapability of NASA hardware, spacecraft communications-a subject dealing with the transfer of\ninformation to and from spacecraft and the Earth-has\na different theoretical background. Because of this\ndistinction, spacecraft communications is treated in\nanother booklet in this series: \xe2\x80\x9cLinking Man and\nSpacecraft.\xe2\x80\x9d\nGerald M.

In 1958, when\nthe number of satellites in orbit could be counted on the\nfingers of one hand, the major tracking problem was\nfinding the tiny satelIites in the immensity of space.\nBetween 1958 and 1968, however, almost 800\nartificial satellites and space probes were launched.\nToday\'s tracking problem is not finding spacecraft,\nrather it is sorting them out and coping with the heavy\ntraffic flow. Even more traffic is caused by the\ngrowing stream of space debris-pieces of defunct\nrockets, exploded spacecraft, the flotsam and jetsam of\nspace exploration. Well over 1000 pieces of space\nhardware are in orbit at any one moment. Tracking\nspacecraft is akin to keeping tabs on all the aircraft\naround a busy airport, except that the targets are much\nhigher and travel much faster.\nRemember those exciting days when the first satellites\nwere being shot into orbit? In the early evening,\npeople would rush outdoors to see the bigger onesstill illuminated by the Sun below the horizon-cruise\n\nacross the background of the stars. Many satellites\nare still tracked by refiected sunlight, but only when\nthe Sun and satellite are in the right positions.\nWhen we wish to track spacecraft 24 hours a day we\nmust make them visible artificially. We cannot\nduplicate the Sun but we can shine radar, laser, and/or\nradio beams on them and detect the echoes and\nreflections.\nThe easy way to track spacecraft, though, is to make\nthem announce their presence themselves with a\nbeacon or transponder. The great majority of satellites\nand space probes carry radio transmitters that\ncontinuously signal their locations to tracking antennas\non the ground; these are called beacons. Other\nspacecraft, such as Gemini, include transponders in\ntheir payloads. A transponder is a beacon that sends out\na signal when it is triggered by a radio or radar signal\nfrom Earth.\n\n1 Satellites are best seen visually just after sunset and\njust before sunrise. Satellites can also be artificially\n"illuminated" by radars, lasers, and radio transmitters.\n\nBeacons and transponders eventually fail and their\nsignals fade away. The spacecraft then becomes \xe2\x80\x9cdark\xe2\x80\x9d\nor \xe2\x80\x9cinactive\xe2\x80\x9d and must be illuminated by the Sun or\na powerful Earth-based radio transmitter if it is to be\ntracked.\nConsider the different kinds of spacecraft and how\ntheir various flight regimes affect the way we track\nthem. The flights of sounding rockets are short in terms\nof time and distance. They can be tracked easily by\nradars and telescopes located right at the launch site.\n\ncan keep track of the hundreds of machines we have\nput into orbit.\n\nRanges\nAnd\nNetworks\nTo keep tabs on its many spacecraft, NASA operates\nthree global networks and sponsors the operation\nof a fourth:\n\nSatellites present a more difficult problem. As their\nlaunch rockets rise from the pad, gain altitude, and\narch over toward the southeast out over the Atlantic\n(assuming a Cape Kennedy launch) they are followed\nby launch site radars and optical instruments.\nJettisoning lower stages and ascending rapidly, the\nrocket is passed from tracking station to tracking\nstation along the chain of islands and ships stretching\nto Ascension Island in the South Atlantic. As the\nspacecraft approaches Africa it should be in orbit.\nIf the African tracking stations know where to look they\ncan pick up (acquire) the satellite, track it, and pass it\non to the next station. The point here is that satellite\ntracking requires stations around the world-in other\nwords, a network of stations rather than a few\ninstruments at the launch site.\n\nSTADAN Space Tracking and For tracking\nData Acquisition\nunmanned scientific\nNetwork\nand applications\nsatellites\n\nTracking lunar, deep space, and interplanetary probes\nis still more difficult. Not only do we need a worldwide\nnetwork to watch them, but we must maintain contact\nwith them when they are hundreds of thousands, even\nhundreds of millions of miles away. Such distances\nare far beyond the capabilities of the radars and optical\ntracking equipment so useful for following satellites.\nA special radio tracking scheme is needed.\n\nEach of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s networks has a different mission\nthat cannot be carried out well by any of the others.\nAs the evolution of each network is described, it will\nbe seen that the tracking techniques are fundamentally\ndifferent for each. There is, however, considerable\ninterchange of tracking data and continual mutual\nsupport among NASA\xe2\x80\x99s networks. This is also true for\nthe worldwide networks maintained by the U.S. Air\nForce and Navy for tracking their military satellites.\n\nEach type of spacecraft thus has its own set of\nrequirements:\n\nSounding rockets-Launch\ntracking equipment.\n\nsite radars and optical\n\nSatellites-Worldwide networks of radio, radar,\nand optical tracking stations.\nSpace probes-Worldwide\nradio tracking stations.\n\nnetworks of long distance\n\nThe subject of spacecraft tracking is really twofold:\n(1) what are the technical methods for finding and\npinpointing spacecraft; and ( 2 ) how can these\ntechniques be organized into worldwide networks that\n\n2\n\nSA0\n\nSmithsonian\nFor precision tracking\nAstrophysical\nof satellites\nObservatory optical\nnetwork\n\nMSFN\n\nManned Space\nFlight Network\n\nFor tracking manned\nsatellites and lunar\nspacecraft\n\nDSN\n\nDeep Space\nNetwork\n\nFor tracking lunar,\nplanetary, and deep\nspace probes\n\nA random sprinkling of tracking stations around the\nworld does not make a network. The stations must\nbe located where they will do the most good for the\nleast cost. To illustrate, there are no tracking stations\nin Antarctica because it would be very expensive to\nmaintain a station in that climate. NASA tracks its\npolar satellites from a station outside Fairbanks, Alaska.\nMost tracking stations, however, are concentrated\nwithin a wide equatorial belt 40\xe2\x80\x9d north and 40\xe2\x80\x9d south\nof the equator. The great bulk of U.S. spacecraft\npass over this belt.\nTracking networks need good ties with the rest of the\nworld, especially with the network control center, where\n\n2 Map of major NASCOM communications lines.

Using\nsubmarine cables, land lines, microwave links, and\ncommunication satellites, NASCOM operates in what\nastronautical engineers call real time. This means\nthat commands, data, and voice messages are transmitted anywhere on Earth in only a fraction of a\nsecond. NASCOM employs hundreds of thousands\n\n3\n\nFor missile and high altitude aircraft tests, a chain of\ninterconnected stations is employed. A range is linear\nand of limited length, not two-dimensional and worldwide like a network. Nevertheless, its stations must be\ntied together in the same ways network stations are\nunified, and the tracking equipment is similar.\n\nThe biggest U.S. ranges extend outward from Cape\nKennedy, Florida, and Vandenberg Air Force Base,\nCalifornia. The Eastern Test Range (ETR) begins at\nCape Kennedy and runs southeastward along a string\nof islands and ships for some 5000 miles. NASA\noperates facilities at some points along the ETR. On\nthe West Coast, Vandenberg is the hub of four\nseparate ranges collectively called the Western\nTest Range (WTR). NASA launches most of its\npolar satellites from here. In between Cape Kennedy\nand Vandenberg, the U.S. operates ten smaller ranges.\nNASA operates two of these smaller ranges: Wallops\nIsland, on the Virginia coast; and the X-15 High Range,\nat Edwards Air Force Base, in the California desert.\nFrom Wallops NASA launches many upper-atmosphere\nchemical-cloud experiments that are seen for hundreds\nof miles. A few small satellites, such as Explorer XVI,\nhave been launched from Wallops on the Scout rocket.\nSeveral varieties of radars line the beach at Wallops,\ntracking sounding rockets, small satellites and\npilotless aircraft launched from the several pads at\nWallops. The Spandar radar with its 60-foot\nparaboloidal reflector is particularly impressive. It\ncan track spacecraft 5000 miles away. A large number\nof tracking telescopes and cameras complement the\nradars. Wallops also employs an instrumented ship,\nthe Range Recoverer, as a downrange station.\n\nSTADAN\nSTADAN, NASA\'s Space Tracking and Data\nAcquisition Network, grew around the basic core of\neleven Minitrack tracking stations set up by the U.S.\nNaval Research Laboratory for the Vanguard\nProgram in 1956 and 1957. In the early days of the\nspace effort, Minitrack was the bulwark of U.S. tracking\noperations. Its radio interferometers still track most\nof NASA\'s scientific satellites and any other spacecraft carrying 136 MHz* radio beacons.\n*1\n\nMHz = 1 megahertz\ncycles per second.\n\n4\n\n= 1 megacycle per\n\nsecond\n\n= 1,000,000\n\n3 The Spandar radar antenna at Wallops island. Other radars\nare shown in the background.\n\nThe Minitrack Electronic Fence\nSuppose you shoot a volleyball-sized sphere into orbit\nfrom Cape Kennedy; you then turn and face west and\nwonder when, where, and even if that tiny sphere is\ngoing to come in over the horizon at 16,000 miles per\nhour. It would be almost impossible to find it with\nnarrow-angle tracking telescopes and thin, pencil-like\nradar beams. To be certain of finding their satellites\nVanguard engineers built an electronic fence that\nthe spacecraft would have to cross if they were in orbit.\nThis fence formed the basis of the Minitrack Network.\nThe name Minitrack comes from minimum weight\ntracking; the weight being that of the tiny radio transmitter aboard the miniaturized Vanguard satellite.\nHaving a voice of its own, a Vanguard satellite\nannounced itself to the north-south fence of radio\nlistening posts along the 75th meridian from Washington, D. C., deep into South America. The fan-shaped\nreceiving patterns of the north-south Minitrack\nstations overlapped so that passing satellites had to\ncross the fence.\n\n4\n\n4 Optical tracker at Wallops Station.\n\n5 The early Minitrack stations along the 75th meridian\nformed an electronic \xe2\x80\x9cfence\xe2\x80\x9d that satellites had to cross.\n\n6 The Minitrack array at Quito.\n\nConsequently the instrument itself grows from tabletop size to football-field size.\n\nA radio interferometer determines the direction of\nf\nthe signal source very accurately. I we set up a line\nof equally spaced radio receiving antennas, say, northsouth along our football field, they will not in general\nreceive the crest of each satellite-sent radio wave at the\nsame instant. If the satellite flies north of the station,\nthe northernmost antenna will be the first to pick up\nf\nil\nthe crest o the wavefront; the southernmost wl be\nthe last. Only if the satellite is plying a perfect eastwest course bisecting the station\xe2\x80\x99s antenna array will all\nantennas receive the wavefront at the same instant.\n\nBy crossing the Minitrack fence, a satellite merely\nannounced that it was there-hardly the accurate\ntracking data the Vanguard engineers wanted. A\nscheme was found that utilized the radio waves from the\nsatellite transmitter to fix the satellite position. The\nbasic idea came from the science of optics. It was\ncalled interferometry; and it had been employed for\ndecades to measure angles and distances with fantastic\naccuracy. In radio interferometry, the idea is scaled\nup from the wavelengths of light (5 x\ncm) to\nradio wavelengths (about 300 cm for Minitrack).\n5\nSatel Iite\n\xe2\x80\x98,,Orbit\nI\n\n\\\n\nI\n\nI\n\nII\n\n&\xe2\x82\xaca\nt-----800-1200 miles+\n\ng # j !\n\ni\n\nI\n\nI\n\nWedge-shaped\nantenna pattern\n\n\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x82\xaca\n\nMinitrack station\n\n5\n\nA Minitrack interferometer measures the angle the\nsatellite-transmittedwavefront makes with the northsouth line of antennas. It does this by counting the\nnumber of wavefronts that pass before adjacent\nantennas receive the same wavefront. (See diagram.)\nAngular precision comes from installing many separate\nreceiver antennas in a line at each station. By using\nlong antenna baselines at each station and then\ncombining tracking data from several stations, the\nMinitrack system can measure the angular position of\na satellite to within 20 minutes of arc.\nA north-south line of receiving antennas in itself is\ninsufficient because only one satellite angle can be\ncomputed. To measure the second angle, Minitrack\nstations also have an east-west line of antennas.\nThe complete Minitrack antenna array forms a cross\nat each station. Along the 75th meridian, the northsouth antenna patterns of the stations combined\nto create the original Minitrack feme.\nUnlike radar and other tracking schemes, Minitrack\nradio interferometry does not provide target range and\nvelocity; only target direction. Angular data alone,\nhowever, are sufficient to establish a satellite\xe2\x80\x99s orbit.\n\n7 An interferometermeasures the angle of a transmitting\nsatellite b y the phase differencebetween the radio waves\nreceived at different receiving antennas in a linear ground\narray.\n\n6\n\nThe Minitrack network went into operation in October\n1957, just after Sputnik 1 was launched. It proved\nhighly successful in tracking the early U.S. Vanguard\nand Explorer satellites. In October 1958, newly\ncreated NASA absorbed Project Vanguard aqd, along\nwith it, the operating responsibility for the Mihitrack\nnetwork. As NASA laid out its plans for space\nexploration, it became apparent that some Egrth\nsatellites, and lunar probes especially, could not be\ntracked accurately by radio interferometers.\n\nSidetore Tracking\nSuppose that NASA has just launched a spacecraft\ntoward the Moon. Minitrack stations can measure its\nangular bearing as it heads toward the Moon; but is\nthat sufficient? As the probe leaves the Earth behind,\nits angular bearing becomes less and less important\nbecause its motion is almost entirely directly away from\nEarth. The probe may travel 10,000 miles with\nhardly a change in its angular bearing. The same\nsort of difficulty arises with Earth satellites in highly\nelliptical orbits. Here, angular bearing remains almost\nunchanged when the satellite is traveling slowest near\napogee. Minitrack angle tracking had to be sup2lemented with range and range rate (velocity) trackmg.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Goddard Space Flight Center developed a\ntracking system based on the \xe2\x80\x9crange and. range rate\xe2\x80\x9d\ntechnique, without the use of radar. The satellite or\nprobe carries a special transponder that is triggered\nby a signal from an Earth-based tracking station. In\nresponse, the transponder emits a radio signal (called\nthe carrier) that is modulated by eight mathematically\nrelated signals called sidetones. The transponder\ncarrier signal is at 1705 MHz, but it is varied* at 8,\n32,160,800,4000,20,000, 100,000and 500,000\ncycles per second. Except for the 8 at the beginning\nof the series, the sidetones form a geometric\nprogression. Each of the sidetones may be thought\nof as a ruler. The lOO,OOO-cycle/sec ruler is 1.86\nmiles long-the distance frbm crest to crest of\nthe radio waves. The 20,000-cycle/sec sidetone ruler\nis five times longer, or about 9.3 miles. At 32-cycles/\nset, the measuring stick is about, 5 8 12 miles long.\n*Actually the carrier\xe2\x80\x99s phase is varied, but this subject is beyond\nthe scope of this booklet.\n\n8 The Goddard range and range rate system may be\nconceived in terms of radio wavelengths as measuring sticks.\n\nWhen the satellite transponder replies to the signal\nfrom Earth, it constructs (by radio) eight separate,\nparallel lines of rulers between itself and the Earth\nstation. If the spacecraft is 5812 miles away, there\nwill be exactly one 32-cycle/sec between spacecraft\nand Earth. How does the tracking station know that\nit is not really looking at the end of the second\n32-cycle/sec ruler and that the spacecraft is really\n11,624 miles away? This ambiguity, as tracking\nengineers call it, can be resolved by looking at the\nmuch longer 8-cycle/sec sidetone. The relationship\nbetween the two sidetones will be quite different if\nthere are two 32-cycle/sec rulers rather than one.\nIn a similar fashion, the station\xe2\x80\x99s electronic circuitry\ncan distinguish between other arrangements of rulers.\nThe smallest sidetone ruler (the 500,000-cycle/sec one)\nis only about a third of a mile long. By comparing the\nwave shapes of the high frequency sidetones, a NASA\ntracking station can compute spacecraft range to within\n45 feet, even if the spacecraft is as far away as the\nMoon. Range rate (spacecraft velocity toward or\naway from the station) can be found by measuring\nthe Doppler effect; that is, the amount the transponder\nwavelengths are compressed or stretched by the motion\n\nof the spacecraft.* Range rate can be measured to\nwithin 4 inches per second for a spacecraft at lunar\ndistances.\nThe introduction of range and range rate equipment\nat certain Minitrack stations was one of the changes\nthat caused the metamorphosis of Minitrack into\nSTADAN. Two other major changes were:\n1. A general rearrangement and consolidation of\nstations. Rearrangement occurred when NASA\nno longer needed all the stations in the electronic\nfence along the 75th meridian because better\ntracking at the launch ranges provided good\norbital data a few minutes after liftoff. Instead,\nNASA needed high latitude stations to track\npolar satellites, such as the Polar Orbiting\nGeophysical Observatories and the Nimbus\nweather satellites.\n2. The addition of large 40-foot and 85-footdiameter steerable paraboloidal dishes at several\nstations to permit faster collection of data from\n*The common analogy refers to the rise and fall of the pitch of a\ntrain whistle as it apmoaches and recedes from the listener.\n\n7\n\nbig NASA satellites, such as the Orbiting\nGeophysical Observatories and Nimbus satellites.\nThese big dishes are usually not used for satellite\ntracking.\nSTADAN today, when compared with its progenitor\nMinitrack, consists of fewer, better equipped, and more\nwidely distributed stations. Actually, the most\nimportant function of STADAN is now data acquisition\nrather than tracking. The hub of STADAN is at Goddard Space Flight Center, where all NASCOM\ncommunication lines converge. Scientific and\napplications satellites are controlled from Goddard\nby commands dispatched from Goddard via NASCOM\nto the STADAN station working the satellite of\ninterest. The STADAN station relays the command\nto the satellite on the uplink portion of the radio link\nand receives data on the downlink portion. In\nessence, STADAN plus satellite form a huge,\nelectrically connected machine run by mission controllers at Goddard.\n\nThe Smithsonian\nOptical\nNetwork\nThe Smithsonian Optical Network evolved concurrently\nwith the Minitrack network in 1956 and 1957. In\nthose days, no one knew for sure that radio\ninterferometry would work well in tracking satellites.\nFor this reason, the United States developed two\nseparate systems based on different principles.\nThe Sun is obviously the best satellite illuminator\nof all. Unfortunately, most satellites are so small that\nthey can be seen only with good telescopes. And just\nwhere does one point the telescope? The sky is a big\nplace to search at random for a pinpoint of light moving\nslowly across the celestial sphere. Furthermore,\nsatellites are not illuminated by the Sun at all when\nthey are in the Earth\'s shadow; and in the daytime\nthe poor contrast between satellite and bright sky\nmakes seeing poor. The best time to see a satellite by\nsunlight is just before dawn and just after sunset,\nwhen the satellite is lit but the Earth below is not.\n\n8\n\n*\n\nFAIRBANKS\n\n9 One o the two 85-foot telemetry receiving antennas at the\nf\nRosman, N.C., STAOAN station.\n\nThe Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO),\nset up an effective plan for optically finding and then\nprecisely tracking the country\xe2\x80\x99s first artificial satellites.\nThe optical location of a satellite is simple in principle:\norganize lots of people the world over to watch the\ndawn and twilight skies. This was the core of the SA0\nMoonwatch Project. Through the astronomical\nfraternity and the great enthusiam for space in 1957,\nthe SA0 was able to establish almost 200 teams of\namateurs in this country and abroad. Moonwatch teams\nwere armed with low power telescopes. Several team\nmembers would arrange their telescopes north-south\nalong the local meridian, creating in effect an optical\nfence analogous to the Minitrack radio fence. With\nMoonwatch teams on the lookout all over the world,\n\nsomeone would see a new satellite eventually. When\na team spotted a satellite-like object, it immediately\ntelegraphed the object\xe2\x80\x99s time of passage over the local\nmeridian to S A 0 Headquarters in Cambridge,\nMassachusetts. With enough telegrams in hand, the\nSA0 computer could calculate a crude orbit.\nBut a crude orbit is of little value to scientists who\nwant to analyze slight orbital changes (perturbations)\ncaused by the Earth\xe2\x80\x98s bulge and the pressure of sunlight.\nin the SA0 scheme, Moonwatch was only the satellite\nfinder. For precision tracking of satellites once they\nwere located approximately, the SA0 built a special\ncamera that photographed them against the background\nof the fixed stars. Since the. positions of the brighter\nstars are known with great precision, the satellite\xe2\x80\x99s\n\n10 Locations of major NASA Tracking Facilities.\n\nrn\n\n*\n\n*\n\nMANNED SPACE FLIGHT NETWORK\nSPACE TRACKING AND DATA ACQUISITION NETWORK\nDEEP SPACE INSTRUMENTATION FACILITIES\n\n0 OPTICAL TRACKING NETWORK\n\n9\n\n1 1 The Baker-Nunn tracking camera.\n\nimage* on the photographic plate would also be\nknown very accurately.\nThe special, wide aperture camera, known as the\nBaker-Nunn camera, was the most important piece\nof hardware in the SA0 optical tracking program.\nWith a 30" field of view it can photograph a satellite\ntoo faint to be seen with the naked eye. By careful\nmeasurement of the images on Baker-Nunn plates, the\nangular position of a satellite can be found to within\ntwo seconds of arc (compared with 20 minutes for\nMinitrack).\nThe SA0 installed Baker-Nunns at 12 stations around\nthe world, generally within a belt 30" above and\nbelow the equator. The primary task of the big\ncameras has been high precision optical tracking of\nsatellites for geodetic and geophysical studies.\nAlthough the Baker-Nunns provide more accurate\ntracking data than the Minitrack interferometers,\nanalysis of the plates is lengthy and laborious.\nMinitrack and the SA0 optical network turned out\nto be complementary.

Its 12 cameras have\nmaterially advanced the science of geophysics with\na minimum investment of money.\n\nThe Manned\nSpace Flight\nNetwork (MSFN)\nThe purpose of NASA\'s Manned Space Flight Network\nis to track and communicate with manned spacecraft\nin Earth orbit or on a voyage to the Moon and back.\nSatellites are satellites; why not use STADAN for\ntracking manned satellites rather than build a whole\nnew network? It is the payload-the astronaut-that\nmakes the difference. We could allow an unmanned\nsatellite to splash into the Atlantic and sink, but not\nan astronaut.\n\nSuppose a manned satellite is launched from Cape\nKenhedy out over the Atlantic. Within a few\nminutes it has pitched over and is headed downrange\ntoward Africa with a speed approaching 15,000\nmiles per hour. But is it in a safe orbit?

For the\nsafety of the astronauts, we must know if the desired\norbit has been attained before the point has been\nreached at which the spacecraft\xe2\x80\x99s path would cause it\nto impact in Africa. If a safe orbit has not been attained,\nthe mission controller back at Houston can initiate\nan abort, causing the spacecraft to splash down in\nthe Atlantic emergency recovery zone just before\nAfrica. In other words we must know where a manned\nsatellite is in real time; we cannot wait for Minitrack\ninterferometer data from several stations to be analyzed.\nRadar provides the necessary split-second tracking data.\nThe tracking situation is much the same during\nreentry and recovery. The mission controller has\nto know exactly where the spacecraft is in order to fire\nthe retrorockets at exactly the right time. If his timing\nis off, the spacecraft may land far outside the\nrecovery area-perhaps on land. Rendezvous\nmaneuvers in orbit also require real time tracking\ndata. The MSFN, then, was built around the radar set.\n\n..,..\n\n.\n\n.\n\n,\n\n~\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n...,\n\n..\n\n.\n\n.\n\n,\n\n.\n\n,\n\n.\n\n. \\\n\nHow the MSFN Radars Work\nOn April 30,1903, a German engineer named Christian\nHuelsmeyer received a patent for a \xe2\x80\x9cprocess for\nreporting distant metallic objects to an observer by\nmeans of electric waves.\xe2\x80\x9d The essence of radar is\nfound in Huelsmeyer\xe2\x80\x99s invention-the bouncing of\nradio waves off objects and listening for the echoes.\nA great deal more work was done by American and\nBritish engineers in the 1920s and 1930s before\n1\nradar became a household word during World War 1 .\nToday, radar is sensitive enough to map the mountains\non the Moon and detect a metal object the size of a\ndinner plate in a 500-mile orbit.\nA radar transmitter is like a radio flashlight. Short\nradio waves-just a few centimeters from crest to\ncrest-are squirted from a waveguide into a metallic\n\n11\n\nnot with Minitrack accuracy. Even more important,\nradar measures target range rate from the Doppler\neffect. By feeding radar-determined range and range\nrate into a computer that knows the laws of motion,\nwe can determine the orbit of a satellite or the\ntrajectary of a sounding rocket.\n\ndish-shaped reflector. The reflector focuses them into\na narrow, pencil-like beam similar to the flashlight\xe2\x80\x99s\nbeam. A major difference is that radar\xe2\x80\x99s microwaves*\nare emitted in an intense pulse only a few millionths\nof a second long. During these scant microseconds,\nthe radar may generate a million watts of power, in\ncontrast to the flashlight\xe2\x80\x99s steady watt or two.\nThe pulse of radar waves moves out at the speed of light\nin search of the target. In a microsecond, it has\nalready traveled 1000 feet; in 1% seconds it could\nreach the Moon. As the pulse travels, however, its\nintensity decreases according to the inverse square law\n-the pulse\xe2\x80\x99s power is cut to one fourth when the\ndistance from the transmitter is doubled. When the\npulse finally hits a target, only a tiny fraction of the\nradio energy in the pulse bounces back in the\ndirection of the waiting radar antenna. The echo,\nmoreover, also suffers at the hands of the inverse square\nlaw. The echo energy finally collected by the radar\nantenna has been weakened going out and coming\nback; its strength varies as the inverse fourth power of\nthe target distance. The size, shape, and material of\nf\nthe target also affect echo strength.

Visible light is also\nelectromagnetic in nature, but the wavelengths are much shorter400 to 700 millimicrons (4 to 7 x 10-7 meters).\n\n12\n\nBecause satellites are small and far away, it is\ncustomary to install a radar transponder on those\nthat are to be tracked by radar. The radar pulse\ntriggers the transponder, causing it to emit a pulse in\nresponse-a pulse that is much stronger than the\nnormal echo. The radar antenna measures transponder\nresponses rather than echoes. The strengths of these\nartificial echoes vary only as the inverse square of the\ndistance, making the satellite easier to track.\n\nGrowth of the MSFN\nEngineers at NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Langley Research Center, at\nHampton, Virginia, began work on a worldwide radar,\ntelemetry, and communications network for tracking\nmanned satellites in 1958.\nThe network that finally evolved consisted of 18 stations\nstretching from Cape Kennedy southeastward; across\nAfrica, the Indian Ocean, Australia; thence to Hawaii\nand the West Coast of the US.;\nacross the continent\nto the Atlantic recovery zone. There were 16 land\nsites and two instrumented ships in a belt that lay\nbeneath the three orbits originally planned for the\nmost ambitious shots in the Mercury Program. All\nof the stations were linked by a terrestrial communication network to the Mission Control Center, at Cape\nKennedy, and the computers at Goddard Space Flight\nCenter, Greenbelt, Maryland. The Mercury Network\nbecame operational on July 1, 196 1 . It performed\nwith high reliability during the entire Mercury\nProgram.\nWhen NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Gemini Program came along in 1963\nwith its two-man spacecraft and plans for rendezvous\nin space, the Mercury Network had to be modified in\nseveral ways. Because of the presence of two spacecraft in orbit during rendezvous maneuvers, the ground\nstations had to add extra antennas and more radio\nequipment to communicate with both sets of astronauts.\nThe Mercury radars, however, were not changed\nbecause they could track both spacecraft by switching\nrapidly from one to the other. Some of the Gemini\n\nmissions lasted as long as two weeks and the spacecraft\ntraveled over a larger portion of the globe than any\nMercury shot. Supplementary stations, including\ninstrumented ships, were temporarily added to the\nMercury Network for Gemini. Finally, there was a\ntrend to consolidate tracking and communications\ninto fewer, but better-instrumented sites. Overall, the\nchanges for Gemini wkre minor. But it was during\nthe Gemini Program (1963 to 1966) that the Mercury\nNetwork became the Manned Space Flight Network.\nThe Apollo Program, though, was a different matter;\nextensive changes in the network were required. When\nThe result of all these changes is that the old Mercury\nApollo spacecraft leave the Earth far behind on their\nNetwork core is hardly discernible today.

A completely different\nsystem was developed by the Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory for tracking far-ranging probes through the\nsolar system. Later, the MSFN adopted some of\nthe JPL techniques in its system, and STADAN\nincorporated a range and range rate tracking system\nsimilar in some respects to the JPL approach.\nWhen the Jet Propulsion Laboratory programs were\nassimilated by NASA in December of 1958, JPL\nhad already conceived the essentials of what was to\nbecome the Deep Space Network or DSN. The\nprimary element in the tracking system was a large\nparaboloidal antenna with a narrow reception pattern.\nAngular bearings of distant spacecraft were found by\ncentering them in this reception pattern and noting the\nantenna pointing angles. The spacecraft, of course,\nhad to make itself visible through radio signals from\nits transponder. Range rate data were obtained from\nthe Doppler effect. Finally, by triggering a transponder\non the spacecraft and timing the round trip signal\ntransmissions, range information resulted. Taken\n\n14\n\ntogether, these data were sufficient for accurate\ntrajectories.\nNASA launched its first series of five Pioneer space\nprobes in the general direction of the Moon between\n1958 and 1960. They were the first U.S. spacecraft\nto be tracked by the embryonic DSN. During this\nperiod, the DSN did not have worldwide coverage.\nFor example, for the flights of Pioneers I11 and IV,\nthe DSN consisted of an 85-foot-diameter paraboloid\nat Goldstone, California, a 10-foot-diameter dish in\nPuerto Rico, and a still smaller antenna at the Florida\nlaunch site. The Jodrell Bank 250-foot radio\nastronomy antenna in England, and a 60-foot antenna\nat South Point, Hawaii (under Air Force operation)\ncooperated during the Pioneer Program by tracking\nthe spacecraft when they moved out of the view of\nDSN stations.\n\nHow many stations are really needed to keep a spacecraft far out in space within view of at least one\nstation?

Three stations spaced\napproximately equidistant around the Earth do the job\nwell. The DSN was planned with this fact in mind.\nBy the time the first Ranger probes were launched\ntoward the Moon in 1961,85-f00t dishes had been\ninstalled at Woomera, Australia, and Johannesburg,\nSouth Africa. With the Goldstone station, the trio was\ncomplete. During the early 1960s, the network was\ncalled the Deep Space Instrumentation Facility (DSIF).\nThe DSIF tracked the fmt Venus probe, Mariner 1 ,\n1\nto a distance of 60 million miles i 1962.\nn\nIn 1965, the network (now called the DSN) guided\nV\nMariner I to within 6200 miles of Mars. Mariner IV\nwas some 135 million miles from Earth at the time of\nplanetary encounter. After Mariner IV went into\norbit around the Sun and became an artificial planet,\nthe DSN tracked and communicated with the spacecraft at distances well over 200 million miles.\n\nat the Goldstone station. Antenna size is important\nin deep space work for two reasons : ( 1) the larger the\nantenna the more accurate the pointing data; and (2)\nthe bigger the antenna aperture, the farther it can track\na space probe, the more data it can receive from\nit per unit time, and the better it can control the space\nprobe. With its 210-foot antenna, the DSN can work\nprobes more than 200 million miles away and measure\ntheir ranges to within 45 feet and their range rates to\nwithin 1 millimeter per second.\nIn addition to the Goldstone 2 10-foot dish, NASA\nhas added several more 85-fOOt paraboloids to the\nDSN to improve geographical coverage and support\nthe Apollo Program. At Madrid, there are two DSN\n85-footers and one belonging to the MSFN. Goldstone\nnow has one MSFN plus three DSN 85-foot dishes.\nFinally, a DSN dish has been installed at Canberra\nalongside the 85-foot MSFN paraboloid. This\nredundancy increases astronaut safety during Apollo;\nif an MSFN paraboloid should go out of commission,\na DSN dish will be ready to take over.\n\nA major addition to the DSN in recent years has been\na 210-foot paraboloidal antenna near the 85-foot dish\n\n15\n\n15 The Doppler record of a passing satellite permits\ncomputation of the orbit from the slope of the curve.\n16 Schematic of the laser tracking experiments performed\nwith Exdoref XXII.\n\nr\n15\n\nHarnessing the Doppler Effect\nNASA uses the Doppler effect to compute range rate in\nradars, in sidetone approach, and in tracking\ndeep space probes with the DSN. There is, however,\na way to obtain all the data necessary for orbit computation by just listening (with radio ears, of course) to\nthe beacon signal from a passing satellite.\n\nA satellite approaching a ground station with a beacon\nemitting 136-MHz signals will appear to a ground\nstation to be emitting signals a few kilohertz higher\nthan it really is because of the Doppler effect. The\nsignals will be correspondingly lower when the\nsatellite recedes toward the opposite horizon. At one\npoint in its transit across the sky, the satellite will appear\nto be emitting exactly the frequency it actually\ndoes emit; that is, the Doppler effect disappears. This\noccurs when the satellite is at the point of closest\napproach and is moving neither toward nor away from\nthe ground station. In the train analogy, this is the\ninstant when the train engine passes the observer.\n\nDoppler tracking is employed by the U.S. Navy in its\nnavigation satellite program. Scientists also employ\nDoppler tracking to measure small changes in satellite\norbits caused by variations in the upper atmosphere and\nthe Earth\xe2\x80\x99s gravitational field. For example, variations\nin the density of the Earth below a satellite can cause\nits orbit to dip or rise a few hundred feet. Doppler\ntracking thus helps gain insight into the structure of the\nEarth\xe2\x80\x98s crust.\n\naser Z\nIn 1955 and 1956, when engineers were first\nstudying the satellite tracking problem, powerful\nsearchlights were considered for illuminating the\nsatellite so it could be easily seen by ground stations.\nSearchlights were dropped in favor of radio\ninterferometers; but the recent development of high\npower lasers reopened the question of artificial\nsatellite illumination.\n\nLasers generate highly concentrated pulses of light\nenergy-so powerful that they may be used to weld\nIf the apparent satellite signal is carefully plotted\nmetals.

This has\nlimited the use of lasers in tracking to special experiments in geodesy, in which scientists attempt to locate\npoints on the Earth more accurately with respect to one\nanother.\n\nTraffic\nJam\nIn the Sky\nThe big NASA tracking networks are supported by\nmilitary and foreign tracking networks.
