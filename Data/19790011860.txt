b'N79- 20031\nNASARESEARCH\nOBOECTIVES\nANDROLES\n\n1\n\nAlfred Gessow\nNASA\nHeadquarters\nI think that it it; veryfltttng\nthat this conference on advanced technology\nairfoils\nbe held here et Langley, for this Center is the origin of the wellknownand widely-used _ASAseries airfoils.\nIt was those airfoils,\nmore than\nany other stngle factor, I belteve, that gaveNACAits well-deserved international reputation.\nI also want to express my pleasure in being a cochairmen.\nof a conference which has as its honorary cochairmen Ira Abbott, who spearheaded muchof that early effort, and Dick Whttcomb; whois responsible for\ngetting muchof the current NASAeffort started,\n\n,,\n_\n\n;\ni\n\nI\'ve put together (fig. 1) an abbreviated chronology of airfoil\ndevelopment\nin order to put the present NASAairfoil\nprogram in perspective.\nAs you can\nsee, the bulk of the NA(A airfoil\neffort occurred in the lg30\'s and the early\n1940\'s. Although therp.wassome additional effort in the 1940\'s and early\n1950\'ssuch as the "H" seriesfor rotorcraft,\nNASA didn\'tget back into the\nairfoil\nbusiness in a mfmningful way until the late 1960\'s whenWhitcombbegan\nhis supercritical irfoilwork. The successof that effortand the extension\na\nof the technologyit represented other applications\nto\nled to the present\nexpandedairfoilprogramwhichwas startedin the early 1970\'s.\nIn structuring\nour presentprogram,it is instructive considerthe\nto\nreasonswhy the NACA _,eries irfoilshad the impactthey had. The firstand\na\nobviousone is that they were good airfoils,better _n a numberof respects\nthan _he ones which they eventually\nreplaced. The secondis that they were\nthe resultof _systematic development\nprogramof familieso_ airfoilswhich\nwere derivedfrom a par\'_ular designphilosophy\nan-__ully\ndocumented.\nIn thisway, airplt, designerscouldchoosean airfoilthat seemedoptimumfor\nne\ntheiruse and could assesswhat performance\npenalties\nwouldoccur if\'theyhad\nto deviatefrom the idealsectionbecauseof practical\nconstraints.The key to\nsuccess, then, w_s a s_stematic program which resulted in families of airfoils\nfor different applications wlth documentedcharacteristics.\nThis view _as brought hometo us by the industry representatives who\nattended a NASa/Industry Airfoil Workshopwhich we held in Washington in\nJanuary 1975, The purpose of that workshop was to review and discuss our airfoil program to determine its responsiveness to industry\'s needs. Wereceived\na numberof good suggestions from that meeting and adjusted and refocused our\nprogram accordingly.\nThe specifics can best be,brought out by considering the\nobjectives and elements of our present program (fig. 2),\nAs you can see, the thrust of the objectives is twofold.\nOne is to\nresearch and provide advanced analytical and experimental _methods\nfor the\ndest_;1 and for the determination of the characteristics\nof not only single\nelephant airfoils,\nbut of multtelement airfoil\ncombinations used in aerodynamic\nc_ntrols and high-lift\nsystems (fig. 3). The increased emphasis we are now\ngiving to such airfoil\nsystems is a result of the needs for such information\n1\no\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n.\n\no\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 ""\n\nI. \xc2\xb0\'\xc2\xa2\n\nwh|ch was expressed at the 1975 workshop. The analysis and design methods\nwhich we research are madeavailable to industry for their use _n developing\natrfotls for their specific use and are also used by us in the secondhalf of\nour program to develop and documentthe behavior of generic famlltes of airfotls for a range of aircraft types as shownin figure 4.\nThe analysts methodswhtch have been and are being developed draw heavily\nupon and boneftt from the remarkable advancesmadein computational aerodynamics during the past few years. The use of computational codes, coupled\nwith mathematical optimization techniques, constitute a powerful tool for\nturntng out new atrfotl designs to satisfy spectftc requirements. In spite of\nlimitations,\nthes_ computational methods have proven to be singularly successful for design purposes and can be used to documentairfoil\ncharacteristics\nas well, at least at conditions involving no or small amounts of separation.\nSimplistically,\nthe state of the art can be characterized by the theory-data\ncomparison showntn figure 5. Viscous theory is fine, whether we are talking\nabout low speed calculations or more sophisticated transonic codes, but only\nunttl separation occurs. Thus, the problem of handltng viscous-dominant flows\nts receiving wtde attention by researchers, and cne approach which is starting\nto showpromise is shownin figure 6, which gives results of Pr:F. Carlson\'s\nfree-streamline modeltng theory applted to a low speed airfoil.\nAnother\napproach - the use of Navler-Stokes codes - may work for the very low Reynolds\nnumbersituation wherein lamtnar separation occurs (fig. 7), as we can see by\ncomparingMehta\'s code wtth a flow visualization experiment and even for\nunsteady tra_;sontc flow at small angles of attack.\nUnfortunately, such codes\ndo not work as yet for situations involving large regions of turbulent flow\nand we are placing a great deal of emphasis at our Centers in providing better\nturbulence models for handltng such cases wtt h Navier-Stokes codes.\n\n_:\n\nWe have spent and ape spending a good deal of effort in the third element\nof the methodspart of our atri\'otl program tn improving existing facilities\nand developing new ones and in developing test _nd instrumentation techniques\nto extend the range and validtty of 2-D data. You will be hearing talks on\nthis aspect of our program, and I will only mention Kere that our stable of\nfacilities,\nwhich tncludes Langley\'s low-turbulence pressure tunnel, 6- by\n28-tnch transonic tunnel, and 0.3-meter transonic cryogenic tunnel, and\nAmes\'s 2\' x 2\' transonic tunnel and 11\' transonic tunnel, cover the complete\nMachnumber and Reynolds numbermap for all classes of aircraft\ncombinations.\n\ni_\n_i\ni\n\nInsofar as the applications pcrt of our program is concerned, you\'ll be\ngetting somedetatled information regardip_ n,Jr efforts from the following two\nspeakers. !wtll\nonly mention a few things that we have done to be responsiw\nto the needs and reco._mendattons the industry as surfaced at the January\nof\n1975 workshop: We have expandedour expertmantal program to documentthe\ncharacteristics of oar new supercrtttcal and low speed airfoil designs coverlng a large range of thickness and deslgn ltft coefficients,\nand tn particular,\nwe have tncluded data on high-lift\nsystems; we have Initiated and now have in\noperation an atrfotl we have and analysis service at Ohto State University; to and\ndesign tested a large numberof rotorcraft atrfotls\nafter a slow start,\nget baseline data for new destgns whtch are unde_ay. Our applications program\n\n2\n\nI\n\nalso includes the design and te:;ting\nof very thi_k airfeils for large ,:argo\naircraft, very thin airfoils for turboprop application, and special pu.\'pose\nairfoils for wind generators, RPV\'s (remotely piloted vehicies), and rotating\nmachinery.\n_s co where and how the program is carried out, it is .lear that the bulk\nof the design and testing is in-house although we have gotten some excellent\nuniversity help in obtaining low speed airfoil data. We also look to universities and industry for help in advancing our analytical capability. Lanoley\nis our lead Center in this program with an across-the-boardcapability, with\nAmes making particular contributions in Navier-Stokesanalysis, design optimization procedures, and in acquiring high-lift system and unsteady aerodynamic\ndata. The contributionsfrom the various in-house and outside sources will\nbecome apparent as the papers are presented in this conference.\nBefore turning over the podium to the next speaker, I\'d like to say that\nI think that we have made some solid contributions in airfoil development and\nhope to make a lot more in the next few years. Much of the success of the\nLangley program can be attributed to Bob Bower\'s interest and support in\nmarshalling the resources of the Center behind tae program. The other individual whe has worked hard and effectively on a day-to-day basis to make the\nprogram and this conference go, who has acted as a principal spokesman for the\nprogram to the outside community, and who feeds me information as I need it\nwith great patience and humor, Ken Pierpont. I take this opportunity to\nacknowledge their efforts.\n\n3\n\n!\n5\n\nAIRFOILS\n\nAERODYNAMIC\nCONTROLS\n\nHIGH\nLIFTSYSTEMS\nFigure 3.- Single element airfoil thrust.\n\nLOW\nSPEEDENERAL\nG\nAVIATION\n\nSUBSONIC\nTRANSPORTS\n\nROTORCRAFT\nANDPROPELLERS\n\nLARGE\nCARGO\n\nSPECIAL\nPURPOSE\nFigure 4.- Airfoil applications.\n\n6\n\n\'!\n\n!\n\n0\n\n-.ti\n\xe2\x80\xa2_\n\nI\n\n*\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n-q\n\n0\n\nq\n\n8\n\nFigure\n\n5 - Airfoil\n\niL\n\nI\n\n16\n\n12\n\nw\xc2\xa3th separated\n\nflov\n\nJ\n\n20\n\n.__\n\n/\n\n_\n\n...\n\n_\'_\n\n....................\n\n2,4 I\'\n2,0\n\n1,6\n\nC 1.2\nL\n0,8\n\nGA(W)-2IRFOIL\nA\n- EXPERIME.4T\n[]\nTHEORY\nMoo= 0.15\n\nO,Zl\n\n0 -8\n\nFigure\n\n8\n\n0\n\n6.-\n\nMassive\n\n8\n\nseparation\n\n16\n\nflow\n\n24\n\nmodel.\n\n!\n\n......\n._==..-.__:.___-.-._\n__-_._.-._.\n..............\n\n......\n\n_-:-.__.__\n. .. _...:.._ :-.\n\n... ....\n\n--.,.\n\n-; _-..=_.\\.\n,J _-..=._._\n\n,\\ ..,. ....\n;: .& .., ./\'\n\n"-.. \\ \\_\xc2\xa2_//////d\nJ,._..:_\n(_,__@_ _._;_._.U._.._\n....,.. _....=\n_\n.._-,_.-_..,.\n. ._ :-_.:._.._ . _--:_-- _.\n\n(a) Angle of attack, 15\xc2\xb0; Reynolds number, 103;\n9% thick symme_-ical airfoil.\n\n0_._\'--:.\n:\':L"_._1..,\'__"\n\n(b) From Prandtl, L. 1952 Essentials of Fluid Dynamics,\np. 200, figure 3.83.\n\nFigure 7.- A qualitative\n\ncomparison\n\nof leading-edge\n\nstall.\n\n9\n\n'
