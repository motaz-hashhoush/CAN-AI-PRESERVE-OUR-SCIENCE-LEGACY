The physical cause of this failure remains\nunknown. To analyze the physical properties of such a\nsphere, it is necessary to cut it up into the smallest\n\npossible specimens and to study them thoroughly to see\nhow the entire structure has been affected. Conventional\ncutting techniques, however, are inadequate for this\npurpose because the pressure of the cutting edge distorts\nthe sphere, causing uneven cut surfaces and inexact\ndimensions.\n(continued overleaf)\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National\t\nAeronautics and Space Administration. Neither the United States \t\nGovernment nor any person acting on behalf of the United States\t\n\nGovernment assumes any liability resulting from the use of the\ninformation contained in this document, or warrants that such use\nwill be free from privately owned rights.\n\nThe solution:\nAn apparatus has been developed which can cut\nelastomeric material to very accurate dimensions and\nwill leave the cut surfaces extremely flat.\nHow it\'s done:\nThe illustration shows how the elastomeric material is\ncut by vibrating it under a knife blade. The material to be\ncut is affixed to a support made of magnesium, to\nminimize the mass that must be vibrated. When spheres\nare to be cut they are held in a plaster-of-Paris mold.\nThe support is constrained to slide in a slot cut in\nTeflon, the latter being used because of its very low\ncoefficient of friction. A 12-watt vibrator, such as is\nused for etching metal, is affixed to the support so that\nit can be made to vibrate linearly at 60 Hz.\nA sharp thin cutting edge, such as a commercial\nrazorband strap, is held in tension in a fixture that, in\nturn, is held in the head of a milling machine designed\nfor metalworking. The controls of the machine are used\nto position the cutting edge in the same plane as the\nvibrating specimen. The controls then are operated,\nmaking the blade come into contact with the specimen,\nto cut it into the shapes and sizes desired.\n\nB73-10521\t\n\nCut specimens of silicone materials prepared to date\nhave included 1/8-inch (3.2-mm) cubes and pieces\n2 by 1/4 by 0.080 inches (51 by 6.4 by 2.03 mm), cut\nfrom sheets of initially spherical samples having a Shore\nAhardness of 60. Dimensions can be held to \xc2\xb10.002\ninch (0.025 mm). Cut surfaces, when viewed in highincidence reflected light, appear mirror-smooth; the\nvibrating mechanism causes no visible striations.\nNote:\nRequests for further information may be directed to:\nTechnology Utilization Officer\nNASA Pasadena Office\n4800 Oak Grove Drive\nPasadena, California 91103\nReference: T5P73-1 0521\nPatent status:\nNASA has decided not to apply for a patent.\nSource: Allen B.
