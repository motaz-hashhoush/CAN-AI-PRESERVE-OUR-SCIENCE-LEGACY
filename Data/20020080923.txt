b'Small Business Innovations\n\nsteadily growing source of\naerospace spinoff applications is the Small Business\nInnovation Research (SBIR)\nprogram, which was established\nby the Congress in 1982 with\ndual objectives: to increase\nparticipation by small businesses in federal R&D activities,\nand to stimulate conversion of\ngovernment-funded research\ninto commercial applications.\nNASA is one of 11 major\ntechnology-generating agencies\nof the federal government\nparticipating, each administering its own program independently under policy guidelines\nset by the Small Business\nAdministration. In the decadeplus since the program\'s\ninception, NASA has awarded\nSBIR contracts to more than\n800 companies and commercial\nI\n\nNASA SMALL BUSINESS\nRESEARCH PROJECTS\nYIELD ADVANCED\n\nComputer Technology\n\nspinoffs have resulted from\nabout one of every three\nprojects completed.\nAmong recent examples of\nsuccessful commercialization in\nthe field of computer technology is the introduction of an\nadvanced family of software\nproducts developed by Symbiotic~,\nInc., Cambridge, Massachusetts under SBIR grants\nfrom NASA and the U.S. Army.\nUnder the Army grant,\nSymbiotics developed a cornerstone software system that\npermits users to upgrade their\nproducts from standalone,\nisolated applications so that\nthey can communicate and\nparticipate in a distributed\ncomputing environment.\nNASA\'s Kennedy Space Center\n(KSC) is applying the software\nto its continuing problem of\n\nintegrating new technology\nwith existing systems - for\nexample, integrating newlydeveloped artificial intelligence\nsystems into the computer\ncomplex of the Space Shuttle\nlaunch processing system,\nwhich has equipment that\nin some cases is more than\n20 years old.\nUnder a subsequent NASA\nSBIR grant, Symbiotics extended the original technology\nto include additional tools,\ngrouped under the product\nname SOCIAL, that enable\nNASA to integrate and coordinate the intelligent and conventional systems used to plan\nand schedule Shuttle launch\nsupport operations. SOCIAL\nprovides an object-oriented\ndistributed processing environment that lets users pass\n\ndata among applications in a\nnetwork of computers with\ndifferent processors, architectures and operating systems even when the applications are\nwritten in different programming languages. In the photo\nat left, the array of computer\nsystems illustrates the ability of\nSymbiotics\' program Networks\nto network various platforms.\nAt Jeft is the company\'s vice\npresident-marketing, Duncan\nMacKay, talking with Richard\nAdler (center), vice president of\nadvanced development.\nSymbiotics introduced\nSOCIAL as a commercial product in 1993. "SOCIAL has\napplicability in a broad variety\nof government and commercial\ndomains," says Dr. Richard\nAdler, Symbiotics\' director of\nadvanced development. "For\nexample, manufacturing process\ncontrol closely resembles KSC\'s\noperations support for the\nSpace Shuttle fleet: a computer\nnetwork is used to monitor and\ncontrol equipment, such as\nthe equipment for producing\nchemicals, semiconductors or\nmechanical parts. Other parallels include operation support\nfor complex communications,\ncomputer, power generation/\ndistribution and transportation\nnetworks. In the business\nsector, SOCIAL can be used to\nintegrate networks of financial\nworkstations, their resident\ndatabases, analysis and graphic\ndisplay tools."\nAnother SBIR program that\nspawned a commercial product\ninvolves the work of Software\nProductivity Solutions, Inc.\n(SPS), Indialantic, Florida in\n\ndeveloping tools for software\nreuse, an emerging technology\nthat can, says SPS, "produce\nsoftware of significantly higher\nquality at a lower cost and in\nless time.\nSPS conducted separate SBIR\nprojects for Langley Research\nCenter and the Army, developing systems for reusing existing\nsoftware rather than creating\nnew computer programs from\nscratch. The technologies from\nboth projects were combined\nin SPS\' commercially available\nInformation Library System\nknown as ~ n ~ u i s i ~ " .\nInQuisiX is a reuse library\nproviding high performance\nclassification (above), cataloguing, searching, browsing,\nretrieval and synthesis capabilities that form the foundation for\ncomprehensive automation\n"\n\nreuse With InQuisX, says\ncompany literature, "software\nassets once thought to be\nobsolete can be identified for\nuse in new applications."\nInQuisiX provides a technological base for SPS\' plan to\ndeveIop a broad line of products for the commercial market.\nSPS has formed a business\nalliance with Science Applications International Corporation\n(SAIC), San Diego, California\nfor marketing software reuse\nproducts and services. SPS\nwill be responsible primarily\nfor development and commercialization of advanced\nsoftware. SAIC will focus\non providing analysis and\nconsulting services.\nInQuisiX is a trademark of Software\nProductivity Solutions, Inc\n\nTM\n\n\'\n\n'
