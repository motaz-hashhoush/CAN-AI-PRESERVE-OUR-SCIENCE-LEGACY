First capacitive gauge, second capacitive gauge, and temperature gauge are embedded in embedding material located within a hollowed out portion of the outer surface. This embedding material is flush with the outer surface to prevent undesirable drag. The first capacitive gauge, second capacitive gauge, and the temperature gauge are respectively connected to first capacitive measuring circuit, second capacitive measuring circuit, and temperature measuring circuit. The geometry of the first and second capacitive gauges is such that the ratio of the voltage outputs of the first and second capacitance measuring circuits is proportional to the thickness of ice, regardless of ice temperature or composition. This ratio is determined by offset and dividing circuit.", "title": "Ice detector", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-13T13:35:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19880019765, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Weinstein, Leonard M."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Langley Research Center", "location": "Hampton, VA, United States"}}, "id": "dba699cfeaf44743bb122c60cdef479b"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other - Patent", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19880019765, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19880019765, "id": "9c69921a65664e2ca50aa866e307f86e", "publicationDate": "1988-08-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19880019765.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19880019765/downloads/19880019765.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19880019765/downloads/19880019765.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19880019765/downloads/19880019765.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
