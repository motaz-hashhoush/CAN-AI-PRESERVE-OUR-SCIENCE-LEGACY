Improved components are required to properly utilize the wide bandwidth allocated for intersatellite link applications around 60 GHz. IMPATT diodes offer the highest potential performance as solid state power sources for a 60 GHz transmitter. Presently available devices do not have the desired power and efficiency. High efficiency, high power IMPATT diodes for intersatellite link applications are being developed by NASA and other government agencies. This paper describes the development of high efficiency 60 GHz IMPATT diodes by NASA. These programs are cofunded by the U.S. Air Force, Space Division.", "title": "High efficiency IMPATT diodes for 60 GHz intersatellite link applications", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T02:06:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19840042546, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Haugland, E.
