Field of the Invention\nThe invention generally relates to ball valves and\nmore particularly to an improved ball valve formed of\nquartz having particular utility in the handling of highly\ncorrosive fluids at high temperatures.\n2. Description of the Prior Art\nThe prior art is, of course, replete with numerous\nvalves, many of which include ball-shaped flow control\ndevices. Additionally, a use of a \xe2\x80\x9cmigrating\xe2\x80\x9d ball for\ncontrolling fluid flow in a valve has been suggested, for\nexample, see U.S. Pat. No. 3,520,319to Jull et al.\nHowever, as can be appreciated by those familiar\nwith techniques and materials employed in the production of silicon for semiconductor or solar devices, large\nquantities of corrosive materials, such as SIC14 must be\nhandled. Moreover, certain processes require that two\nor three separate process steps be performed simultaneously employing a common apparatus. As a consequence, it has been found highly desirable to provide a\nvalve capable of isolating specific regions of an apparatus while being subjected to temperatures elevated well\nabove 300\xe2\x80\x9d C. Of course, the valve employed must be\ncapable of functioning without significant attendant\ndegredation which, as a practical matter, could lead to\ncontamination of the materials being handled.\nIt is, therefore, the general purpose of the instant\ninvention to provide an improved valve particularly\nsuited for use in handling highly corrosive fluid materials, both liquids and gases, at high temperatures without\nexperiencing degredation and attendant losses in the\nutilitv of the valve.\n\n2\n\nleast one rod supported for rectilinear reciprocation\nconnected with the ball for displacing the ball relative\nto each socket seat, as will become more readily apparent by reference to the following description and claims\nin light Of the accompanying drawings.\nDESCRIPTION OF T H E DRAWINGS\nFIG. 1 iS a Vertically sectioned view Of a ball valve\ncomprising one embodiment of the instant invention.\n1\n0\nFIG. 2 is a vertically sectioned view of a further\nembodiment of the invention.\nDESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED\nEMBODIMENTS\n15\n\nFirst Embodiment\nReferring now to the drawings wherein like reference characters designate like or corresponding parts\nthroughout the several views, there is shown in FIG. 1\na valve 10 comprising one embodiment of the instant\n20\ninvention.\nWhile not shown in the drawings, it is to be understood that the valve 10 is particularly adapted to be\nemployed in handling large quantities of corrosive flu25 ids, such as halosilane intermediates often encountered\nat temperatures well above 300\xe2\x80\x9d ,in the production of\nsilicon for semiconductor solar devices.\nAt the outset, it should be understood that the valve\n10 includes a housing 11 which is fabricated from a\n30 suitable refractory material, preferably quartz. As\nherein employed, the term refractory relates to heat\nresistant, non-metallic materials. Preferably, the housing 11 is of a generally T-shaped configuration and\nincludes an inlet conduit 12, an inlet conduit 13 and a\n35 discharge conduit 14. Each of the conduits comprises a\nsegment of quartz tubing. While the conduits 12 and 13\nare of linear configurations, the segment 12 terminates\nin an angulated portion 16. The conduits 12, 13 and 14\ncommunicate with a valving chamber 17 common\n40 thereto.\nAs shown in FIG. 1, the portion 16 is coaxially related to an inlet port 18 while the segment 13 is coaxially related to an inlet port 20 and the segment 14 an\nOBJECTS A N D SUMMARY OF THE\noutlet port 22. As shown, the port 22 is spaced from the\nINVENTION\nA.- chamber 17 in coaxial alignment with the inlet Dort 20\nC\nIt is, therefore, an object of the invention to provide\nand in abaxial aknment with the inlet Port 18.\nan improved ball valve which OvercOmeS the aforemenFormed in coaxial alignment with the inlet port 18\nthere is a first socket 24 having a configuration contioned difficulties and disadvantages.\nIt is another object to provide an improved selecforming to a segment of a sphere while a second socket\ntively actuatable ball valve particularly suited for use in 5 26 of a similar configuration is formed in coaxial align0\nhandling highly corrosive fluids at high temperatures.\nment with the inlet port 20. These sockets are disposed\nAnother object is to provide a valve for use in hanin mutally spaced abaxial alignment and communicate\ndling large quantities of corrosive fluids in the producwith the valving chambers 17. Disposed within the\ntion of silicon for use in fabrication of semiconductor\nchamber 17 and adapted to be seated in each of the\ndevices, although not necessarily restricted in use 55 sockets 24 and 26 there is a migrating ball 28, also\nthereto since the valve of the instant invention may be\nformed of quartz. In practice, the ball 28 includes a first\nequally useful when employed in other endeavors resurface 28a of a compound curve configuration conforming substantially to the dimensions and configuraquiring a handling of corrosive chemicals at high temtions of the socket 24, and a second surface 28b of a\nperatures.\nThese together with other objects and advantages are 60 dimension and configuration substantially conforming\nachieved through the use of a selectively actuatable ball\nto the dimension and configuration of the socket 26.\nvalve including a housing formed of quartz and having\nPreferably, the surfaces 280 and 28b are characterized\ndefined therein multiple fluid inlets and at least one fluid\nby a common radius and are arranged in axially spaced\noutlet, and a socket seat interposed between each of the\nrelation. Thus the ball 28 is adapted to be moved beinlets and the outlets, a ball formed of quartz material 65 tween the sockets 24 and 26 and be seated for forming a\nconfigured to be discharged from and received by each\nfluid tight seal between the contacting surfaces thereof.\nof said sockets for opening and closing an associated\nThus the operation of the valve is dictated by the posiinlet relative to the outlet, and an actuator including at\ntion of the ball 28 relative to the sockets.\nI\n\n3\n\n4,195,666\n\nAt this juncture, it is important to note that repositioning of the ball is effected through manipulation of a\npush-pull rod 30. The rod 30 is connected to the ball 28\nby an articulated coupling 32 comprising a pair of interconnected eyes, one being formed at one end of the rod\n30 and the other being projected from the surface 280 of\nthe ball. It should now be apparent that the ball 28 is\nrepositioned relative to the sockets simply by imparting\naxial displacement to the rod 30.\n1\nThe rod 30, as shown in FIG. 1 Projects through a\nsleeve 34 integrally related to the tube segment l2 and\ncoaxially aligned with the inlet port 18. Preferably, the\nsurface of the rod 30 is polished while the sleeve is\nprovided with an O-ring 36 seated in the sleeve for\npurposes of establishing between the sleeve and the rod\nmay be formed Of any\na fluid tight\nThe\nsuch as dynamic\nOr Teflon as\ndesired. However, in order to assure minimal O-ring\ndegredation, the\nbe so that the temperature of the O-ring remains below 250" C.\nAs an aid to\nthe rod 30 is provided with\na suitable grip or handle 38 located at its extremity in a\nconvenient location\nto the\nhousing\' In\ngrasps the\n38 and\n\'peration, an \'perator\naxially displaces the rod 30 for displacing the ball. Thus\nthe surface 28a of the ball is caused to seat against the\nsurface of the socket 24 or against the surface 286\nagainst the surface of the socket 26. With the ball 28\nseated in the socket 26, a first flow path established from\nthe tube segment 16 through the inlet port 18, and\nthence through the outlet port 22, while the port 20\nremains in a closed condition due to the presence of the\nball. Similarly, with the ball 28 received in the socket 24\na second flow path is established which extends through\nthe inlet port 20 and thence through the outlet port 22,\nwhile the first flow path is interrupted at the inlet port\n18 as a consequence of the presence of the socket 24 of\nthe ball 28.\n\n4\n\n5\n\n1\n0\n\n15\n\n2o\n\n25\n\n30\n\nreceived by the socket 56, in sealing relation therewith,\nwhereby the ball 58 is adapted to be received in the\nsockets 54 and 56 with a fluid-tight seal being established between the contiguous surfaces thereof.\nIt is important here to note, however, that connected\nto the ball 58, at the surface 58u, there is a first actuator\nrod 60. Also connected to the ball 58, at the surface 586,\nthere is a second actuator rod 62. Again, a suitable\narticulated coupling, designated 64, is provided for\ncoupling the actuator rods 60 and 62 with the ball 58, at\nopposite surfaces thereof. Like the coupling 32, the\ncouplings 64 comprise interconnected eyes formed on\nthe rods and projected from the surface of the ball 58.\nIt is important to note that each of the actuator rods\n60 and 62 include a\n66. Each\ncomprises a steel\nbar, encapsulated by a layer 68 of quartz. Moreover, it\nis noted that the actuator rod 60 is sealed in a first sleeve\n70, the axis of which passes through the inlet port 48,\nwhile the actuator rod 62 is seated in a sleeve 72, the\naxis of which passes through the inlet port 50. Concentrically related to the sleeves 70 and 72, there are electrical windings 74 and 76 for alternately establishing\nelectromagnetic fields about the\n66 for the actuator\nrods 60 and 62, respectively. It should now be understood that the cores 66 function as solenoid cores and in\nresponse to voltages applied across the coils 74 and 76\nare displaced in axial directions for displacing the ball\n58\nto the sockets 54 and 56 for Opening and\nthe\nports 48 and 50,\nThe Operation Of the\n40 is similar in many respects to the operation Of the\nlo, hereinbefore\ndescribed.\nWith the\n\n35\n\n40\nFurther Embodiment\n~~~i~~ now to FIG. 2, wherein is illustrated a valve\n40 constituting a further embodiment of the invention.\nIt will be appreciated from even a cursory review of\nFIG. 2 that the valve 40 is similar in many respects to\nthe valve 10. For example, note that the valve 40 in- 45\ncludes a housing 42, also of a generally T-shaped configuration. The housing 42 also includes segments of\nquartz tubing, designated 44,45 and 46.While the segments 45 and 46 are of linear configuration, the segment\nof tubing 44 terminates in an angulated portion 47. The 50\nportion 47 includes an inlet port 48, the segment 46\nincludes an inlet port 50 and the segment 45 includes an\noutlet port 52 provided in remote relation to the ports\n48 and 50. The ports 48, 50 and 52 communicate with a\nvaiving chamber 53, commonly related thereto. The 55\nports 50 and 52 are arranged in coaxial alignment while\nthe port 48 is abaxially aligned with both of the ports 50\nand 52.\nDisposed in coaxial juxtaposition with the port 48 is a\nfirst socket 54, while a second socket 56 is disposed in 60\ncoaxial juxtaposition with the inlet port 50. The surfaces\nof these sockets also are of a compound configuration\ngenerally conforming to that of segments of a sphere.\nInterposed between the sockets 54 and 56, defined\nwithin the chamber 53, there is a ball 58 having a first 65\nsurface 580 dimensioned and configured to be received\nin the socket 54, in sealing relation therewith, and a\nsecond surface 586 dimensioned and configured to be\n\nas shown, a\nfirst flow Path is established from the tubular segment\nport 48 and thence to the Outlet\n44 through the\na second flow path extended through the\nport 52\ninlet port 50 to the outlet port 52 is interrupted as a\nconsequence of the ball 58 being present and seated in\nsealing relation with the socket 56. However, upon the\ncoil 74 being energized and, simultaneously, the coil 76\nbeing de-energized the core 66 of the actuator rod 60 is\ndrawn toward the coil 74, for causing the ball 58 to be\nlifted from the socket 56 and seated in the socket 54.\nThus the inlet Port 48 is c h e d and the inlet Port 50\nopened. Consequently, the continuity of the second\nflow Path through the inlet Port 50 to the outlet Port 52\nis established, while the flow path through the inlet port\n48 to the outlet port 52 is interrupted.\nIn view of the foregoing, it is believed to be readily\napparent that the valves 10 and 40 provide practical\nsolutions to the problem of controlling the flow of hightemperature corrosive fluids.\nWhat is claimed is:\n1. A selectively actuatable ball valve comprising:\nA. a valve housing formed of refractory material\nhaving means defining therein a fluid inlet port, a\nfluid outlet port, and a pair of mutually spaced,\nadjacently related socket seats disposed in communicating relation with the fluid inlet port and the\nfluid outlet port;\nB. a ball formed of refractory material configured to\nbe received in and discharged from each of said\nsocket seats for alternately opening and closing\nsaid inlet port and said outlet port; and\nC. valve actuator means for displacing said ball reiative to said socket seats including a pair of rods,\neach rod of said pair being connected to said ball\n58 seated in the socket 569\n\n5\n\n4,195,666\n\nand supported for rectilinear reciprocation for displacing the ball relative to said socket seats.\n2.
