Surface gravities, Doppler broadening velocities, effective temperatures, and metal abundances are  determined for 131 K giants. Evolutionary tracks and gravities determined from the photometry are used to give space positions, space velocities, and absolute magnitudes of the 131 stars. We conclude that a  class of stars exists with metals and/or nitrogen significantly enhanced with respect to the sun; further that these stars have average space motions similar to those of moderately old Population I stars. The Doppler broadening velocity is found to be a strong function of temperature for K giants, and in some cases, possibly a function of surface gravity.", "title": "Abundances in late-type giants.", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-07T02:52:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19730028422, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Gottlieb, D.
