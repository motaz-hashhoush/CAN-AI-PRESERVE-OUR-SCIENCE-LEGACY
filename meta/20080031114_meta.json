Human perception of rattle can be negative that is a motivating factor of the current research effort to study sonic boom induced window rattle. A rattle study has been conducted on residential houses containing windows of different construction at a variety of geographic locations within the United States. Windows in these houses were excited by a portable, high-powered loudspeaker and enclosure specifically designed to be mounted on the house exterior to cover an entire window. Window vibration was measured with accelerometers placed on different window components. Reference microphones were also placed inside the house and inside of the loudspeaker box. Swept sine excitation was used to identify the vibration threshold at which the response of the structure becomes non-linear and begins to rattle. Initial results from this study are presented and discussed. Future efforts will continue to explore the rattle occurrence in windows of residential houses exposed to sonic booms.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20080031114, "endDate": "2008-07-31T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "Noise-Con 2008", "location": "Dearborn, MI", "id": "dfecda3fc3f04e3bb43700da44dc9de3", "startDate": "2008-07-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20080031114, "id": "961147c1b6324df7ad058bba6d8019de", "publicationDate": "2008-07-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20080031114.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20080031114/downloads/20080031114.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20080031114/downloads/20080031114.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20080031114/downloads/20080031114.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
