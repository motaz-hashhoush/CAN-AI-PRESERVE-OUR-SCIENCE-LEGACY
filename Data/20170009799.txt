Prior to launch, GeneLab works with\nthe PI to understand the data volume anticipated and the nature of the data to be\nshared. Post-flight GeneLab works closely with the PI team to facilitate the data and\nmetadata submission.\nSample Sharing Missions\nThe goal of the Sample Sharing missions is to make the greatest use of all\ncells/tissues/samples that have experienced microgravity conditions. Prior to launch GeneLab\nengages with the PI to determine the tissues/samples that can be donated to or augmented by\nGeneLab for post-flight processing and immediate posting to the data system. GeneLab\ntakes receipt of these samples either immediately post-flight, or post-PI processing depending\nupon the nature of the samples. GeneLab works closely with the PI team post-flight to\nfacilitate the data and metadata submission.\n\nWhen to engage with GeneLab\nThe GeneLab process toward data is the same for any collaboration. The only difference\nis the chronological point at which GeneLab engages with the PI/experiment.\n\nBlessed are the flexible, for they shall not\nbe bent out of shape. \xe2\x80\x94 Anonymous.\n\nGeneLab Model Organism Interest\n\nDatafile Downloads by Model Organism\nAugust 16 to September 15, 1%1%1%\n2016\n\nMus musculus\n\nArabidopsis thaliana\n\n2%\n\nHomo sapiens\n\n2%\n\n2%\n\ncellular organisms\n\n2%\n\nbacterial isolates\n\n3%\n\nBrassica rapa\nDrosophila melanogaster\nRattus norvegicus\n\n7%\n\nBacillus\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae\n\n49%\n\nCaenorhabditis elegans\nEnvironmental Samples\nAspergillus fumigatus\nRhodospirillum rubrum\n\n10%\n\nPseudomonas aeruginosa\nBacillus subtilis\nSalmonella enterica\nDanio rerio\nEscherichia coli\nCandida albicans\nCeratopteris richardii\n\n17%\n\n'
