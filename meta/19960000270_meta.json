The appropriate amount of liquid phase necessary for complete densification has been adjusted by controlling the maximum processing temperature. The maximum temperature itself has to be adapted to several parameters as powder stoichiometry, silver addition and oxygen partial pressure. Prolonged annealing at 850 and 820 C and cooling in N2 atmosphere led to nearly single phase material with T(sub c) = 92 K. Critical current densities j(sub c) of 2'200 A/sq cm at 77 K/0 T have been achieved in samples of more than 1 mm thickness. Reducing the thickness below 0.4 mm enhances j(sub c) considerably to values is greater than 4'000 A/sq cm. The addition of 2 wt% Ag decreases the solidus temperature of the Bi-2212 powder by 21 C. Therefore, the maximum heat treatment temperature of Ag containing samples can be markedly lowered leading to a reduction of the amount of secondary phases. In addition, Ag enhances slightly the texture over the entire cross section and as a result j(sub c) at 77 K/0 T.", "title": "Partical Melting of bulk Bi-2212", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T23:30:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19960000270, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Heeb, B."}, "organization": {"name": "Eidgenoessische Technische Hochschule", "location": "Zurich, Switzerland"}}, "id": "b4c152de2fa84c71937724d3a7df63e0"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19960000270, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Gauckler, L.
