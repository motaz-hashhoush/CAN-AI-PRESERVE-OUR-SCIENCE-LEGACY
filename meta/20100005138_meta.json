Few therapies are perfectly specific for the desired physiological activity; rather they act on multiple biological targets and result in multiple physiological effects. There are several strategies that are employed to prevent, alleviate or counteract medication-induced side effects. The administered dose may be optimized to the lowest possible amount that provides the desired therapeutic effect, with the expectation that untoward effects will be minimized by a lower dose. Empirical trials of different therapies for a particular medical problem may be used in the hopes of finding a drug with minimal side effects for a particular patient, or at least of finding a set of side effects that the patient considers tolerable. If these two strategies have been exhausted, it may be possible to administer another medication to block or ameliorate side effects. A recent search of published scientific literature has revealed that there are medications used in spaceflight that seem to be associated with a significant number of reports of untoward effects. To prevent future medical problems and to improve the well-being and productivity of crew members, it would be best to eliminate (or at least reduce) untoward effects. Reports from the literature will be examined, with the aim of identifying a strategy for reducing untoward effects.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20100005138, "endDate": "2010-02-04T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "HRP Investigators Workshop", "location": "Houston, TX", "id": "a28d6470be2246f09d091a75a5edcb3a", "startDate": "2010-02-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20100005138, "id": "eae46217c7a343bf94515c2dc9fdb58f", "publicationDate": "2010-02-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20100005138.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20100005138/downloads/20100005138.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20100005138/downloads/20100005138.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20100005138/downloads/20100005138.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
