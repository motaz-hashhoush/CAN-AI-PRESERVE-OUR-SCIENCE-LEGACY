Allowance  of lead-free components presents one of the greatest risks to the r  eliability of military and aerospace electronics. The introduction of  components with lead-free terminations, termination finishes, or cir cuit boards presents a host of concerns to customers, suppliers, and  maintainers of aerospace and military electronic systems such as: 1.   Electrical shorting due to tin whiskers 2. Incompatibility of lead-f ree processes and parameters (including higher melting points of lead -free alloys) with other materials in the system 3. Unknown material   properties and incompatibilities that could reduce solder joint reli ability As the transition to lead-free becomes a certain reality for   military and aerospace applications, it will be critical to fully un derstand the implications of reworking lead-free assemblies.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20100042600, "endDate": "2010-10-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Department of Defense", "location": "Washington, DC, United States"}}, "meetingId": "0b7554f3ef7046e789c59a4ea018be40", "id": "ac14f280d05747039be4ad9118293b3c"}], "name": "Surface Mount Technology Association International Conference", "location": "Orlando, FL", "id": "0b7554f3ef7046e789c59a4ea018be40", "startDate": "2010-10-24T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}, {"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20100042600, "endDate": "2010-08-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Department of Defense", "location": "Washington, DC, United States"}}, "meetingId": "8995d5296af9484093425481810efa60", "id": "01dcdb07d7e0445aa84635d9ac3b09b3"}], "name": "DoD Soldering Technologies Working Group (STWG)", "location": "Columbus, OH", "id": "8995d5296af9484093425481810efa60", "startDate": "2010-08-24T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}, {"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20100042600, "endDate": "2010-01-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Department of Defense", "location": "Washington, DC, United States"}}, "meetingId": "258531ae3d884eec80df64d0b4031544", "id": "606b919b14c944bb9702b74f9bd4929e"}], "name": "Pb-free Electronics Risk Management (PERM) Consortium", "location": "Oak Ridge, TN", "id": "258531ae3d884eec80df64d0b4031544", "startDate": "2010-01-05T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20100042600, "id": "0a5697e35af040e38b64df6cdb3ccb35", "publicationDate": "2010-10-24T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20100042600.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20100042600/downloads/20100042600.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20100042600/downloads/20100042600.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20100042600/downloads/20100042600.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
