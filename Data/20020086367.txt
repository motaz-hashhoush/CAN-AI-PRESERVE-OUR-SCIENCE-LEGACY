b'Business Jet\nShown below is the CitationJet business aircraft,\ndeveloped by Cessna Aircraft Company, Wichita,\nKansas, and introduced to flight test in 1991. It is the\nfirst business jet to employ natural laminar flow\n(NLF), a technology developed by NASA\'s Langley\nResearch Center and refmed for the CitationJet\napplication by Cessna.\nNLF is a means of keeping the airflow over a\nwing smooth, or laminar, solely by the shape of the\nwing surface. Near the leading edge, air moves over\nthe wing in smooth, aerodynamically efficient sheets\ncalled "laminas."As the air moves farther across the\nwing, friction between the air and the wing causes\nthe laminas to expand and the air becomes\nturbulent. The turbulence creates added drag, which\nlimits the airplane\'s speed and increases its fuel\nconsumption.\nNASA has developed technology for a number\nof ways of maintaining laminar flow, among them a\nseries of NLF airfoils shaped to keep the air smooth\nfor a longer time as it progresses over the wing.\n\n7be design\ngoal is to\nextend\n\nlarninarflow\nacross 35\nP e n t of\n\nthe wing\'s\nchord\n\nWith a conventional wing, the onset of turbulence\noccurs near the wing\'s leading edge. With the\nCitationJet\'s NLF wing, the design goal is to extend\nlaminar flow across 35 percent of the wing\'s chord.\nNASA\'s Central Industrial Applications Center, Rural\nEnterprises, Inc., Durant, Oklahoma, and its Kansas\naffdiate, Kansas Technology Enterprise Corporation,\nTopeka, Kansas, and Wichita State University assisted\nCessna in the transfer of the NLF technology.\nNLF and other design elements combine to give\nthe CitationJet cruise speeds up to 437 miles per\nhour, a range of 1,500miles and the ability to\noperate from airstrips of less than 3,000 feet.\nCessna describes the nine-passenger CitationJet\nas an "entry level" business jet and claims it is "the\nlowest priced business jet you can buy" at $2.5\nmillion. Within two days of the announcement of its\navailability, the first production block of 50 airplanes\nwas sold out. Certification by the Federal Aviation\nAdministration and first deliveries are expected in\nOctober 1992.\n\n'
