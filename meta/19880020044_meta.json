It is one of two space qualified manipulators. A new conceptual design for the next generation manipulator of space applications is presented. The next generation manipulator and the PFMA are described in detail. Their differences could have a major influence on the construction, testing, and performance of a space arm. Assessed in detail are these technologies and their effect on the design. Servicing is an important goal of robotics in space. Parameters such as environment, type of task, time sequence, and dexterity will affect the arm and its ability to accomplish its mission. Requirements such as these are important considerations in the design of the next generation space arm.", "title": "Next-generation space manipulator", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-05T18:52:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19880020044, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Brunson, P."}, "organization": {"name": "Martin Marietta Aerospace", "location": "Denver, CO, United States"}}, "id": "da49f40de6f74492987a3d5f573479b0"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19880020044, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Chun, W."}, "organization": {"name": "Martin Marietta Aerospace", "location": "Denver, CO, United States"}}, "id": "54597b13e0e247e3a1ffc170d86dd9b3"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19880020044, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Cogeos, P."}, "organization": {"name": "Martin Marietta Aerospace", "location": "Denver, CO, United States"}}, "id": "a6658e77cb9f46b8b61dba2ffc5f9e88"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19880020044, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19880020044, "id": "4ab7692ecac54e8d969507ee4ce526ba", "publicationName": "NASA, Marshall Space Flight Center, Second Conference on Artificial Intelligence for Space Applications", "publicationDate": "1988-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
