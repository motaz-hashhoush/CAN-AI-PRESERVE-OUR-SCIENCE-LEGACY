b'Improving Vision\n\nM\n\nHealth and Medicine\n\nany people are familiar with the popular science fiction series Star Trek: The Next\nGeneration, a show featuring a blind character\nnamed Geordi La Forge, whose visor-like glasses enable\nhim to see. What many people do not know is that a\nproduct very similar to Geordi\xe2\x80\x99s glasses is available to\nassist people with vision conditions, and a NASA engineer\xe2\x80\x99s expertise contributed to its development.\nThe JORDY\xe2\x84\xa2 (Joint Optical Reflective Display)\ndevice, designed and manufactured by a privately-held\nmedical device company known as Enhanced Vision,\nenables people with low vision to read, write, and watch\ntelevision. Low vision, which includes macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and glaucoma, describes\neyesight that is 20/70 or worse, and cannot be fully corrected with conventional glasses.\nUnlike someone who is blind, a person with low\nvision retains a small part of his or her useful sight.\nJORDY enables people to see using their remaining sight\nby magnifying objects up to 50 times and allowing them\nto change contrast, brightness, and display modes,\ndepending on what works best for their low vision condition. With this device, people can see objects at any\nrange, from up close to distant. It also provides the flexibility for the user to enjoy theatre, sporting events, and\nmore. JORDY functions as a portable display that is\nworn like a pair of glasses and as a fully functional desktop video magnifier when placed on a docking stand.\n\n22\n\nJORDY was inspired by the Low Vision\nEnhancement System (LVES), a video headset developed through a joint research project between NASA\xe2\x80\x99s\nStennis Space Center, Johns Hopkins University, and the\nU.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Worn like a pair of\ngoggles, LVES contained two eye-level cameras, one\nwith an unmagnified wide-angle view and one with magnification capabilities. The system manipulated the\ncamera images to compensate for a person\xe2\x80\x99s low vision\nlimitations. Although the technology was licensed and\nmarketed by Visionics Corporation, LVES was only\ncommercially available for a short time.\nIn an effort to bring a new and improved low vision\nheadset to the market, Enhanced Vision, of Huntington\nBeach, California, pursued the development of JORDY.\nWith advances in smaller camera technology, the company significantly increased the head-worn video magnifier\xe2\x80\x99s usability, effectiveness, and overall portability.\nPaul Mogan, an engineer at NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Kennedy Space\nCenter, has enthusiastically helped Enhanced Visions\xe2\x80\x99\ncontinuing efforts to improve JORDY by contributing\nideas and evaluating prototypes.\nLegally blind since age 19 due to macular degeneration, Mogan began using the JORDY 1 in 1999. With\nsuggestions for improving the product, he began corresponding with Enhanced Vision. For example, because\nslight head movements while wearing JORDY would\ncause the image to jump, Mogan recommended adding\n\nThe JORDY\xe2\x84\xa2 headset, when worn like a pair of glasses,\nenables people with low vision to see objects at any range.\n\nS P I N O F F\n\n2003\n\nHealth and Medicine\n\nBy placing JORDY\xe2\x84\xa2 on a docking stand above a\nbook, a person with low vision can read magnified\npages that are projected onto a computer screen.\n\nimage stabilization to the product. He found the company happy to receive and implement his feedback. When\nEnhanced Vision developed JORDY 2, a lighter, smaller\nversion of the original device, Mogan again offered\nsuggestions for refinements. One of the enhancements\nnoted for JORDY 3 incorporates an even smaller, highresolution camera that fits into small, discreet glasses\nthat weigh less than 2 ounces. Increased miniaturization\nwill allow Mogan and others to wear JORDY comfortably for longer periods of time.\nJORDY significantly improves the lives of people\nwith low vision by enabling them to pursue their\ngoals. According to Mogan, \xe2\x80\x9cAs an engineer, I\xe2\x80\x99m\nalways looking for the technologies that are going to\ngive me the edge to keep up. The JORDY has done this\nmore than anything else on the market.\xe2\x80\x9d He particularly benefits from the product at work whenever he\nreads for extended periods of time or completes forms.\nBy placing JORDY on a docking stand above a book,\n\nMogan reads magnified pages that are projected onto\nhis computer screen.\nAside from assisting at work, JORDY helps people\nregain their independence in other ways. The device,\nwhen plugged directly into a television set and used in\ncombination with the headset, allows the visually\nimpaired to enjoy television. JORDY also enables people\nto participate in events, and to see the faces of family and\nfriends. For example, when U.S. speedskater Casey\nFitzRandolph won a gold medal in the 2002 Winter\nOlympic Games, his grandfather was able to watch the\nhistoric moment from the stands using his JORDY.\nAn eye care professional or low vision specialist can\nbest determine JORDY\xe2\x80\x99s suitability for a patient\xe2\x80\x99s individual condition during a routine eye exam. Enhanced\nVision works with leading doctors throughout the United\nStates and Canada. Its products are available in over 70\ncountries worldwide.\nJORDY\xe2\x84\xa2 is a trademark of Enhanced Vision.\n\nS P I N O F F\n\n2003\n\n23\n\n'
