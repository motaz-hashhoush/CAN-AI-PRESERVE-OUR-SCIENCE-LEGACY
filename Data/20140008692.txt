b"PSL Icing Facility Upgrade Overview\nThomas A. Griffin 1 and Dennis J. Dicki 2\nNASA Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio 44135\nand\nPaul J. Lizanich 3\nSierra Lobo Corporation, Cleveland, Ohio 44135\nThe NASA Glenn Research Center Propulsion Systems Lab (PSL) was recently upgraded\nto perform engine inlet ice crystal testing in an altitude environment. The system installed 10\nspray bars in the inlet plenum for ice crystal generation using 222 spray nozzles. As an\naltitude test chamber, the PSL is capable of simulating icing events at altitude in a groundtest facility. The system was designed to operate at altitudes from 4,000 to 40,000 ft at Mach\nnumbers up to 0.8M and inlet total temperatures from \xe2\x80\x9360 to +15 \xc2\xb0F. This paper and\npresentation will be part of a series of presentations on PSL Icing and will cover the\ndevelopment of the icing capability through design, developmental testing, installation,\ninitial calibration, and validation engine testing. Information will be presented on the design\ncriteria and process, spray bar developmental testing at Cox and Co., system capabilities,\nand initial calibration and engine validation test. The PSL icing system was designed to\nprovide NASA and the icing community with a facility that could be used for research\nstudies of engine icing by duplicating in-flight events in a controlled ground-test facility.\nWith the system and the altitude chamber we can produce flight conditions and cloud\nenvironments to simulate those encountered in flight. The icing system can be controlled to\nset various cloud uniformities, droplet median volumetric diameter (MVD), and icing water\ncontent (IWC) through a wide variety of conditions. The PSL chamber can set altitudes,\nMach numbers, and temperatures of interest to the icing community and also has the\ninstrumentation capability of measuring engine performance during icing testing. PSL last\nyear completed the calibration and initial engine validation of the facility utilizing a\nHoneywell ALF502-R5 engine and has duplicated in-flight roll back conditions experienced\nduring flight testing. This paper will summarize the modifications and buildup of the facility\nto accomplish these tests.\n\nNomenclature\nA/D\nARRA\nATP\nCDP\nCIP\nDCS\nDI\nDPU\nDVD\nDVR\nEHWG\nFAA\n\n= analog/digital\n= American Recovery and Reinvestment Act\n= Aeronautics Test Program\n= cloud droplet probe\n= cloud imaging probe\n= distributed control system\n= deionized\n= data processing unit\n= digital video disc\n= digital video recorder\n= Engine Harmonization Working Group\n= Federal Aviation Administration\n\n1\n\nPSL Mechanical Tech Lead, Wind Tunnel and Propulsion Test Branch, 21000 Brookpark Road, Cleveland, OH, 44135.\nPSL Lead Facility Engineer, Wind Tunnel and Propulsion Test Branch, 21000 Brookpark Road, Cleveland, OH, 44135.\n3\nPSL Electrical Tech Lead, Sierra Lobo Corporation, 21000 Brookpark Road, Cleveland, OH, 44135.\n2\n\n1\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nFOD\nFT\nID\nI/O\nIRT\nIWC\nMMI\nMVD\nNASA\nNTSC\nOPC\nOS\nPC\nPSL\nscfm\nUAV\nUTR\nWDPF\n\nT\n\n= foreign object damage\n= Facilities Test Division\n= inner diameter\n= input/output\n= Icing Research Tunnel\n= icing water content\n= man-machine interface\n= median volumetric diameter\n= National Aeronautics and Space Administration\n= National Television System Committee\n= object linking and embedding for process control\n= operating system\n= personal computer\n= Propulsion Systems Laboratory\n= standard cubic feet per minute\n= unmanned aerial vehicle\n= uniform temperature reference?\n= Westinghouse Distributed Process Family\n\nI. Introduction\n\nhe Propulsion Systems Laboratory (PSL) at the NASA Glenn Research Center is one of the premier U.S.\nfacilities for research on advanced aeropropulsion systems. The facility can simulate a wide range of altitude\nand Mach number conditions while supplying the aeropropulsion system with all the support service necessary to\noperate at those conditions. Test data are recorded on a combination of steady-state and high-speed data acquisition\nsystems. For over three years, the PSL has undergone a significant transformation: an ice crystal cloud generation\nsystem was added, making it the first ground-based test facility in the world capable of fully simulating these\nchallenging atmospheric conditions, which have been a longstanding threat to aircraft engines. Following the\ncompletion of the facility\xe2\x80\x99s first engine icing test, which resulted in the successful replication of a known altitude\nicing loss of power engine event condition, the facility staff are further augmenting the facility capability in response\nto ever-evolving research requirements to improve the efficiency of the testing process and to resolve known\ndeficiencies in the system identified as part of the lessons-learned process.\n\nII. PSL Facility Background\nThe Propulsion Systems Laboratory (PSL) at NASA Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, OH, houses two\naltitude simulation test chambers, which are used for aeronautics research of turbine engines. It consists of two\nchambers, PSL3 and PSL4, which are each 24 ft in diameter and 39 ft long. They are direct-connect facilities in\nwhich the engines are connected through inlet ducts to the inlet plenum. Each chamber utilizes the NASA GRC\ncentral air services for supply of pressurized air to set the inlet conditions and altitude exhaust for altitude\nsimulation. Local to PSL are also J-57 heater engines and turbo-expanders, which provides nonvitiated temperature\nconditioning of the inlet air for Mach and altitude conditions (Fig. 1). Both test chambers were commissioned in\n1973 for turbine engine research studies. They have been in continuous use since that time and have tested a wide\nvariety of propulsion systems including military and commercial turbofan engines, turboshaft, turbine-based\ncombine cycle, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) engines. PSL is NASA\xe2\x80\x99s only ground-based, full-scale engine\ntest capability designed for research to provide detailed information on the performance and operability of engines\nand propulsion systems at extreme conditions over the entire flight envelope, which can only be obtained through\naltitude-simulated ground-based testing.

PSL functional layout.\nPSL3 was recently upgraded in 2010 to 2012 for engine ice crystal research at altitude conditions. This paper\nwill explain the enhancements made to the facility, the lessons learned, and the future enhancements planned.\n\nIII. Advocacy for PSL Upgrade\nNASA Glenn has a strong icing research program dating back to the establishment of the Icing Research Tunnel\n(IRT) in World War II.1 Numerous icing flight campaigns have been conducted by the NASA GRC Icing Branch,\nincluding programs to characterize the natural icing environment, to collect data and study various aspects of the\nnatural icing process, to study the aerodynamic effects of icing, and investigate methods to protect aircraft from\nicing. Many complimentary, similar, and even more extensive studies have been conducted by the Icing Branch in\nthe IRT, where precise control over icing conditions greatly expand test utility. NASA has also developed the\nLEWICE icing code which predicts ice accretion and shapes on airfoil surfaces.2,3 The Icing Branch researchers and\nIRT operations engineers and technical staff represent world class experience in aircraft icing. Based on this and that\nPSL is uniquely suited to operate small- and medium-sized engines at varying altitudes and inlet conditions, the\nicing and altitude capabilities could be merged to position PSL to provide a capability to the icing community for a\nsimulated flight environment to conduct both ice crystal and conventional icing research.\nBased on the increased experience of engine power loss events since 1990,4 the technical staff at NASA began to\nadvocate for the upgrade of the PSL to have a capability for ice crystal generation for engine research studies under\nsimulated altitude conditions. Preliminary design studies were performed to consider different ice generation designs\nsuch as shaved ice and spray bars. Several companies and agencies such as Cox and Company, the Federal Aviation\n3\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nAdministration (FAA), NASA GRC Icing Branch, and NASA Headquarters Aviation Safety Program provided input\nfor design requirements. Input was also obtained from the FAA Engine Harmonization Working Group (EHWG),\nmuch of which was included in their 2005 roadmap,5 task 3 and 4, Mixed-Phase/Glaciated Icing Technology Plan.\nThese tasks were titled:\n(1) Task 3. Experimental testing in support of ice accretion model development and validation for high ice water\ncontent environments.\n(2) Task 4. Test Facilities Requirements for demonstrating engine compliance with Appendix D requirements.\nThe EHWG endorsed the enhancement of the PSL for an ice crystal test capability in 2008 and a study was done\nof future utilization rates of the icing system in the PSL. It was determined that there was sufficient interest from the\nicing community to proceed with solicitation of funding sources for the facility icing system.\nUltimately the spray bar technique, similar to those used in the IRT, was selected as the most practical and gave\nthe most versatility for use in the PSL. Utilizing the modulation of water supply pressure and atomizing air pressure\nwould give a wide range of median volumetric diameter (MVD) distributions and icing water content (IWC). It was\ndetermined that the amount of material required to meet our requirements would make the shaved ice method\nimpractical. The design envelope specified is presented in Table 1.\nTable 1. PSL Icing Design Requirements\nSpecification\nMinimum Maximum\nAltitude (pressure), ft\n4000\n40,000\n\xe2\x80\x9360\n15\nInlet total temperature, \xc2\xb0F\nMach number\n0.15\n0.80\nAir flow rate, lbm/s\n10\n330\nIWC, g/m3\n0.5\n9.0\n40\n60\nMVD, \xc2\xb5m\nRun time\nContinuous up to 45 min\nInitial studies and preliminary designs were funded through the NASA Aeronautics Test Program (ATP). This\nprovided accurate cost estimates for a detailed design and fabrication effort. Once funds became available from the\nAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009, approval was given to proceed with final design,\nfabrication, and enhancement of the facility. The system was required to be removable so that the PSL3 can be\nreconfigured back to pre-icing configuration for standard engine research.\nThe modification was programmed in several different phases: the design phase, fabrication phase, icing system\ninstallation, icing calibration, and then an engine validation test. This was further separated into icing systems that\nincluded all of the systems necessary to generate the ice cloud in the plenum and test cell hardware, which would be\nhardware located in PSL3 utilized for the calibration and engine validation phases.\nThe facility modification, fabrication, and icing system installation was managed by the NASA Glenn Facilities\nDivision. A.M. Kinney was selected as the prime contractor for the design with a subcontract to Cox and Company,\nInc., for the spray bars and plenum transition duct. For part of the design effort, as a risk reduction, two\ndemonstration tests of the spray bar design were performed at the Cox and Company LeClerc Icing Research\nLaboratory. A representative cross section of the spray bar was installed and velocities and residence times\nequivalent to the environment in the PSL were run to determine droplet freeze out and MVD distributions. Based on\nthe results of these tests there was confidence to proceed forward with the spray bar and facility design under\nconsideration.\nOnce the icing system was designed, fabricated, and installed the system was turned over to the Facilities Test\nDivision (FT) for checkout and commissioning. This involved a lengthy process of verification of all of the wiring,\ncontrol programming, instrumentation, and operation of the icing systems. This process took approximately\n3 months to complete and was accomplished by initially performing end-to-end checks of instruments and valve and\nswitch wiring, then individual component operation, and then complete subsystem operation and verification. A\ndetailed checkout plan was written and performed before the systems were determined to be ready to operate\ncollectively.\nSeparate from this design effort was the FT design and fabrication of the test cell hardware needed for the initial\nicing calibration and validation test. This included the remaining transition duct, which reduced the inlet diameter\n\n4\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\ndown to 36 in.; the instrumentation duct for location of the icing instrumentation; and the initial uniformity grid\nmeasurement system. The hardware was fabricated in house by the NASA GRC Fabrication Division.\nThe initial calibration of the icing system was performed in 2012.6 Although we drew on experience and\ntechniques utilized in the IRT, there were differences in the operation of the facility, which required new procedures\nand techniques to be developed. The IRT is designed to create a cloud of supercooled liquid droplets. The PSL was\ninitially designed to generate a cloud of frozen ice particles, although it has since demonstrated the capability of also\nperforming conventional icing testing. There was the new cooling air system which sprays \xe2\x80\x9340 \xc2\xb0F service air at the\nnozzle discharge to aid with droplet freeze out. Operating procedures for the system had to be developed to optimize\nits effectiveness. Initial valve tuning had to be performed to optimized control response when sprays were initiated.\nThe initial calibration was completed after 35 test periods. A cloud imaging probe (CIP) and cloud droplet probe\n(CDP) for cloud particle sizing; robust and multiwire probes for cloud water content; and a uniformity grid,\ntomography duct, and sheet laser for cloud uniformity are used to characterize the ice cloud. We calibrated the\nfacility at flight altitude conditions and ice cloud conditions that would be used for the validation test.\nThe last phase of the ice system upgrade program was an engine validation test. NASA wished to conduct a\nseries of validation tests of the new icing system, and a contractor, Honeywell, provided the test article for this\nvalidation test via a task order under the RTAPS contract. NASA would provide test time in PSL3 and Honeywell\nwould provide an ALF502-R5 engine that previously experienced power loss due to ice crystal ingestion during a\nflight test. The design of the engine has since been changed to eliminate this issue. Thus we were able to use a\nunique engine that was instrumented for icing testing and had a characterized rollback condition. Under this contract\nthe data were provided to Honeywell for use of the engine, and Government- use-only rights were provided to\nNASA for all of the data generated. The engine was installed in the PSL immediately after completion of the\ncalibration test in 2012 (Fig. 2).\nUsing spray bar settings determined for the calibration to replicate the cloud conditions experienced during a\nflight test, flight 850, the engine was successfully rolled back three times. The facility was then operated at\nconditions that the engine did not roll back during flight test, flight 855, and the engine did not roll back. An\nadditional 86 test points where roll backs were identified and 37 no roll backs test points were performed.7\n\nFigure 2. ALF502-R5 installation in PSL3.\n\n5\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nIV. Facility Modifications\nA. Design of Facility Hardware for Calibration\nThe design of the facility hardware that was required for the first calibration of the PSL Icing system was\ndesigned by one of NASA Glenn\xe2\x80\x99s in-house engineering contractors, Vantage Partners, LLC. They were given the\ntask of providing design and fabrication drawings and specifications for all of the hardware including a transition\nduct, a tomography duct, a uniformity grid, a translating table, an instrumentation duct, a camera duct, and a powder\nspray system for coating the ice on the grid during cloud uniformity calibration. These items are shown in Figs. 3\nand 4. This hardware enabled the icing researchers to gather data on the particle size, water content, and uniformity\nof the icing cloud that would be generated in PSL3 at various altitude conditions.\n\nFigure 3. Icing calibration layout.\n\nFigure 4. Icing calibration installation.\n6\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nB. Icing Calibration Hardware\nFigures 3 and 4 show the calibration hardware installed into PSL3 prior to testing. The first two pieces on the left\nare transition ducts that reduce the diameter of the air stream from the 90-in. test cell bulkhead down to the 36-in.\ninner diameter (ID) ducting of all of the downstream ducts. The next piece to the right of the transition duct is the\ncamera duct that houses the external cameras and the powder spray nozzles, followed by the tomography duct. The\nnext duct is the instrument duct that is used to house all of the icing measuring instruments including the multiwire\nprobe, robust probe, CDP, and CIP along with a cloud uniformity grid. The table at the far right was used in the\nuniformity portion of the calibration. The uniformity grid was inserted into the instrumentation duct and a\nsupercooled liquid droplet spray was turned on until a predetermined amount of ice accreted on the grid. Then\npowder was sprayed onto the ice and the table slid the duct across a plane of lasers that measured the ice buildup, all\nremotely because the test section is sealed during tests. Finally the yellow heater was turned on to melt the ice. The\ntable was then moved back into the air stream and ready for another test. Ice particle cloud uniformity was later\nverified using the sheet laser and tomography systems.\n1. Plenum Modifications\n(1) Removal of FOD screen: The inlet plenum that is upstream of the transition duct would normally contain an\ninlet bellmouth and a foreign object damage (FOD) screen that is the last form of protection for an engine during\nnormal altitude engine testing. This must be removed for all icing tests. Its removal is shown in Figs. 5 and 6. The\ninlet bellmouth and FOD screen are replaced with carbon fiber transition sections.\n\nFigure 5. FOD screen removal.\n\nFigure 6. FOD screen disassembly.\n\n7\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n(2) Carbon fiber transition panel: After the FOD screen is removed, carbon fiber panels are installed into the\nplenum to reduce the plenum diameter From ~16 ft. down to the 90-in.-diameter test cell bulkhead. These panels are\ncoated with a special conductive material that allows the surface to be grounded and reduces the chance of ice\nbuildup that may occur because of a static charge from the ice particles (Fig. 7). Two of the lower sections also\ncontain cameras for monitoring the spray bar nozzle performance during testing.\n\nFigure 7. Carbon fiber transition panel installation.\n(3) Spray bar support structure: The spray bar support structure is made from stainless steel structural tubing that\nwill support each spray bars at three locations: the center and both sides as shown in Fig. 8. It is positioned just\ndownstream of the existing plenum flow straightener. The spray bar supports are designed to be removable for\nreconfiguration of the plenum back to normal engine testing.\n\nFigure 8. Spray bar support structure.\n\n8\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n(4) Plenum penetrations for spray bar supplies: All of the subsystems that feed the 10 equally spaced spray bars\nwere fed into the plenum through several new penetrations (Fig. 9) that were made in the outer skin of the PSL3\nplenum. From the penetration the atomizing air, cooling air and spray water pipes were routed around the ID of the\nplenum behind the plenum liner before exiting at the location of the proper spray bar. Hoses made the connection\nfrom the supply system piping to the actual spray bars (Fig. 10). These allowed for ease of installation and removal\nas well as provided thermal expansion relief.\n\nFigure 9. Plenum penetration.\n\nFigure 10. Supply hoses to spray bars.\n\n2. Spray Bar Configuration\nThe 10 spray bars hold a total of 222 nozzles, 110 of the standard type and the 112 of the modified (Mod. 1) type\nthat were both developed in GRC\xe2\x80\x99s IRT (see Fig. 11). The IRT nozzles have been developed over years of testing.\nThe design, copied directly from the IRT with only minor modifications, has proven to produce a robust, repeatable\nwater-atomizing nozzle. Standard nozzles have a larger hypodermic tube with higher water flow rate capability than\nthe Mod. 1 nozzles.\n\nFigure 11. Icing spray nozzle cross section.\n\n9\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nHigh-pressure water is delivered through the center tube while lower pressure atomizing air enters the nozzle\nfrom the side, and the spray exits through the larger hole on the left.\nThe atomizing air is required to break up the larger water droplets that are formed when the high-pressure water\nexits the small tube in the center of the nozzle. This air pressure along with the correct water pressure determines the\nsize of the particles that leave the body of the nozzle.\nThe cooling air distribution manifold is located on the aft end of the spray bar, and this manifold circles the spray\nnozzle (Fig. 12). The cooling air temperature can be as low as \xe2\x80\x9340 \xc2\xb0F and is used as needed to assist with droplet\nfreeze-out by creating a local zone of cold air.\nThe 10 spray bars are primarily made out of fiberglass to allow them to be relatively lightweight (see Fig. 13).\nThe spray bar pressure controls are in three zones to account for changes in head pressure for different mounting\nheights. There are three compartments in the spray bar; the leading compartment holds all of the wires for the nozzle\nsolenoid valves, heater, and instrumentation. The center section is structurally the support for the bars, and it houses\nthe atomizing air pipes, water pipes, individual spray water solenoid valves, and nozzle holders. The aft compartment\nhouses the cooling air supply lines, cooling air nozzle, and spray nozzle. The middle and aft compartment are insulated\nand temperature monitored.\n\nFigure 12. Spray bar cross section.\n\nFigure 13. Spray bar installation in the inlet plenum.\n10\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n3. Icing Spray System Modifications\nOverall, the icing spray system worked well during the first PSL engine icing test. The system as designed\nincludes over 222 individually controlled spray nozzles that are alternated between two difference sets of nozzles,\n\xe2\x80\x9dStandard\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9dModified\xe2\x80\x9d (Mod. 1) lowflow nozzles. The main issue which required improvement was to reduce\nthe occasional frozen nozzle. This phenomenon was observed primarily when a nozzle would be used early in the\ntest run, then would not be required for a long period of time. The belief is the water which is dead-headed in the\ntube running through the solenoid and into the nozzle would freeze in place, precluding proper nozzle operation\neither by freezing in the solenoid or partially obstructing the flow path within the nozzle itself. Investigation after the\ntesting showed the spray bar heating system as designed was insufficient. This design concentrated the heat trace\nalong the water supply and return lines\xe2\x80\x94ignoring the spray bar solenoid and nozzles all together. With the nominal\noperating point calling for water to be constantly recirculated through the spray bars back to the holding tank at a\ntemperature well above freezing, it is believed there is little chance for the main water pipe to become frozen.\nThe existing heat trace was removed from the spray bars and has been replaced with a new three-zone heat trace\nsystem. One heat trace circuit is used to maintain heat on all solenoids in the spray bar. The heat trace circuit is used\nto wrap around each solenoid on the spray bar. A second heat trace circuit is used to wrap the standard nozzles, and\na third to wrap the Mod. 1 nozzles. In addition, the insulation installed in the spray bars was greatly improved. Each\nof these heat trace zones are separately monitored through multiple type T thermocouples and should enable troublefree operation of the system.\n4. Steam System\nIn a normal non-icing engine test the combustion air supplied to PSL is dried through desiccant dryer beds prior\nto being delivered to the facility. This enables the supplied combustion air line to operate as low as \xe2\x80\x9350 \xc2\xb0F without\nfreezing up the flow-straightening grid in the plenum ahead of the engine. However, in an icing environment this\nabnormally low dew point could create the situation where droplets lose volume/mass because of evaporation.\nTo mitigate this problem, the icing system design included a steam injection system. This steam injection occurs\ndownstream of the turbo-expander air coolers at the combustion air control valves (Fig. 14). This is a high\nturbulence point in the combustion air system well upstream of the flow straighteners to enable thorough mixing.\nThe desired operating point is a 50% relative humidity in the inlet plenum. This sets a dew point that remains just\nbelow the combustion air temperature to preclude ice forming on the flow straighteners while still maintaining a set\nrelative humidity in the inlet plenum.\nAs an engine operates at higher altitudes, the total mass flow of air required is greatly reduced. The steam system\nas originally designed did not sufficiently account for this dramatic reduction of mass flow required, and it had\ndifficulty maintaining a 50% relative humidity under some conditions. The steam system was modified to include a\nnew low-flow leg, which permits stable control down to 0.025 lbm/s of steam.\n\nFigure 14. Steam injection system schematic for PSL.\n11\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nAs described above, the PSL facility was designed for operation with cold dry air at altitude conditions. To\nmeasure the dew point of the provided air the facility relies upon a General Eastern dew point analyzer, which\noperates on a chilled mirror technology. This technology device is excellent for a steady-state measurement such as\nmonitoring the moisture content of the combustion air after being processed by a dryer bed whose performance\nslowly degrades over the course of a test run. The steam injection system changed this philosophy to one that\nrequires a measurement system having a much faster response. Step changes in dew point caused by the enabling or\ndisabling of steam injection overwhelms the chilled mirror system, forcing the system into a 20-min-long PACER\nmirror cleaning cycle.\nThe facility has upgraded its dew point system to include three Spectra WVSS-II atmospheric water vapor\nsensors (Fig. 15), measuring the humidity at the point prior to steam injection, prior to the spray bars and just\nupstream of the engine face. The sensors are commonly used on commercial aircraft and provide an output with an\nupdate rate as short as 2.3 s. Unlike a chilled-mirror technology system, these devices use a tunable diode laser\nabsorption spectroscopy method, which is not overwhelmed by rapid changes to the humidity of the sample.\n\nFigure 15. SpectraSensors water vapor sensor.\n5. Icing Support Systems\nFigure 16 displays the PSL icing support systems.\n\nFigure 16. PSL icing system photographs.\n\n12\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nFigure 17. Icing subsystem diagram.\nThe first of the three main icing subsystems required for ice generation is the spray water system (Fig. 17). It\nwas originally designed to supply high-pressure, cold city water to the spray bars. The spray water system has a\nmechanical chiller that can reduce the water temperature down to about 35 \xc2\xb0F before it is sent to a holding tank\nwhere batches of water-particle mix can be formulated. The water is then pressurized to 400 psig with a pair of\nwater pumps and sent to the water control manifold, which splits the water into three separately controlled pressure\nzones that feed the spray bars. The three zones are used to minimize differences in pressure at the spray nozzles\ncaused by differential water heads at the bars because of their different elevations. The water will flow through the\nspray bar and then return to the main holding tank with another set of control valves that close down when a spray\nbegins so that the supply pumps maintain a constant flow and pressure with sprays on and off. The particle injection\nportion of this system was never used because it was found that city water has an adequate concentration of particles\nthat become the nucleation sites of the ice particles. After the first engine test the researchers had requested that a\ndeionized (DI) water system be installed because the city water used during the first engine test caused a\nconsiderable amount of buildup on the test engine\xe2\x80\x99s internal parts during the test. A 100-gpm DI water system has\nbeen installed in PSL and will be used during the next calibration test. It has the capability of delivering pure DI\nwater or a blend of city water and DI as required to provide adequate particles for ice nucleation sites.\nThe atomizing air system (Fig. 17) brings in up to 2500 scfm of shop air at 120 psig, filters it, and cools it down\nto around 35 \xc2\xb0F. The air goes through a control station where a control valve reduces the pressure to meet the\nresearch test point condition requirements. There is a separate control valve for the standard nozzles and one for the\nMod. 1 nozzles, and when air is delivered to the nozzle, it goes to every standard or Mod. 1 nozzle depending on\nwhich type of nozzle is selected.\nThe cooling air system (Fig. 17) also uses the facility shop air for its source. The air is dried with a desiccant\ndryer to a dew point temperature of \xe2\x80\x9340 \xc2\xb0F, and from there it enters a heat exchanger that brings the temperature\ndown to 35 \xc2\xb0F. It then goes to a liquid nitrogen heat exchanger, which brings it down to a temperature of \xe2\x80\x9340 \xc2\xb0F\nbefore it goes to the control station behind the plenum where the pressure and flow rate are set to meet the research\nrequirements. The system has a maximum flow rate of 2500 scfm.\n6. Design and Fabrication of Facility Hardware for Validation Test\nThe calibration transition duct and tomography duct were used for the engine validation test. Downstream of\nthese ducts a new labyrinth seal was designed, fabricated, and installed. The labyrinth seal is used during tests that\nutilize a thrust stand for measurement of engine thrust and isolates the facility from the engine inlet ducting. After\n13\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nthis hardware, a new transition duct was made to increase the internal diameter from 36 to \xe2\x88\xbc40 in., which matches\nthe inlet fan flange. The other major piece of hardware that was used was the 10K thrust measurement stand.\nBefore icing tests were performed in the PSL, the primary types of video data obtained in the PSL were from\nfour cameras in the test cell for monitoring the engine and a number of cameras outside the cell positioned around\nthe facility monitoring for fuel or other leaks, and very importantly observing the aft of the engine for signs of\nsparks. Up to five of these cameras were overlayed with time code and recorded on medical-grade digital video disc\n(DVD) recorders. Engine icing has brought about a new level of importance to the observation of the engine under test.\nFor the first engine icing test a single standard National Television System Committee (NTSC) camera was used\nto observe the face of the engine. The camera was in an enclosure in the test cell peering through a window in the\nfinal section of inlet ducting (Fig. 18). Additional windows were present to provide lighting for this camera. The\ncamera was canted at an angle to permit the viewing of the inlet guide vanes and/or splitter lip between the core and\nbypass of the engine. In addition, the facility added a number of cameras to observe the operation of the spray bars\nas well as monitoring the 27:1 contraction ratio for ice accretion. The continuous observation of this video during\nicing tests demonstrated their importance.\nThe facility has committed to improving the video capability. A new 16-channel digital video recorder (DVR)\nsystem is being installed to replace the five DVD recorders, and a new 20-channel time code overlay system is\nreplacing the obsolete five-channel system. This will enable the recording by all five plenum cameras, as well as the\ntypical four-cell cameras and other special cameras that are installed for a test.\nIn addition, an eight channel 1080-pixel camera system is being installed. For the next engine icing test a new\ncamera duct is being fabricated with 16 ports to enable four engine quadrant views as well as a view of the entire\nengine face from a camera mounted dead-center on one of the spray bar supports in the inlet plenum. Additional\ncontrol room monitors are being installed as required to display these new views.\n\nFigure 18. Instrument and camera duct.\n\n14\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n7. Prototype Tomography System\nDuring the initial icing calibration a tomography duct was installed at the exit plane for cloud uniformity\nmeasurement.8 The system is nonintrusive and can be used for real time monitoring of spray bar performance and\ncloud uniformity (Fig. 19).\nThis advanced instrumentation was used for an in-situ measurement utilizing equally spaced laser diodes and\nreceivers around the circumference of the duct. The system was utilized in conjunction with the sheet laser and\nuniformity grid with good correlation. The system demonstrated the ability to diagnose abnormal performance of the\nspray bars such as leaking nozzles, which were deliberately turned on at low flow rates (see Fig. 20). Another\nabnormal operation is two nozzles becoming inoperative during testing. This was also simulated and diagnosed\nusing the tomography system as shown in Fig. 21.\n\nFigure 19.

COBRA Data System\nFor decades the steady-state data system at GRC has been ESCORT. ESCORT is a system based around Neff\n400/470/600 A/D (analog/digital) systems which are now 30+ years old. Neff itself is out of business. The system\nruns on HP/DEC Alpha computers running VMS, which are at least 15 years old and whose maintenance and repair\nservices are now no longer available. The system architecture is central bus, which does not take advantage of\nmodern computing systems or operating system (OS) designs. There is no ability for multicore, multithreading, or\ndistributed processing.\nThe ESCORT system limits are similarly being pushed to the limit with every successive test in the PSL. There\nis a maximum of only 2000 input channels, 8000 calculations, and only 16 display screens. The system\nconfiguration is through ASCII configuration files, and the system operates on a command line interface.\nThe PSL is expecting to receive one of the first new COBRA data systems that will replace ESCORT. This\nsystem (Fig. 22) is designed around standard commercial hardware including personal computers (PCs), switches,\ndata storage, and multiple vendors of A/D converters. It will utilize commercial and open-source software running\non multiple OS including Windows and Linux and will be capable of processing data with multiple programming\nlanguages. It is designed to be scalable in the number of displays, calculators, subsystems, and analog channels. The\nsystem will be completely configurable through an online interface. COBRA will effectively be both a steady-state\nand medium-speed data system offering multiple data acquisition rates of 12.5, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, and 800\nsamples per second with digital signal processing and anti-aliasing. The maximum of display stations will be\ndoubled to 32.\n\nFigure 22. COBRA data system.\n2. Ovation System\nIn the early 1990s a Westinghouse Distributed Process Family (WDPF) control system was installed in the PSL.\nThe facility subsystems utilized almost 300 control sheets, which were spread across seven data processing units\n(DPUs). In the early 2000s, WDPF evolved into the Emerson Ovation product line. The PSL facility control system\nwas upgraded to Ovation 2.2, running OCR-161 processors operating on AutoCAD-developed control sheets with\nWindows 2000 engineering stations and operator stations utilizing Windows NT servers, while retaining the WDPF\nQ-line I/O (input/output) cards.\n\n16\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nThe icing system would require a significant expansion of the control system. The decision was made to break\naway from the use of 20-year-old Q-line I/O cards and augment the system with multiple remote drops near the new\nsubsystems using the current line of Ovation I/O cards (see Fig. 23). The use of the current Ovation I/O cards\nrequired an upgrade of the control system to at least v3.0. Emerson has a process called Evergreen for the migration\nof older WDPF or Ovation systems to the up-to-date versions of Ovation. In 2010, the PSL performed a partial\nupgrade to Ovation v3.3.1. This upgrade included modern OCR400 controllers, migrating the control sheets from\nWDPF-era AutoCAD-based to Ovation E-CAD, and man-machine interface (MMI)/PC upgrades to Windows XP\nand Windows Server 2003 and 2008. With the changeover of control sheets a complete facility integrated system\ntest of all subsystems was performed. This nearly 500-page-long, 8-week task culminated in a cold pipe test to fully\ncertify that the facility was completely functional after the control system change.\nTwo remote drops were added to the PSL Distributed control system (DCS), one for analog signals and one for\ndiscrete signals. With the vast improvements in processor capability over the 20 years since the system was\noriginally designed, these remote drops were added to a single processor, DPU 7. As part of a simultaneous DCS\nexpansion, controls for two facility heater engines were moved to a remote drop off DPU 8, relieving DPU 7 of any\ntasks associated with operating one of those engines. The icing system alone requires 300 control sheets, which\nexceeds the total number of control sheets required to operate the facility prior to the installation of the icing or\nheater engine controls. The end-to-end checks of all signals, subsystem checkouts, and integrated system testing of\nthe icing system culminating in a series of validation test runs was completed in 2012.\nAn image of the PSL Ovation DCS topology is presented in Fig. 23.\n\nFigure 23. Ovation I/O diagram.\n\n17\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nThe MMI of the facility DCS utilizes schematic-like drawings that generally reflect piping and instrumentation\ndiagrams (Figs. 24 and 25). Control screens were created for each individual subsystem, spray bar nozzle control,\nannunciation (see Fig. 26), trending of spray bar pressures, and an overall icing system control display. The control\nscreen expansion was made in the style of the existing facility screens to ensure a familial experience for the facility\noperators, with popup windows at the bottom of the screen for control actions.\n\nFigure 24. Ovation MMI screen, pump and valve control.\n\nFigure 25. Ovation MMI screen, spray bar water regulator controls.\n\n18\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nFigure 26. Ovation icing annunciators.\n\nFigure 27. Ovation spray bar solenoid controls.\nThe spray bar control system (Fig. 27) permits the operator to select individual modules from eight\nprogrammable patterns. The pattern can be programmed to manually start and stop, or it can be programmed to\nspray for a predetermined length of time. The pattern can be modified on the fly as required by selecting or\ndeselecting nozzles. The spray can also be aborted on demand.\nIn 2018 Emerson will drop the SureService support program for the WDPF Q-line I/O cards. The current plan is\nto initiate another Evergreen process in 2015 with a further upgrade to Ovation 3.5 and replace all remaining Q-line\ncards with current Ovation I/O cards. This change of I/O cards can be accomplished without any modifications to\n19\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nfield wiring, though the facility will be required to perform a complete end-to-end check of all signals and repeat the\nfull integrated systems test before returning to testing.\n3. Ovation to ESCORT Data Transfer\nDuring operation of any aeronautical facility at NASA GRC, the practice is to not have the facility control\nsystem rely upon data acquired from the data system. The control system should be able to operate the facility\nwithout the data system being in scan. However, the reverse is not always true. Even though the Ovation system\ndoes have a Historian, which tracks and permits the recall of virtually every parameter in the system, it can be useful\nto integrate some of this data with the dataset acquired on the ESCORT steady-state data system. One must\nrecognize that although the ESCORT data system is the data system of record and all of its measurements are\ntraceable, the facility control system is not held to that standard. Ovation permits the use of OPC (object linking and\nembedding for process control) for the transmitting of points to other systems. In the case of the PSL, approximately\n100 points are routinely sent to the ESCORT system for inclusion in the data set. The routinely included parameters\nare pressures, temperatures and valve positions from combustion air, auxiliary air, exhaust, fuel, cooling tower\nwater, and hydraulic systems. During an icing test this OPC transfer list is doubled to include salient parameters\nfrom the icing system including pressures and temperatures from air, water, and spray bar and chiller systems as\nwell as status from each of the spray nozzles.\n4. Auto Run Log\nThe Auto Run Log system (Fig. 28) was originally designed for test conductors. Test conductors spent a\nconsiderable amount of their time writing down the critical test parameters for every test point to be used as an index\nfor locating the points in the future. In addition the test conductor is expected to log observations on each point,\nobservations which are not necessarily tied to a point, and actually keep overall awareness for the safety of the\npersonnel, facility, and the article under test. Experience has shown that testing efficiency is largely dependent on\nthe speed of the test conductor.\nThe Auto Run Log was designed to help ease the burden on test conductors by permitting the entry of\nobservations for each data point taken without the need to laboriously log the numerous critical parameters. The use\ncan configure the logger to fill in any of the data tags in the system. A new entry is created with each data system\npoint taken, or on demand by the user. All of the desired parameters requested by the user would be filled in by the\nsystem for each observation or reading as an example, for a typical engine test this would include Time, Date,\nReading Number, P0, P2, Altitude, Mach number, N1, N2, and EGT. The automatic logging of the numerous\nparameters greatly facilitates the active monitoring of the test, improved communication to the facility operators,\nand overall \xe2\x80\x9dheads up\xe2\x80\x9d testing.\n\nFigure 28.

Digital Temperature Scanner System\nPSL is transitioning from 1960s vintage ovens to a digital temperature scanner system. The Scanivalve\nDTS3250/64Tx thermocouple scanners (Fig. 29) provide for 64-channel thermocouple measurements. The first four\nunits installed in PSL3 were used to augment the temperature measurement capability of the test cell, increasing the\navailable customer channel count over 500 thermocouples. A similar upgrade is also underway in the companion\nPSL4.\n\nFigure 29. Scanivalve DTS module wiring.\nNear-term plans include replacing the ten 48-channel ovens with eight 64-channel scanners in both PSL3 and\nPSL4.\nThis is just part of the first phase of a $4M plan to roll out large numbers of these systems, replacing all ovens\nand uniform temperature reference (UTR) block measurement devices with scanners over the next several years.\nThe advantage of these units is the elimination of copper wiring and associated patch board contacts required with\nan oven or UTR as well as the reduction of A/D channels required by the next-generation data system.\n\nV. Conclusion\nThe PSL has successfully added an engine altitude icing capability to PSL3 and has performed its inaugural test\nprogram. We have successfully calibrated our icing system and demonstrated we can simulate the icing conditions\nthat caused the ALF502-R5 engine to roll back in flight test.\nSubsequent to this first test program we have implemented several enhancements which should improve the\ncapabilities of the system. We have added a low flow steam line, improved water vapor measurement system,\nimproved spray bar heater and temperature measurements, and a de-ionized water system.\nThe PSL has a unique capability of being able to be used for simulated altitude icing studies and has been\ndesigned to offer a wide range of flight conditions and cloud properties. It would be a valuable resource to use for\nparametric studies of icing sensitivity without the risk or variability of a flight campaign.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis facility enhancement effort was funded by NASA AEST, and ATP programs.
