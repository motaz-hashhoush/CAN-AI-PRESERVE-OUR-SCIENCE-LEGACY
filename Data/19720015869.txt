It is the intent to utilize this parameter, as measured by\nthe onboard radar altimeter, for an improved determination of\nthe earth\'s gravitational field and for the determination of the\nvariation of the physical surface of the oceans.\nTwo tracking system approaches to accurately determine\nthe spacecraft height (orbit) are described and their results\nstated. These are satellite-to-satellite tracking (SST) and\nground-laser tracking (GLT). Height variations can be observed in the dm-regions using SST and in the m-region using\n\npresent GLT.\n\niii\n\nCONTENTS\nPage\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION .............................................\n\n11.\n\nATS-F AND GEOS-C SATELLITE-TO-SATELLITE\n\n1\n\nTRACKING..\n\nIII.\n\nGEOS-C LASER GROUND TRACKING .........................\n\nIV.\n\nREFERENCES ...............................................\n\nv\n\n2\n\n3\n\n5\n\nSATELLITE HEIGHT DETERMINATION USING\nSATE LLITE- TO-SATELLITE TRACKING AND\nGROUND LASER SYSTEMS\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe GEOS-C spacecraft will be the first one to make a connection between\nthe National Geodetic Satellite Program and hopefully a new program, namely\nthe Earth and Ocean Dynamics Satellite Applications Program.\nThe major difference between GEOS-C and the two previous spacecraft,\nGEOS-A and -B, is that this one carries a radar altimeter and a satellite-tosatellite tracking system.\' Both are major experiments needed for future applications programs in the area of earth and ocean dynamics.2\nAltimeter data with errors of, say, \xc2\xb13 to \xc2\xb15 m will be used for a more\nrigorous analysis, as done in the past, of the earth gravity field and the variations of the physical surface of the sea (gravity anomalies, geostrophic equilibrium of the sea, wind loading, storm surges, etc.). One of the main advantages\nof height information for orbit and thus gravity field analysis is the large number\nof data points obtainable (2 per second), their high accuracy and extremely good\nalong track distribution. For the determination of the ocean height and its variations, the altimeter is at present the only capable instrument.\nAs is the case for all measurements made, a zero adjustment or an initial\ncalibration will have to be performed by each of the pertinent experimenters.\nThe SST and GLT for altimeter calibration and along track evaluation will be\nbriefly discussed.\n\n1\n\nII.\n\nATS-F AND GEOS-C SATELLITE-TO-SATELLITE\n\nTRACKING\n\nThe ATS-F spacecraft will track, as shown in Figure 1, the GEOS-C using\na 2000 MHz SST which measures range and range rate sums.\' With such a\nsystem, the orbits of ATS-F and GEOS-C can be determined simultaneously\nwith a high degree of accuracy. In addition, after an initial independent determination of the GEOS-C height (using, say, a radar, or a laser ground or shipborne station), the SST will be able to "follow" the GEOS-C spacecraft in a\nphase-locked fashion over half the earth. Thus a constant "watch" can be kept\non the altimeter independent of any ground support. This is important if the\nheight is to be used to check the variation of the physical surface of the ocean,\nsay from the U.S. to Europe. The SST, as presently configured, should be able\nto "detect" satellite height variations in the submeter level, Figure 2. Please\nnote that only systems errors are included which are of primary importance at\nthis time. It is clear that these system errors have to be smaller by a factor\nof 5 to 10 as compared to those expected from the eventual experiments.\nFigure 3 shows the height differences of GEOS-C orbit due to different\ngravity fields as used in present day accurate orbit determination. The fields\nused are the NWL and the SAO fields.3 4 Variations in the order of tens of\nmeters do occur. Improvements made in the mean time may reduce these\nvalues by a factor of 3 to 5. Nevertheless this indicates that for the GEOS-C,\nat least at the beginning of the flight evaluation period, only relative height\nvariations in the submeter level will be detectable.5 In other words, one can\nonly determine these variations consistent with one particular gravity field used\nin the orbit determination process.\nThese considerations do not hold for the variation of the physical sea surface. A trench (5 to 10 m over 100 to 200 km) can and will be fairly easy to\ndetect. This holds true for other variations in the height of the ocean surface\n(tides, storm surges). Figure 4 shows a mathematically simplified trench profile (Puerto Rico trench) and the expected height variations (Ah = 15 m, Ah =\n1.6 m/s). 1 Since the satellite orbit will certainly not follow this kind of a profile and the altimeter can be "watched" from the ATS for any eventual drifts,\nsuch profiles should be fairly easy detectable with the GEOS-C altimeter system\nas configured.\nThe contribution of the SST to the analysis of the gravity field, and in particular to the determination of anomalies, is out of the content of this paper and\nis discussed in references 5, 6 and 7.\n\n2\n\nIII. GEOS-C LASER GROUND TRACKING\nIn addition to the SST approach, precision GLT systems will be used as an\nadditional method of determining the "real" height of the GEOS-C spacecraft\nindependent of the dynamics of the orbit.\nAs shown in Figure 5, three precision ground laser stations are planned to\nbe used in the Caribbean area. The stations will be near the sea (for ease of\nlevel determination) at Key West, Canal Zone, and Antigua to form a good three\ndimensional triangle (station distances commensurate with satellite height) of\nnear optimum conditions. It is assumed that the uncertainty of the sea surface\nover this area is approximately two meters. Using these three stations, the\nheight of the spacecraft can be determined completely independent of the orbital\ndynamics earth gravity field and its rather large uncertainties, as shown in\nFigure 3. Figure 6 depicts the height errors of the spacecraft as a function of\nthe ground track.8 Please see also for comparison Figure 5 showing the ground\ntrack and the position of the spacecraft (time ticks) relative to the three ground\nstations. It can be seen (Figure 6) that over a rather large subsatellite track\n(500 to 1000 km), the spacecraft height can be determined with these laser systems to within two to three meters. Please note that this assumes that the relative errors are \xc2\xb15 to 10 m in longitude and latitude, and +2 m in height for Key\nWest and Antigua and zero (arbitrary reference) for the Canal Zone.\nThe present (10 cm in the future) tracking system\'s capabilities of 30 cm\n(noise, bias) of the laser systems are far below the errors considered, so they\ndo not constitute a limit. On the contrary, they enable one to determine relative\nintersite distances from 30 to 50 cm. This result was obtained during the recent\nGoddard Polar Motion Experiment as reported in reference 9. Thus, the errors\nof five meters, as shown in Figure 6, for the error of the intersite distances\ncan be reduced considerably by the method used for the Polar Motion Experiment\nwhich in turn will reduce the depicted height errors. This, of course, assumes\nthat the problems associated with the reflection from the sea surface have been\nsolved to a compatible accuracy.\nOne more hurdle to overcome is the unknown in the variation in the mean\nsea surface. For this purpose, a tracking ship located at or near the ground\ntrack will have to be used, as shown in Figure 7. Figure 8 depicts the dependency of the height error on the ship\'s position (across track). As can be seen,\nno accurate navigation is needed. That is, a 400 m or 600 m ship\'s position\nerror is quite tolerable under the conditions stated above.\n\n3\n\nIn conclusion it can be stated: Both methods, the SST as well as the GLT\ncan be used, under the conditions stated, to determine the height of the GEOS-C\nspacecraft with errors commensurate of the radar altimeter. It should be noted\nthat both methods are rather independent of the final choice of the orbit.\n\n4\n\nRE FERE NCES\n\nvon Bun, F. O., "Geodetic Satellite Mission and GEOS-C Spacecraft", Space\nRes.
