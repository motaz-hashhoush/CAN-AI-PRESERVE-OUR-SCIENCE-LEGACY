To meet the five-year mission lifetime goal, a single transmitter would accumulate over 6.3 billion shots. Cr(4+):YAG is a promising candidate material for passively Q-switching the laser. Historically, the performance of saturable absorbers has degraded over long-duration usage. To measure the multi-billion shot performance of Cr(4+):YAG, a passively Q-switched GLAS-like oscillator was tested at an accelerated repetition rate of 500 Hz. The intracavity fluence was calculated to be approximately 2.5 J/cm(exp 2). The laser was monitored autonomously for 165 days. There was no evidence of change in the material optical properties during the 7.2 billion shot test.. All observed changes in laser operation could be attributed to pump laser diode aging. This is the first demonstration of multi-billion shot exposure testing of Cr(4+):YAG in this pulse energy regime", "title": "Multi-Billion Shot, High-Fluence Exposure of Cr(4+): YAG Passive Q-Switch", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T22:53:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19980237419, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Stephen, Mark A."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD United States"}}, "id": "1d3fb6666a014e979cbf2f5c88b254de"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19980237419, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Dallas, Joseph L."}, "organization": {"name": "Science Systems and Applications, Inc.", "location": "Lanham, MD United States"}}, "id": "1efa20614d8b44b482e20b6296553f2c"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19980237419, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Afzal, Robert S."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD United States"}}, "id": "b08e18b225784dcaa657ac907b4b104b"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19980237419, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19980237419, "id": "a1d26a64826149309b7de016d945ea4b", "publicationName": "Laser-Induced Damage in Optical Materials", "publicationDate": "1997-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19980237419.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19980237419/downloads/19980237419.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19980237419/downloads/19980237419.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19980237419/downloads/19980237419.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
