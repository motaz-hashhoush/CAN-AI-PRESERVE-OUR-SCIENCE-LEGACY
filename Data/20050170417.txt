b"Heart Pump Design for\nCleveland Clinic\nFoundation\nSketch of Lewis/Cleveland Clinic Foundation heart pump\nshowing placement.\n\nThrough a Lewis CommTech Program project with the\nCleveland Clinic Foundation, the NASA Lewis Research\nCenter is playing a key role in the design and development\nof a permanently implantable, artificial heart pump assist\ndevice. Known as the Innovative Ventricular Assist System\n(IVAS), this device will take on the pumping role of the\ndamaged left ventricle of the heart. The key part of the IVAS is a nonpulsatile (continuous\nflow) artificial heart pump with centrifugal impeller blades, driven by an electric motor.\nLewis is part of an industry and academia team, led by the Ohio Aerospace Institute\n(OAI), that is working with the Cleveland Clinic Foundation to make IVAS a reality. This\ndevice has the potential to save tens of thousands of lives each year, since 80 percent of\nheart attack victims suffer irreversible damage to the left ventricle, the part of the heart\nthat does most of the pumping.\n\nPhoto of Lewis/Cleveland Clinic Foundation heart pump.\nImpeller blade design codes and flow-modeling analytical codes will be used in the project.\nThese codes were developed at Lewis for the aerospace industry but will be applicable to\nthe IVAS design project. The analytical codes, which currently simulate the flow through\nthe compressor and pump systems, will be used to simulate the flow within the blood\npump in the artificial heart assist device. The Interdisciplinary Technology Office heads up\n\nLewis' efforts in the IVAS project. With the aid of numerical modeling, the blood pump\nwill address many design issues, including some fluid-dynamic design considerations that\nare unique to the properties of blood. Some of the issues that will be addressed in the\ndesign process include hemolysis, deposition, recirculation, pump efficiency, rotor thrust\nbalance, and bearing lubrication. Optimum pumping system performance will be achieved\nby modeling all the interactions between the pump components. The interactions can be\nmultidisciplinary and, therefore, are influenced not only by the fluid dynamics of adjacent\ncomponents but also by thermal and structural effects.\nLewis-developed flow-modeling codes to be used in the pump simulations will include a\none-dimensional code (ref. 1) and an incompressible three-dimensional Navier-Stokes flow\ncode (ref. 2). These codes will analyze the prototype pump designed by the Cleveland\nClinic Foundation. With an improved understanding of the flow phenomena within the\nprototype pump, design changes to improve the performance of the pump system can be\nverified by computer prior to fabrication in order to reduce risks. The use of Lewis flow\nmodeling codes during the design and development process will improve pump system\nperformance and reduce the number of prototypes built in the development phase.\nThe first phase of the IVAS project is to fully develop the prototype in a laboratory\nenvironment that uses a water/glycerin mixture as the surrogate fluid to simulate blood. A\nlater phase of the project will include testing in animals for final validation. Lewis will be\ninvolved in the IVAS project for 3 to 5 years.\n\nReferences\n1.
