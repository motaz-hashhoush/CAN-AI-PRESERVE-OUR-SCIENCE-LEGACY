Yet, the ability to identify remnants of earliest life is critical to our understanding of the timing of life's origin on earth, the nature of earliest terrestrial life, and recognition of potential remnants of microbial life that might occur in extraterrestrial materials. The search for earliest life on Earth now extends to early Archean organic remains; these tend to be very poorly preserved and considerably more difficult to interpret than the delicately permineralized microfossils known from many Proterozoic deposits. Thus, recent efforts have been directed toward finding biosignatures that can help distinguish fragmentary remnants of ancient microbes from either pseudofossils or abiotic organic materials that may have formed hydrothermally or in extraterrestrial processes (House et al., 2000; Boyce et al., 2001; Kudryavtsev et al., 2001; Schopf, 2002; Schopf et al., 2002, 2005a,b; Cady et al., 2003; Garc a-Ruiz et al., 2003; Hofmann, 2004; Brasier et al., 2005; Rushdi and Simoneit, 2005; Skrzypczak et al., 2005). An exciting area of biosignature research involves the developing technology of NanoSIMS. NanoSIMS is secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) for ultrafine feature, elemental and isotopic analysis. Its resolution approaches 0.05 micrometers for element mapping, which is 10-50 times finer than that attainable with conventional SIMS or electron microprobes. Consequently, NanoSIMS has the potential to reveal previously unknown, chemical and structural characteristics of organic matter preserved in geologic materials. Robert et al. (2005) were the first to combine NanoSIMS element maps with optical microscopic imagery in an effort to develop a new method for assessing biogenicity. They showed that the ability to simultaneously map the distribution of organic elements [such as carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and sulfur (S)] and compare those element distributions with optically recognizable, cellularly preserved fossils could provide significant new insights into the origin of organic materials in ancient sediments. This chapter details a recent NanoSIMS study which was designed to acquire new data relevant to establishing critical biosignatures (Oehler et al., 2006a-c). In this study, NanoSIMS was used to characterize element distributions of spheroidal and filamentous microfossils and associated organic laminae in chert from the approx. 0.85 billion year old (Ga) Bitter Springs Formation of Australia. Previous work established preservation of a diverse microbiota in the Bitter Springs Formation (Schopf, 1968; Schopf and Blacic, 1971), and there is no dispute within the scientific community regarding the biogenicity of any of the Bitter Springs structures evaluated in this new study. Thus, the NanoSIMS results described below provide new insight into - and can be used as a guide for assessing - the origin of less well understood organic materials that may occur in early Archean samples and in meteorites or other extraterrestrial samples.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20070016053, "id": "0a006bfecbe34c92a2559d2c4f2cf195", "publicationDate": "2007-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20070016053.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20070016053/downloads/20070016053.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20070016053/downloads/20070016053.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20070016053/downloads/20070016053.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
