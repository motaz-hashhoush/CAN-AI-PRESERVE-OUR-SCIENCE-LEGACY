From the NASA Mariner 10\nflybys, in 1974 and 1975, ~45% of the planet was\nimaged, its magnetic field was detected, H, He, and O\nin the exosphere were measured, and other physical\ncharacteristics of the planet were determined [e.g., 2].\nDespite these data, much information about Mercury\nstill had to be inferred. It was over 30 years before\nMESSENGER provided the first in-depth study of the\ninnermost planet. Orbiting Mercury from 2011 to 2015,\nthe MESSENGER spacecraft was able to image the\nentirety of the planet and thus provide the first global\nview of Mercury. Coupling multispectral images with\ndata from MESSENGER geochemical instruments, we\nhave developed a better understanding of the\ngeochemical terranes on the planet and the unique\nnature of Mercury\xe2\x80\x99s composition compared to the other\nterrestrial planets [e.g., 3]. MESSENGER also provided\ndata that have led to great advancements in\nunderstanding the internal structure, exosphere, and\nmagnetosphere of Mercury [e.g., 4]. The treasure trove\nof MESSENGER data reveal Mercury as a geochemical\nend-member among the terrestrial planets. However, we\nare left with many questions that can only be answered\nwith further exploration.\nPresent Exploration of Mercury: Launched on\nOctober 20, 2018, the joint ESA/JAXA dual-orbiter\nBepiColombo mission is due to arrive at Mercury in\nDecember 2025 [5]. The Mercury Planetary Orbiter is\nset to study the surface and the internal composition of\nthe planet. The other orbiter, Mio, will study Mercury\xe2\x80\x99s\nmagnetosphere. Combined, these two spacecraft will\nprovide insight into the origin and evolution of Mercury,\nby conducting a global characterization of the planet\nand investigating its interior, surface, exosphere and\nmagnetosphere [5]. BepiColombo will build upon the\nlegacy of MESSENGER by advancing our\nunderstanding of the planet's magnetic field, volcanic\nactivity, permanently shadowed craters, the planet's\nglobal contraction, unique surface features like hollows,\nthe origin of the carbon component of the planet's crust,\nits dynamic magnetosphere, and the evolution of its\nexosphere.\n\nFuture Exploration of Mercury: Despite the\ninflux of data from the Mariner 10 and MESSENGER\nspacecraft and the much-anticipated data that will be\ncollected by BepiColombo, there is a limit to their\nscientific return. While orbiters could still provide finer\nvaluable context, they cannot directly sample surface\nmaterials, nor probe the interior as a landed mission can.\nFurthermore, an orbiter cannot retrieve a sample to be\nsent to Earth for laboratory-based analyses. Currently,\nthere is no Mercury mission in the planning stages to\nfollow BepiColombo. Here, we advocate for the future\nexploration of Mercury through landed science and\nsample retrieval.\nLanded Science. There are several major aspects of\nMercury\xe2\x80\x99s character and evolution where substantial\nknowledge gaps exist but where our current\nunderstanding would be dramatically improved with\ndata acquired from the planet\xe2\x80\x99s surface via landed\ninstruments. Specifically, our view of the planet\xe2\x80\x99s\ngeochemical makeup, its interior structure, geological\nevolution, and present-day processes at work there, as\nwell as the planet\xe2\x80\x99s polar volatile inventory, would be\nsubstantially advanced by landed measurements [6]. In\nsitu compositional and petrological observations would\nimprove our knowledge of the nature, origin, and\nabundance of Mercury\xe2\x80\x99s low-reflectance material, the\nmineralogy of the planet\xe2\x80\x99s varied surface materials, and\nthe composition of diffuse deposits interpreted to be\npyroclastic in nature. A seismometer, heat-flow probe,\nand magnetometer on a lander would robustly\ncharacterize the interior structure of the planet, the\npresent-day level of seismicity, pertinent heat flow\nrelated to the core dynamo, and the electrical and\nthermal conductivity structure of the crust and mantle.\nIn situ geochronological measurements of the surface\nmaterials and investigations of the remnant\nmagnetization would provide additional information\nregarding the age of materials on Mercury\xe2\x80\x99s surface,\nsurface geological processes and evolution, and the\nhistory of interior melt production and dynamo\ngeneration, as well as crucial calibration of impact flux\nin the inner Solar System. Furthermore, in situ imaging\nof the surface would return key data on the regolith\nproperties such as grain size, shape, and mechanical\nstrength. In addition, a lander on the surface of Mercury\nwould have the unique opportunity to provide in situ\n\nmeasurements to understand the origin and composition\nof the volatile compounds within Mercury\xe2\x80\x99s polar\ndeposits, the purity of the ice in these deposits, as well\nas the physical and mechanical properties of the\nvolatiles, such as volume, grain size, strength, thickness,\nand evidence for layering.\n\nFigure 1.

Although the data from remotesensing and in-situ analysis missions provide a wealth\nof knowledge regarding the physical and chemical\ncharacteristics of a planetary body, there are critical\nscience questions that can only be fully addressed via\nexamination of a sample in Earth-based laboratories,\nwhere sustained, highly sensitive analytical\nmeasurements are possible. The exact mineralogy of a\nMercury sample could be fully characterized, yielding\ninsight into trace element abundances, isotopic ratios,\nmineralogy, and petrology at microscopic levels. The\npresence or absence of key mineral phases (e.g., Simetal and graphite) would directly test published\nhypotheses for the history of Mercury and lend insight\ninto the early evolution of the planet. Additionally,\nradiometric dating of a sample would place\nunprecedented constraints not only on the various\ngeologic features across the surface of the planet but on\nthe inner Solar System impact flux itself. Further,\nMercury has been likened to some exoplanets in terms\nof the highly reducing conditions under which it formed.\nTherefore, examination of a sample from Mercury\nwould lend insight into the formation and evolution of\nsmall, iron-rich rocky planets in general. Lastly, as\ndemonstrated by ongoing analysis of Apollo lunar\nsamples, a sample from Mercury would be an invaluable\nscientific resource for decades to come, with ever more\nsophisticated tools brought to bear as they become\navailable.\nPotential Sites. Although there are legions of\nlocations for future exploration of Mercury, a few\nparticularly useful sites for advancing our\nunderstanding of the planet include the Rachmaninoff\nBasin (Figure 1), the polar deposits, and an ancient lowreflectance material (LRM) deposit. A lander and/or\nsample retrieval from these locations would be able to\n\nanswer key scientific questions including: What is the\ncomposition of Mercury\xe2\x80\x99s oldest crust? How does this\nmaterial compare with the other terrestrial planets? How\nold is the crust of Mercury? What were the conditions\nduring Mercury\xe2\x80\x99s core formation? What are the\ndominant volatile species associated with pyroclastic\neruptions and polar deposits? What are the major, trace,\nand rare earth element compositions of these various\ndeposits? What is the mineralogy and petrology\nassociated with pyroclastic, polar ice, and LRM\ndeposits? What are the radiometric ages of these\ndeposits? How pure is the ice in these deposits?\nChallenges. Despite strong scientific promise, the\nlanded exploration of Mercury and the delivery to Earth\nof a sample of the planet for laboratory analyses would\nbe a substantial undertaking. One of the main concerns,\nand perhaps the greatest challenge, is the large amount\nof launch energy and \xe2\x88\x86V required for both reaching\nMercury and landing on its surface [7]. Furthermore, the\nthermal environment that a lander must endure will need\nto be carefully considered. The large fluctuation in\ntemperature on Mercury is challenging for the longevity\nof the instruments. Regardless, the sending of any\nlanded mission to Mercury must include consideration\nof the diversity of materials present on the surface.\nSimilarly, the size of any retrieved sample should be\nsufficiently large that some of the materials can be\npreserved for future analysis when technology has far\nexceeded our current abilities.\nConclusion: To ensure the continued exploration of\nthe Sun\xe2\x80\x99s closest planetary neighbor, development of\nmission concepts need to begin now. The planned\nseven-year cruise of the BepiColombo mission,\ncomparable to some outer Solar System missions,\nreflects the difficulty in reaching the innermost planet,\nhence time is of the essence. Landed instruments and\nsample retrieval from Mercury would lead to\ntransformative Solar System science that places new\nand vital constraints on the building blocks and\nthermochemical evolution of Mercury and the other\nterrestrial planets. Any delay in the planning and\nexecution of missions to follow BepiColombo will be a\ndetriment to our exploration and understanding of\nenigmatic Mercury.\nReferences: [1] Solomon, S.C., et al., (2001) PSS 49:\n1445\xe2\x80\x931465.
