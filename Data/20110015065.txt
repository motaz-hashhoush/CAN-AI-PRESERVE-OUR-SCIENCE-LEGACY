When you do, you will\nnotice some letters and numbers etched\nor inscribed on it. All NASA parts have\nidentification, usually expressed in terms\nof part number, serial number, and the\nlike. In most cases, this identification is\npermanently marked directly on the part\nfor tracking throughout its life cycle. The\nrecently approved NASA Technical Standard 6002 and Handbook 6003 (found at\n\nhttp://standards.nasa.gov) added the matrix symbol to the identification scheme\nas shown in Figure 1. This put a checkerboard bar code on the part so that an optical scanner could read it. The intent\nwas to make tracking parts as easy as\nchecking out at the grocery store. The\nsystem works well as long as the matrix\nsymbol is visible.\nBut what if the matrix symbol identification gets covered with paint or a\n\nFigure 1. A Space Shuttle Component shows matrix symbol identification markings.\n\nsimilar coating? NASA has developed a\nmethod for reading the matrix symbol\nthrough up to 15 mils (25 \xce\xbcm) of paint\n(5 or 6 layers). This method of part\nidentification involves coating selected\npatches on the objects with magnetic\nmaterials in matrix symbol patterns\nand reading the patterns by use of magneto-optical imaging equipment. The\nhand-held magnetic scanner, shown in\nFigure 2, is easy to use and is commercially available through a NASA licensee. It decodes the matrix symbol\njust like any other scanner. The magnetic marks can be read under conditions that would render optical methods useless. For example, the magnetic\nscanner can read magnetic marks in\nthe dark or under bright ambient light\nthat might interfere with optical reading of visible marks, symbols that are\nobscured by discoloration or contamination, in addition to symbols that are\ncovered by paint. Furthermore, inasmuch as magnetic marks can be hidden from unaided view, they are less\nlikely to be deliberately damaged or destroyed. They can even be hidden deliberately for security reasons.\nMagnetic material can be applied as\nviscous ink or paste and even can be\n\nFigure 2. This Hand-Held Scanner would contain all the equipment (except a source of electric power) needed to read and decode magnetic matrix symbols.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2005\n\n5\n\nmixed with spray paint. The magnetic\nmaterial should be one of high retentivity and high coercivity. The matrix symbol pattern can be defined by use of a\nstencil, or recesses to hold the magnetic\nmaterial in the matrix symbol pattern\ncan be formed by laser engraving, machine engraving, micro-abrasive blasting, laser etching, or any other suitable\nmarking method. If the magnetic material as applied is not magnetized\nstrongly enough to enable reliable detection over time, it can be magnetized\nagain by use of a permanent magnet or\nelectromagnet.\n\nBar codes were seldom seen before\n1975 but are now common in every commercial outlet. They are on tags and labels of virtually every product. Likewise,\ndirect part marking is now being popularized for tracking things that cannot be labeled. NASA tracks parts using direct part\nmarking. The Department of Defense revised MIL STD 130 to include matrix symbols for direct part marking, and the automotive industry now complies with its\nB-17 specification for application of matrix symbols on many automobile parts.\nNow all those little marks that get covered\nwith paint, whether they are on your auto-\n\nmobile, jet fighter, weapon, or space shuttle, can be read with ease.\nThis work was done by Harry F. Schramm\nand Clyde S. Jones of Marshall Space Flight\nCenter; Donald L Roxby and James D. Teed\nof Rockwell International Corp.; and\nWilliam C. L. Shih, Gerald L.

Such adverse channel effects are\ntypical of data communications between\nmobile units or between mobile and stationary units (e.g., telemetric transmissions from aircraft to ground stations).\nThe proposed system incorporates novel\nsignal processing techniques intended to\nreduce the losses associated with adverse\nchannel effects while maintaining compatibility with the high-speed physical layer\nspecifications defined for wireless localarea networks (LANs) as the standard\n\n802.11a of the Institute of Electrical and\nElectronics Engineers (IEEE 802.11a).\nOFDM is a multi-carrier modulation\ntechnique that is widely used for wireless\ntransmission of data in LANs and in metropolitan area networks (MANs). OFDM\nhas been adopted in IEEE 802.11a and\nsome other industry standards because it\naffords robust performance under frequency-selective fading. However, its intrinsic frequency-diversity feature is\nhighly sensitive to synchronization errors; this sensitivity poses a challenge to\npreserve coherence between the component subcarriers of an OFDM system in\norder to avoid intercarrier interference\nin the presence of large dynamic\nDoppler shifts as well as frequency-selective fading. As a result, heretofore, the\nuse of OFDM has been limited primarily\nto applications involving small or zero\n\nTransmitter\n\nDoppler shifts. The proposed system includes a digital coherent OFDM communication system that would utilize enhanced 802.1la-compatible signal-processing\nalgorithms to overcome effects of frequency-selective fading and large dynamic Doppler shifts. The overall transceiver design would implement a\ntwo-frequency-channel architecture (see\nfigure) that would afford frequency diversity for reducing the adverse effects of\nmultipath fading. By using parallel concatenated convolutional codes (also\nknown as Turbo codes) across the dualchannel and advanced OFDM signal processing within each channel, the proposed system is intended to achieve at\nleast an order of magnitude improvement in received signal-to-noise ratio\nunder adverse channel effects while preserving spectral efficiency.\n\nReceiver\nFrequency\nChannel 1\n\nInput\nBit Stream\n\nOFDM-Based\nModulator\n\nOFDM-Based\nDemodulator\n\nCrossChannel\n(Turbo)\nEncoder\n\nDiversity\nCombiner\nOFDM-Based\nModulator\n\nFrequency\nChannel 2\n\nIterative\nDecoder\n\nOutput\nBit Stream\n\nOFDM-Based\nDemodulator\n\nA Two-Frequency-Channel, Cross-Coded OFDM System would contain the proposed signal-processing system, parts of which would reside in both transmitting and receiving subsystems.\n\n6\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2005\n\nOne of the novel techniques adopted\nfor the proposed system would be multipass processing of packet preamble for\nacquisition of frequencies and timing of\ncarrier and data symbols. The multipass\napproach is intended to eliminate as\nmuch synchronization error as possible\nat an early stage of packet preamble processing in order to reduce the inter-carrier interference, which can contribute\nsignificantly to the bit-error rate under\nadverse channel conditions.\nAnother novel signal-processing technique would be joint pilot- and data-aided\n\nchannel estimation, tracking, and equalization in each of the two frequency channels. This technique would not only increase the accuracy in the estimate of the\nchannel effects, but also would support\ntracking of dynamic Doppler shifts, resulting in a much improved channel equalization under adverse channel conditions.\nAnother novel aspect of the design\nwould be the use of (1) turbo cross-channel coding in the transmitter in conjunction with (2) diversity combining of signals in the receiver. The gain afforded by\nthis combination of coding and fre-\n\nquency and time diversity would help to\ncounteract severe fading, especially for\nthe case when both channels are simultaneously affected by deep fades.\nThis work was done by Haiping Tsou,\nScott Darden, Dennis Lee, and Tsun-Yee Yan\nof Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

The spectral resolution of this system is greater than that of\nprior terrestrial multispectral imaging systems. Moreover, unlike prior high-spectralresolution airborne and spaceborne hyperspectral imaging systems, this system does\nnot rely on relative movement of the target\nand the imaging system to sweep an imaging line across a scene.\nThis compact system (see figure) consists of a front objective mounted at a translation stage with a motorized actuator, and\na line-slit imaging spectrograph mounted\nwithin a rotary assembly with a rear adaptor to a charged-coupled-device (CCD)\ncamera. Push-broom scanning is carried\nout by the motorized actuator which can\nbe controlled either manually by an operator or automatically by a computer to drive\nthe line-slit across an image at a focal plane\nof the front objective. To reduce the cost,\nthe system has been designed to integrate\nas many as possible off-the-shelf components including the CCD camera and\nspectrograph. The system has achieved\nhigh spectral and spatial resolutions by\nusing a high-quality CCD camera, spectrograph, and front objective lens. Fixtures\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2005\n\nfor attachment of the system to a microscope (U.S. Patent 6,495,818 B1) make it\npossible to acquire multispectral images of\nsingle cells and other microscopic objects.\nTo make it unnecessary to move the\ncamera relative to the target or vice versa,\nthe design of the system provides for lateral motion of the image on the focal\nplane. For this purpose, the front lens is\nmounted on a translational stage driven\nby a computer-controlled motor.\nThe system also includes a computer\nprogrammed with special-purpose operational software; frame-grabber, and motorcontrol circuit boards connected between\n\nthe computer on one hand and the CCD\nand motor, respectively, on the other\nhand; and light sources. The system can\ncollect image data in as many as 1,040\nspectral bands in the wavelength range\nfrom 400 to 1,000 nm.\nThe special-purpose operational software is a single computer program that\ncontrols all aspects of the acquisition and\npreprocessing of image data, performing\nfunctions that, heretofore, entailed the use\nof several different programs: The software\ncontrols the camera, scanning speed, and\nstart and stop positions, and automatically\ndrives the motorized actuator in push-\n\nActuator\n\nCCD Camera\nImage Relay/Filter Suite\n\nLens\n\nThe Main Front Components of the imaging system are shown mounted on the tripod.\n\n7\n\nbroom scanning. A user may utilize the\nprogram to invoke the CCD camera\xe2\x80\x99s user\ninterface for customized configuration.\nDifferent spectral band-pass and spatial resolutions may be changed by different CCD\nvertical/horizontal binning factors. A calibration function is implemented for correcting spectral and spatial errors due to\noptical distortion of the front objective and\nspectrograph. The software then preprocesses the image data into hyperspectral image cubes (three-dimensional arrays\nof data indexed according to two spatial coordinates and a spectral coordinate). Next,\nthe software can perform calibration,\nnoise-removal, data-formatting, and subset-\n\n8\n\nting operations; correct for spectral distortions; and create headers for image-data\nfiles to be subjected to further processing\nby other software (for example, the software described below), as instructed by the\nuser. The program can also perform some\nimage-inversion calculations and some statistical analysis of image data, and can detect image saturation.\nBy suitably modifying the operational\nsoftware and adding special-purpose\nimage-processing software, the system can\nbe configured for automated inspection of\nfood items on production lines. An example of this functionality is the development\nof a prototype version to process three- or\n\nfour-spectral-band images to detect fecal\ncontamination of poultry carcasses on a\nconveyor belt at a rate of 180 carcasses per\nminute \xe2\x80\x94 about double the rate of a modern poultry-processing line.\nThis work was done by Chengye Mao, David\nSmith, Mark A. Lanoue, Gavin H. Poole, Jerry\nHeitschmidt, and Luis Martinez of The Institute for Technology/Provision Technologies;\nand William A. Windham, Kurt C.

Kennedy Space Center, Florida\nA magnetic-flux-compensated voltagedivider circuit has been proposed for\nuse in measuring the true potential\nacross a component that is exposed to\nlarge, rapidly varying electric currents\nlike those produced by lightning strikes.\nAn example of such a component is a\nlightning arrester, which is typically exposed to currents of the order of tens of\nkiloamperes, having rise times of the\norder of hundreds of nanoseconds. Traditional voltage-divider circuits are not\ndesigned for magnetic-flux-compensation: They contain uncompensated\nloops having areas large enough that the\n\ntransient magnetic fluxes associated\nwith large transient currents induce spurious voltages large enough to distort\nvoltage-divider outputs significantly.\nA drawing of the proposed circuit was\nnot available at the time of receipt of information for this article. What is known\nfrom a summary textual description is that\nthe proposed circuit would contain a total\nof four voltage dividers: There would be\ntwo mixed dividers in parallel with each\nother and with the component of interest\n(e.g., a lightning arrester), plus two mixed\ndividers in parallel with each other and in\nseries with the component of interest in\n\nthe same plane. The electrical and geometric configuration would provide compensation for induced voltages, including\nthose attributable to asymmetry in the volumetric density of the lightning or other\ntransient current, canceling out the spurious voltages and measuring the true voltage across the component.\nThis work was done by Carlos T. Mata of\nDynacs, Inc., for Kennedy Space Center.\nFor further information, contact the Kennedy\nInnovative Partnerships Office at (321)\n867-8130.\nKSC-12381/448\n\nHigh-Performance Satellite/Terrestrial-Network Gateway\nThis apparatus affords flexibility in the choice of data rates.\nLyndon B. Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA gateway has been developed to enable digital communication between (1)\nthe high-rate receiving equipment at\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s White Sands complex and (2) a\nstandard terrestrial digital communication network at data rates up to 622\nMb/s. The design of this gateway can\nalso be adapted for use in commercial\nEarth/satellite and digital communication networks, and in terrestrial digital\ncommunication networks that include\nwireless subnetworks.\n\xe2\x80\x9cGateway\xe2\x80\x9d as used here signifies an\nelectronic circuit that serves as an interface between two electronic communication networks so that a computer (or\nother terminal) on one network can\ncommunicate with a terminal on the\nother network. The connection between this gateway and the high-rate receiving equipment is made via a synchronous serial data interface at the\nemitter-coupled-logic (ECL) level. The\nconnection between this gateway and a\nstandard asynchronous transfer mode\n(ATM) terrestrial communication network is made via a standard user network interface with a synchronous optical network (SONET) connector. The\ngateway contains circuitry that per-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2005\n\nforms the conversion between the ECL\nand SONET interfaces. The data rate of\nthe SONET interface can be either\n155.52 or 622.08 Mb/s. The gateway derives its clock signal from a satellite\nmodem in the high-rate receiving\nequipment and, hence, is agile in the\nsense that it adapts to the data rate of\nthe serial interface.\nAlthough the ECL interface is synchronous, it bears ATM cells (in effect, data packets for asynchronous\ntransmission) according to Telecommunications Industry Association\n(TIA) Standard 787. This characteristic renders the gateway transparent to\nany protocols above ATM, including\nthe Internet Protocol (IP), the User\nDatagram Protocol (UDP), and the\nTransmission Control Protocol (TCP).\nThe gateway can perform ReedSolomon encoding for forward error\ncorrection (FEC) during operation\nwith a satellite source that is not\nequipped for FEC.\nThe primary advantage afforded by\nthis gateway is that it enables a satellite/Earth network or the wireless subnetwork of a terrestrial network to operate at a data rate independent of that of\n\nthe network components at either end\nof a data-communication link. Because\nterrestrial networks must subscribe to\nstratified, standard data rates, the data\nrates of the terminals of the networks\noften limit the performances of the wireless links. Often, the optimal data rate\nfor a wireless link in a terrestrial network\nlies between the standard data rates supported by the remainder of the network.\nA gateway like this one would enable a\nwireless portion of a terrestrial network\nsegment to operate at its optimal data\nrate, while preserving the standardization of data rates at the network terminals.\nThis work was done by David R.

The IVoDS was\ndeveloped to supplement and eventually\nreplace the Enhanced Voice Distribution System (EVoDS), which, heretofore, has constituted the terrestrial subsystem of a system for voice communications among crewmembers of the International Space Station (ISS), workers at\nthe Payloads Operations Center at Marshall Space Flight Center, principal investigators at diverse locations who are\nresponsible for specific payloads, and\nothers. The IVoDS utilizes a communication infrastructure of NASA and NASArelated intranets in addition to, as its\nname suggests, the Internet. Whereas\nthe EVoDS utilizes traditional circuitswitched telephony, the IVoDS is a\n\npacket-data system that utilizes a voice\nover Internet protocol (VOIP). Relative\nto the EVoDS, the IVoDS offers advantages of greater flexibility and lower cost\nfor expansion and reconfiguration.\nThe IVoDS is an extended version of\na commercial Internet-based voice conferencing system that enables each user\nto participate in only one conference at\na time. In the IVoDS, a user can receive\naudio from as many as eight conferences simultaneously while sending\naudio to one of them. The IVoDS also\nincorporates administrative controls,\nbeyond those of the commercial system, that provide greater security and\ncontrol of the capabilities and authorizations for talking and listening afforded to each user.\nThe IVoDS has a client/ server architecture. It utilizes the H.323 VOIP with\n\ncustom extensions as required to support operations unique to the ISS mission. An authorized user can gain access\nto the IVoDS by means of a standard\ndesktop personal computer and modem\ncapable of intranet or Internet communication with the Payload Operations\nCenter at a rate of at least 128 kb/s. The\nsubsystems of the IVoDS (see figure) include the following:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Conference or voice servers: These are\ncomputers that host conferences (voice\nloops) to which client computers connect.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Conference or voice clients: These are the\naforementioned client computers, which\nare located at the remote work sites of individual users.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Administrator server: This is a computer that processes requests from the\nadministrator client described below.\n\nJohnson\nSpace Center\nInternational Space Station (ISS)\n\nPayload Operations Integration Center at\nMarshall Space Flight Center\nISS/Ground Voice\nCommunications\n\nEVoDS\n\nInternet and\nResearch &\nEducation\nNetworks\n\nConference\nServers\n\nTelephone\nGateways\n\nEVoDS\nVoice\nPanel\n\nVPN\nServer\n\nIVoDS\nConference\nClients\n\nAdministrator\nServer\n\nPAYCOM\nClient\n\nAdministrator\nClient\n\nThe IVoDS manages voice communications among users aboard the ISS and users at diverse terrestrial locations.\n\n10\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2005\n\nThis computer maintains collections of\nnetwork, user, and conference data,\nand controls the conference or voice\nservers.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Administrator client: This computer\nmanages users, conferences, and the\ndatabase in the administrator server.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Payload communications manager\n(PAYCOM) client: This is a computer\nthat exerts control over who talks in\nsuch restricted conferences as those\n\nthat include direct communication\nwith crewmembers of the ISS.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Virtual public network (VPN) server:\nLike other VPN servers, this serves to\nauthenticate, by use of identification\nnumbers and encryption, the computers of remote users (in this case, conference clients) who seek access to the\nIVoDS.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Telephony gateways: These are interfaces\nbetween (1) the EVoDS voice loops,\n\nwhich are of public switched telephone\nnetwork type, and (2) the IVoDS InternetProtocol-based conferences.\nThis work was done by James Chamberlain, Gerry Myers, David Clem, and Terri\nSpeir of AZ Technology, Inc., for Marshall\nSpace Flight Center.

The design of the transition could be\nadapted to multilayer circuit boards in such\nproducts as cellular telephones (for connecting between circuit-board signal lines\nand antennas), transmitters for Earth/satellite communication systems, and computer\nmother boards (if processor speeds increase\ninto the range of tens of gigahertz).\nThe transition is designed to satisfy the\nfollowing requirements in addition to the\nbasic coupling requirement described\nabove:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The transition must traverse multiple\nlayers, including intermediate layers\nthat contain DC circuitry.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The transition must work at a frequency of 32 GHz with low loss and low\nreflection.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The power delivered by the transition\nto top-layer microstrip must be split\nequally in opposite directions along the\nmicrostrip. Referring to the figure, this\namounts to a requirement that when\npower is supplied to input port 1, equal\namounts of power flow through output\nports 2 and 3.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The signal-line via that is necessarily a\npart of such a transition must not be\nwhat is known in the art as a blind via;\nthat is, it must span the entire thickness\nof the circuit board.\nThe lower end of the via is connected\nto a circular pad on the bottom\n(ground) layer.

The combination of the\ntriangular-taper portion of the cutout\nand the rectangular cavity serves to\nfocus the electromagnetic field to propagate up the signal-line via. The cavity\nalso prevents coupling of the signal to\nneighboring circuits. The rectangular\ncavity can be fabricated easily by con-\n\nventional machining techniques; the triangular-taper portion of the cutout is\nfabricated easily by printed-circuit techniques. To compensate for reflections\nfrom the transition, step-matching sections are included in the vicinity of the\ntriangular taper.\nMode-strapping vias are also included. These vias are blind; that is, they\nterminate at, and are connected to, an\nintermediate layer. These vias can be\n\nblind because they do not carry the signal. These can be closely spaced. The\ncloseness of the spacing compensates\nsomewhat for the unreliability of connections formed in the process of fabrication of blind vias.\nThis work was done by Larry Epp and\nAbdur Khan of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

MACHETE consists of four general software systems: (1) a system for\nkinematic modeling of planetary and\nspacecraft motions; (2) a system for characterizing the engineering impact on the\n\nbandwidth and reliability of deep-space\nand in-situ communication links; (3) a\nsystem for generating traffic loads and\nmodeling of protocol behaviors and state\nmachines; and (4) a system of user-interface for performance metric visualizations. The kinematic-modeling system\nmakes it possible to characterize space\nlink connectivity effects, including occultations and signal losses arising from dynamic slant-range changes and antenna\nradiation patterns. The link-engineering\nsystem also accounts for antenna radiation patterns and other phenomena, including modulations, data rates, coding,\nnoise, and multipath fading.

In cases in which observational\ndata come from off-grid stations, it is\nnecessary to preprocess the observa-\n\n14\n\ntional data to transform them into gridded data. First, the wind direction is\ngridded and binarized so that D(i,j;n) is\nthe input to CEM based on forecast\ndata and d(i,j;n) is the input to CEM\nbased on gridded observational data.\nHere, i and j are spatial indices representing 1.25-km intervals along the\nwest-to-east and south-to-north directions, respectively; and n is a time index\nrepresenting 5-minute intervals. A binary value of D or d = 0 corresponds to\nan offshore wind, whereas a value of D\nor d = 1 corresponds to an onshore\nwind.

Prior polymeric electrolyte\nfuel-cell membranes (e.g., those that contain perfluorosulfonic acid) depend on\nwater and must be limited to operation\nbelow a temperature of 125 \xc2\xb0C because\nthey retain water poorly at higher temperatures. In contrast, the present developmental anhydrous membranes are expected to\nfunction well at temperatures up to 200 \xc2\xb0C.\nThe developmental membranes exploit a hopping-and-reorganization pro-\n\nton-conduction process that can occur in\nthe solid state in organic amine salts and\nis similar to a proton-conduction process\nin a liquid. This process was studied during the 1970s, but until now, there has\nbeen no report of exploiting organic\namine salts for proton conduction in fuel\ncells.\nThe present development work exploits\nand extends the previous research on\nwater-free proton conduction in organic\namine salts.

It has been demonstrated\nthat by combining such a proton conductor with nanoparticles of suitable oxide\n(for example, silica) and a stable binder\n[for example, poly(tetrafluoroethylene)],\none can fabricate a polymeric electrolyte\nmembrane inexpensively. The figure depicts the results of measurements of the\nionic conductivity of such a membrane\nmade from triethylenediamine sulfate.\nThe activation energy for proton transport, obtained from the slope of the plot,\nlies in the range of 0.15 to 0.20 eV \xe2\x80\x94 a low\nrange indicative of facile transport of protons.\nProton-conducting membranes to be\ninvestigated in the continuing development effort are divided into the following three classes according to the amine\nsalts and related compounds on which\nthey are based:\nType I: Organic tertiary amine bisulfates,\ntriflates (trifluoromethanesulfomates),\nand hydrogen phosphates.\nType II: Polymeric quaternized amine\nbisulfates, triflates, and hydrogen phosphates.\nType III: Polymeric quaternized bisulfates, hydrogen phosphates, and triflates combined with perfluorosulfonic\nacid-based polymers.\nAs in the case of the membrane described in the preceding paragraph, a proton-conducting membrane of type I would\n\n15\n\nbe fabricated from one or more salts of\ntype I by processing a mixture of fine salt\nparticles, oxide nanoparticles, and\npoly(tetrafluoroethylene).\nFabrication of membranes of type II\nwould involve synthesis of polymers, followed by casting of the polymers into\nmembranes. Depending on the starting ingredients and process used to make a given\nmembrane, either the quaternized nitrogen atoms would automatically be incorporated into the membrane during polymerization, or else it would be necessary to\nquaternize the membrane in a bisulfate or\na hydrogen phosphate.\nA membrane of type III would be a twocomponent polymeric system cast from a\n\n16\n\nsolution containing a perfluorosulfonic\nacid-based polymer and a quaternary-nitrogen-containing polymer salt of type II. This\npolymer would make it possible to exploit\nthe strong acidity of the dry perfluorosulfonic acid and the flexibility of its polymer\nback bone. The general objective in formulating such a two-component system is to increase the number of sites available for proton hopping and provide for additional\nrelaxation and reorganization mechanisms\nin order to reduce the heights of barrier to\nthe transport of protons.\nThis work was done by Sekharipuram\nNarayanan and Shiao-Pin S.

In contrast, the present developmental system is designed\nto be sufficiently compact and lightweight to be easily portable, to utilize\nboth energy and material more efficiently, and to produce components\nthat have mechanical properties approximating those of the corresponding original components.\nThe developmental EB F3 system will\ninclude a vacuum chamber and associated vacuum pumps, an electron-beam\ngun and an associated power supply, a\nmultiaxis positioning subsystem, a precise wire feeder, and an instrumentation system for monitoring and control.\nThe\nelectron-beam\ngun,\npositioning subsystem, and wire feeder\nwill be located inside the vacuum\nchamber (see figure). The electronbeam gun and the wire feeder will be\nmounted in fixed positions inside the\ndomed upper portion of the vacuum\nchamber. The positioning subsystem\nand ports for the vacuum pumps will\nbe located on a base that could be\ndropped down to provide full access to\nthe interior of the chamber when not\nunder vacuum.\nDuring operation, wire will be fed to\na fixed location, entering the melted\npool created by the electron beam.\nHeated by the electron beam, the wire\nwill melt and fuse to either the substrate or with the previously deposited\nmetal wire fused on top of the positioning table. Based on a computer aided\ndesign (CAD) model and controlled by\na computer, the positioning subsystem\n\n17\n\nwill move the substrate so that the\nmetal deposited from the wire will accumulate to form a component of the\ndesired size and shape.\nWhereas conventional electron-beam\nwelding systems generally utilize electron-accelerating potentials of the order\nof 60 kV, the proposed system will utilize\na potential between 8 and 15 kV. Consequently, the shielding needed to protect\npersonnel and equipment against x rays\ngenerated by impingement of the electrons on the workpiece can be considerably less massive. The electron beam will\n\n18\n\ndeliver a maximum power between 3\nand 5 kW and be focused to heat a small\nspot. Because a considerably higher fraction of an electron beam\xe2\x80\x99s energy is converted into heat (relative to a laser\nbeam, for example) in a small spot on\nthe workpiece, the use of the electron\nbeam will contribute to the energy efficiency of the system.

The operational\nparameters will be selected to ensure the\nproper feeding, melting, and consolidation of the feedstock to yield a deposit\n\nthat will be nearly 100 percent dense\n(that is, will contain little or no porosity)\nand will have a very fine grain structure,\nas needed to ensure superior mechanical properties.\nThis work was performed by J.

By emphasizing concentration\nand sorting of specimens prior to detection, the underlying system concept\nwould make it possible to attain high\ndetection sensitivities without the need\nto develop ever more sensitive biosensors. The original purpose of the proposal is to aid the search for signs of life\non a remote planet by enabling the detection of specimens as sparse as a few\nmolecules or microbes in a large\namount of soil, dust, rocks, water/ice,\nor other raw sample material. Some ver-\n\nsion of the system could prove useful on\nEarth for remote sensing of biological\ncontamination, including agents of biological warfare.\nProcessing in this system would begin\nwith dissolution of the raw sample material in a sample-separation vessel. The solution in the vessel would contain floating microscopic magnetic beads coated\nwith substances that could engage in\nchemical reactions with various target\nfunctional groups that are parts of target\nmolecules. The chemical reactions\nwould cause the targeted molecules to be\ncaptured on the surfaces of the beads.\nBy use of a controlled magnetic\nfield, the beads would be concentrated\n\nin a specified location in the vessel.\nOnce the beads were thus concentrated, the rest of the solution would\nbe discarded.

Unlike prior liquid-circulation thermal-protection suits that\nprovide either cooling or warming but\nnot both, an LCWG as envisioned\nwould provide cooling at some body locations and/or heating at other locations, as needed: For example, sometimes there is a need to cool the body\ncore and to heat the extremities simultaneously. An LCWG garment of the\ntype to be developed is said to be shortened because the liquid-cooling and heating zones would not cover the\n\n20\n\nwhole body and, instead, would cover\nreduced areas selected for maximum\nheating and cooling effectiveness.\nPhysiological research is under way to\nprovide a rational basis for selection of\nthe liquid-cooling and -heating areas.\nIn addition to enabling better (relative\nto prior liquid-circulation garments)\nbalancing of heat among different\nbody regions, the use of selective heating and cooling in zones would contribute to a reduction in the amount of\nenergy needed to operate a thermalprotection suit.\nThis work was done by Victor S.

During operation of the\nastronomical interferometer, the electromagnet is excited to produce linear reciprocating motion of the corner-cube\nretroreflector at an amplitude of 2 to 4\nmm at a frequency of 250, 750, or 1,250\nHz. Attached to the corner-cube retroreflector is a small pick-off mirror. To suppress vibrations, a counterweight having\na mass equal to that of the corner-cube\nretroreflector and pick-off mirror is\nmounted on another electromagnetic actuator that is excited in opposite phase.\nEach gauge is required to measure the\namplitude of the motion of the pick-off\nmirror, assuming that the motions of the\npick-off mirror and the corner-cube\nretroreflector are identical, so as to measure the amplitude of motion of the corner-cube retroreflector to within an\nerror of the order of picometers at each\nexcitation frequency.\n\nReceiver\nAssembly\n\nEach gauge is a polarization-insensitive heterodyne interferometer that includes matched collimators, beam separators, and photodiodes (see figure).\nThe light needed for operation of the\ngauge comprises two pairs of laser\nbeams, the beams in each pair being\nseparated by a beat frequency of 80 kHz.\nThe laser beams are generated by an apparatus, denoted the heterodyne plate,\nthat includes stabilized helium-neon\nlasers, acousto-optical modulators, and\nassociated optical and electronic subsystems. The laser beams are coupled from\nthe heterodyne plate to the collimators\nvia optical fibers.\nThe basic heterodyne-interferometer architecture is not new, but prior\nsystems based on the architecture\nhave not afforded accuracies as great\nas those of the present gauges. The\nnovelty of the present gauges lies in\nnumerous details of design, construction, and setup that, taken together,\nmake it possible to obtain the required level of accuracy. Within the\nlimited space available for this article,\nit is possible only to summarize a few\nmajor details:\n\nReference\nPhotodiode\nPhotodiode\nOutputs to\nProcessing Circuits\n\nLens\nBeam Dump\nPick-off Mirror\non Retroreflector\non Modulator\n\nReference\nMirror\n\nInner Mask\nBeam\nSplitters\n\nLenses\n\nOuter Mask\n\nLens\n\nProbe\nPhotodiode\n\nReceiver Assembly\n\nMatched\nCollimators\n\nOptical Fibers Carrying Laser\nBeams From Heterodyne Plate\n\nThis Laser Heterodyne Interferometer utilizes an inner probe beam pair and an outer reference beam\npair. High sensitivity and high accuracy are achieved through innovative design features and careful\nattention to detail in construction and alignment.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2005\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The gauge utilizes an inner beam pair\nin one of the interferometer arms (the\nprobe arm) and an outer beam pair in\nthe other interferometer arm (the reference arm). The beams are separated\nby (1) an inner mask and a mirror with\na hole in the reference arm, and (2) an\nouter mask in the probe arm. Care is\ntaken to provide a small radial separation between the beams to minimize\nleakage between them.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 In the design, construction, and setup of\nthe collimators, great care is taken to\neliminate scattered light, to adjust the\ncollimator lenses to the collimating positions, and to match the collimator outputs. Although the wave fronts coming\nout of the collimators are not very flat,\nthey are matched to within a fraction of\nthe 633-nm laser wavelength. Once the\ncollimators are adjusted to the required\nmatch, they are permanently glued in\nposition.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The photodetectors, and lenses that\nfocus light on the photodetectors, are\nmounted in receiver assemblies, the optical configuration of which is the inverse\nof that of the collimators. The photodiodes are only 100 mm in diameter and\nare mounted at the precise focal points\nof the lenses. The precise placement and\nthe smallness of the photodiodes helps\nto discriminate against leakage in the\nform of diffracted light, which travels at\nslight angles to the optical axes of the\nmain masked beams.\nTwo of the gauges have been built and\nhave been demonstrated to be capable of\na sensitivity of \xe2\x89\xa43 pm/Hz1/2 within 1-Hzwide bands at each of 250, 750, and 1,250\nHz. When the gauges were tested while\nmonitoring the same optical-path-length\nmodulator, the root-mean-square systematic error per gauge was found to be\nabout 25 pm. However, the systematic errors do not constitute a major drawback,\ninasmuch as they can be reduced by cyclic\naveraging and they occur at a frequency\nabove 1,250 Hz.\nThis work was done by Yekta Gursel of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nFurther information is contained in a TSP\n(see page 1).\nNPO-30799\n\n21\n\nPCM Passive Cooling System Containing Active Subsystems\nA PCM would absorb intense heat bursts and would be regenerated between them.\nLyndon B. Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA multistage system has been proposed\nfor cooling a circulating fluid that is subject to intermittent intense heating. The\nsystem would be both flexible and redundant in that it could operate in a basic\npassive mode, either sequentially or simultaneously with operation of a first, active cooling subsystem, and either sequentially or simultaneously with a\nsecond cooling subsystem that could be\nactive, passive, or a combination of both.\nThis flexibility and redundancy, in combination with the passive nature of at least\none of the modes of operation, would\nmake the system more reliable, relative to\na conventional cooling system.\nThe system would include a tube-inshell heat exchanger, within which the\nspace between the tubes would be filled\nwith a phase-change material (PCM). The\ncirculating hot fluid would flow along the\ntubes in the heat exchanger. In the basic\npassive mode of operation, heat would be\nconducted from the hot fluid into the\nPCM, wherein the heat would be stored\ntemporarily by virtue of the phase change.\nOf course, it would become necessary\nto remove heat from the PCM to maintain or restore its heat-absorption capacity. This would be accomplished by means\nof the first, active cooling subsystem,\nwhich would circulate a cooling fluid\nthrough one or more tube(s) in thermal\ncontact with the PCM. For example, such\na cooling tube could be wrapped in a spiral around the heat-exchanger shell as\nshown in the figure.\n\nSpiral-Wrapped Tube of\nFirst Cooling Subsystem\n\nPhase-Change\nMaterial\n\nHot\nFluid In\nCool\nFluid Out\n\nHot\nFluid In\nCool\nFluid Out\n\nCore Containing Second\nCooling Subsystem\n\nThis Cross Section Is Greatly Simplified to show only selected major features of a heat exchanger according to the proposal.\n\nThe heat exchanger would include an\ninner core that would accommodate the\nsecond cooling subsystem. As mentioned above, the second cooling subsystem could be active, passive, or both.\nThis subsystem would remove heat from\nthe core by means of heat pipes, a water\nmembrane evaporator, and/or one or\nmore active refrigeration devices. In the\ncase of a water membrane evaporator,\n\nheat would be dissipated in the environment by releasing the steam generated\nat the membrane.\nThis work was done by David E. Blanding\nand David I.

Kennedy Space Center, Florida\nThe Mars Electrostatics Chamber\n(MEC) is an environmental chamber designed primarily to create atmospheric\nconditions like those at the surface of\nMars to support experiments on electrostatic effects in the Martian environment. The chamber is equipped with a\nvacuum system, a cryogenic cooling system, an atmospheric-gas replenishing\nand analysis system, and a computerized\ncontrol system that can be programmed\nby the user and that provides both au-\n\n22\n\ntomation and options for manual control. The control system can be set to\nmaintain steady Mars-like conditions or\nto impose temperature and pressure\nvariations of a Mars diurnal cycle at any\ngiven season and latitude. In addition,\nthe MEC can be used in other areas of\nresearch because it can create steady or\nvarying atmospheric conditions anywhere within the wide temperature,\npressure, and composition ranges between the extremes of Mars-like and\n\nEarth-like conditions.\nThe MEC (see figure) includes access\nports for installation and removal of experimental devices, and vacuum-feedthrough ports for connecting to the devices from the outside. Also included are\nfeed-through ports for pressure sensors,\nthermocouples, and gas-supply tubes that\nare permanent parts of the apparatus.\nThere also are access ports for visual monitoring of experimental devices.\nThe temperature in the chamber can\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2005\n\nThe Mars Electrostatics Chamber has an external length of 2 m, external diameter of 1.3 m, and interior volume of 1.5 m3. The chamber houses an experiment deck measuring 1.43 by 0.80 m. This apparatus is versatile enough to be useful for general research in addition to research on electrostatics in\nthe Martian environment.\n\nrange from a minimum of 150 K to a maximum of 473 K. The temperature at 48\ndifferent locations within the chamber is\nmonitored by use of thermocouples. Temperature is controlled mainly by balancing (1) the inward leakage of heat from\nambient temperature against (2) the removal of heat by circulation of a mixture\nof warm gaseous nitrogen and cold vaporized liquid nitrogen through a cooling\nshroud inside the chamber. The rates of\nflow of the warm and cold nitrogen are\nmonitored by flowmeters and regulated\nby controllable valves. Additional heating\nis provided by tape heaters outside the\n\nchamber and additional cooling by a liquid-nitrogen cold plate.\nFollowing initial evacuation, the\nchamber is backfilled with an atmospheric gas mixture (e.g., CO2 with small\namounts of N2, Ar, O2, and H2O to simulate the Martian atmosphere) at low\npressure [typically between 6 and 9 millibars (between 600 and 900 Pa) for the\nMartian atmosphere]. Thereafter, pressure is brought to and maintained at the\nrequired value by use of a feedback control system that balances the rate of flow\nof atmospheric gas into the system\nagainst the rates of leakage and of vac-\n\nuum pumping. The feedback control\nsystem includes a pressure sensor and a\ngas-feed throttle valve.\nThe composition of the gas is monitored by use of a separately operated\nresidual-gas analyzer, the output of which\nis sent to the computerized control system. A mass flow controller maintains\nthe desired relative concentrations of the\ngases in the atmospheric gas mixture.\nA programmable logic controller\n(PLC) is the heart of the computerized\ncontrol system. The PLC accepts inputs\nfrom a manual control panel, capacitance manometers, flowmeters, pressure\ncontrollers, and thermocouples. The\nPLC provides outputs to indicators on\nthe manual control panel, and to the\nvacuum, heating, cooling, pressure, and\ngas-composition systems described\nabove. Numerous outputs are sent to a\ngraphical user interface (GUI) that features \xe2\x80\x9csoft\xe2\x80\x9d controls and indicators that\nemulate those of the manual control\npanel with the addition of elaborate\ngraphical management capabilities. The\nGUI notifies the PLC when it is ready to\naccept or provide information relative to\nthe control process. Optionally, the operation of the MEC can be controlled by\nuse of the manual control panel alone,\nor partly by use of the manual control\npanel and partly by use of the GUI. This\noption affords flexibility for manually\nperforming tests while maintaining safe\noperation by use of automatic control.\nThis work was done by Carlos Calle and Dean\nC.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA solid-phase extraction (SPE)\nprocess has been developed for removing alcohols, carboxylic acids, aldehydes, ketones, amines, and other polar\norganic compounds from water. This\nprocess can be either a subprocess of a\nwater-reclamation process or a means\nof extracting organic compounds from\nwater samples for gas-chromatographic analysis. This SPE process is an\nattractive alternative to an Environmental Protection Administration liquid-liquid extraction process that generates some pollution and does not\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2005\n\nwork in a microgravitational environment. In this SPE process, one forces a\nwater sample through a resin bed by\nuse of positive pressure on the upstream side and/or suction on the\ndownstream side, thereby causing organic compounds from the water to be\nadsorbed onto the resin. If gas-chromatographic analysis is to be done,\nthe resin is dried by use of a suitable\ngas, then the adsorbed compounds\nare extracted from the resin by use of\na solvent. Unlike the liquid-liquid\nprocess, the SPE process works in both\n\nmicrogravity and Earth gravity. In\ncomparison with the liquid-liquid\nprocess, the SPE process is more efficient, extracts a wider range of organic compounds, generates less pollution, and costs less.\nThis work was done by Richard Sauer of\nJohnson Space Center, Jeffrey Rutz of Krug\nLife Sciences, and John Schultz of Wyle Laboratories.\nInquiries concerning rights for the commercial use of this invention should be addressed\nto the Patent Counsel, Johnson Space Center,\n(281) 483-0837.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA method for rapidly estimating the\naeroheating, shear stress, and other\nproperties of hypersonic flow about a\nthree-dimensional (3D) blunt body\nhas been devised. First, the geometry\nof the body is specified in Cartesian coordinates. The surface of the body is\nthen described by its derivatives, coordinates, and principal curvatures.\nNext, previously relatively simple equations are used to find, for each desired\ncombination of angle of attack and\nmeridional angle, a scaling factor and\n\n24\n\nthe shape of an equivalent axisymmetric body. These factors and equivalent\nshapes are entered as inputs into a previously developed computer program\nthat solves the two-dimensional (2D)\nequations of flow in a non-equilibrium\nviscous shock layer (VSL) about an axisymmetric body. The coordinates in\nthe output of the VSL code are transformed back to the Cartesian coordinates of the 3D body, so that computed\nflow quantities can be registered with\nlocations in the 3D flow field of inter-\n\nest. In tests in which the 3D bodies\nwere elliptic paraboloids, the estimates\nobtained by use of this method were\nfound to agree well with solutions of\n3D, finite-rate-chemistry, thin-VSL\nequations for a catalytic body.\nThis work was done by Carl D. Scott and\nIrina G. Brykina of Johnson Space Center.

In that system, a newly acquired star image would be treated as an\nantigen that would be matched by an appropriate antibody (an entry in a star\ncatalog). The method would enable\nrapid convergence, would afford robustness in the face of noise in the star sensors, would enable recognition of star\nimages acquired in any sensor or spacecraft orientation, and would not make\nan excessive demand on the computational resources of a typical spacecraft.\nGoing beyond the star-tracking application, the AIS-based pattern-recognition\nmethod is potentially applicable to pattern-recognition and -classification\nprocesses for diverse purposes \xe2\x80\x94 for example, reconnaissance, detecting intruders, and mining data.\nThis AIS method is capable of efficient analysis of large sets of data, including sets that are characterized by\nhigh dimensionality and/or are ac-\n\nquired over long time intervals. When\nthe method is used for unsupervised or\nsupervised classification, the amount of\ncomputation scales linearly with the\nnumber of dimensions and offers performance that is both (a) nearly independent of the total size of the set of\ndata and (b) equal to or better than the\nperformances of traditional clustering\nmethods. When used for pattern recognition, the method efficiently finds appropriate matches in the data. The\nmethod enables efficient classification\nof a high-dimensional set of data in a single pass through the data, and quickly\nflags outliers in much the same way as\nthe human immune system produces antibodies to invading antigens.\nThe AIS model in this method is embodied in a set of partial differential\nequations that approximate some aspects of the dynamics of a network of immune-system B cells:\n\xe2\x8e\xa1 p\xce\xb8\n\xe2\x8e\xa4\n\xe2\x88\x82bi\n= s + bi \xe2\x8e\xa2\nf (h i , h i\xe2\x80\xb2 ) + KiA \xe2\x88\x92 d\xe2\x8e\xa5\n\xce\xb8 + bi\n\xe2\x88\x82t\n\xe2\x8e\xa3\n\xe2\x8e\xa6\nwhere bi is the number of cells of clone i,\nt is time, s is a rate of influx, p is a maximal\ngrowth rate, \xce\xb8 is a growth clone-size\nthreshold, f(hi ,h\xe2\x80\xb2) is a cell activation funci\ntion, hi is a binding field, h\xe2\x80\xb2 is a cross-linki\n\ning field, KiA is a measure of the affinity of\na clone-i antibody for the antigen (the\npattern to be recognized), and d is a death\nrate. The functions f(hi ,h\xe2\x80\xb2), hi , and h\xe2\x80\xb2 are\ni\ni\ndefined by additional equations that must\nbe omitted here for the sake of brevity.\nSuffice it to say that the cell activation\nfunction, f(hi ,h\xe2\x80\xb2), depends on the binding\ni\nbetween the B-cell populations in the network. Cells having greater affinity with the\nincoming pattern (cells representing\ncloser matches to the pattern) clone\nthemselves (with or without mutation)\nfaster than do those having lesser affinities (representing poorer matches).\nThe unsupervised classification process\nfor this model starts with a single sequential presentation of the data to a randomly\ninitialized set of cell populations. As a result of this mode of presentation, the\namount of computation in the classification process is of the order of a number\nproportional to the number of dimensions of the input data. An affinity radius\naround each incoming pattern is used to\ncull the number of clone populations that\nrespond each time. The system is allowed\nto evolve in time, and the clone population that survives is used as the class for\neach pattern. Typically, 10 to 20 computational cycles are all that are needed for\nconvergence for each incoming item.\n\nSpectral Images and Attribute Images derived from spectral images were generated from images of the Marquesas Islands acquired by a spaceborne imaging spectrometer in 18 wavelength bands at 36-km resolution. AIS classification of the data of the 18 images yielded an image in which Islands can be\ndiscerned more easily.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2005\n\n25\n\nThe method has been demonstrated by\napplying it to a high-dimensional data set\nrepresenting images, synthesized from images acquired by a spaceborne imaging\nspectrometer in 18 wavelength bands, that\nshow various attributes of the Marquesas\nIslands and vicinity (see figure). Details of\n\nindividual islands are difficult to discern in\nany one of the images, but after classification of the image data by the present AIS\nmethod, the dominant island groups can\nbe discerned more easily.\nThis work was done by Terrance Huntsberger of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion\n\nLaboratory.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nThe Cryogenic Tank Analysis Program\n(CTAP) predicts the time-varying thermodynamic state of a cryogenic fluid in\na tank or a Dewar flask. CTAP is designed to be compatible with EASY5x,\nwhich is a commercial software package\nthat can be used to simulate a variety of\nprocesses and equipment systems.\nThe need for CTAP or a similar program arises because there are no closedform equations for the time-varying thermodynamic state of the cryogenic fluid in\na storage-and-supply system. Manual calculations cannot incorporate all the pertinent variables and provide only steadystate solutions of limited accuracy. The\nheat energy flowing into and out of the\nsystem, the inflow and outflow of fluid,\nthe thermal capacitance and elasticity of\nthe storage vessel, and the thermodynamic properties of the cryogenic fluid at\neach instant of time are needed. In other\nwords, to define the time varying state of\nthe cryogenic fluid, it is necessary to calculate all the pertinent variables and iterate quasi-steady-state solutions at successive instants of time. It is impractical to\nattempt to do this without the help of a\ncomputer program.\nThe basic tank system (see figure)\nmodeled in CTAP consists of a pressure\n\nvessel (the tank) that contains the cryogen; the insulation on the tank; the tank\nsupports; and the fill, vent, and outflow\ntubes. The thermodynamic system is considered to be bounded by the outside\nsurface of the pressure vessel, with provisions for flow of both liquid and gas into\nor out of the tank. The volume of the\ntank is treated as a variable to account for\ncontraction and expansion of the pressure vessel with changes in pressure.\nThe mathematical model implemented in CTAP is a first-order differential equation for the pressure as a function of time. The equation is derived as a\nquasi-steady-state expression of the first\nlaw of thermodynamics for the system regarded as closed and isothermal. The\nequation includes terms for the parasitic\nleakage of heat through the insulation,\nfor pressurization energy (supplied by\nheaters) to be added to the tank fluid,\nfor expulsion of liquid or vapor, for the\nthermal capacitance of the tank wall, and\nfor stretching of the tank under pressure. CTAP incorporates fluid-property\nsubroutines based on equations of state\ndeveloped at the National Institute of\nStandards and Technology. At present,\nthe fluids represented in CTAP are hydrogen and oxygen.\n\nInflow or Outflow of Vapor\nPressure Vessel\nVapor\n\nLiquid\nHeat Inputs\n\nInsulation\nInflow or Outflow of Liquid\n\nA Cryogenic Fluid and Tank, taken together as a time-varying system, are modeled in CTAP by a quasisteady-state differential equation based on the first law of thermodynamics.\n\n26\n\nCTAP is set up as a large subroutine to\nbe called from within EASY5x. CTAP requires 28 input variables and returns 12\nvalues for use in execution of EASY5x.\nThe input variables define the fluid\n(oxygen or hydrogen), the initial state of\nthe fluid, the tank and its parameters,\nthe thermal environment, and the fluid\nscenario (defined next). The user can\nselect any one of the following 12 options or fluid scenarios:\n1. Program calculates rates of boil-off or\nexpulsion for a supercritical fluid at\nconstant pressure.\n2. Program calculates rate of expulsion\nof liquid at constant pressure.\n3. Program calculates rate of expulsion\nof vapor at constant pressure.\n4. Program calculates the rate of increase of pressure under a condition\nof tank lockup.\n5. Program calculates the rates of inflow\nof heat required for a given mass flow\nrate of supercritical fluid at constant\npressure.\n6. Program calculates the rates of inflow\nof heat required for a given mass flow\nrate of liquid at constant pressure.\n7. Program calculates the rates of inflow\nof heat required for a given mass flow\nrate of vapor at constant pressure.\n8. Program simulates tank blowdown \xe2\x80\x94\nthe expulsion of initially supercritical\nfluid from the tank. This calculation\nincludes effects of stretching of the\ntank under pressure.\n9. Program calculates variable-pressure\nexpulsion of liquid under heater and\nmass-flow conditions specified by the\nuser.\n10. Program calculates variable-pressure\nexpulsion of vapor under heater\nand mass-flow conditions specified\nby the user.\n11. Program calculates heat loss through\nthermodynamic vent system.\n12. Program calculates pressure rise in\nthe tank from helium pressurant.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2005\n\nFor steady-state solutions, CTAP returns single values (temperatures,\nheat flows, and/or mass flows) that describe the state of the cryogenic system. For transient solutions, CTAP returns rates of change of pressure and\ndensity, so that EASY5x can update the\npressure and density accordingly at\n\neach time step, then pass new values of\npressure, density, and any other parameters (e.g., external temperature)\nthat might change with time back to\nCTAP.\nThis work was done by G.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nThe safety and mission assurance\n(S&MA) performance metric is a\nmethod that provides a process\nthrough which the managers of a large,\ncomplex program can readily understand and assess the accepted risk, the\nproblems, and the associated reliability\nof the program. Conceived for original\nuse in helping to assure the safety and\nsuccess of the International Space Station (ISS) program, the S&MA performance metric also can be applied to\nother large and complex programs and\nprojects. The S&MA-performance-metric data products comprise one or\nmore tables (possibly also one or more\ngraphs) that succinctly display all of\nthe information relevant (and no information that is irrelevant) to management decisions that must be made to\nassure the safety and success of a program or project, thereby facilitating\nsuch decisions.\nS&MA organizations within NASA\nhave traditionally provided data products that target specific stages of the life\ncycles of projects and are generally independent of each other. Such data products have included (1) critical-items lists\n(CILs) generated through failuremodes-and-effects analyses (FMEAs);\n(2) noncompliance reports (NCRs) \xe2\x80\x94\nmore specifically, reports of noncompliance with safety requirements as revealed through safety-oriented analyses\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2005\n\nand reviews; and (3) problem reporting\nand corrective action (PRACA) documents, which are used in tracking and\nclassifying hardware failures that occur\nduring testing, assembly, and operations. Notwithstanding the value of\nthese data products, it is difficult to assess the effects on the overall program\nor project from the contents of such a\ndata product considered by itself. Prior\nto the conception of the S&MA performance metric, there was no process\nfor integrating the individual S&MA\ndata products into a data product that\ncould enhance the decisions of program managers.\nThe S&MA-performance-metric process is one of gathering information\ngenerated according to the various\nS&MA disciplines (for example, data\nproducts like those described above).\nThe gathered information is differentiated into four categories:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Accepted Risk \xe2\x80\x94 This category includes\ninformation from CILs and NCRs. The\ncritical items and noncompliances can\nbe classified against specific affected\nsubsystems of the ISS or other system\nthat is the focus of the program or\nproject.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Anomalies \xe2\x80\x94 For the purpose of S&MA,\nanomalies are defined as hardware or\nsoftware failures, or adverse discrete\nevents that have occurred during development and operation of the system.\n\nAnomalies include the subject matter of\nPRACA reports and of the corresponding reports for software, denoted S/W\nPRs. The PRACAs and S/W PRs can also\nbe classified against specific subsystems.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Capability Reliability \xe2\x80\x94 This category is\nparticularly relevant to the ISS because\nthe ISS is being assembled in stages over\na period of several years, and its configuration and required capabilities for each\nstage are different. A predicted-reliability\nanalysis is performed for each capability,\nand consequently for each stage. This\nanalysis is based on the planned times\nbetween assembly flights, the predicted\nfailure rates of the components, the system architecture, the profile of operations for each stage, and data pertaining\nto failures observed in flight.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Subsystem/Capability Dependencies \xe2\x80\x94 The\nfinal piece of the ISS S&MA metric is\nthe dependency of subsystem and stage\ncapabilities. One relies on the ISS subsystems to realize the capabilities required at each stage. This dependency\nof capabilities upon subsystems provides an integrated system perspective\nthat helps in the correlation of capability performance with anomalies and accepted risk across subsystems.\nThis work was done by Jerry Holsomback,\nFred Kuo, and Jim Wade of Johnson Space\nCenter.

The technique involves exploitation of\nthe slight attractive or repulsive forces exerted on most fluids by a magnetic-field gradient. Although small, these forces can\ndominate in microgravity and therefore\ncan be used to hold fluids in position in\npreparation for an experiment. The magnetic field is applied to a test cell, while a\nfluid mixture containing a concentration\ngradient is prepared by introducing an\nundiluted solution into a diluting solution\nin a mixing chamber. The test cell is then\nfilled with the fluid mixture. Given the\nmagnetic susceptibilities of the undiluted\nand diluting solutions, the magnetic-field\ngradient must be large enough that the\nmagnetic force exceeds both (1) forces associated with the flow of the fluid mixture\nduring filling of the test cell and (2) forces\nimposed by any residual gravitation and\nfluctuations thereof. Once the test cell has\nbeen filled with the fluid mixture, the magnetic field is switched off so that the experiment can proceed, starting from the\nproper initial conditions.\nThis work was done by Fred Leslie of\nMarshall Space Flight Center and\nNarayanan Ramachandran formerly of\nUniversities Space Research Association.

(\xe2\x89\x8819-cm)-diameter spacecraft that would contain three digital video\ncameras to be used in visual inspection of\nthe exterior of a larger spacecraft (a space\nshuttle or the International Space Station).\nThe Mini-AERCam would maneuver by\nuse of its own miniature thrusters under\nradio control by astronauts inside the\nlarger spacecraft. The design of the MiniAERCam avionics is subject to a number of\nconstraints, most of which can be summarized as severely competing requirements\nto maximize radiation hardness and maneuvering, image-acquisition, and datacommunication capabilities while minimizing cost, size, and power consumption.\nThe report discusses the design constraints, the engineering approach to satisfying the constraints, and the resulting iterations of the design. The report places\nspecial emphasis on the design of a flight\ncomputer that would (1) acquire position\nand orientation data from a Global Positioning System receiver and a microelectromechanical gyroscope, respectively;\n(2) perform all flight-control (including\nthruster-control) computations in real\ntime; and (3) control video, tracking,\npower, and illumination systems.\nThis work was done by Larry Abbott and\nRobert L. Shuler, Jr., of Johnson Space Center.

The flexibility of the\nwing is to be optimized such that passive\ndeformation of the wing in the presence\nof aerodynamic disturbances would reduce the overall response of the airplane\nto disturbances, thereby rendering the airplane more stable as an observation platform. The aspect of the development emphasized in the report is that of\ncomputational simulation of dynamics of\nthe UFMAV in flight, for the purpose of\ngenerating mathematical models for use\nin designing control systems for the airplane. The simulations are performed by\nuse of data from a wind-tunnel test of the\nairplane in combination with commercial\nsoftware, in which are codified a standard\nset of equations of motion of an airplane,\nand a set of mathematical routines to compute trim conditions and extract linear\nstate space models.\nThis work was done by Martin R.
