The SRB dewatering set consists of a nozzle plug, control console, remote control unit, power distribution unit, umbilical cable, interconnect cables, and various handling and storage items. The nozzle plug (NP) is a remotely controlled, tethered underwater vehicle that is launched from the retrieval vessel (RV) by a crane, descends down the side of the SRB, and is positioned below the SRB nozzle. A TV camera mounted at the top of the NP central core is used by the control console operator to visually guide the NP during descent and docking. The NP is then driven up and locked into the nozzle. Compressed air is passed through the umbilical from the RV, through the NP and into the SRB motor. The water inside the SRB is expelled causing the SRB to rotate to a near horizontal attitude on the surface of the water.", "title": "SRB dewatering set", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-11T01:57:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19810013876, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Wickham, R.
