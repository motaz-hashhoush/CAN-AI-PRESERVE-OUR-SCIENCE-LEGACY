When a client, who operates an electricity generating plant required assistance in evaluating the effects of a heated water discharge on aquatic life, Law proposed a Visiting Investigator Program (VIP) to Stennis Space Center (SSC). The VIP is directed toward small companies who could use remote sensing profitably, but do not have the money to explore new technologies. SSC provided remote sensing data to Law enabling it to produce images of the thermal \"plume,\" the water area affected by the discharge. After comparisons of plant and animal life with similar life in an unaffected control area, Law concluded that the discharge effect was not significant.", "title": "Broadening the Earthscan Industry", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T12:52:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020080100, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020080100, "isbn": "0-16-045368-2", "id": "fb446fa9c9cf41bc927541d3512a3624", "publicationName": "sPINOFF 1994", "publicationDate": "1994-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020080100.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020080100/downloads/20020080100.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020080100/downloads/20020080100.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020080100/downloads/20020080100.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
