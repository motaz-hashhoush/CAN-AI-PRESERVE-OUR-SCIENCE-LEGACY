A physician or healthcare provider performs the test by collecting a fingerstick of blood from a patient. The tiny volume of blood is inserted into the rHEALTH device. Inside the device is a microfluidic chip that contains small channels about the width of a human hair. These channels help move the blood and analyze the blood sample. The rHEALTH sensor uses proprietary reagents called nanostrips, which are nanoscale test strips that enable the clinical assays. The readout is performed by laser-induced fluorescence. Overall, the time from blood collection through analysis is less than a minute.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20120006591, "id": "f7c647166b1a4298be07341c1ef25fb0", "publicationName": "NASA Tech Briefs, January 2012", "publicationDate": "2012-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20120006555, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "NASA Tech Briefs, January 2012", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20120006591.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20120006591/downloads/20120006591.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20120006591/downloads/20120006591.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20120006591/downloads/20120006591.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
