It offers a variety of valuable services to\nfacilitate the transfer of aerospace technology to nonaerospace applications ,\nthus assuring American taxpayers maximum return on their investment in\nspace research; thousands of spinoffs of NASA research have already\noccurred in virtually every area of our economy.\nThe TU Program has worked for engineers, scientists, technicians, and\nbusinessmen . And it can work for you .\n\nNASA Tech Briefs\n\nTech Briefs is published quarterly and is free to any U.S. citizen or organization. It is both a current-awareness medium and a problem-solving tool.\nPotential products ... industrial processes ... basic and applied research . ..\nshop and lab techniques . .. computer software ... new sources of technical\ndata . . . concepts .. . you will find them all in NASA Tech Briefs . The first section\nhighlights a few of the potential new products contained in Tech Briefs . The\nremainder of the volume is organized by technical category to help you quickly\nreview new developments in your areas of interest . Finally, a subject index\nmakes each issue a convenient permanent reference file .\n\nFurther Information\non Innovations\n\nAlthough many articles are complete in themselves, others are backed up by\nTechnical Support Packages (TSP\'s) . TSP\'s are available without charge and\nmay be ordered by simply completing the enclosed TSP Request Card . Further\ninformation on some innovations is available for a nominal fee from other\nsources , as indicated at the ends of the articles . In addition , Technology\nUtilization Officers at NASA Field Centers will assist you directly when\nnecessary . (See page A4 .)\n\nPatent Licenses\n\nMany of the inventions described are under consideration for patents or have\nbeen patented by NASA. Unless NASA has decided not to apply for a patent ,\nthe patent status is described at the end of each article . For further information\nabout the Patent Program see page A8.\n\nOther Technology\nUtilization Services\n\nTo assist engineers, industrial researchers , business executives, city\nofficials , and other potential users in applying space technology to their\nproblems , NASA sponsors six Industrial Applications Centers. Their services\nare described on page A6. In addition , an extensive library of computer\nprograms is available through COSMIC , the Technology Utilization Program\'s\noutlet for NASA-developed software . (See page A5 .)\n\nApplications Program\n\nTo help solve public-sector problems in such areas as safety, health,\ntransportation , and environmental protection , NASA TU Applications Teams,\nstaffed by professionals from a variety of disciplines, work with Federal\nagencies , local governments, and health organizations to identify critical\nproblems amenable to technical solutions . Among their many significant\ncontributions are a rechargeable heart pacemaker, a lightweight fireman \'s\nbreathing apparatus, aids for the handicapped, and safer highways .\n\nReader Feedback\n\nWe hope you find the information in NASA Tech Briefs useful .

Unlike belts made of plastic and\npolymeric fibers , the stainless-steel\nbelts can be used in intense heat or\ncold, under intense radiation, and under high loads. In one design, cylindrical rods run transverse to the entire\nbelt length to serve as teeth that mesh\nwith the drivewheel sprockets. The\nrods are secured by steel wires running along the length of the belt. Another proposed belt has U-shaped flexible teeth that engage the wheel\nsprockets. The teeth are connected by\nflexible strips. Where the application\npermits, the belts could be coated with\nplastic or rubber to reduce noise.\n(See page 599.)\n\nAdjustable Gas-Flow\nRestrictor\n\nThe pressure of a confined gas can\nbe reduced and precisely controlled by\na new adjustable flow restrictor . If desired, the gas can also be simultaneously heated or cooled . Developed\noriginally to control oxygen flow In the\nlife-support system of a space vehicle,\n\nA10\n\nthe new device can be adapted to\nother fluid-flow applications, such as\npetroleum processing or food processing . The gas passes through the annular space between two mating\nthreaded parts. The long, narrow, helical path reduces the pressure within a\nshort axial distance, and the pressure\ndrop can be adjusted simply by screwing or unscrewing the threaded members. A heating fluid or coolant can be\ncirculated through the hollow core of\nthe restrictor to control the gas temperature.\n(See page 594.)\n\nImproved Probe for RectalCancer Detection\nAn improved proctosigmoidoscope\nfor inspection of the rectum and colon\nis able to scan ahead and to the side\nfor viewing around intestinal folds . It\nwill make possible more thorough medical examinations by exposing lesions\nand other anomalies that could only be\nseen with a lateral view. The addition of\na third lens, which has a mirrored coating along the perimeter of one surface,\n\nTesting Integrated Circuits by\nPhotoexcitation\n\nLaser light is rapidly scanned over a\ncircuit under test in a new method for\nrapid production-screening of integrated circuits. In an adaptation of a much\nslower photoexcitation technique previously used only for developmental\ntests, the photo response of each subcomponent of the circuit is recorded as\nit is clocked through many digital\nstates. The superimposed images form\na "signature " of the test circuit, which\ncan be compared with a reference to\nmake a rapid online acceptlreject decision. CMOS integrated circuits have already been tested by the procedure,\nwith good results. A HeiNe laser was\nused, and power delivered to the IC\nwas less than about 0.1 milliwatt.\n(See page 474 .)\n\ndistinguishes this instrument from\nthose with conventional two-lens design. The mirrored convex surface reflects the lateral image of the colon\nwall through a space in the body of the\nproctosigmoidoscope. A double image\nis viewed by the operator: He sees a\ncentral image of the frontal view and a\nconcentric ring that contains the side\nview.\n(See page 562.)\n\nFlow-Compensating Pressure\nRegulator\nA flow-compensating pressure regulator maintains a constant pressure at\nits output, despite variations in the infusion flow rate . It can be used with a\nsurgical instrument for the removal of\noptical cataracts and in other applications where fluid pressure must remain\nconstant.

Its antenna patterns show exceptional uniformity and\nsymmetry, varying by less than 1.5 dB\nover most of the forward hemisphere,\n\nF".JllD\n\n.,,"\'"\n\n.-.\n\ndiaphragm is the basic pressure-regulating element. A second diaphragm,\nlocated a small distance below the first\non the same centerline, responds to\nthe pressure drop across an adjustable\nexternal orifice and a parallel internal\norifice near the flow inlet. The force on\nthis second diaphragm is coupled to\nthe regulator valve through a compound lever. The action of the two\ndiaphragms and the lever exactly compensates for the pressure drop in the\nsurgical instrument that controls the\nflow rate.\n(See page 548.)\n\nMiniature Ku\xc2\xb7Band Down\nConverter\n\n.".."-\n\n._-\n\n- . -~\n\nA miniature, hermetically-packaged,\nthin-film microwave integrated circuit\nserves as the complete receiver front\nend (excluding the local oscillator) for\ncompact Ku-band radar and communications systems. The entire circuit is\npackaged in a small hermetically-welded, nitrogen-filled aluminum case. The\ncircuit consists of three stages of FET\namplification, a four-pole Tchebyscheff\nfilter, a balanced mixer, one stage of\nbipolar transistor IF amplification, and\na passive temperature-compensation\ncircuit. Even a voltage regulator is included in the hybrid package. The measured overall noise figure of the converter is approximately 4 dB.\n(See page 473.)\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1978\n\nl \' 6-f\\JRN\nWRAPUNGHt\n(,.TCM DETERMINED\n\nIV ELEMENT LENGTH\nAAOtAl\n\nMINUS\n\nTO BAlUN)\n\nScratch\xc2\xb7Resistant Plastic\nLenses\nHElUl ElEMENT\n\nELEMENT LENGTH\nIS APAOJC tMATELV\n\nTEAMINATION\nIIOPENQACUT\n\n~s~ ~ \' I~EMENT DIAMETER\n\nTO (10- HVSRlO\n\n"\' .. ...1_..\n\n.-\n\n.....UN\n\npolyimide films, with and without reflective or absorptive coatings , the response varied from - 1.5 to - 16\ng/cm 2 - W.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA frequency-stabilizing circuit that\ncontrols the output of a multichannel\nmicrowave oscillator requires only one\nreference crystal oscillator. Conventional stabilization circuits , in contrast ,\nnormally require a separate reference\noscillator for each channel.\nThe new circuit was developed to\ncontrol five Ku-band radar channels for\nthe Space Shuttle, one of which doubles as a communication channel. The\ncircuit stabilizes a Gunn-diode voltagecontrolled oscillator (VeO).\nAs shown in the figure, a single crystal oscillator operates at 156 MHz and\nsupplies a 27-dBm signal to a x 83 multiplier and tuned-cavity filter. The output of the frequency multiplier is mixed\nwith a small portion of the variable-frequency Gunn-diode output to produce\nan intermediate frequency (IF) of between 156 and 364 MHz at - 30 dBm.\nWideband modular amplifiers raise\nthe IF level to drive a phase comparator. The comparator reference input is\na 52-MHz signal that is derived by\ndividing the crystal osdllator output by\n3. (Emitter-coupled-Iogic flip-flops are\nused in this divider.)\nWhenever the Gunn-diode veo\ntunes to a frequency for which the IF\nfrom the mixer equals an integral multiple of 52 MHz, the phase comparator\ngenerates a zero-difference output that\nis used, via a loop filter, to phase-lock\nthe Gunn diode.\nThe channel frequency to which the\nGunn diode is phase-locked is specified by a digital code applied to logic\ncircu itry. A portion of the mixer IF\ndrives five simple filters, each of which\nis followed by a radio-frequency detector. The sweep and log ic circuitry responds to these detectors, as well as\nto a zero-difference detection circu it\nand to the code that specifies the desired channel frequency. The logic ensures that the sweep is stopped , and\nphase lock occurs only when the IF is\n\nNASA Tech Brie fs, W inter 1978\n\nGUNN-DIOOE\nVOLTAGECONTROLLED\nOSCILLATOR\n\nKu-BAND\nOUTPUT\n\nHiS\xc2\xb7MHz\nCRYSTAL\nOSCILLATOR\nAND AMPLIFIER\n\n. 83\nMULTIPLIER\nAND FILTER\n\nMIXER\n\nFILTERI\nDETECTOR\nBANK\n(5)\n\n52 MHz\n\nLOOP\nFILTER\n\nPHASE\nCOMPARATOR\nDC\n\nZERODIFFERENCE\nDETECTOR\n\nSWEEP\n\nLOGIC\n\nCHAN NEL\nSELECTI ON\nCODE\n\nA Voltage\xc2\xb7Controlied Oscillator Is Phase\xc2\xb7Locked to a selected frequency within any of\nfive channels.

Both monitoring schemes utilize two channels for improved reliability.\n\nA new arc detector for protecting\nhigh-power microwave klystron osc illators uses fiber optics connected to a\nremote solid-state light-sensing circuit. The fiber optiCS make it possible\nto place the sensor (a hybrid photodiode/operational amplifier) away\nfrom the RF field and high-temperature areas within the waveguide, preventing false triggering and shutdown\nof the klystron power supply. The new\ndetector is more reliable, smaller, and\nmore sensitive than many other\nsystems that locate the detector in the\nwaveguide .\nThe arc detector and sensing\ncircuit, shown in the block diagram ,\nincorporate two parallel fiber-optic\nbundles. The end of one bundle is\naimed at the klystron output window,\nand the end of the other bundle is\ndirected down the waveguide away\nfrom the window . The opposite end of\neach bundle is coupled to solid-state\nlight detectors . Each light detector has\n472\n\na silicon photodiode and a low-noise\nhigh-speed operational amplifier in a\nsingle package . The detector requires\nonly a \xc2\xb115-Volt power supply , as\ncompared to several hundred volts for\nphotomultipliers . The detector sensitivity is determined by selecting the\namplifier feedback resistor. The output\nvoltage is proportional to the input light\npower . It can be periodically checked\nby placing a small calibrated light\nsource in the waveguide near the fiber\noptics .\nIn addition to the light signal, the\ncircuit monitors the reflected power\nfrom a waveguide directional coupler.\nThis RF power is divided and drives\ntwo crystal detectors . The dc output\nfrom each crystal is applied to the\ninput of a voltage comparator . A\nreference voltage to the comparator is\nset to the value corresponding to\nmaximum allowable reflected power .\nWhen the reference voltage is exceeded , the protective logic circuit is\n\nactivated .\nThe outputs from the light detectors\nand the reflected-power amplifiers are\nfed to two edge-triggered flip-flops\nthat feed two pin-diode drivers . The\ndiode drivers control the crystal\nswitches that turn the klystron power\nsupply on 0 r off .\nThe crystal switches are mounted in\na strip-line circuit and are on when\nthey are conducting (forward biased) .\nWhen both switches are off , they\nprovide 40 dB of attenuation . When\none switch is off , it provides 25 dB of\nattenuation , which is sufficient to\nreduce the RF klystron output to\nextinguisn an arc or to reduce\nreflected waveguide power.\nThis work was done by Edward J .\nFinnegan and Robert A.

Using a " state superposition "\ntechnique , the IC is scanned by a\nnarrow laser beam while being electrically activated through a sequence of\noperating states . The photocurrent\ngenerated in the IC by the light beam\nis displayed on a CRT in synchronism\nwith the position of the beam . The\nresulting image is a " signature" of the\ndevice under test and could be used\nto make an accept/reject decision\nduring production screening.\nThis new approach overcomes a\nbasic problem in using electrical tests\nto screen integrated circuits : the\nbuffering effect of each succeeding\nstage on the preceding stages of a\ndigital IC prevents direct monitoring of\nthe internal operation of the circuit by\nmeasurements at the external terminals . The photoexcitation method is\nalso superior to electron-beam scanning, since it is completely nondestructive (whereas the electron beam\ncan damage the circuit) and does not\nrequire a vacuum chamber .\nAlthough photoexcitation is a\nknown method for testing microcircu its, it has usually not been used for\nproduction screening . This is because\nto be certain that all internal elements\n(such as trans istors and diodes) are\nactive during the tests , many images\nmust be scanned , each with the\ncircuit in a different digital state . This\ngives detailed information about the\ncircu it operation , but it generates a lot\nof data that are not eas ily reduced to a\npass/fail criterion.\nIn the new approach , a set of digital\nstates is selected such that each\ninternal element appears in at least\none of the corresponding photoresponse images. Then a test circu it\n(or program) generates a superposition of the photoresponse images by\nscann ing the dev ice with an opt ical\nscanner as it is being clocked\nrepeatedly through the set of selected\n(the\nstates .

The laser\nbeam is controlled by lenses and\ngalvanometer/mirror scanners, and\nthe light passes through a neutral\ndensity filter that limits the power\ndelivered at the IC surface to less\nthan about 0.1 milliwatt.\nThe photo response signal is\nsensed by a small resistor in series\nwith the negative voltage (or ground)\nterminal of the device under test.

By comparing the phase of the\nsignal with the phase of the power\noscillator , the phase detector can\ndetermine whether the signal is\ncaused by a true short circu it or by a\ncapacitive path . Capac itance between\nthe single ground point and Earth ,\ncreated by powerl ine filters and\ntransformers , produces a signal with a\nleading phase that is rejected by the\nphase detector . On the other hand , a\nshort circu it produces a signal with a\nphase that is the same as that of the\npower osc illator ; in th is case , the\nampl itude and phase detector generates a dc output.\nThe low-pass fi lter and level detector remove ripple from the dc signal\nand determine whether the dc level is\nhigh enough to sound the alarm . A\nhigh resistance , such as that of a\nworker \'s body in contact with the\nbuilding frame , produces a low dc\nlevel that is rejected by the level\ndetector. However , a short ci rcuit or\nlow resistance between the ground\nplate and the building frame produces\na high dc level , causing the level\ndetector to send a logic Signal to the\naud ible alarm and flasher c ircu it.

Writing is very fast ; the\nswitching characteristics of the ferroelectric material allow each line to be\nwritten within a few microseconds .\nThe standard approach used to\naddress a matrix of orthogonal lines is\nto use the full voltage on one y line to\nenable it to accept input data on the x\nlines or line. One-half voltage is\napplied to all other y lines to protect\nthem from being influenced by new\ndata on the x lines or line (i.e .,\nVy\n1, Vx\n1, Vy\n1/2) . A high\nx-line plus voltage would be "no\ndata," and a zero voltage would be\n"data ."\nA high poling voltage is required for\nferroelectrics, and the hysteres is\nloops are not as square as with, for\nexample, ferromagnetic materials . A\ntypical hysteresis loop for ferroelectric materials is shown in the\ndiagram . Note that the one-half select\nvoltage is close to the switching\nvoltage Ec . Repetitive application of\nthe minus-one-half select voltage\nwould have the effect of depoling the\nmaterial from its poled state of + Pr\nand erasing the information stored at\nthe corresponding juncture of x and y\nlines . This depoling process is called\nhysteresis creep , and its electrical\npath is also plotted in the diagram .\nThe difference between the x and y\nvoltages at an intersection creates the\nelectric field , E, across the ferroelectric . The electric field is proportional to (Vy - Vx ) divided by the\nthickness of the ferroelectric . If the\none-half select voltage resulted in an\nelectrical field greater than Ec , the\nprevious polarization history would be\n\n=\n\n=\n\n=\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1978\n\nELECTRIC\nFIELD\n\n-E ..------------~~--------+_--------~~--------_.. +E\n\nHysteresis Loop for a typical ferroelectric memory material Is shown along with\n\npolarity definitions.

By\nmaking the voltage levels Vy\n1,\nVx = 2/3 , and Vy = 1/3 instead of\nVy\n1, Vx\n1, and Vy\n1/2,\nrespectively, the cross-coupling voltage levels are reduced significantly .\nSince hysteresis creep is a function of\nthe number of the voltage pulses and\nthe magnitude of the electric field\n\n=\n\n=\n\n=\n\n=\n\nrelative to Ec , this small improvement\nin the cross-coupling signal levels\ngreatly relieves hysteresis creep .\nThis work was done by Lawrence E.\nTannas , Jr., of Rockwell International\nCorp . for Langley Research Center.\nNo further documentation is available.\nTitle to this invention has been\nwaived under the provisions of the\nNational Aeronautics and Space Act\n[42 U.S.C. 2457(f)] , to the Rockwell\nInternational Corp., 3370 Miraloma\nAve ., Anaheim , CA 92803.\nLAR-11993\n\n479\n\nSimplified Phase Detector\nAlthough it has only a few components, a\nphase detector circuit is linear over 27CJ\' .\n\nNASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nA comparatively simple circuit gives\na dc output voltage that is very nearly\nproportional to the phase difference\nbetween an oscillator signal and a\nreference signal.

The measured output is shown in Figure 2. The\noutput equation holds if the peak\nosc illator and peak reference signals\nare equal , if the phase separation\nbetween the osc illator signal components is 90\xc2\xb0 , and if the diodes are\nlinear (that is , if their characteristic\nexponent n = 1) .\nIf n = 2 (a square-law characteristic), the detector output will be\nsinusoidal instead of a straight line,\nand it will have a 180\xc2\xb0 range between\npeaks instead of the 270\xc2\xb0 range shown\nin Figure 2. Also , if the ratio of the\noscillator and reference peak voltages\nis much greater than or less than 1,\nthe range will similarly be limited to\n180\xc2\xb0.\nThis work was done by Lloyd M.\nHershey of Caltech for NASA\'s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA new digital correlator requires\nonly a few integrated circu its to determine the synchronization of two 24-bit\ndigital words . The modular circu it can\nbe reduced or expanded easily to accommodate shorter or longer words. It\nuses a fully-parallel asynchronous\nstructure for maximum speed without\nspecial clocks, counters, or accumulators, as would be needed for a serial\ncorrelator .\nWith little or no modification, the correlator can be utilized in industrial and\ncommercial data processing and telecommun ications .

If the Hamming\ndistance (the number of disagreeing\nbits) between the received data and\nthe ideal frame is less than 3, a " positive " correlation is discerned; and if\nthe Hamming distance is greater than\n21 , a " negative " cor relation is recognized.\nThe correia tor functions in three\nstages.

It has potential uses in\nradio and televis ion receivers, in\nsignal distribution systems, and in\ntest and measurement instruments .\nThe circuit operates on a form of\npulse modulation by switching the\ninput signal on and off with a duty\ncycle that depends on the widths of a\nseries of pulses . A duty cycle of 100\npercent produces zero attenuation,\nand a zero-percent duty cycle gives\ncomplete attenuation . The attenuation\nvaries linearly with pulse width between these extremes .\nThe input signal is turned on and off\nby an RF switch (see Figure 1) . The\nessential requirement is that the\nswitch have a high on/off ratio ; the\nhigher the ratio, the greater the\nattenuation that is possible before\n\nphase shift starts to build up. (Theoretically , if the on / off ratio is Infinite ,\nthere will be zero phase shift.) With\nPIN diodes, for example, 60 dB of\nattenuation are possible with only a 2\xc2\xb0\nphase shift. Isolation amplifiers ensure\nthat the widely changing impedances\nof the switches do not affect the\nsource, load , or band-pass filter.\nFigure 2 shows the circuit waveforms\nfor a 6-dB attenuator (50-percent duty\ncycle) .\nThe band-pass filter eliminates\nsidebands . When a single-carrierfrequency signal is applied to the input\nswitch , the ac output consists of the\ncarrier and many sidebands spaced at\nthe pulse frequency . The filter\nremoves the sidebands so that the\ncarrier output is essentially the same\nas the input except that the carrier\namplitude is a function of the pulse\nwidth . The filter should be well\nmatched so that the output phase\ndoes not drift with pulse-width\n\nATIENUATED\nRF OR IF\n\nFigure 1.

A feedback loop that\nturns off a transistor in series with the\ndc supply and turns on a parallel highresistance path is sometimes used for\nprotection .

The outputs of the\ncurrent transducers are delivered to a\ncurrent imbalance detector (see\nfigu re) .\nThe output voltage of each parallel\nmodule is controlled by its own pulsewidth modulator, which contains a\ncomparator with an output that is high\nor low dependi.ng on whether the error\nsignal from the converter voltageregulation loop is less than or greater\nthan a triangular reference waveform .\nThe pulse width of each modulator can\nbe adjusted by changing the dc level\nof its triangular reference waveform .\nTherefore a correction signal (the\ndifference between the module output\nand the average output) is developed\n\nby the current imbalance detector and\napplied to the pulse-width modulator\nof an out-of-balance module . This\na dc bias correction signal automatically adjusts the pulse width\nto provide equal load sharing . The dc\nbias affects the pulse width in a\nmodulator in the same way as the\nvoltage-regulation error signal , but is\nin addition to the latter signal and does\nnot affect the operation of the voltageregulation loop .\nThis work was done by Colonel W.\nT.

Another possibility is that water may be generated\nby chemical reactions inside the\npackage .\nThe study found several factors that\ncontribute to the moisture problems .\nThese include :\n-Contaminants. Residues of the\nmicrocircuit manufacturing processes can start reactions that lead to\nmigration . Sodium chloride is particularly problematical. It absorbs moisture in the package and corrodes the\ngold , forming gold chloride and gold\nsodium chloride , both of wh ich absorb more moisture and accelerate\nthe corrosion process .\n- Large Packages . For a given relative\nhumidity at sealing , large packages\ncontain more moisture than small\nones , and thus they have more moisture available to aid corrosion and\ndendrite growth .\n- High Voltage . Voltages above 8 volts\nseem to increase the destructive\neffects of moisture .\n- Narrow Conductor Spacing. The\nwider the space between conductors , the less likely it is that dendrites\ncan bridge the gap . Below about\n0.005 in. (0 .13 mm) , however , the\nmoisture thresholds for migration are\nnot affected by the spac ing .\n- Temperature . A high operating temperature , by preventing the condensation of moisture , may inhibit gold\nmigration . On the other hand , if condensation does occur , high temper-\n\nature will accelerate the reactions\nthat produce migration . Once the\ntemperature drops below the dewpoint of the moisture in the package,\nirreversible processes may start that\ncontinue even after the temperature\nis raised . For example , condensed\nmoisture may start a reaction that\nproduces highly hygroscopic substances that cause gold migration\neven when the temperature is raised\nand the condensate evaporates .\nIt should be possible to prevent gold\nmigration by observing strict precautions during the fabrication of\nhybrids . For example , a dry internal\npackage environment should be ensured , and the package and substrate\nshould be subjected to rigorous\nclean ing procedures . The cleaning\nprocesses should be selected to\nremove specific residues . Materials\nthat might decompose during processing should be eliminated . Proper\nsealing techniques should be used and\ntheir effectiveness should be monitored by leak testing . Moisture sensors\nshould be used to determine package\ndewpoints and to identify the processes that contribute to high moisture\nlevels .\nThis work was done by Aaron\nDerMarderosian of Raytheon , Inc .,\nand Charles R.

Previously, in a conventional superheterodyne receiver in which cascaded band-pass filters decreased\xc2\xb7 the\nbandwidth , the minimum detectable\nsignal was about - 110 dBm with a\n- 5-d B signal-to-noise ratio (noise approxi mately twice the signal amplitude) . With the modified receive r, a\nsignal 35 dB below the noise level can\nbe detected (noise 56 times the signal\namplitude) . The equ iva lent bandwidth\nof the circu it is on ly 0 .159 Hz .\nA re ference signal that is phaselocked with the input signal operates a\nsynchronous switch in the final stage\nof the new receiver . The input (and associated noise) is gated through the\nswitch on ly during a portion of the\nreference cycle . Since the input is\nphase-related to the reference , it is\npassed by the switch with little attenuation . However, noise and signals that\nare not phase-related produce a timeaveraged output of zero . The time constant of an integrating low-pass filter\nthat follows the switch is chosen to\ngive the desired bandwidth. The circuit\ncan demodulate either am plitudemodulated (AM) or phase-modulated\n(PM) signals.\nA block diagram of the improved receiver is shown in Figure 1. The incoming 11 .7-GHz signal is received and\nfirst converted to a 1.05-GHz intermediate frequency that is applied to a\nphase-locked loop. A 10-MHz reference oscillator and a frequency synthes izer deriv e the con trol frequencies for the loop. The loop output , a\n1O.OOOO-MHz signal that has the amplitude- or phase-modulated information\nsuperimposed on it, is applied to a mixer that also receives a synchronous\n10.0025-MHz signal from the synthesizer. The mixer output, a 2.5-kHz difference frequency is amplified and applied to the phase detector (in color)\nalong with a reference 2.5-kHz signal.\n\nRECEIVING\nANTENNA\n\nY\'\'\'.\'GHz)\nRF\nRECEIVER\n(1.05GHZ)\n\n1 - --\n\nI\n\nPHASE-LOCKED LOOP\n-- -- -- -- - - - - - - -- -- -r\n10 MHZ\n\nH 4\n\nFILTER\nAND\nAMPLIFIER\n\n60 MHZ\n\nFILTER\nAND\nMIXER\n\nI\n\n,\n\nL\n\nI\n\nI\n\nFILTER\nAND\nAMPLIFIER\n\nMIXER\n\nx60\nMULTIPLIER\n\nf4-\n\nVOLTAGECONTROLLED\nCRYSTAL OSCILLATOR\n(16.5 MHZ)\n\nrL~_-\'\n\nPHASE\nDETECTOR\n\n~ PASS , .\nLI~E~\n\nL -- -- - - -- - - -- -- - - -\n\nt-\n\n-\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\n- - -~\n\n50 MHZ\nFREQUENCY\nSYNTHESIZER\n\nr- - I LI MITER\n\nI\n\n\'----\n\n10.0025 MHZ\n\nJ\n\nI\n\n. 2.5-kHZ\nSQUARE WAVE\n\n10.000\nMHZ\n\n-\n\n10-MHZ\nREFERENCE\nOSCILLATOR\n\nREFERENCE\n2.5 kHZ\n\nSIGNAL\nLOG\nAMPLIFIER\n\nt\n\nf4-1\n\nLOWPASS\nFILTER\n\n14-\n\nSYNCHRONOUS\nSWITCH\n\n~\n\nAUDIO\nAMPLIFIER\n\n~\n\n,\nMIXER\n\nf4-\n\nPHASE\nDETECTOR\n\nRECORDER\n\nFigure 1.

(Such a fixed-gain channel is\nused because measurement accuracy depends on receiver gain stability .) A mixer translates the IF signals\n\nto baseband , near zero frequency.\nThe frequency synthesizer permits\nthe selection not only of the carrier\nfrequency but of any des ired sideband\nfrequency as well .\nA low-pass filter provides almost\nflat response and sharp cutoff ripple is 0.1 dB and bandwidth is 22\nhertz.

At this bandwidth, the contribution of the signal\n\npower Is negligible, and the total\npower measurement is proportional to\nthe receiver-system noise temperature. (The receiver precalibration\nprov ides the proportionality constant.)\nThe computer accumulates the\nsampled signal data for a predetermined length of time (periods of 4, 8,\nand 16 minutes are used) , then uses\nthe value of noise temperature from\nthe wideband power measurement to\ncalculate the signal power .\nThis work was done by Richard M.\nGo/dstein, John W.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nThe frequency response of a frequency-modulation (FM) receiver can\nbe measured with the aid of a phasemodulation (PM) transmitter instead of\nan FM transmitter, by applying a simple correction to the output power level. As the modulating frequency is increased , the output level obtained in\nresponse to the PM input is monotonically reduced by 6 dB per octave.\nThis technique was developed on an\noccasion when the only FM transmitter\navailable had a modulator bandwidth of\nmerely 200 kHz and it was necessary\nto measure the response of a receiver\nwith a bandwidth of about 8 MHz. A PM\ntransmitter with modulator bandwidth\nof 13 MHz was available to supply test\nsignals to the FM receiver; a network\nanalyzer and a calculator programed\nthe test frequencies and computed a\ngraph of relative output power from the\nreceiver as a function of frequency. A\nblock diagram of the test arrangement\nis shown in Figure 1.\nAn FM transmitter has a modulation\nindex given by M/f ,where M is the frequency deviation (proportional to the\nmodulation amplitude) and fm is the\nmodulation frequency.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nAlthough the conventional nonreturn-to-zero (NRZ) code is the most\nefficient for recording digital data (if\nefficiency is measured by bits to unit\nlength of tape ratio) , it is subject to dc\ndrift and bit slippage whenever long\nstrings of "1 \'s" or "a\'s" are encountered in the data . Codes that insert\ncheck bits in the data to break up long\nstrings alleviate this problem, but only\nat the expense of recording efficiency.\nAlthough some phase-modulated\ncodes are almost as efficient as NRZ,\nthere exist systems that need (for one\nreason or another) to maximize the bit\npacking density . For these cases, an\nimproved code (called J-NRZ) gives\n100 percent of NRZ efficiency yet also\nsolves the dc drift problem . It does so\nby adding check bits in a specified\nformat only when a long string is\nencountered. The rest of the data\nstream is encoded in standard NRZ\nformat.\nOne such system, developed at\nJohnson Space Center, is programed\nto search for 32 consecutive identical\nbits . The playback system is able to\nhandle up to 64 identical bits without\ndrift , ensuring a 2:1 error margin .\nAs shown in the figure, the system\nconverts the input data into NRZ, and\na clock is generated from the data .

Each of\nthe four BO-MHz-bandwidth, 21B-point\nspectrum analyzers accepts BO-MHzbandwidth stochastic signals ; the\ncombination yields a combined bandwidth of 320 MHz and 220 (approximately 1 million) channels _ The\nsignals are analyzed by fast Fourier\ntransform (FFT) techniques .\nThe complete system includes an\nRF receiver , followed by the FFT\nspectrum analyzer and the data\nprocessor _ The analyzer accepts the\nincoming 320-MHz bandwidth and\ndetermines the complex voltageversus-frequency spectrum for 220\nchannels _The data processor records\napproximately 300 samples per second in each channel and decides if\nany interesting event has occurred _ In\nthis process, the first step is to\naverage the spectrum ove r an approximately 1-minute interval to reduce\n\n494\n\nFROM\nSPECTRUM\nACCUMULATOR:\n32 LINES\n32-BIT\nCOMPLEX\nSPECTRA\n11BR. 161)\n\n~-POINT MAGNITUDE\n\nCALCULAnON AND\n32-BIT SPECTRUM\nACCUMULATOR\n\nFigure 2_ The Data Processor receives a complex voltage spectrum from the\nanalyzer.

In multiamplitude and phaseshift transmission systems designed to\nhandle maximum data in minimum\nbandwidth, th~ receiver can recognize\nthe pattern in the signal but cannot\ndiscern whether the elements in the\npattern are "1\'s" or " O\'s ."\nThe new differential-encoding method resolves this ambiguity and does so\nwith little or no penalty in transmission\nrate, error rate , or system complexity .\nThe method has been used in a 4-bit\nmultiamplitude minimum-shift-keying\n(MAMSK) transmission system .\nIn MAMSK , the increase in error\nprobability was very small , as predicted by theoretical analysis (the\n"Gray coding penalty, " was equal to\n4 /3) . Moreover , the only additional\ncircuits required were two ExclusiveOR circuits and an inverter at the\ntransmitter and receiver. These are\nrelatively minor penalities to pay for\nthe elimination of ambiguity .\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1978\n\nThe method is no less applicable to\nquadrature-amplitude shift keying\n(QASK), independent amplitude and\nphase-shift keying (IAPSK), continuous-phase frequency-shift keying\n(CPFSK), and other symmetrical\nsignal patterns . The principle of the\nmethod is that, if signal points are\nproperly encoded and decoded , bits\ncan be detected correctly regardless\nof rotational phase ambiguities . Most\npractical signal sets have a phase\nambiguity, L, which is some power of\n2. A method of differentially encoding\na signal set of M = 2K bits, for which\n2N , is as follows :\nL\n-The Signal space is divided into L\nequal pie-shaped sectors . Any\nsignal point within one of these\nsectors is equivalent in terms of\ndifferential encoding .\n-For each K bits of data , the first N\nbits are encoded as in N-ary PSK\n(phase-shift keying) but with the\n2N signal points replaced by 2N\nsectors .\n-The remaining K - N bits determine\nthe Signal point within the sector.\nThe 2K-N points within the sector\n\n=\n\nmust be Gray-coded to reduce the\nprobability of bit error.\n-The basic idea is that the first N bits\ndefine a change irl sector while the\nremaining K-N bits define the signal\npoint within a new sector.\nThis scheme is consistent with the\nhypothesiS that the best performance\nis obtained by differentially encoding\nas few bits as possible; this practice\nkeeps error propagation to a minimum . The sectors should not be\nselected arbitrarily, but must be\nchosen so that the probability of\nsector error is minimized .\nBecause of the wide variety of\npossible Signal sets, it is not possible\nto derive a general formula for differential encoding . Nevertheless, formulas have been developed for the\nmore common Signal designs and\noften can be extended by fairly Simple\nanalysis to special cases .\nThis work was done by William J .\nWeber III of Caltech for NASA\'s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

The Video ReformaUer uses only twelve 4-bit shift registers , each of which has the capability of serial loading with\nparallel output and vice versa. Therefore , the same elements can perform both the serial and the parallel operati ons of\nreformatting .\n\nA logic circuit for reformatting data\nsignals uses only one set of shift\nreg isters instead of the two sets\npreviously requ ired . Because the new\nreformatter uses fewer integrated\ncircu its than its predecessor , it is\nmore reliable and costs less .\nThe reformatter was developed for\nrearranging television picture data for\nthe Viking spacecraft. The basic\nprinciple is also appl icable to mUltiplexing and frequency-conversion\ncircu its .\nThe new reformatter rearranges the\nindividual bits of a 2,112-kHz serial\ndata stream into a prescribed format\nof seven parallel outputs for record ing\non seven tracks of a magnetic tape\nrecorder . The serial data stream\nconsists of consecutive picture elements (pixels) produced by \'scann ing a\nvidicon ; each pixe l consists of 7 bits ,\nwh ich define shades of gray . The input\n\n496\n\ndata to the circuit arrive bit-serial and\npixel-serial. The ci rcuit converts the\ndata to seven-pixel-parallel , bit-serial\ndata for the multitrack tape recorder ,\nin which seven tracks are allocated to\nthe parallel format data .\nThe usual reformatting circuits\nemploy two arrays of registers :\nIncoming data are loaded into one of\nthe reg ister arrays and are transferred\nto the other . At the time of transfer ,\nthe data are reformatt~d . The data are\nthen serialy sh ifted out of the second\narray in the new format , whi le the first\narray is simultaneously reloaded with\nincoming data .\nThe new reformatter , in contrast ,\nemploys a single set of twelve 4-bit\nsh ift registers . The 12 reg isters are\nintegrated circu its (type 54L95) that\ncan load in parallel and sh ift serially or\ncan shift serially and produce a\nparallel output. The units are connect-\n\ned in series to form a 48-bit shift\nregister (see Figure 1) .\nInput data are presented in blocks\nof seven consecutive pixels . The\nreformatter buffers each block and\nrearranges the bits . Thus , data enter\nserially by pixel and serially by bits\nwithin pixels . They exit in parallel by\nbit groups (all the first bits , followed by\nall the second bits , and so forth) and\nexit serially by pixel within bit groups\n(see Figure 2) .\nThe twelve 4-bit shift registers are\nclocked at the 2,112-kHz data rate .\nThe serial bits are rearranged at the\n48th bit, so that when the 7 bits of a\npixel transfer out of the shift register in\nparallel , bit 1 of the seven pixels in\neach group appears simultaneously at\nthe seven output lines. Then bits 2\nthrough 7 appear simultaneously - in\nthat order . Pixel 1 always emerges on\noutput line 1, pixel 2 on output line 2,\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1978\n\nand so forth, as Figure 2 shows.\nOn the 48th clock, the reformatter\nperforms a parallel load instead of a\nshift . This rearranges the first 48 bits\nof the block in the correct sequence\nfor output. Since only 47 bits have\nentered the register at this time, bit 48\nis parallel-loaded into the proper\nrearranging position. The 49th bit\nsimply shifts along in proper sequence\nand is not needed in executing the\nrearrangement. Other blocks follow\ndirectly behind, with no break between\nblocks. The data flow is always\ncontinuous .\nAs noted, this reformatting concept\nmay be used in other applications,\nsuch as decommutating and frequency division . In decommutating,\nthe bits from any given source are\nalways received at exactly the same\nspot within the serial incoming data\nstream. From this location , they are\nmoved to different locations but\nalways in a predictable pattern . The\nbits are always taken from the\nrearranged locations at the same\ntime.\nFrequency conversion is performed\nsimply by changing from serial to\nparallel. For example , in the reformatter, the incoming 2, 112-kHz bit\nstream is divided by 7 to produce\n301-SI7-kHz parallel outputs. By a\nsimilar rearrangement, other incoming\nrates may be divided into lower rates.\nThis work was done by Alexander\n\nREARRANGE\nON\n48th CLOCK\nBIT\n\no\n\n7\n7\n\n2\n\n~\n\n3\n\n7\n\n1\n\nI\n\n4\n\nI\n\n5\n6\n\nI\n\n8\n\n7\n\nI\nI\n\nDATA\nINPUT\n\nI\nI\n\n7\n6\n\n7\n\n7\n\n6\n\n7\n\n~\n\n5\n4\n\n7\n7\n\n3\n\n3\n\n7\n\n~\n\n-6\'-"~\n\n:\n\n~\n\n2\n\nI\n\n7\n\nI\n\n6\n\nI\nI\n\nI :\n\n1\n\nI\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n~\n5\n4\n3\n\nI ~\nI\n\n4\n3\n2\n1\n\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\n\nI\nL.OATA\nOUTPUT\n\nI I\n- --1--7\n6\n5\n\nI\nI\n\nI\n\n_l_~\n\n48\n\n6\n\nI\n\nI :\n\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n\n6\n\nI\n\nI\n\n41\n\n7\n\n-.2 -l_7_\n\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nj\n\n~\n\nI\nI\nI\n\nTO\nTO\nTO\nTO\nTO\nTO\nTO\n\nTRACK\nTRACK\nTRACK\nTRACK\nTRACK\nTRACK\nTRACK\n\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n\nFigure 2.

Refer to NPO-13676 .\n\nEfficient Rectifying Antenna\nA rectifying antenna features reduced cost, high conversion\nefficiency, and high-power handling capability.\n\nNASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nRecent improvements in rectifyingantenna (rectenna) elements of a\nmicrowave-power transmission sys-"\ntem have resulted in a higher microwave-to-electrical-energy conversion\nefficiency and a better physical structure more suited for quantity production. Tests on the rectenna have\ndemonstrated a new efficiency level\nof 82 percent in converting RF to dc ,\nthe dc exceeding a 30-kW power\nlevel.\nThe rectenna system comprises 17\n\nsubarrays positioned closely together\nto intercept the microwave beam.\nEach subarray has 270 rectenna\nelements to collect and rectify the\nincoming microwave power. Some\nkey improvements in the element\nstructure and in the subarray design\nhave led to better overall system\nefficiency .\nAs shown in a simplified electrical\nschematic , each rectenna element\nconsists of a half-wave dipole\nantenna , a two-section low-pass\n\nmicrowave\nfilter,\na\nhalf-wave\nSchottky-barrier diode rectifier, an\ninductance section to resonate the\nrectifier circuit , a bypass capacitance\nand output filter serving as a microwave short, and a dc bus bar. The\nsliding microwave short, which incorporates a high value of capacitance,\nalso serves as a smoothing filter to\nremove microwave components from\nthe dc output. For improved reliability,\nthe Schottky-barrier diode uses a\nplated heat-sink construction rather\n(continued on next page)\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1978\n\n497\n\nthan the flip-chip construction .\nThe low-pass filter is a most essential part of the rectenna element. It\nserves to attenuate any harmonic\npower that propagates toward the\nhalf-wave dipole where it would be\nemitted as radio-frequency interference (RFI) . Also, it stores energy\nduring the nonconductive portion of\nthe rectification cycle, acting as a\nbuffer between the even flow of power\ninto the half-wave dipole and the intermittent flow of power through the\nrectifier. The characteristic impedance of the filter is matched to the\nimpedance of the half-wave dipole,\nboth about 120 ohms .\nThe rectenna element utilizes\nTeflon machine screws, eliminating\nthe previously-used nylon screws that\ndeveloped mechanical problems due\nto temperature variations. In addition,\neach element is conformal coated to\nprevent corrosion between dissimilar\nmetals. This coating also helps the\nelements to withstand extreme environmental conditions without the use\nof protective radomes . (Radomes add\nsignificantly to system cost and\nweight and make it more difficult to\npredict the rectenna performance.)\nThe elements are arranged in :3\nsubarray in 18 rows, 15 elements to\nthe row. The placement of the\nelements is such that individual\nsubarrays may be interchanged with\none another without altering the\ninterface symmetry . All of the\nrectenna elements in one row are\nconnected in parallel to a common\nbus bar by a machine screw and nut\nwith appropriate insulating washers .\nEach subarray contains a number\nof protection and instrumentation\nfeatures . These include crowbar protection for overvoltage, self-fus ing of\nthe diodes, temperature monitoring,\nand incident-power monitoring . The\ncrowbar is a self-contained protective\ndevice that comes into play when the\nvoltage across the output terminals of\nthe subarray exceeds a value that can\ndamage the rectifier diode . It is\ndesigned to place a short across the\noutput terminals when a preset value\nof output voltage (200 V) is exceeded .\nThe short is automatically removed\nwhen the incident microwave power is\nremoved .\n\n498\n\nTEFLON NUTS\nAND SCREWS\n\n\\\n\nTWO-SECTION LOW-PASS\nMICROWAVE FILTER\n\nHALF-WAVE\nDIPOLE\nANTENNA\n\n1/\n\nINDUCTANCE\nTO RESONATE\nRECTIFIER CIRCUIT\n\nHALF-WAVE\nSCHOTIKY-BARRIER\nDIODE RECTIFIER\n\nBYPASS CAPACITANCE\nAND OUTPUT FILTER\n\nRectenna Element is shown illustrating the mechanical construction and the\nelectrical setup. This element is designed to withstand extreme environmental\nconditions without the use of expensive radomes.\n\nThe self-fusing protective feature of\nthe individual diode immediately removes the diode from the circuit when\nit shorts . Gold wires 1 mil (0 .03 mm)\nin diameter, which internally connect\nthe diode chip to the package cover ,\nprovide this function .\nThe temperature is monitored in\neach subarray with a thermistor . Each\nsubarray contains a thermistor\nmounted on one of the -bus bars . This\nthermistor measures the temperature\nof the bus bar, which also serves as a\nheat s ink for the rectenna elements .\nThe thermistor is enclosed to prevent\nits heating from stray microwave\nradiation .\n\nThe incident-power is monitored\nwith\na\nseparately-instrumented\nrectenna element in every subarray .\nThis element, referred to as a\nsubarray reference element, is used\nin connection with the computer and\ndisplay to measure the incident-power\ndensity .

Th is lightweight surface reflects RF energy well . However, there\nare potential problem areas such as\nthermal distortion and long-term mechanical stability when the film is subjected to ultraviolet radiation.\nThese difficulties can be largely\neliminated by substituting knittedmesh materials for the aluminized\nfilm. These meshes can be produced\nfrom a wide selection of yarns to form\nthe necessary mesh membrane. The\nmaterial used for the reflector surface\nshown in the figure was a gold-andsilver-plated nickel chromium alloy\nknitted mesh . The entire surface is\nmade up of 16 gores , this number\nbeing selected so that two gores could\nbe obtained from standard-width\nmaterial .\nBefore installation the mesh is\nstretched on a special table to pretension it to the desired :circumferential and radial tensions . Next the\ngores are cut to the developed shape\nof the desired cone plus a seam\nallowance .\nThe reflector is assembled by sewing the seams of adjacent gores,\nusing a TFE coated , fiberglass sewing\nthread 0.40 mm (0.016 in.) in\ndiameter . Next , the outside edges of\nthe mesh reflector are trimmed with a\nfiberglass tape 112 in. (1 .3 cm) wide .\nThe mesh reflector is attached at its\ninner diameter to the hub of the support frame by screws installed through\nthe fiberglass trim tape . Because\nthere is no provision for adjustment at\nthe inner hub , this establishes a fixed\nreference circle on the desired conical\nsurface. The intermediate attachment\nring must be adjusted to lie on the\nconical surface of the proper cone\n\nThe Conical Antenna Rellector uses a rigid aluminum frame supporting a knitted\nmetallic-mesh surface.

The\nperformance of the antenna could be\nfurther improved by using special\ntooling in its fabrication to control the\ngeometry of the quadrifilar-helix elements more precisely.\nThe peak circular gain of the\nantenna , when it is scaled up to its\nintended 550-megahertz operating frequency, is expected to be about 2.2\ndB, on the basis of an expected\nefficiency of 71 percent (at the larger\nsize) .

The lower capacity cells\nbecome fully charged or discharged\nearlier than the others during a\ncharging or discharging cycle , liberating gas inside the battery and possibly\nrupturing the cel l.\nA new cell-bypass control system\nsenses low-capacity cells before they\novercharge or overdischarge . When a\ndefective cell is detected , a relay\nautomatically removes that cell from\nthe battery circu it.\nA version of the bypass control\nsystem (see figure) tested for batteries\nto be used on space probes consists of\na multiplexing circuit , a single cell-\n\nvoltage monitor , and an electromagnetic relay for each cell. The multiplexer sequentially applies each cell\nvoltage to the voltage monitor . If a\nparticular cell voltage exceeds the\npreset upper limit (1 .75\xc2\xb10.05 volts for\nthe Ni/Cd batteries being monitored)\nwhile charg ing , or if it falls below the\nminimum (O .90\xc2\xb10.05 volt) while discharg ing , that cell is disconnected\nfrom the battery supply.\nIlluminated lamps indicate which\ncell is being monitored . In addition ,\neach cell may be set or reset by\nmanual switches to override the\nbypass control circuit. The unit spends\n"\'53 ms monitoring each cell and "\'7\nms switch ing from cell to cell ; the 26\ncells are scanned in approximately\n1.7 s.\n\nAlthough th is unit was originally\ndesigned for negative-limited NI/Cd\nbatteries that exhibit a sharp voltage\nrise at the point of 100 percent\ncharge , it could easily be modified to\ndetect the 100-percent charge point in\nmost other rechargeable batteries .

Kennedy Space Center, Florida\nA system for monitoring lightning\nstrikes utilizes an optical data link between the lightning sensor and recording instruments. The data link is thus\nimmune to electrical interference that\ncould be induced in a wire by the huge\nburst of energy in a lightning strike. The\nnonconductive link also protects\npeople and equipment at the datareceiving end from electrical shock.\nThe receiver also includes a data\n502\n\n"compactor" that continuously\nsamples the received signal but records only significant changes in its\nlevel. No data are stored between lightning hits, and portions of a strike in\nwhich the lightning current remains\nconstant over several samples are\nstored only once (after the first such\nsample) along with a time signature.\nThus, the requirements for memory\nspace , printout paper, and magnetic\n\ntape are greatly reduced.\nThe lightning sensor is a coil encircling a long cable (see figure). When\nlightning strikes the cable, it induces a\nvoltage in the coil. This voltage excites\na light-emitting diode (LED) through a\nscaling resistor and full-wave bridge.\nThe LED output is carried by an opticalfiber cable to the reGeiver , where it is\ndetected by a photodiode. A voltage\nthat measures the lightning current is\ndeveloped by the photod iode.\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1978\n\nSCALING\nRESISTOR\n\n---,\nI\n\nOPTICAL-FlBER\n\n~-r-"I/ CABLE\nLED\n\nr - - - - - - - - -,\n\nL-_\n\nI\nI I\nI I\nI I\n\nr-\n\n--~\n\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\n\nDATA\nREOUEST\nSTRIP\nCHART\n\nTRANSMITIER\n\nRECEIVER\n\nI\n\nEVENT\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\n__ _--=-=---.:::~-~=--_---r---+--=--_-=-_--=---=---....:::=\'~\n1---=-\n\nThis Lightning Monitoring System includes an optical-fiber link between the lightning-current transducer and a data compactor.\nCompacted data are transmitted over a telephone communications line for remote processing.\nLightning strokes characteristically\nproduce sharp rises in current that\nreach peaks of about 200 kiloamperes\nduring a 2-microsecond interval. A\nsingle flash of lightning typically contains five such peaks in a O.S-second\ninterval, with each strike receding to\nhalf its peak amplitude in about 50\nmicroseconds. The voltage output of\nthe photodiode dupl icates these\nvariations.\nAn analog-to-digital converter (AOC)\nin the data compactor digitally codes\nthe photodiode voltage and temporarily\nplaces it in a data register. If an incoming word differs from the preceding\nword by a predetermined amount, it is\nstored in the compactor memory along\nwith a number that identifies the time\nat which the word was acqu ired. If the\nnew word does not differ significantly\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1978\n\nfrom the previous word, it is not stored.\nThus, when there are rapid changes in\nthe voltage produced by a lightning\nstroke, the compactor stores many\ndata points. However, when the voltage changes relatively slowly, fewer\npoints are stored. The memory has a\n2,047-word capacity, which is enough\nfor data on about 10 lightning flashes\naveraging 5 strokes each.\nAs soon as the compactor starts to\nstore significant data, it signals a remote data-p(ocessing station that information is available . The remote station requests the information, and the\ncompactor transmits its contents, still\ndigitally coded, over a telephone line.\nAt the remote station, the data points\nand identifying time signatures are\nconverted to analog form, and the\nlightning-current\nwaveform\nis\n\nstructed on an oscilloscope or stripchart recorder.\nA computer at the remote station\ncan process the digital data, if required. An operator at the remote station can control data collection rates,\ndata compaction criteria, data transmission rates, and system sensitivity.\nThis work was done by J.C. Fuchs\nand R.J.

A digital telecommunications network is viewed as a set of\nterminations connected by a set of\nlinks. Each termination consists of\none or more terminals or computers in\nthe same area or city , called the\nterminal city . The main purposes of\nthe network are assumed to be the\n\n504\n\nrapid exchange of information with the\ndata-base system and fast intracity\ncommunications.\nBecause the operating cost of a\ngiven communication network depends on its layout, an initial configuration analysis can often produce\nsignificant cost reductions . By using\nSTACOM , one can employ a modified\nEasu-Williams technique to search for\nthose direct links between system\nterminations and a Regional Switching\nCenter (RSC) that may be eliminated\nwithout impairing system performance.\nInputs to STACOM include traffic\ndata , terminal locations, and functional requirements. During a program\nrun , the network may be divided into\nany number of regions. Each Regional\nSwitching Center can act as both a\nswitching and a data-base center for\nterminals in its region . STACOM first\ndefines regions with nearly equal\ntraffic . Next, an RSC is selected to\nproduce the minimal traffic-distance\nproduct sum. Before optimizing a\nregional network , STACOM constructs an initial " star" network in\n\nwhich each termination is directly connected to the RSC . The regional\nnetwork is optimized by forming a\nmultidrop network in which some lines\nhave more than one termination .\nInterregional networks are formed and\noptimized similarly .\nPrinted output includes initial regional network and optimized network\ncosts and assignments of system\nterminations . If requested , the geographical connections of the optimized network are plotted to detail\nmultidrop line connections to all of the\nsystem terminations .\nSTACOM is written in FORTRAN V\nfor execution in the batch or demand\nmode and has been implemented on a\nUN IVAC 1108 under control of EXEC\n8. The code requires that the system\nsupport subroutine reentrancy .

Most\nflat-plate collectors utilizing either air\nor liquid transport media can be tested\nby the system .\nThe facility simulates Sunfall properties, such as radiation intensity,\nspectrum, collimation, uniformity, and\ndirection . Wind conditions of varying\nvelocity and direction are also reproduced. It is also capable of duplicating\nthe characteristics of the solar-energy\nsystem to which the collector is\nattached, including the transport\nmedium and flow rate, the fluid inlet\ntemperature, and geometric factors\nsuch as collector tilt and azimuth\nangles .\nAs seen in the figure, "Sunlight" is\ngenerated by 40S tungsten/quartz/\nhalogen lamps that duplicate the solar\nspectrum very closely. The lamps are\nrated at 300 W (at 120 V) , and the\ntungsten filament has an equivalent\nsource temperature of 3,3S0\xc2\xb0 F\n(1,843 0 C) . Each bulb is attached to a\ndichroic-coated glass reflector that, in\naddition to directing the light, also\nlimits infrared emission. The lamps\nare mounted in a 27- by 1S-lamp array\nthat irradiates a 4- by 8-ft (1 .2- by\n2.4-m) planar surface area .\nDirectly in front of the lamp array is\na lens housing that holds a Fresnel\nfocusing-lens array (there is one lens\nin front of each lamp). The entire\nlens/lamp array is cooled by room air\nthat is transported across the bases of\nthe lamps. The heated air is collected\nin a tapered plenum and drawn off\nthrough a 2S-in.

Since the regulator has\nparallel output transistors, it can be\nscaled up for high-current solar\npanels simply by adding more transistors.\nThe voltage regulator , shown in\nFigure 1, is connected in parallel with\nthe solar panel. This example shows a\n12-Vdc regulated supply . The 12-V\nreference voltage is set by Zener\ndiode 01 and diodes 02 through 05. A\nresistor R1 in series with the diode\nstring controls the base/emitter bias\non transistors 01 and 02 . When the\nsolar-panel voltage exceeds the 12-V\noutput, the voltage across R1\nforward-biases transistors 01 and\nQ2 . This causes them to conduct\nthrough resistors R2 and R3 . Figure 2,\nwhich shows typical I-V characteristics for a solar array , indicates how\nthe load voltage can be held at 12 V by\ncontrolling the current through the\nshunt.

The extent of\nthe junction space-charge region is\nnegligible compared with the absorption length in most solar"cell materials.\nThe minority carriers created must survive all capturing or annihilating mechanisms to traverse the junction and\njoin the majority carriers in order to\ncontribute to the useful current. Doping levels in the p and n regions are\nhigh to minimize internal cell resistance. Theory and experimental results\nagree well for silicon solar cells .\nGaAs, with a band gap of 1.4 eV as\ncompared to 1.1 eV for silicon, is potentially more efficient in solar-cell\napplications . However , the direct\ntransition of electron-hole pairs means\na very short absorption length and very\nshort minority-carrier lifetimes. It is desirable either to increase the minoritycarrier lifetimes or to avoid generating\nthe carriers in the regions where the\nconduction mechanism is by diffusion.\nIf the carriers could be generated in\nthe electric field region, the problem\nwould be eliminated. GaAs solar-cell\nconstruction based on conventional\ntheory fails to yield high efficiency. In\norder to achieve higher efficiency,\nmodifications such as the use of AlAs\nas a front layer have been tried in the\npast.\n\n(I\nP-REGION\n\nElectron-Hole Pairs generated in the space-charge region.do not tend to recombine.\nSeparation and collection of these electrons and holes occur with virtually unity\nprobability.\n\nA promising new approach is to generate electron-hole pairs primarily in\nthe space-charge region of the junction. The electrons and holes will immediately travel out of the junction in\nopposite directions, as shown in the\nillustration, and become useful majority carriers . In this manner the short-life\nproblem is eliminated, and the conversion of photogenerated carriers to useful current is nearly 100 percent efficient.\n\nWith a typical n-type GaAs material,\na space-charge region can be obtained\nat the surface by applying a very thin\nfilm of a metal such as Pt so that a\nmetallGaAs barrier height of 1 eVexists\nat the surface. The space-charge layer\nwould extend 1 micron inward if the\ndoping level were 10 15 cm - 3.

The use of a constant\nsampling interval presumes that the\nscanning velocity of the interferometer\nremains constant. In any real system,\nhowever, there will be velocity fluctuations that can lead to errors .\nOne conventional way to overcome\nthis problem is to put a feedback loop\ninto the system . In this approach, a\nreference monochromatic laser of\nknown wavelength is scanned at the\n\nsame time as the unknown light\nsource . Since the reference wavelength is known, the time between\nsuccessive intensity maximums or\nminimums at a set velocity is also\nknown. Any shift in this timing\nprovides the error Signal for the loop .\nHowever , since this approach is not\ntotally effective , a new proposal has\nbeen devised to eliminate residual\nfluctuations .\nThe new concept would compensate for velocity changes by multiplying the detector output by a signal\nproportional to the scan velocity . A\nvelocity-sensing circuit detects the\nscan velocity by monitoring the signal\n\nfrom the reference laser. Any increase\nin the velocity , which would lower the\nintegrated Signal strength , is compensated for by an increased signal from\nthe velocity circuit. Conversely , a\ndecrease in velocity would raise the\nintegrated output signal and would be\noffset by a smaller signal from the\nvelocity-sensing ci rcuit. In this way\nthe output signal is made nearly\nvelocity independent.\nThis work was done by Rudolf A .\nSchindler of Caltech for NASA\'s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

However,\nthis design had excessive mechanical\nhysteresis , making the deflectionversus-current characteristic dependent on whether the current setting was\napproached from above or below. In\n\naddition, there was a dead zone of\nabout \xc2\xb15 percent around each current\nsetting, corresponding to a displacement error of as much as 0.0025 mm\n(1/4 wavelength) at 10.6 microns.\nThese problems were solved by substituting steel springs for the rubber\nones and by redesigning the moving\nelement to minimize friction .\nMagnetic hysteresis affects the\nperformance of the transducer less\nthan mechanical hysteresis because\nm~ch of the magnetic flux is located in\nthe airgap. Magnetic hysteresis was\nnot noticeable with ferrite cores , but\nwas significant with steel cores made\nof cold-rolled stock.

The earlier version, deSigned\nfor atmospheric sampling experiments , used a standard full feedback\nloop to control the speed of the leadscrew actuator in one arm of the interferometer . In the new system , the lead\nscrew is run open loop by a synchronous motor that has its speed\naccurately controlled by a crystal\noscillator . Short-time-period velocity\nvariations are sensed by detecting the\nfringes from a reference laser beam\nthat has gone through the interferometer. These variations are compensated for by moving-coil and piezoelectric actuators and their servos .\nWith these changes the overall system\ndesign can be simplified with no\ndegradation in performance .\nAs shown in the illustration, the\nprimary scanning is provided by a\nlead-screw-driven cat\'s-eye retroreflector. In this system , the lead screw\nis driven by a synchronous motor or a\nstepping motor . To accelerate the\nmotor and lead screw at the start of\nthe scan , the drive frequency is\ngradually brought up to the required\nscan velocity. Thereafter , the motor is\ndriven by an accurate , crystal-controlled frequency source , which, along\nwith a precision-ground ball-screw\nand ball-nut assembly with antibacklash compensation , ensures high\nvelocity stability at low frequencies .\nTo correct for the inevitable velocity\nvariations at frequencies above approximately 5 to 10Hz, two additional\npath-difference error-correcting actuators are used. A moving-coil actuator\ndrives a bending mirror in one of the\ninterferometer arms to correct for\nvariations in the frequency range from\n5 to 500 Hz , and piezoelectricallydriven secondary mirrors in the cat\'seyes correct for variations above\n500 Hz.\nThe velocity variation is sensed by\ndetecting the fringes from a reference\n\nTUBUlAR PIEZOELECTRIC\nTRANSOUCERS\n\nI CArS-EYE\nSECONDARY\nMIRRORS\n\nI\n\nL\n\n--,\n\nDRIVE\nAMPliFIER\n\n14iJ=J=~----,\n\nI\nI\nI\nL - - -----Ho-r\'t\n\n1 9---f:~\n\nI\n\nMOVING-COIL\nMIRROR\n\n-it\nI\n\nI\nI\n\n(I\n\n,,)\n\nI\nI\nI\n\n19=A--<\n\nI\nI\nI\n\nI\n\nl~\n\nI\n\nMOTOR-DRIVEN\nLEAOSCREW FOR\nCArS-EYE RETROREFLECTOR\n\nIn this Velocity-Scan Servosystem , the lead screw is driven open loop from a\nfrequency-stable current source.

This signal is lowpass filtered to remove ripple and then\n\nis ac coupled to the moving-coil and\npiezoelectric actuators . The crossover frequency of the ac coupling for\nthe moving-coil actuator is less than\n10Hz and is about 250 Hz for the\npiezoelectric actuator .\nIn operation , if the lead screw turns\nat a constant rate, no change in the\nfringe-velocity signal will occur , and\nthe moving-coil and piezoelectric\n(continued on next page)\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1978\n\n517\n\nactuators receive no signal.

As is the case\nmore often than not, however, certain\npractical difficulties have to be overcome before theory can be reduced to\npractice . In building a frequency\nstandard, a problem that must be\nfaced is the so-called " wall shift" in\nfrequency caused by collisions between the hydrogen atoms and the\nwalls of the container .\nVariable-volume hydrogen masers\nhave been suggested as a way of\ncorrecting for the wall shift. In these\ndevices , the frequency is measured at\ntwo or more volumes to determine the\ndependence of the shift on mean free\npath ().) . This dependence is then\nextrapolated to ). = <Xl to find the\nunshifted frequency . In most previous\nmasers , however , the expansion and\ncontraction of the variable volume\nmay introduce stresses in the wall that\naffect the wall shift in a way that\ncannot easily be accounted for when\ndetermining the frequency correction .\nAnother problem is the introduction of\ninstabilities in the maser frequency\nthat make 1 part in 1014 measurements difficult if not impossible .\nIn a proposed new variable-volume\nmaser , the wall shift could be\naccurately determined , and a frequency standard with an accuracy of 1\npart in 10 14 would be possible . As\nshown in Figure 1, the new maser has\na fixed-volume section inside a microwave resonant cavity. The variable\nvolume , outside the cavity, is enclosed by a flexible sheet of Teflon in\nthe shape of a truncated cone . A\nmetal baffle separates the fixed and\nvariable volumes and contains the\nmicrowave field within the cavity .\nApertures in the baffle allow hydrogen\natoms to move freely between the\nvolumes .

The variable-volume section\nexternal to the cavity ioS made of thin, flexible Teflon shaped in the form of a\ntruncated cone. For best stability and accuracy, the length-to-diameter ratio of the\nmicrowave cavity should be at least 2 to 1.\nAs shown , the variable volume has\ntwo stable positions: one with the cone\n"folded " inward and the other with the\ncone folded outward . With this design ,\nstresses on the walls are essentially\nthe same for either configuration\n(except for a negligible area near the\nfolded-over edges). and thus they do\nnot affect the wall shift. Also , the\ndesign allows a large change in\nvolume between the two states , which\nimproves the accuracy when correcting for the wall shift. Since the variable\nvolume is external to the cavity,\nchanges in the maser volume do not\ndestabilize the cavity resonance .\nTo use the maser as a frequency\nstandard , the wall shift is measured at\ntwo temperatures and at the two\nvolumes (see Figure 2) .

Included in\nthe 82-page report are design, performance , and hardware specifications in sufficient detail to assemble\nthe system and to allow architectural\nengineers and contractors to procure,\ninstall, operate, and maintain it.\nThis system is intended for use in a\nsmall , single-family dwelling where a\nroof-mounted collector is not feasible\n(because of lack of space or other\nrestrictions) . A prototype unit has 203\nsquare feet (18 .7 m 2) of effective\ncollector surface and 113 cubic feet\n(3 .1 m 3 ) of rock storage . Expansion or\nreduction of the collector array and\nthe storage bed is possible in 68-ft2\n(6 .2-m 2) and 37-tt 3 (1 .0-m 3 ) increments , respectively .\nThree modes of operation are\npossible , to maintain three different\nair-circulation loops : (1) collector-tostorage, (2) collector-to-Ioad, and (3)\nstorage-to-Ioad . Airflow is controlled\nby two blowers and two dampers .\nSolar energy is collected in modes 1\nand 2; space heating is generated in\nmodes 2 and 3.\nWater is siphoned in the domestichot-water preheat loop between the\nair-to-water heat exchanger and the\npreheat tank . The domestic hot water\nis heated , primarily in mode 1, when\nair temperatures in the heat exchanger are hottest ; however , when the air\ntemperature into the heat exchanger is\nhigher than the preheat-tank water\ntemperature , the water may also be\nheated in modes 2 and 3.\n\nAt a projected demonstration\nsite for the prototype in Clinton,\nMississippi , the system is expected to\nsupply 48 percent of the total buildingheat requirements (35 percent of\nspace heat and 68 percent of heat for\ndomestic hot water) . For this system ,\nthe hot-water demand is 130 gal I d\n(492 lid) , the domestic-hot-water\ntemperature is 140 0 F (60 0 C). and\nthe peak heating load is projected at\n30,604 Btu (32 .3X 106 J) .

The tests were\ninitiated to verify that the collector\nmeets U.S. Housing and Urban\nDevelopment\n(HUD)\nDepartment\nStandards for " thermal stability ." The\ntest program consists of three parts :\n(1) initial thermal performance ; (2)\n\n524\n\n30-day stagnation ; and (3) final\nthermal performance .\nThe test item is a modular nonmetallic single-glazed liquid solar\ncollector that is designed for field\nassembly. It consists of 30 closelyspaced\nelastomeric\ntwin\ntubes\ncemented to an insulating base and\ncovered with flexible plastic . The\npanel is 4 ft (1 .2 m) wide by up to 25 ft\n(7 .6 m) long . The length can be\nselected to meet the requirements of\nthe building in which the system is\ninstalled.\nThe initial thermal performance test\nconsists of four parts :\n- Preconditioning . The collector is\nfilled with water , and the inlet is\nsealed . Then the panel is held in a\nnonoperational stagnation mode in\nwhich the water is allowed to evaporate. The stagnant collector is\nexposed for 3 days to cumulative\nsolar radiation of at least 1,500\nBtu/ft 2 /day (4.73x1Q-3 cal/cm 2 /s) .\n- Time Constant. The transient response of the collector to a step\nchange in insolation is measured .\n- Instantaneous Efficiency. The collector efficiency is determined as a\nfunction of solar radiation flux,\nambient temperature , and fluid inlet\ntemperature .\n- Incident-Angle Modifier. The efficiency is measured for solar radiation\nincident at 30 \xc2\xb0 , 45\xc2\xb0, and 60\xc2\xb0 with\nrespect to the normal to the collector.\nPossible materials or construction\nproblems are identified during the\n30-day stagnation exposure tests that\nfollow the initial thermal performance\ntests. During this period, the stagnant\nwater-filled collector is exposed to\n1,500 Btu/ft 2 /day solar flux. A 4-hour\nexposure to 300 Btu/ft 2 /h (0 .0227\ncal/cm 2 /s), after boilout of the water ,\nis made at least once . The physical\nappearance of the collector is monitored, and data on ambient temperature, wind , and precipitation are\nrecorded .\nThe final thermal performance test\ndiffers from the initial test in that there\nis no preconditioning , no timeconstant measurement , and no\nincident-angle modifier measurement.\nThe efficiency measurements are\nmade at 12 test points instead of the\nminimum of 16 points in the initial\nsequence.\nA special test of the instantaneous\nefficiency at four points , with the\n\ncollector glazing removed , was carried out.

The test results are described\nin a new report. Four of the inhibitors\nare proprietary products available\nfrom commercial vendors ; most are\nbased on sodium salts, including\nnitrates , borates , silicates , and phosphates. The 12 were evaluated for\ntheir abilities to protect aluminum ,\nsteel , copper , and stainless steel at\ntemperatures typical of those encountered in a solar-heating system .\nTest specimens were cleaned and\nimmersed in solutions of the inhibitors\nin a corrosive aqueous solvent (containing sodium chloride, sodium sulfate, and sodium bicarbonate) . The\ntest assemblies were made by drilling\na small hole in one end of each\nspecimen . Aluminum , steel , copper ,\nand stainless-steel specimens were\nplaced on a screw, with a stainlesssteel nut between adjacent specimens\nto act as a separator and to insure\nelectrical contact. The assemblies\nwere immersed in 450 ml of the test\nsolutions (contained in Erlenmeyer\nflasks) and the flasks were placed in\nhot-water baths (at 80\xc2\xb0 C) .\nThe assemblies were removed from\nthe solutions and placed in empty\ncovered flasks each working day for 8\nhours (to simulate a system drained\nat night during the winter to preven\nfreezing) . Each specimen was visually\ninspected each day , and the solution\nlevel was maintained by the addition\nof distilled water to insure constant\nsolution concentration . After 1 year of\nexposure, the assemblies were\nremoved , disassembled , cleaned ,\nand weighed .\nEvaluation of the corrosion inhibitors was based on the corrosion\nprotection they afforded aluminum\nand mild steel because neither copper\nnor stainless steel was significantly\ncorroded in any of the solutions or in\nuninhibited water . The inhibitors are\nrated in three categories according to\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1978\n\nprotection afforded aluminum, protection afforded mild steel , and protection afforded a combination of the two .\nTwo inhibitors were found to be\nvery effective for aluminum and steel\nunder the conditions of this test and\nare recommended for consideration in\nmulti metallic solar-heating and cooling systems . Their evaluation under\nsimulated or actual service conditions\nis recommended . Two others show\npromise , but neither protected aluminum , and additional testing is required\nbefore they can be recommended .\nFor systems where aluminum components are not corrosion-critical , two\nof the inhibitors may give adequate\nprotection, and another may be\nconsidered for systems having no\ncorrosion-critical steel parts . An allstainless-steel , copper, or combination system is probably the most\ncorrosion-resistant , but the cost may\nbe prohibitive .\nThis work was done by T.

The results are\npresented in a table that lists the\nstandard free-energy change , the\nequilibrium constant , and the heat of\nthe reaction , all calculated for a\ntemperature range of 100 to 1,600 K.\nAn analysis of these data indicates\nthat silicon CVD is an irreversible and\nexothermic reaction over a wide\n\ntemperature range . It is promising for\ndevelopment as an economical commercial process .\nThe chemical-vapor deposition consists of several physical and chemical\nsteps ; however, the exact mechanisms are not completely understood .\nIn the study , rate expressions were\nderived for every conceivable elementary step . The elementary steps were\nconveniently grouped into six categories : (1) mass transport of silane\nand hydrogen , (2) homogeneous pyrolysis of silane, (3) homogeneous\nnucleation of silicon, (4) heterogeneous pyrolysis of silane , (5) heterogeneous nucleation of silicon, and (6)\nsilicon crystal growth .\nThe actual mechanism of silicon\nCVD is thought to consist of three or\nmore of these six categories . The\ncontrolling step depends on the\nreaction temperature and on the silane\nconcentration. The experimental evidence leads to some general conclusions about silane pyrolysis : The\nreaction is predominantly homogeneous at temperatures between 300\xc2\xb0\nand 500\xc2\xb0 C and is predominantly\nheterogeneous at higher tem peratures\nbetween 500 \xc2\xb7 and 1,200\xc2\xb0 C; the\nheterogeneous reaction is a diffusionlimited process above 1,000\xc2\xb0 C; and\nthe crystal structure of the deposited\nsilicon depends strongly on the substrate temperature . All of these\nfactors are taken into consideration in\ndeveloping rate expressions for the\nCVD process .\nTwo basic elements needed to use\nthe rate expressions to formulate the\nglobal state of silicon CVD from the\nelementary steps are the exact mechanism of silicon CVD and numerical\nvalues for the various constants in the\nrate expressions. Numerical values of\nthe coefficients and constants are\nreported in the literature , or they can\nbe estimated . If one of the steps is\nparticularly slow, it can be designated\nas the rate-limiting step, and the\nremaining steps can be assumed to\noccur at equilibrium conditions . The\nrate of the limiting step will then be the\nglobal rate .\nThis work was done by George C.\nHsu, Ralph Lutwack, and Ananda K.\nPraturi of Caltech for NASA\'s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

In one\nLandsat image there are 7,581,600\npicture elements (pels) . Each pel\ncorresponds to a particular location of\napproximately 80 meters resolution in\nthe ground scene and is represented\nby a four-dimensional vector . The four\ncomponents of this vector correspond\nto the reflected light intensity of the\nground location in each of four different spectral bands . This program\nidentifies and counts the number of\nunique multispectral vectors that\noccur in a Landsat image . It also\ncounts the number of times that the\nunique vectors are repeated in the\nimage . Thus the program computes a\nfour-dimensional histogram of the\n\n526\n\nLandsat multispectral image data.\nThis histogram is a measure of the\ncomplexity of the image data and can\nbe used to predict the most costeffective and accurate procedures for\nregistering , compressing , and classifying the image data .\nMultispectral image handling and\nprocessing can be enhanced by\nexpressing the image data in histogram format. The histogram format is\nobtained by extracting all of the unique\nvectors and their number of occurrences from a Landsat image. The\nimage is described at each pictureelement location by one number ,\nwhich identifies the unique fourdimensional vector that belongs there .\nImportant cost reductions for most\ntypes of processing can be realized by\nprocessing each unique vector once\nand applying the results to the pictureelement locations with a table lookup\nprocedure. In the histogram format ,\none obvious way to reduce processing\ncost significantly is to reduce the\nnumber of unique vectors in an image\nand approximate an image with a\nreduced vector representation. Statistical results indicate that 30 to 50\npercent of the unique vectors only\noccur once in an entire image, 12 to\n16 percent occu r twice , and 7 to 10\npercent occur three times . By appropriately combining the vectors that\noccur a relatively few times with their\nnearest spectral neighbors , significant\ncost reductions can be achieved .\n\nAs a means for ordering the different vectors , it would be convenient if\neach different four-dimensional vector\ncould be represented by a unique\nnumber for a table lookup procedure in\na way that would not waste computer\nmemory . It would be even more\nconvenient if these single numbers\ncould be consecutive integers starting\nwith " 1" and ending with a maximum\nnumber that can be determined from\nthe amount of memory available .\nIt is not possible to assign a unique\nnumber to all of the possible unique\nvectors since it is not possible to count\nall the vectors with most computer\nsystems . It is possible , however, to\ncount a considerable number of\ndifferent vectors if each different\nvector is assigned an identifier number\nthat is "approximately unique ." This\n"approximately-unique "\nidentifier\nnumber is derived by means of a\ndivisor, base , and multiplier technique . The program can handle up to\n40,000 unique vectors in this manner .\nThis program is written in FORTRAN\nIV for the IBM FORTRAN H compiler\nand has been implemented on an IBM\n360 with a central memory requirement of approximately 350K of 8-bit\nbytes.\nThis proJram was written by Robert\nR.

Now ,\nPSI fabrics also can be made\nextremely light in weight by a new\nprocess that produces ultra-Iowdenier PSI fibers . Filaments having\ndeniers as low as 0.17 (that is,\nweighing 0.17 gram per 9,000 meters)\ncan be made in five-filament yarns of\n0.80 denier. In contrast , conventional\nPSI fibers are at least 1.5 deniers, and\nyarns often range from 75 to 15,000\ndeniers .

Because it is\nhighly reflective , however, aluminum\nneeds a coating of a light-absorbing\nmaterial to function effectively in such\napplications as space heating and\nwater heating.\nNow, a method has been developed\nfor forming an absorptive coating from\nthe\ncopper component of an\naluminum / copper alloy . The coating\nconsists of copper oxide and has solar\nabsorption characteristics similar to\nthose of the best previously available\ncoating , black chrome (see figure).\nThe copper oxide coating , however, is\nmuch simpler and less costly to\nproduce .\nSheet aluminum alloy with high\ncopper content (6 percent or more) is\nused as the starting material. One\nsurface of the sheet is etched in\nsodium hydroxide solution , and a\nmatrix of small copper oxide granules\nforms on the surface . If the aluminum\nsheet has been previously tempered\n(2219-T87 aluminum alloy, for example) , the copper oxide forms as a\ncoherent (i .e., continuous, nongrainy)\nlayer .

After immersion in a solvent such as acetonitrile,\nthe acrylics dissipate 50 to 70 percent\nof an induced electric charge within 1\nminute , yet they retain their optical\nclarity . The antistatic properties remain even after the treated plastic has\nbeen washed , rubbed , and exposed to\nvacuum .\nThe treatment solves persistent\nproblems associated with charge\nbuildup on PMM plastics used in\ncommercial applications . In aircraft ,\nfor example , prolonged and repeated\ncharge accumulations have caused\nwindows made of PMM to fracture;\nand in hospitals , electronic equipment\ncases and covers made of PMM have\nbeen a fire hazard. especially when\nthe equipment is used near oxygen\nsupply lines .\nVarious solvents were studied as\npossible antistatic agents for PMM\n(see table) . Only acetonitrile and\nnitromethane , however , were found to\ndissipate static charge without destroy ing the optical clarity of the\nplastic . It is conjectured that the low\nmolecular weight of these solvents\nallows them to penetrate the acrylic\nester matrix, so that they cannot be\nremoved easily from the plastic. The\nelectrochemical properties of the\nabsorbed solvent (high electron affinity . large dipole moment, and polarizability) probably help to screen\nintermolecular potential barriers between PMM molecules, ailowing\n\n534\n\nSolvent\n\nDissipation of\nStatic Charge\n\nacetonitrile\nnitromethane\npropanol\ndimethyl sulfoxide\nbenzene\nethyl acetate\nethylene glycol\nacrylonitrile\n\nyes\nyes\nno\nyes\nno\nno\nno\nno\n\nOptical\nClarity\n\ngood\ngood\ngood\nbad\nbad\nbad\nfair\nbad\n\nComparison of Measured Antistatic Optical Properties of treated po lymethacry late ,\nusing various solvents, as descri bed in the text\n\ncharge to flow more readily .\nThe solvent can be applied by\ndipping , brushing, spraying, or immersi on.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA thin coated-felt insulation tile has\nbeen shown to be a lighter and easierto-install replacement for silica tiles .\nDuring the design of NASA\'s Space\nShuttle Orbiter, the felt insulation was\ndeveloped as a potential replacement\nfor low-temperature reusable surface\ninsu lation (LRSI) made of silica .\nAt temperatures under 700 0 F\n(370 0 C) , silica tiles of the minimum\ndurable thickness (about 0.5 cm)\nwould overprotect the Orbiter , thereby\nadd ing unnecessary weight. The felt\ntiles could not only be made thinner\nand lighter but could be applied in\nlarger sheets (1 by 2 meters) to save\ntime, and they are flexible to accommodate buckling and conform to\ncurved surfaces.\nThe felt is a commercially-available\nmodified nylon-fiber material. For use\n\nas insulation , it is pretreated and\ncoated . The pretreatment is exposure\nto 750 0 F (400 0 C) to prevent adverse\nshrinkage during service . The felt is\nheated in five incremental steps to\ndrive off volatiles that might otherwise\nburn in the presence of oxygen .\nFor application as a reusable\ninsulatil)n tile , the felt must be coated\nto prevent charring, to waterproof it,\nand to give it the needed optical\n(thermal) properties . An elastomeric\nsilicone , pigmented with Ti02, meets\nthese requirements , giving the tile a\nsolar absorptance-to-emittance ratio\nless than 0.4 , and also imparts a\nrelatively-smooth aerodynamic surface . The coating is applied and\nallowed to cure at room temperature\n(with a 15-minute postcure at 650 0\nF/345\xc2\xb0 C) .\n\nThe felt thickness can be from 0.16\nto 0.4 in. (0 .4 to 1 cm) as dictated by\nthe local structural heat sink , the\nexpected maximum heat load , and\nother considerations . It can be appl ied\nto the surface to be insulated with a\nroom-temperature-vulcanizing\nadhesive .\nThis work was done by Robert L.\nDotts , Robert J. Maraia , James A .\nSmith , Ivan K.

It is estimated that any increases in processing time or costs as a result of the\npretreatment would be more than\noffset by the improved efficiency of\nthe subsequent conversion .\nThe new process is an extension of\nthe one reported on page 199 of NASA\nTech Briefs, Vol. 2, No . 2, " LowTemperature Coal Desulfurization "\n(NPO-13937) , in which coal powder is\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1978\n\noxidized by chlorinolysis , leached with\nwater , and then recovered in a\ndechlorination step . In the new process , a solvent-refining step is added\nfollowing an initial mild oxidation treatment (such as chlorination) , with the\nresult that the end product has a low\nash content. No effective treatment\nfor removing ash had been demonstrated in the earlier process .\nThe process , as outlined in the\nillustration , is initiated as the coal\nstructure is loosened up through lowtemperature oxidation . This step penetration of soluent into the coal\nmatrix also modifies the coal\nsolubility parameter so that it can be\ndissolved by proper solvents at a\nrelatively low temperature and at\n\natmospheric pressure .\nThe chem ically treated coal is\nextracted with a common solvent such\nas tetrahydrofuran (THF) at 66 0 C and\natmospheric pressure for less than 4\nhours . The THF is an effective\nsolvent at these low temperatues and\nis easily removed and recovered .\nOther organic solvents may also be\nsu itable .\nThe resulting slurry is filtered to\nremove undissolved mineral matter\nand is then distilled to recover the\nTHF solvent for recycling . The sol id,\nafter extraction , filtration , and dis tillation (or evaporation), contains most\nof the organic matter and 20 percent\nof the original mineral content.

The final product retains only a\nsmall amount of residual chlorine\n(less than 0.3 percent) , contains very\nlittle sulfur with essentially no inorganic sulfur , and is expected to be\nnoncaking and nonswelling .\nThe economical features of the\nprocess are its use of relatively low\ntemperatures and recyclable solvent.\nFurther cost savings are realized in\nsubsequent coal gasification or liquefaction. In both processes there is\nreduced hydrogen consumption due to\nthe cleaner coal . An earlier problem of\nsolid separation during coal liquefaction is eliminated due to the low\nash content of the pretreated coal.\nFinally, a costly step of scrubbing in\ncoal gasification and liquefaction to\nremove H2S is also avoided .\nThis work was done by Partha S.\nGanguli and George C.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nIn an accelerated purification process for colloidal silica sols , the waiting\ntime between deionization cycles is\nreduced from several months to a few\ndays . The process produces the same\nhigh-purity silica sol as the previous ,\nmore time-consuming method . The\nkey to the new technique is the use of\nelevated temperatures to accelerate\nthe removal of Na+ ions following the\nfi rst deionization .\nHigh-purity silica sol is a binder for\npure silica fibers in reusable surface\ninsulation . The sol must retain its\namorphous structure if the insulation\nis to be stable at high temperatures . A\nmajor contaminant and destabilizing\nfactor is sodium , which is used in the\n\n536\n\nprocessing of colloidol sols . It is\nderived either from sodium silicate or\nfrom high-pressure/high-temperature\nprocessing in which NaOH prevents\ngelation . At high temperatures , the\nsodium devitrifies the structure into\ncrystalline phases, such as cristobalite , degrading the cohesiveness of\nthe binder .\nThe objective of the purification\nprocess is to reduce the Na20 content\nfrom around 2,300 ppm to a purified\nlevel of less than 300 ppm . In the\nconventional approach , a quantity of\nsol is treated by column deion ization\nto remove Na+ by ion exchange . This\nis followed by a 30-day storage at\nambient temperatures to allow resid-\n\nual Na+ tQ migrate to the surface of\nthe silica particles . The process is\nrepeated in three additional ionization\ncycles requiring 30-day intervals\nbetween each .\nThe new process was developed\nafter a series of experiments . The first\napproach - heating the product prior\nto the first deionization - showed no\nimprovements . Significant improvement , however , did occur when heat\nwas applied following the first deionization cycle , and the particle diameters were about 15 Jim . The purified\nsol was obtained after about 48 hours\nat 134 0 F (57 0 C) and in 8 hours at\n1700 F (7r C) .

The particle diameter of silica is about 15 /lm. The Na20-ppm\ncontent is based on ignited weight, and the percent of cristobalite formed after 4\nhours at 2,300\xc2\xb0 F (1,260\xc2\xb0 C) indicates the stability of the product at elevated\ntemperatures.\n\nsol at elevated temperatures further\nreduced purification times to 3 hours\nat 1700 F. The new process and\nresults are compared with the previous method in the figure.\nOther alternatives have also been\nexamined. One, for example, involves\ngrowing the colloidal particles from\nparent silica acid stabilized with an\namine rather than the NaOH . This\nprocess, however, is limited to particle sizes of only about 4 ",m . Another\nion-exchange process, using a recycling, pressurized heating system to\nbuild up sols with 15- to 150-",m\nparticle sizes, does not meet the highpurity standard but is of interest In\nparticle-growing systems evolving\ncolloidal silica solutions .\nThis work was done by E.

Nonetheless , stainless steel\nis attractive as a substrate because of\nits durability .\nRecently, quality zirconium oxidePAA membranes have been made\ndirectly on stainless-steel substrates ,\nusing a dilute aqueous solution of\nsodium nitrate and zirconium nitrate.\nThe solution is circulated through a\nporous stainless-steel tube .\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1978\n\nA water solution of 0.01 to 0.05\nmolar sodium nitrate and about 0.04\ng/l of zirconium nitrate (at a pH of\nabout 4) is circulated through a\nporous stainless-steel tube having\npore ratings (based on absolute\nparticle retention) of 0 .2 to 10\nmicrons . An inert "filter aid" , such as\npowdered carbon , may be included in\nthe process.\nAfter a period of time ranging from a\nfew seconds to several hours, depending on the pressure , flow through\nthe tube pores diminishes to an\naverage rate of from 10-4 to 5X10- 3\nmls at an applied pressure of 4X10 6\nto 7X106 N/m 2 , and the electrical\nconductivity of the throughflow becomes 4 to 40 percent lower than\nthe feed-flow conductivity. These\nchanges indicate that the zirconium\noxide membrane has been formed .\nNitric acid then is added to the\nsolution to reduce the pH to 2. Also,\n50 ppm of polyacrylic acid are added .\nThe pH is then slowly raised to neutral\nby adding sodium hydroxide, at which\ntime the procedure is complete .\n\nThe electrical conductivity of the\nthroughflow (filtrate) is typically 5 to\n10 percent of the conductivity of the\nfeed solution . The throughflow velocity normally ranges from 3X10- 5 to\n5x1O- 5 m/s .\nIt is important that sintered-powder\ntechnology be used in fabricating the\nstainless-s tee I tubes . Stainless-steel\npowder is compacted and sintered\ninto a strong , porous tubular substrate . Tube porosity is controlled by\nthe powder size , initial compaction,\nand sintering conditions .

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nConventional methods of producing\nseals and other molded siliconerubber parts often include a vacuum\ndeaeration step to remove air from the\nrubber before molding . Air is trapped\nwhen the rubber is measured , catalyzed , mixed , and transferred to\nplastic cart ridges for injection into\nmolds . Unfortunately , vacuum deaeration does not always adequately deaerate the high-viscosity silicone , and\nmolded parts must often be rejected\ndue to residual air inside the rubber.\nThis problem is eliminated by\ncentrifuging the rubber after vacuum\ndeaeration . An inexpens ive handoperated centrifuge can be modified to\naccept the plastic cartridges (see\nfigure) . A mixed , high-v iscos ity\n(6,000-poise) silicone rubber is\npushed into the cartridges and\nvacuum-degassed\nfor\nseveral\nminutes . Then the cartridges are\nplaced in the centrifuge holders and\nare centrifuged to el iminate any\nremaining air.\nCentrifuging draws most of the\nsilicone rubber to the bottom of the\ncartridge with only a th in layer of\nsilicone on the inner cartridge wall. A\nquick check of the centrifuged rubber\nshows that it does not have the bubbly\nsurface that it normally has after\nvacuum deaeration .

The types of\namines studied ranged from simple\naniline derivatives to complex multiring\n\n538\n\ndi- and tri-amines . These analyses\nwere made on a commercially-available liquid chlOmatograph equipped\nwith a valve-loop injector, a 6,000-psi\npump, and a 254-nm ultraviolet detector. Chromatographic amine sepa-\n\nrations were previously limited to primarily thin-layer , ion-exchange, or gaschromatographic analyses of aliphatic\namines. HPLC has been used in only a\nfew cases to separate aromatic amines.\nThis technique offers speed, the poten-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1978\n\ntial for sample scaleup, and a stable\nenvironment for analysis of these reactive species.\nMany of the chemicals controlled by\nthe second emergency standard issued by the Occupational Safety and\nHealth Administration are aromatic\namines. Classically important in the\ndye industry, the physiological activity\nof these compounds makes them of interest to the biomedical field. Furthermore, in the field of polymer chemistry,\nisomeric aromatic diamines have become increasingly important in studying the effects of chemical structure on\nthe properties of polyimides, polyamides, epoxies, and urethanes. They\nare valuable chemicals in many areas\nof industry and research . As interest in\nthis class of compounds expands, their\nseparation and analysis become more\nimportant.\nThe figure shows the HPLC chromatogram obtained at room temperature for a synthetic mixture of four\nisomeric aromatic amines . It demonstrates the special ability of this technique to separate complex amine\nmixtures. Impurities as low as 0.1\npercent were easily detected . Satisfactory separations were obtained\nusing various silica gel adsorbents\nwith chloroform and/or cyclohexane\nmobile phases . The chromatographic\nconditions that led to a satisfactory\nseparation in a reasonable time were\ndetermined by changing the polarity of\nthe mobile phase for one of the\nadsorbents and then, when necessary , repeating the process using an\nadsorbent of higher or lower surface\narea as appropriate . Thus, both\nmobile-phase polarity and adsorbent\nsurface area as well as adsorbent\ntype were considered in optimizing a\nseparation .\nThe primary separation mechanism\nfor these compounds was found to\ndepend upon an interaction between\nthe basic amino group and the slightlyacidic silica adsorbent. In most cases,\nthis interaction was related to the base\nstrength of the amine.

Such plastics\noffer several advantages over glass as\nlenses in cameras , projectors , telescopes , and other optical instruments :\nPlastic materials are inexpensive and\nlightweight , they can be injectionmolded , and they requ ire no further\nfinishing when released from the\nmold . The new process el iminates a\nmajor disadvantage of plastic lenses :\nthe tendency to become scratched\nunder routine cleaning .\nIn the new process , a plastic lens\n(for example , one composed of\npolymethyl methacrylate) is subjected\nto three consecutive steps :\n1. Exposure to a water-vapor plasma ,\nwhich forms hydroxyl groups on the\nlens surface ;\n2. Exposure to a plasma of siliconbased monomers ; and\n3. Exposure to an argon plasma .\nThe first step ensures good adherence of the coating to the lens . The\nsecond step deposits the coating , and\nthe third step cross-l inks the coating\ninto a strong , scratchproof polymer .\nAll steps are carried out in the same\nvacuum chamber (see figure) . So that\nboth sides of the lens are coated , the\nlens is positioned about midway in the\n2-inch (5-cm) space between the\nchamber electrodes . The upper\n(" hot " ) electrode is connected to an\nadjustable radio-frequency (RF) power\nsupply . The lower electrode is connected to ground .\nThe chamber is evacuated , and\ndistilled-water vapor is suppl ied\nthrough an inlet tube whi le valves\nmaintain chamber pressure at 15 to 25\nnewtons per square meter. The RF\nfield ionizes the water vapor between\nthe electrodes into a plasma that\ndeposits hydroxyl groups on the lens.\nThe depOSition period lasts for 100 to\n1,000 seconds .\nFollowing this step , the chamber is\nagain evacuated ; the monomers are\nintroduced through the inlet tube (for\nexample , a mixture of vinyldimethyl-\n\nVACUUM\nCHAMBER\n\n"Hor\'\nELECTRODE\n\nADJUSTABLE RF\nPOWER SUPPLY\n\nVACUUM\nPUMP\n\nThe three steps of the Plasma Deposition process for depositing antiabrasl on\ncoatings on polymethyl methacrylate lenses are carried out In a single chamber.

Pressure is regulated to about 7 to 13 newtons per\nsquare meter. The electrodes ionize\nthe monomer mixture , and it depOSits\non the hydroxyl-coated lens at a rate\n0.1 to 0.25 nanometer per second . A\nmonomer layer up to 3,000 nanometers thick can be deposited ; above\nthat value , internal stresses become\n\nlarge enough to pull the layer away\nfrom the lens surface .\nThe chamber is evacuated a final\ntime , and argon is introduced at a\npressure of about 20 newtons per\nsquare meter . The ionized argon\ngenerates ultraviolet light, heat, and\nelectrons that both cross-link and\nstress-relieve the monomer film over a\nperiod of 200 to 1,000 seconds.\n(continued on next page)\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1978\n\n543\n\nFilms formed in this manner pass\nthe standard military-specification test\nfor adhesion .

With it, researchers can\nbegin to predict the deposition rate of\nsilicon for a given set of operating\nconditions . They can also determine\nthe best gas and particle flow rates\nand the power requirements .\nThe fluidized-bed process is under\nconsideration as a means of produc ing\ninexpensive silicon for solar cells. In\nthe process, silicon particles are fed\ninto a stream of silane and hydrogen\nso that the particles form a fluidlike\nbed . The silane pyrolyzes in the bed,\ndepositing additional silicon on the\nparticles. The particles grow, and the\nlarger ones are continuously extracted\nfrom the reactor . The process is\ncontinuous, and since it has a very\nlarge reaction area (the particle\nsurfaces), it is a potential source of\npure silicon on a much larger scale\nthan conventional chemical-vapor\ndeposition .\nSeveral assumptions and limiting\nconditions were used to make the\nproblem tractable , including :\n-At temperatures above 1,000\xc2\xb0 C, the\nprimary reaction is the heterogeneous pyrolysis of silane on the\nsurface of the silicon particles .\n-The rates of adsorption and reaction\nare faster than the transport of\n\nsilane ; thus the particle-growth rate\nis diffusion limited .\n-The fluidization of particles smaller\nthan 50 microns in diameter, which\nwould cause abnormal fluidization, is\nnot considered; the bed is assumed\nto be either bubbling or particulately\nfluidized .\nIf the bed is particulately fluidized\n- that is, if the particles are uniformly\ndistributed through the gas , the\nparticle growth rate can be obtained\nrelatively simply . If the bed is bubbling\n- that is, if bubbles of gas coexist\nwith a particle-and-gas emulsion, the\nbubble and the emulsion characteristics must be studied separately in\nexperiments that examine the interaction between the two phases . When\nthe growth rate is obtained, the mass\nbalance of silicon particles in the feed ,\nproduct, and entrainment streams and\nin the bed is calculated .\nThis work was done by George C.\nHsu, Ki-Bong Kim, Ralph Lutwack,\nand Ananda K.

Biolog ical Cell Separation occurs in the center chamber (5 by 0.5 by 0.2\ncentimeters), which is enclosed by membranes; progress is monitored by transmission of a light beam . The apparatus, including electrode chambers, is\' constructed of polymethyl methacrylate and is designed so that its upper and lower\nhalves can be opened.\nBiological cells can be separated\nfrom a suspending medium by an\nelectric field . The concept was developed for biological experiments in\nspace or diving aircraft, where the\nabsence of gravity effects makes conventional cell-separation methods ineffective. However, it also greatly\nspeeds up separation in normal\ngravity , reduces sedimentation , and\nimproves separation efficiency.\nThe new technique represents an\nextension of a biological-cell separation method that utilizes a two-phase\naqueous polymer system as the cellsuspending medium. Cell separations\ncan take place in such systems\nbecause , if a mixed cell population is\nshaken up in the polymer solution and\nthe phases are allowed to separate by\nsettling , cells with certain surface\nproperties are found to be associated\nwith only the top phase, while the\nremainder of the cells is adsorbed at\nthe interface between the phases .\nExtension of this method to separate the phases with an electric field\nhas been demonstrated with polymer\nemulsions that are not suitable for\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1978\n\nbiological cells . However, polymers\nthat are suitable are already under\ndevelopment.\nThe prototype apparatus for fielddriven phase separation consists of\ntwo electrode chambers separated\nfrom a central " phase" chamber by\nmembranes (see Figure 1). The center\nchamber is filled with an emulsion of\ntwo polymers (two phases) . An electric field is applied between the two\nplatinum electrodes (on the order of\n10 volts per centimeter) as rinse\nsolution circulates thro\'ugh the upper\nand lower chambers to remove unwanted\nelectrochemical\nreaction\nproducts from the electrodes .\nUnder the influence of the electric\nfield , the droplets in the emulsion\nseparate . The droplets of one of the\npolymer components move to and\ncoalesce in the upper half of the\ncenter chamber, while the components of the other polymer do the\nsame in the bottom half.\nIn practice , a different kind of biological cell would associate with each\npolymer, so that after migration of the\ndroplets, the upper half of the center\n\nz\n\no\n~\n\nE - 4.8 V/cm\n\n~\n\n(JJ\n\nz\n\n~ 0.50\n\n....\n\n~\n\nt3\n\nt;:\n\no\n\nTURBID\no ~----~-----~\nTIME (MIN)\n\nFigure 2.

Thus, to assist\ngravity, the bottom electrode is made\nthe cathode to attract the positivemobility NaDS droplets . The separa-\n\ntion is complete in about a minute one-tenth the time required with\ngravity alone .\nAs an aid in measuring the progress\nof the separation process, an optical\nsystem measures the turbidity of the\nemulsion .

The outgoing beam\nintensity is sensed by a solid-state\ndetector and amplifier and is displayed\non a strip-chart recorder (Figure 2).\nBecause biological cells themselves\nhave electrophoretic mobility, it is\n\nconceivable that the electric field\nmight pull cells out of their proper\npolymer medium and into the wrong\none, thus negating the separation\nprocess.

[This\ninstrument is described in "Intraocular\nPressure Reduction and Regulation"\n(LEW-12723), page 549 of this issue .]\nThe pressure regulator controls the\nintraocular pressure during substantial\nvariations in the flow rates of the\ninfusion fluid . The regulator may be\napplicable to a variety of eye-surgery\ninstruments .\nThe regulator uses a standardarrangeent spring-loaded diaphragm\nas the basic pressure-regulating element (see figu re). The no-flow output\npressure of the regulator is set by a\nspring force pushing against the outlet\npressure-sensing\ndiaphragm .\nA\nsecond diaphragm is located a small\ndistance below the first on the same\ncenterline . This diaphragm responds\nto the pressure drop across an\nadjustable external orifice and a small\ninternal orifice in parallel with it .\nThe external orifice , a length of\nsilicone tubing with an adjustable\npinch section , provides a means to\ncal ibrate the unit to match the\npressure-drop characteristics of different instruments . This orifice is\nadjusted so that the pressure at the\n\n548\n\nSPRING-LOADED\nDIAPHRAGM\n\nREGULATING\nVALVE\n\nCOMPOUND\n\'r2.~:m77;,Jt"LEVER SYSTEM\n\nINLET\nPORT\n\nThe Flow-Compensating Pressure Regulator could be used with a cataract-surgery\ninstrument to keep intraocular pressure constant , delJpite variations in infusion flow\nrate . As fluid enters the inlet port , there is a pressure drop across the flow-sensing\ndiaphragm ; this force is amplified and reversed by a compound lever to open the\nvalve . With any change in pressure at the outlet , the two diaphragms will cause a\ncompensating flow-rate (and thus pressure-drop) change to keep the outlet pressure\nconstant .\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1978\n\noutlet of the surgical instrument with\nflow is the same as the no-flow output\npressure of the regulator . The small\ninternal orifice , located on the centerline of the conical flow-sensing diaphragm , also acts as an air bleed to\nassure that the regulator is completely\nliquid filled with no trapped air volume .\nAs infusion fluid flows through the\nregulator, the pressure drop across\nthe two orifices generates a force on\nthe flow-sensing diaphragm . An interconnected compound-lever system\ntransmits this force to the regulating\nvalve . The lever system multiplies the\ndiaphragm force by a factor of 5 and\nreverses its direction so as to pull the\nvalve open .\nThe force on the flow-sensing\ndiaphragm combines with the spring\nforce to maintain a constant pressure\nat the instrument outlet. Any tendency\nof the pressure at the instrument outlet\nto increase or decrease will cause the\ntwo diaphragms to decrease or increase the flow from the regulator\nenough to restore that pressure . The\nactions of the flow-sensing diaphragm,\nthe lever system, and spring-loaded\n\ndiaphragm exactly compensate for the\npressure drop in the surgical instrument that controls the flow rate . Thus\nthe regulator can maintain a constant\npressure at the working end of a\nsurgical instrument, even with variations in flow rate of infusion fluid\nthrough the instrument.\nThe regulating valve is the machined end of a cylinder with a small\nradius edge that presses against a flat\nsilicone seat for positive shutoff during\nno-flow (standby) conditions . The flat\nvalve surface provides rapid increases\nin flow capability for very small axial\nvalve motions .\nThe infusion fluid, a sterile salt\nsolution, must not be contaminated as\nit passes through the regulator . Those\ncomponents that come in contact with\nthis fluid are made either from clear,\nhigh-temperature-resistant plastic or\nMonel . The regulator is designed to\nhave a small fluid volume . A vertical\nflow path through the regulator easily\neliminates trapped air .\nThe gain of the regulator, the ratio\nof outlet pressure increase relative to\nsensed pressure drop in the flow-\n\nsensing orifice , can be altered by\nchanging the multiplication factor in\nthe lever system or by using diaphragms of unequal area . The present\nunit uses diaphragms with equal\neffective area of 1 in .2 (6 .5 cm 2).\nThe pressure regulator has had\nsubstantial evaluation in experimental\nlaboratory use including extensive\nanimal surgery . The functional performance appears to be consistent\nand satisfactory. Manufactu ring engineering has not been done and is not\nplanned .\nThis work was done by Edward F.\nBaehr of Lewis Research Center.\nPreliminary drawings can be reproduced and made available at cost if\nrequested.\nThis invention has been patented by\nNASA [U .S.

The system is\ndesigned to reduce intraocular pressure - pressure inside the eye hydraulically to any level desired by\nthe physician over a set time and in a\ncontrolled manner. It may be most\nimmediately useful in dealing with\ncases where intraocular pressure\nremains markedly elevated in spite of\nmedical treatment immediately prior\nto glaucoma surgery.\nGlaucoma is a widespread group of\neye diseases characterized by elevated intraocular pressure . Such increased pressure if not reduced can\ncause impaired visual function and\neventual blindness . Medical treatment\nto reduce and control the pressure is\nnot always successful ; in such\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1978\n\ncases , surgery may be used to\nrelieve the pressure .\nPrior to the ophthalmic surgery,\nmedication is used to reduce intraocular pressure temporarily . Such\nprocedure requires some time to\nobtain the desired reduction in pressure . In addition , drugs may have\nundesirable side effects on some\npeople and may be insufficiently\neffective on others .\nAs a supplement to drugs and\nperhaps eventually as an alternative,\nthe new system can be used safely to\nreduce abnormally high intraocular\npressure hydraulically during a predetermined time interval. Once intraocular pressure has been reduced to\nthe level desired by the surgeon, a\npressure regulator will maintain this\nset minimum pressure within a reasonable range during intraocular\nsurgery .\n\nAs shown in the figure, a fluid\nsupply at a pressure matched to the\nexisting intraocular pressu ~e is connected to the anterior chamber of the\neye through a small cannula inserted\nnear the edge of the cornea. Pressure\nof the fluid supply is reduced and\ncontrolled so that the intraocular\npressure is reduced by the same\namount and at the same rate .\nIf only very small liquid flows are\nexpected during the surgery and after\nsurgical penetration of the eye,\nintraocular pressure can be established and maintained by adjusting\npressure (i.e ., height) of the fluid\nsupply alone, and the pressure\nregulator need not be part of the\nsystem . However, for larger and\nvariable flows , the pressure regulator\nis desirable .\nThe system shown in the figure\n(continued on next page)\n549\n\nmakes use of a flow-compensating\npressure regulator [see " Flow-Compensating Pressure Regulator " (LEW12718) on page 548 of this issue] that\nadjusts automatically to maintain the\nset minimum intraocular pressure\nafter the eye has been opened by\nsurgical penetration dyring\nthe\nglaucoma surgical procedure . The\nregulator has a spring-biased diaphragm that is initially adjusted so the\nregulator will produce the desired\nminimum intraocular pressure . A\nvertical tube or standpipe connected\nto the top of the regulator contains a\ncolumn of liquid that provides an\nadditional regular bias . The level of\nthe column of liquid is selected so that\nthe total output pressure of the\nregulator equals the measured intraocular pressure.\nAfter the cannula has been inserted , liquid is bled out of the standpipe at a predetermined rate, reducing\nthe bias on the regulator diaphragm\nand, consequently , causing a gradual\nreduction in regulator output pressure . The system is entirely liquid\nfilled, and the pressure regulator\npermits only forward , not reverse,\nflow . Also, the eye is essentially an\nelastic chamber where pressure reduction is accompanied by the movement of a very small amount of fluid\nout of the eye . Accordingly , a\npressure-relief tube between the regulator output and cannula is provided\nto furn ish a flow path to the outside for\ntreatment fluid ; this pressure-relief\ntube permits the eye pressure to\ndecrease at the same rate as the\nliquid head in the standpipe decreases .\nWhen the standpipe is completely\ndrained , intraocular pressure will be\nthe same as the regulator output\npressure initially set by the spring\nadjustment. During surgery the regulator will maintain this minimum\npressure through the cannula connected to the anterior chamber . A\nmeasuring system records intraocular\npressure continuous Iy.\nInvestigations with the system\n\n550\n\nNOTE: AT THE PRESENT, DYNAMIC\nFLUCTUATIONS IN INTRAOCULAR\nPRESSURE ARE MORE ACCURATELY\nMEASURED WITH A SEPARATE CANNULA.\nPRESSURE MEASUREMENT\nWITH SEPARATE TRANSDUCER\n\nSTANDARD SALINE\nOR RINGER SOLUTION\n\nINTRAOCULAR\nPRESSURE-SETIING\nCOLUMN (IPSC)\n\nPRESSURE\nREGULATOR\n\nTO OUTSIDE\n\nIntraocular Pressure Regulator can be used by a physician to reduce pressure inside\nthe eye hydraulically . Fluid pressure within the eye stays at the same pressure as the\nfluid system to which the eye is connected by a cannula. The pressure in the system\nis set by a pressure regulator and setting column . The special pressure regulator\nreplaces fluid loss by the eye (during surgery for instance) without changing the\npressure .\n\nhave shown that intraocular pressure\nexcursion peaks resulting from external loads such as surg ical manipulations are reduced if the intraocular\nresting pressure is first lowered . This\nresult was expected . Use of this new\nsystem reduces such intraocular\npressure excurs ion peaks even further , however , because the penetrating cannula and the external flu id\nsystem prov ide a pressure-relief\nmechanism .\nBased on its demonstrated capabili ty , the new intraocular pressure\nreduction and regulation system may\nbe useful as a tool to permit controlled\nstudies of several post-eye-surgery\ncomplications (e.g ., cataract forma-\n\ntion , choroidal detachment , flat anterior chamber , macular edema , and\nmalignant glaucoma), which may be\ndue at least in part to marked intraocular pressure fluctuations and/or\nhypotony during surgery .\nThis work was done by Edward F.\nBaehr of Lewis Research Center and\nWilliam J .

Standard\npackaging techniques couid be used to make the hand-held version.\nReferring to Figure 2, the input to the\ncircuit is derived from three chest electrodes and one temperature-monitoring thermistor . In addition, digital\nblood-pressure data can be accepted\nfrom external circuitry.\nThe chest electrode signals are fed\nto both the ECG and the respiration sig-\n\nnal conditioners. In the ECG circuit, the\nSignal is amplified, filtered, and used to\ngenerate standardized output pulses\nsynchronized with the ECG pulses.\nThe respiration-rate circuit measures the change in impedance (at 50\nkHz) of the chest as it expands and\ncontracts during the breathing cycle . A\n(continued on next pagp\\\n\n551\n\nconstant-cu rrent 50-kHz signal is impressed across the electrodes, and the\nvoltage changes that occur as the person breathes are processed to give\nstandardized output pulses that follow\nthe breathing cycle .\nEither the ECG or the respiration\npulses are switched into the heart!\nbreath-rate processor, which converts\nthe time between pulses to a digital\nheart rate or breath rate that is stored\nin three-state output latches for interrogation by the display circuitry. Concurrently, the temperature monitor converts the thermistor resistance to a digital signal that corresponds to body\ntemperature ; it stores the signal in output latches.\nThe three-state latches remain in\nhigh-impedance output states that decouple them from the rest of the circuit\nuntil they are enabled by the functionselect switch. When either the temperature monitor or the heart!breath-rate\nmonitor is selected , the corresponding\nlatches are multiplexed, one digit at a\ntime, into the display driver. Th e multiplex frequency is derived from the\nclock generator, which also sequences\nthe monitoring circuits and the display.\nThe display driver develops the required seven-segment signals that operate the liquid-crystal readout.\nThe heart and breath rates can be\ndisplayed directly in beats per minute,\nand the temperature can be displayed\nin degrees (Fahrenheit or Centigrade).\nIn addition , the heart rate can be determined from either the beat-to-beat time\nor from an average of five consecutive\nbeats.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nHigh common-mode rejection and\nthe ability to accept electrocardiogram\n(ECG) signals of varying amplitude,\nshape, and polarity are some of the\nfeatures of the hybrid ECG amplifier\nand cardiotachometer of the vital-signs\nmonitor. [See "Hand-Held Vital-Signs\nMonitor" (MSC-18232) on page\nof\nthis issue.] Besides filtering and amplifying the analog ECG, the low-power\ncircuit develops standardized pulses\nthat can be counted and averaged by\nthe heart/breath-rate processor.\nThe circuit receives the heart signal\nfrom three electrodes, one of which is\na common or reference electrode. The\nsignal is amplified by a balanced differential amplifier with very high input\nimpedance and large common mode\nrejection and is fed to a band-pass\nfilter to suppress noise and interference. The filtered signal is then sent to\na normalizing circuit that standardizes\nthe amplitude of the heart pulses regardless of their polarity. A bipolar\nthreshold circuit detects the pulses,\nand the threshold output is then standardized in width and amplitude.\n\n554\n\nAs shown in the figure, the input\namplifier consists of three operational amplifiers. The gain of the input\ndifferential amplifier is + 40 dB. An\nadditional 50-dB common-mode rejection ratio is added by the final amplifier\nin this group of three .\nCapacitor C, and resistor R, determine the low-frequency cutoff at 0.05\nHz for the heart signal. R, is a very high\nresistance to ensure that C, is small\nenough to fit in the hybrid package.\nThe gain of U7 , the ECG output amplifier, is adjustable from 6.25 to 48. At\nmaximum gain, the dc offset at the\nECG output does not exceed 0.125\nvolt.\nU8 and associated circuitry constitute a high-impedance active bandpass filter with low output impedance.\nThe filter , with a center frequency of 17\nhertz and a Q-factor of 3, prevents\ncardiotachometer triggering on an abnormally large T-wave . U3 is a high-gain\namplifier for which field-effect transistor (FEn Q, is a variable shunt attenuator that controls the overall gain . The\noutput of U3 and inverter U4A are full-\n\nwave peak detected by 0" O2, and C2.\nThus, the maximum peak amplitude\n(regardless of polarity) is stored on C2\nand is transferred to the output of voltage follower Us. The summing amplifier U4 B combines the peak-detector\noutput with a portion of the original filtered ECG signal to linearize the FET\nvoltage characteristic.\nR2 is selected to set the dc operating voltage at the FET gate, calibrating\nthe normalized output of U3 at 2 volts\npeak. Therefore , the largest peak of\nthe filtered ECG signal will be 2 volts,\nregardless of the input amplitude, over\nthe specified range . The bipolar\nthreshold circuit (consisting of UsA,\nU8 B, and U8C), biased at plus and\nminus 1.5 volts, reacts whenever the\nabsolute value of the normalized signal\nexceeds this value . U7 B and surrounding components set the width of the\noutput pulses.\nThis work was done by George A.\nRinard, Dale A.

It generates an analog\nrespiration signal as output along with\na synchronous square wave that can\nbe monitored by a breath-rate processor.\nThe circuit (see figure) requires two\nactive chest electrodes that are driven\n\nwith balanced 50-kHz current. A reference (common) electrode is also provided . These can be the same electrodes that monitor the ECG heart signal in the vital-signs monitor. The voltage developed across the chest impedance is amplified , rectified , and filtered\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1978\n\nto monitor the amplitude envelope of\nthe 50-kHz signal as it is modulated by\nthe subject\'s breathing. After additional gain and filtering, the respiration signal is converted to a standardized\nsquare wave .\nCapacitors C1 and C2 balance the\noutput current with respect to the common electrode. Since the chest impedance is very nearly resistive, the excitation circuit acts like a differentia tor.\nThus, to obtain a square-wave excitation , a triangular-wave generator (U 1 ) is\nused. (The triangular wave becomes a\nsquare wave when differentiated.) U2 is\nan inverter that produces a waveform\nof opposite polarity and equal amplitude. The excitation-generator output\nis very nearly 18 volts peak-to-peak,\nwhich is the total supply voltage.\n\nThe 50-kHz voltage drop across the\nchest impedance is amplified by the\nbalanced differential amplifier U3 and\nU., and it is rectified at the input to U5 .\nThe slowly varying voltage that follows\nthe breathing cycle is then coupled into\nvoltage follower Us by capacitor C3\nand resistor R1 , which set the passband lower 3-dB frequency limit at 0.1\nHz. U7 furnishes a gain of 200 and sets\nthe upper 3-dB frequency limit at 10\nHz. The output of U7 is available as the\nimpedance pneumograph signal.\nTo discriminate against spurious signals that can arise when the subject\nmoves, a second-order low-pass filter\n(Us and surrounding components) with\na cutoff at 1 Hz is added to reduce the\nactive bandwidth. Also, Ug and associated components form a bipolar dc\n\nrestorer that shortens the recovery\ntime alter a large extraneous signal.\nU10 is a threshold circuit, with some\nhysteresis, that converts the respiration signal to a square wave; and U11\ntranslates the squarewave voltage\nlimits to zero and + 9 volts, as required\nby the rate processor circuit.\nThis work was done by George A.\nRinard, Dale A.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA single hybrid circuit converts the\ntime between pulses from the ECG signal conditioner or the breath-rate signal conditioner (see preceding articles)\nto determine the heart-rate or respiration-rate output of the vital-signs monitor. [See "Hand-Held Vital-Signs Monitor" (MSC-18232) on page\nof this issue .] The desired operating mode\n(heart or breath) is selected by routing\ncontrol frequencies from the clock circuit to the heart/breath-rate processor.\nThe circuit determines the heart rate\nfrom either a beat-ta-beat time or from\nthe time of five consecutive beats. No\nanalog techniques are required for the\nconversion . Because only digital processing is used, no calibration is required, and no components external to\nthe hybrid package are needed. The\ncomputed value of heart rate or breath\nrate is stored in a three-state latch for\ntransfer to the display driver discussed\nin the next article.\nThe processor calculates heart rate\n(from 40 to 200 beats per minute) with\nan accuracy of 1 beat per minute; it\ncalculates breath rate (from 6 to 24\nbreaths per minute) with an accuracy\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1978\n\nof 1 breath per minute. The calculations are made by dividing a constant\nfactor by the period between beats (or\nbreaths), such that the quotient is\nequal to the rate in beats or breaths\nper minute.\nEdge-triggered counter 1 (see\nfigure) is clocked by the heartlbreath\npulses. The one-count or five-count\noutput of counter 1 is selected and\ntransferred (through switch 1) to counter 2. Concurrently, switch 2 routes the\ncorrect frequency to the rest of the circuit for the one-beat or five-beat computation mode. Because the time between breaths is relatively long, the\nrespiration rate is computed only on a\nbreath-to-breath basis.\nThe output of counter 2 initializes\nthe rest of the circuitry for the processing of a heart or breath rate based on a\ntotal count, N, accumulated in counter\n3 between two successive pulses at\ncounter 2. The count N equals the\nperiod between heart or breath pulses\nmultiplied by frequency fo (counted by\ncounter 3 during this period).\nThe count N is latched into register\n1, which is used as the preset input for\n\ncounter 4, a presettable down counter.\nCounter 4 is preset at the beginning of\nthe cycle and also whenever it has\ncounted down to zero during the processing .

At the end of t, a second output of shift register 1 latches the count\naccumulated by counter 5 in threestate latch register 2.

As the examiner guides the instrument through the large intestine, it is\nimportant that he sees ahead to avoid\nperforating the wall of the intestine\nand also that he sees to the side to\nview around intestinal folds.\nCurrently-available optical devices\nfor this purpose include the colonoscope , a thin flexible probe , usually\nadministered by a skilled clinician,\nthat carefully examines the entire\nlarge intestine, and the proctosigmoidoscope , a larger probe for the\nrectum and colon. The proctosigmoidoscope is a less-expensive and\nmore easily administered device. Both\ninstruments have restricted lateral\nvision.\nThe modified proctosigmoidoscope\nshown in the figure is able simultaneously to "see" in the forward direction\nand laterally . It differs from the conventional two-lens designs by the\naddition of a third lens which is\npartially mirrored. The central circle of\nthe lens is not mirrored and is one\nelement of the refracting system that\nforms an image of the frontal view .\nThe mirrored convex surface around\nthe perimeter of the lens reflects the\nlateral image of the colon wall.\nThe operator sees a double image\nwhen using the instrument; he sees a\ncentral image of the forward direction\nand an outer concentric ring that\nshows what is directly to the side or\nslightly behind the viewing port.\n\n562\n\n1 em\n\nEN LARGED VIEW\n\nCOLON\nWALL\n\nThis Mod ified Proctosigmoidoscope is given an expanded field-of-view by the\naddition of a partially mirrored lens.

The design would allow optical inspection of\nthe large bowel, from the cecum to the\nrectum , with minimal discomfort or risk\nto the patient and no exposure to harmful radiation of the patient or the\ndiagnostician.\nThe colonoscope would be simple to\noperate and could be administered by\nrelatively unskilled clinicians. It is expected to make gastrointestinal examinations, which are now performed only\nby experienced colonoscopists, more\nwidely avai lable fo r early diagnosis of\ninflammation , polyps, colon ic tumors ,\nintestinal\nparasites ,\nand\nother\nailments .\nThe new design (see figure) has an\nart iculated end that flexes its way\nthrough the colon . Within the end are\noptical fibers, some of which illuminate\nthe wall of the colon and others of\nwh ich rece ive an image of the wall .\nThe light is transferred through the\narticulating bellows by a lens , linked\nby optical fibers to an external light\nsource and a screen . The diagnostician views a continuous display of\nsmall areas of the colon as the instrument moves through it. Inflatable\nbladders fore and aft of the bellows\nare sequentially inflated and exhausted as the bellows is expanded and\ncontracted so that the articu lated end\nmoves through the colon .\nSeveral tracking methods have been\nproposed , using ultrasonic or radiofrequency (RF) signals. In using ultrasonics, a single transmitter (e.g., a\npiezoelectric crystal) on the tip of the\ncolon os cope could be sensed by an array of two or more receivers on the\nanterior or lateral surfaces of the abdomen . The arrival times of a pulse signal\nfrom each transmitter could be used to\ngenerate an X,Y-coordinate display of\nthe path on a cathode-ray tube . The\ntransmitter crystal must lie at the intersection of two circles , the centers of\nwhich are located at the detectors and\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1978\n\nSEGMENTED OPTICAL FIBERS\nBLADDER\nINFLATED\nBELLOWS\n\nFIBER\nOPTICS\n\nBLADDER\nINFLATE/DEFLATE\nLINE\nSHEATH\n\n.. -..... -- ...... ... -............ . .\nLENSES\nBLADDER\nINFLATE/DEFLATE\nLINE\nOBJECTIVE\nLENS\n\n~.\n\n\'"-\n\nMOVABLE\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n. . ....-...... - .--....... -..... -..\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n.. .......\n\n~\n\n-- ..\n\n...... . _.\n\nFIXED\n- --- . . _ .. ---\'!\n\n,\n\n...\n\n--...\n\nCONTINUOUS OPTICAL FIBERS\n\nTwo Possible Self-Propelling Colonoscopes are shown . In the version illustrated in\nthe upper figure , the bladders Inflate and deflate, but they do not move laterally\nalong the probe ; lenses relay the image between the sections of optical fibers . In the\nlower figure , the bladder on the right is fixed laterally , and the bladder on the left\nmoves along the probe body . In this version , a cont inuous fiber-optic bundle is\nused .\n\nthe radii of which are proportional to\nthe elapsed time between the transmitted and received pulses.\nFor each pulse transmitted by the\npiezoelectric crystal at the tip of the\ncolonoscope, a point would be defined\nand displayed on the CRT. Since the\ncrystal can be pulsed in rapid succession, the position of the moving tip can\nbe displayed as a series of points. With\nultrasonics, acoustic coupling between\nthe transducer and the body is essential since an airpath offers too\nmuch impedance; a liquid or gel layer\ncould be provided for this purpose .\n\nOther methods for tracking the colonoscope can be simpler than ultrasonics but may compromise the opportunity for real-time display of its location . Possible methods include\nmounting a magnet on the distal end of\nthe colonoscope and detecting and\ntracking its position and direction with\na small magnetometer on the abdomen ; and incorporating a tuned circuit\nat several points along the length of the\ncolonoscope . In this approach, external RF generators, tuned to resonate\nwith the internal circuits , would exhibit\n(continued on next page)\n\n563\n\ncharacteristic changes in load when directed toward the colonoscope resonator. A similar concept has a set of\nexternal opposing Helmholtz coils arranged to buck each other and create\na moving nulled-out zone in the region\nof the colonoscope . Two pairs of cOils\nwould create a null zone in X and Y\ncoordinates covering the area of the\nabdomen . When this zone traverses\nthe position of the resonant circuits,\nthe load could undergo a transient that\nwould be displayed on a CRT or an X-Y\nrecorder .\n\nIn addition to the bladderlbellows\nsystem, other methods of locomotion\nare also being studied. One proposal\ncalls for small compliant paddles arranged in a helix around the articulated\nend. If the end is rotated, the paddles\nwould pull themselves along like a\npropeller.\nAnother possibility replaces the bellows by a tube of plastic that softens\nand hardens over a narrow temperature range. Under external control, this\ntube could be heated so that it bends\naround the flexures of the colon; it\n\nwould be cooled for passage through\nthe straight regions .\nThis work was done by Robert E.\nFrazer of Caltech for NASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA noncontact acoustic technique for\nrecording the motion of the chest wall\nduring the cardiac cycle can give\ninformation on changes in the size,\nshape, and compliance of the heart\nventricles. The technique utilizes aircoupled ultrasonic transducers that\noperate only slightly above audible\nfrequencies . The transducers are\narranged in a phasemeter configuration for measuring absolute changes in\nthe distance between the transducer\nassembly and the chest wall. Because\nthe skin surface reflects very-Iowfrequency ultrasound, only chest-wall\nmotion is sensed by this technique.\nIn a prototype of the new probe,\nknown as an acoustic kinetocardiometer, the transducers are housed in\nplastic cones that direct the ultrasound, and the assembly is mounted\non an adjustable rotating arm. When\n\n564\n\nthe probe is in position, the transmitting and receiving crystals are\nabout 10 inches (25 cm) from the\nchest wall. The transducer cones are\nfocused on the chest in a pattern\ncorresponding to the standard "V"\npositions used to identify electrocardiogram (EKG) leads. All the\nnecessary electronics and data\nrecorders are located on a table near\nthe patient\'s bedside .\nClinical studies using the probe are\nunderway for the early diagnosis of\nright ventricular hypertrophy associated with obstructive respiratory\ndisease . For this purpose, it has been\nfound that the acoustic kinetocardiometer is an effective adjunctive diagnostic tool that complements radiological evaluation . It provides data that\ncannot be obtained by other noninvasive methods . Because of its\n\nsimplicity, it would probably require\nonly a fraction of the investment\nrequired for an echocardiographic\napparatus (which uses high-frequency\nultrasound to image the heart). Also\nthe output of the probe could be\ndigitized and fed to a microprocessor\nfor rapid storage and analysis.\nThis work was done by Jerry G.\nDavis and David M.

This\ninstrument has been successfully used\nto average parameters on a 1975\nChevrolet V-8 engine and on a\nContinental 6-cylinder aircraft engine .\nThe curve is generated in real time\nand is available immediately after the\nconclusion of the 1DOth cycle .\nThe curve-averaging instrument can\nbe considered in four sections as\nshown in the block diagram of Figure\n1: the curve-averaging and storage\nsection, which adds the 100 curves\nand divides the output by 100; the\n1DO-sample logic, which detects when\n100 samples have been averaged and\nstored; the input and output multiplying circuits, which allow multiple\ntraces to be averaged and stored; and\nthe timing logic, which initiates the\nanalog-to-digital conversion pulse .\nThe instrument , shown in Figure 2,\nwas developed to measure the important parameters associated with the\noperation of an internal-combustion\nengine, such as mass-fraction burn\nrate , ignition energy, and the indicated\nmean effective pressure . A major\ncharacteristic of internal-combustion\nengines is the cycle-to-cycle variation\nof these parameters .\nThese variations are particularly\nprominent at lean mixture ratios,\nwhich are currently of great interest\nfor Investigating emission reduction\nand economy gain.\nBecause of the cycle-to-cycle variation , a single cycle curve cannot be\nused to characterize engine operation\nat any given time .

The probe eliminates the error created by shock\nwaves in conventional probes - error\nthat varies with airspeed and must be\ncorrected by calculations .\nThe new probe allows air to flow\nthrough it ~see figure}, thereby "swallowing" the bow shock wave and removing it from measurement orifices .\nThe probe is open at its forward end so\nthat it can ingest air and has slots at its\naft end so that the air can leave. Internal static-pressure orifices are located\nnear the forward end, and a totalpressure tube is positioned along the\nprobe axis. (Instruments determine the\nmach number from the total internal\npressure and the static-pressure measurements.) The shock wave, instead\nof forming at the tip of the probe as it\ndoes in conventional sensors, forms\ninside the probe toward the rear , well\nbehind the measu rement orifices\nwhere it would distort the measured\nvalues.\nShock-swallowing probes have previously been used in wind tunnels and\narc jets to measure mass flux and\nother free-stream flow parameters.\nThe new probe is intended for measuring mach number in high-performance\naircraft over widely varying altitudes\nand speeds . Like conventional probes,\nit can be mounted on an airplane nose\nboom .\n570\n\nAIR\nENTERING\n\n---t--\' \\- - - - - - - - SHOCK WAVES - - - - - -\n\nAir-Data Probe allows air to flow through it so that the inevitable supersonic shock\nwave forms behind pressure-measuring orifices and tube Instead of directly on\nthem. Measured pressures therefore are close to those in free-flowing air and are\nused to determine mach numbers of flying aircraft.\n\nIn wind-tunnel tests, the probe demonstrated a number error comparable\nto existing probes . It was tested at\nvarious angles of attack and angles of\nsideslip . The exit slot area was found\nto be critical. With small slot openings,\nthe shock wave is not swallowed;\nmeasurements are erratic, and error\nis unacceptably large . Once the slot\narea is increased beyond a certain\nsize, however, the shock wave enters\nthe probe , and measurement error\ndrops to a uniformly low level.\nThe tests also explored the effects\nof altering the positions of the internal\nstatic-pressure orifices and the totalpressure tube . The measurement error\n\nwas smallest , the tests showed , when\nthe orifices were near the probe entrance , where they are least likely to be\ninfluenced by reflected shock waves .\nFor the same reason, the total-pressure tube should be placed near the\nprobe entrance . The probe data were\nalso used to determine flow direction .\nThis work was done by Jack Nugent,\nGlenn M. Sakamoto, and Lannie O.\nWebb of Dryden Flight Research\nCenter and Lana M.

The new semi\nconductor-laser velocimeter is compact enough to be mounted within\nwind-tunnel models , engine walls , or\nhelicopter blades, where it can measure velocities in the boundary-layer\ngases flowing over it.\nThe mini-LV needs much less power\nthan its gas-laser predecessor - 0.4\nwatt instead of 6.7 kilowatts . It is just\nas accurate as the conventional LV ,\nmeasuring velocities with an accuracy\nof 98 percent or better.\nThe laser diode produces a continuous-wave beam at a wavelength of\n820 .0 nanometers and an output\npower of 10 milliwatts. Since the diode\nemits a beam with relatively wide\ndivergence (20\xc2\xb0). a collimating lens is\nplaced in front of it to straighten the\nbeam (see figure). In one configuration , the mini-LV samples a gas\nvolume 3 .66 millimeters long and\nabout 0 .197 millimeter in diameter roughly the same as the conventional\nLV.

These impurities are acquired\nduring various stages of circuit fabrication and may erode materials\nmaking up the chips. Reliability is\noften determined by selecting a\nnumber of sample IC\'s and puncturing\nthe packages under controlled conditions so that contaminants and total\ngas composition may be analyzed via\nmass spectrometer. Typical contaminants include chlorinated solvent\nvapors, excessive water, and acidic\nvapors picked up during various rinse\noperations . The test procedure is very\ntime consuming .\nA new carrousel tray speeds up the\ntesting process by feeding the spectrometer with up to 12 samples in\nrapid succession. This effectively\nreplaces a tedious procedure of\ntesting one sample at a time. As\nbefore, the new system may be used\nto detect impurities carried over from\nfabrication rinse operations, or it can\nbe used to test the hermetic integrity\nof the IC seal as a function of time .\nThe new system (see figure) uses a\nsimple , multiple-sample holder with\ndetent elements on a carrousel tray\nand a means for rotating and puncturing the samples . The 12-sample batch\ncan be analyzed without breaking\nexternal vacuum seals and introducing\ncontamination . Copper gaskets assure\nstability at high temperatures and low\npressures .\nThe method of running samples\nthrough the device is to load the holder\nwith up to 12 sealed flat-pack or other\nIC sealed packages, positioning relative to the detents, transferring into\nthe chamber, and tightening and\ntorquing all flange screws (not\nshown) . The temperature of the\nchamber is raised to 125 0 C and is\nheld at that level for about 24 hours\nwith the gate valve open and the highvacuum ion pump in continuous\noperation.

Up to 12 IC\'s can be tested in rapid succession to check for\nimpurities.\nperiod, the gate valve is closed, the\ntemperature controller is reset to 100 0\nC, and the system is allowed to\nstabilize, requiring up to 1 hour to\nreach 100 0 C. The mass spectrometer\n(diffusion vacuum pumping, liquid\nnitrogen cold baffle) is operated\ncontinuously on a 24-hour basis .\nFor analysis of the first sample , the\nmicrometer puncture apparatus is\nslowly rotated until the first rush of\ncaptive heated gas is noted on the\nchamber capacitance manometer\nreadout gage as having passed from\nthe package to the chamber . Because\na very fine needle is used, the lid of\nthe puncture package will have only a\nsmall pinhole leak . The needle does\nnot contact or damage the chip . The\n\nmicrometer so completely minimizes\ndamage that in many cases it is also\npossible to carry out extensive electrical tests after removal of the test\nsamples from the sample\' chamber.\nApplications are not limited to IC\npackages with sealing metal or ceramic covers.

The SEM\nbeam is narrow enough to irradiate a\nsingle IC subcomponent, such as a\ntrans istor. After each component is\nirradiated with a predetermined radiation does [e .g., 106 rad (Si)). a device\nparameter is measured during the\nbeam off period to determine the\nradiation sensitivity. By using the high\nmangification feature of a SEM, the\nirradiated region can be localized to\nwithin an area less than 1 by 1 mil\n(0 .03 by 0.03 mm) . Thus , it is\npossible to determine the exact\nlocation of the radiation-sensitive\nsection within the IC .\nA schematic of the scanning\nelectron microscope is shown in the\ndiagram . The radiation beam is\ndirected onto the IC through a series\nof coils and condenser lenses . The\ndecapped circuit is mounted on a\nstage that is modified to accept an\nelectronic bias circuit. The bias\nparameters are monitored by a\nmicroammeter, a voltmeter, and an\noscilloscope . The SEM also has a\nrastering feature that limits the\nelectron-beam scan horizontally and\nvertically so that only a selected subcomponent or area of the IC is\nirradiated . In addition , the microscope\nincludes a spot mode that permits the\nirradiation dot to be scanned manually\nover the area of interest.\nPreliminary setup and raster adjustments are made at 2 keY to minimize\nradiation effects prior to the final,\ntimed exposure . Then the electron\nenergy is switched to 30 keY , which\npenetrates the metal and ins ulation\nlayers . Magnification ranges between\n100 and 500 are generally s\\Jfficient to\ncover single subcomponents and their\nisolation areas .\nThe test procedure is initiated by\ncalibrating the absorbed electronbeam current at a fix ed aperture\nsetting , with the electron beam\n\n574\n\nL V ~ ELECTRON GUN (FILAMENT)\nI \\.AAA.J BEAM-BLANKING COIL\n\n\\.AAA.J\n\n..J IL\nI\n-\'1\n..J IIL\n-, I\n\n\\.AAA.J\n\n1----__\n\nL.,..;;.;:\';";\';\';\';\'~\n\nI\n\nFIRST CONDENSER LENS\n\nSECOND CONDENSER LENS~_ _ _ _--,\n\n\\.AAA.J g~CiCTION\n\n..J I\nIL\n-,\n\n-- I\n\nI\n\nMAGNIFICATION\nCONTROL\n\nFINAL LENS\nFINAL\n\n~APERTURE\nDETECTOR\n\nx. y.

Because\nthese low current levels create a\nnoisy image on the microscope\nviewing screen, larger currents are\nused during the setup phase of the\ntest. During the tests, the image\ndetector is replaced when necessary\nto maintain the maximum signal-tonoise ratio.\nOnce the circuit is set up , all the\nsubcomponents within a given section\nof a chip are irradiated in sequence ,\nstarting with the least sensitive and\nending with the most sensitive .\nTypical exposure times are near 1 min\n\nfor a total dose of 106 rad (Si). Shorter\nexposures are used for unhardened\ndevices . A digital counter/timer controls the exposure times through a\nbeam-blanking coil.\nWhen small sections are irradiated\nat magnification settings between 500\nand 2,000 , special compensation by\nthe x , y , and z axes stage controls\nminimizes image offset.

The\ncharts account for heat transfer\nbetween the gas and the cylinder\nwalls, and the charging gas is treated\n\nas a real gas that is subject to intermolecular forces . Previous methods\nfor determining topping pressure required lengthy trial-and-error calculations, and they were based on the\ninaccurate assumptions that the\ncharging process is adiabatic and that\nthe filling gas behaves like an ideal\ngas.\nCharts for two gases - hydrogen\nand oxygen - are available (see the\nfigure), and charts" for other important\nindustrial gases can be developed\nfrom the model.

One signal, a\nreference, is compared to a test signal\nthat is transmitted through the specimen (and back-reflected) . The change\nin specimen length is indicated by a\nchange in the phase difference between the two signals.

The\npast procedure for solving the deformation variables required the tedious\nuse of charts or a high-speed computer.\nThe contact geometry in ball bearings , gears , and cams can be\ndepicted by two solids having different\nradii of curvature in a pair of principal\nplanes (x and y) passing through a\nsingle-point contact between the\nsolids with no applied load . Such a\ncondition is called "point contact" and\nis shown in the figure where the radii\nof curvature are noted by r\'s.\nIt is assumed that for convex\nsurfaces , the curvature is positive but\nthat for concave surfaces , the curvature is negative .

(Absorption reduces the path length to only about 20\ncm .) This eliminates any background\neffects caused by radiation that might\nbe backscattered from regions outside\nthe volume being sampled.

A\nnegative transparency of the first\nimage and a positive transparency of\nthe second are overlaid in perfect\nregister . Cracks and changes in shape\nappear as bright spots when the\noverlay is viewed on a light table .\nThe method was developed for\nevaluating the effect of environmental\ntests on ceramic tiles used in the\nSpace Shuttle .

This\ntime-consuming procedure required\nsome knowledge of where the\nchanges might occur , and it gave no\npermanent record of the test results.\nIn the new technique , a pOint\nsource of blue light illuminates the\nsurface of the tile or other object\nthrough a grid transparency, as shown\nin Figure 1.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA small cylindrical test chamber\ncan be used to determine the behavior\nof flammable liquids in combination\nwith other materials under adiabatic\ncompression . Experiments can be\nconducted to find out whether a given\ncontainer material has a catalytic\neffect on a fuel that might contribute to\naccidental deflagration or detonation\nbelow the expected temperature .\nThe chamber has been used to\ndetermine the compatibility of hydrazine with various materials (stainless\nsteels, aluminum alloys, tungsten\ncarbide , and others) considered for\nthe fuel system in the Space Shuttle . It\nshould also be useful to producers and\nusers of flammable liquids and to\nsafety specialists.\nDesigned for use with aU-tube\npressure system, the chamber holds a\nhollow cylindrical specimen of the\nmaterial (see figure) .

The chart (and\nthe rupturable disk) gives evidence of\nany detonation .\nIn the hydrazine tests , the pressure\nwas increased at a rate of 2S,OOO\npsi Is (172 .s x l0 6 N I m 2 /s) to a 30: 1\ncompression ratio at 80\xc2\xb0 F (26 .7\xc2\xb0 C)\nand at SO ,OOO psi/s (34S x 100\nN/m 2 /s) to a 20 :1 ratio at 27So F\n(13S0 C) . No detonation was found\nwith any of the materials tested .\nThe compression tester is a modification of an earlier version in which\ncompression took place entirely in a\nU-tube made of the specimen material.

A vidicon and TV monitor display an image (of the upper sideband) that represents the internal structure of the\nspecimen .\n\nThe immersion of a test specimen in\nwater or other liquid is not necessary\nwith a new acousto-optical imaging\nsystem for nondestructive testing .\nInstead , the specimen is placed in\ncontact with a membrane that forms\nthe end wall of a Bragg cell. Acoustic\npulses are transmitted through the\nwater-filled cell , through the membrane , and into the specimen . The\npulses are reflected by the specimen\nback into the water , where they\ninteract with pulses of laser light ,\ndiffracting part of the light into upper\nand lower sidebands (see figure) . One\nof these sidebands is detected by a\nvidicon and is displayed on a TV\nmonitor to image the internal structure\nof the specimen .\nLight from the laser is collimated\nand converged into a wedge with a line\nof focus just outside the Bragg cell.\nThe cell is an alum inum box measuring 40 by 20 by 20 centimeters . It is\nfitted with end windows that allow the\nlaser light to enter and leave .\nA quartz transducer is mounted on a\npanel at the top of the cell . The trans-\n\n582\n\nducer fundamental frequency is 18.7\nmegahertz , but it can be driven at odd\nharmonics of the fundamental. Since\nthe resolution of the system is directly\nproportional to the acoustic frequency , it is desirable to use the\nhighest frequency practical, which in\nthis case is about 56 megahertz .\nThe radio-frequency pulse that\nenergizes the quartz transducer is also\nsent through a delay line to an\nelectronic shutter that controls the\nlaser light emission. The pulse synchronizes the acoustic and optical\nsignals so that they appear simultaneously only at the time when the desired\nimage can be formed . For example ,\nafter a sound burst has been generated , a laser pulse is generated to\ninteract with reflected sound from a\nselected depth with in the specimen. In\nthis way , the structure of the specimen in a plane at the selected depth is\nimaged . This process is repeated with\nincreaSing delays between the emission of sound and the em ission of\nlight , so that the reflected sound\nrepresents increasing depths within\nthe specimen .\n\nThe system operates in real time ,\ndoes not requ ire film developing , and\nuses readily-available optical components . One of its primary advantages is that it makes it possible to\ninspect objects that are too large to be\nimmersed or might be damaged by\ndirect contact with the liquid .\nUnlike holographic imaging systems , the acousto-optical system does\nnot demand exceptionally-h igh dimensional stability in its components , and\nthus it is easier to set up and maintain\nin production testing . Moreover , since\nthe interpretation of interference\nfringes is not necessary , the system\ncan be used by people without specific\ntraining in holography.\nThis work was done by Hua -Kuang\nLiu of Lumin, Inc ., for Marshall\nSpace Flight Center.

The chief program is an axisymmetric potential-flow\nprogram , called EOO , which calculates the incompressible potential flow\nabout arbitrary axisymmetric bodies .\nInput for EOO , from various specified analytical shapes or sets of\ncoordinate pOints for the inlet components , is generated by a program\ncalled SCIRCL. Basic solutions computed by the EOO program can be\ncombined into solutions of interest by\na program called COMBYN, which\nalso applies compressibility corrections . Together, these programs can\nbe used to calculate the compressible\npotential flow in an arbitrary axisymmetric inlet at any combination of\noperating conditions of inlet mass-flow\nrate, free-stream velocity, and inlet\nincidence angle . This package should\nprove to be a very useful tool for the\ndevelopment of a wide variety of\npropulsion system inlet designs .\nProgram SCIRCL prepares coordinate point input for efficient use by the\npotential-flow program . The inlet is\nassumed to be axisymmetric and is\nrepresented by its meridional profile .\nThis profile is broken into segments at\nconvenient tangent points . Each\nsegment may be defined by an\nanalytical expression or a set of\npoints. SCIRCL prepares input for\nEOO and provides printed information,\nsuch as curvature , wall angles, and\nflow-area distribution, which can be\n586\n\nuseful in the preliminary screening of\nproposed inlet shapes. Sets of points\nspanning the passage, like flowmeasuring rakes , are defined at axial\nlocations where velocity profiles or\nstreamlines are desired. These rake\npOints, with one specified as a control\nstation, are passed as input to EOO\nalong with the geometrical information. SCIRCL can provide plots of the\ninlet geometry, rake points, area\ndistribution, and curvature distribution .\nProgram EOO, originally developed\nby the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, is used for calculating incompressible potential flow. The program\napplies an exact general method of\nsolving the Neumann (or second\nboundary value) problem to the\ncalculation of flows about or within\naxisymmetric bodies . The program\nutilizes a distribution of sources or\nsinks of initially unknown strength to\nrepresent the inlet profile . This representation results in a Fredholm\nintegral equation of the second kind,\nwhich is exact for a continuous\ndistribution of source strength . This\ncontinuous distribution is approxi~\nmated by representing the inlet profile\nby a finite number of discrete elements characterized by a control point\non each element. Each element may\nhave the same type of source strength\ndistribution (e .g., constant, linear,\nparabolic), and the element itself may\nbe flat or curved . This approximation\nresults in a set of linear algebraic\nequations that are solved by matrix\nmethods for the source strength at the\ncontrol points . Velocities at the control\npoints and at specified off-body (rake)\npoints are calculated from the source\ndistribution . The program can calculate three basic solutions with the\nclosed-duct solutions and shroudvorticity solutions being used extensively . The closed-duct method uses a\ncombination of a closed-duct inlet and\nan open duct, both in an axial\nfree-stream flow, to obtain a static\narbitrary mass flow. The shroudvorticity method utilizes a distribution\nof unit vortexes, in addition to the inlet\nprofile distribution of sources, on the\nshroud surface to induce a static mass\nflow through the inlet. The basic\nsolutions are output by EOO for use by\nprogram COMBYN.\n\nProgram COMBYN combines the\nbasic solutions from EOO into any\nnumber of solutions of interest. A\nsolution of interest is one having\nspecified values for free-stream\nvelocity, inlet incidence angle, and\ninlet weight flow. The average axial\nvelocity at the control station may be\ninput instead of inlet weight flow.\nTemperature and pressure may be\nspecified if other than standard conditions are desired. The combined\nsolution velocity, obtained from the\nbasic incompressible solutions, includes the Lieblein-Stockman compressibility correction. Output from\nCOMBYN includes a printout of the\nvarious parametric and calculated\nvalues and plots of the onbody static\npressure ratio . When the velocity on\nthe inlet surface becomes locally\nsupersonic , the agreement , an optional supersonic correction based on\nlocal stream tube area, is included in\nCOMBYN .\nThese programs are written in\nFORTRAN IV for execution in the\nbatch or demand mode and have been\nimplemented on a UNIVAC 1100/42\nwith \xc2\xb7a maximum central memory\nrequirement of approximately 57K of\n36-bit words . For plotted output, a\nCALCOMP plotting system is required .\nThis program was written by\nCharles A. Farrell, Jr., and Norbert O.\nStockman of Lewis Research Center.\nFor further information, Circle 0 on\nthe COSMIC Request Card.\nLEW-1301O\n\nOrbital Heat Rate Package\nRadiative heat analysis\nThe Lockheed Orbital Heat Rate\nPackage (LOHARP) calculates the\ntemperature distribution of an orbiting\nspacecraft. It is a valuable tool in the\ndesign and analysis of other structures\nthat must function in complex thermal\nenvironments . LOHARP consists of\nthree separate computer programs:\nthe View Factor program (VU FACT) ,\nthe Radiation Constant program\n(RAOCON), and the Radiation Orbital\nHeating program (ROHEAT).\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1978\n\nThe VUFACT program calculates\nthe diffuse radiation view factors\nbetween any system of surfaces and\nincludes the effects of shading and\nsemitranspar~nt\nsurfaces .\nThe\nRADCON program calculates the\nradiant interchange factors between\nany system of surfaces, including the\neffects of absorptivity, emissivity, and\nreflectivity for multiple reflections . The\nROHEAT program calculates the\ndirect incident flux and total absorbed\nheat rates for complex vehicles in orbit\nabout a planet.\nUsed as a system , these three\nprograms can accurately predict the\ntemperature distribution of a structure\nin planetary orbit. VUFACT and\nRADCON are very useful in the\nthermal analysis of any complex\nconfiguration where the effects of\nradiative interchange are important.\nThe VUFACT program calculates\ndiffuse view factors based on geometry . The seven basic surface shapes\navailable for modeling a complex\nvehicle are rectangular and trapezoidal plates, circular plates, cylinders, cones, spheres , and circular\nparaboloids . The view factor equation\nconsists of a double-area integral\nevaluated over the two surfaces for\nwhich the view factor is to be\ncalculated . VUFACT utilizes a doublesummation numerical method for\nevaluating the integral equation.\nThis method utilizes an incremental\narea approach, in which each surface\narea is subdivided into incremental\nareas called elements . Assuming that\nthe view factor over a given element\narea is constant , the view factors are\ncalculated between elements and\nsummed over the entire areas to yield\nthe view factor between surfaces .\nShading and semitransparent intervening surfaces are accounted for on\nthe incremental level. VUFACT has a\nbuilt-in restart capability so that\ncompleted calculations need not be\nrepeated in the event of abnormal\ntermination . VUFACT prepares an\noutput tape containing necessary\nsurface information and view factors\nto allow radiant interchange factors to\nbe computed with RADCON .\nThe RADCON program computes\nthe net radiant interchange between\ntwo surfaces as the difference between the radiant energy emitted by\nthe first surface and absorbed by the\nsecond, and the energy emitted by the\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1978\n\nsecond and absorbed by the first. This\nincludes energy traveling directly from\nthe first surface to the second and also\nthe energy that impinges on other\nsurfaces and is then reflected between\nseveral surfaces in the system until it\nis finally absorbed by the second .\nRADCON employs the basic method\nof Hottle with the assumptions that all\nsurfaces are perfectly diffuse emitters\nand reflectors, surface emissivities\nand absorptivities are\nconstant\n(temperature-Independent), all surfaces are gray (wavelength-independent) , and infrared and solar transmissivities of each surface are constant\n(incident-angle-independent) .\nTwo\nsets of radiant interchange factors\nmay be computed with one set based\non the infrared emissivity of the\nsurfaces and the other set based on\nthe solar absorptivity . The interchange\nfactors are output on magnetic tape\nfor input to the ROHEAT program .\nThe ROHEAT program calculates\nthe direct incident flux and total\nabsorbed heat rates for vehicles in\nplanetary orbit. An important consideration in the design of a spacecraft\nis the thermal environment the vehicle\nexperiences in planetary orbit. The\ndirect incident heat flux on a vehicle is\nthe radiant energy flux that is available\nat the surface from the Sun (solar).\nthe planet (planet shine). and that\nreflected from the planet atmosphere\n(albedo) . The total absorbed heat rate\nis the energy rate that is absorbed by\nthe surface and includes the energy\nreflected by other surfaces.\nThe vehicle to be analyzed may be\nin either a circular or an elliptic orbit\nand may be either planet- or Sunoriented . A transfer orbit is available ,\nand the vehicle is allowed to rotate\nabout and to spin about the x-axis. The\ndirect incident heat rates are calculated by classical me1hods . The total\nabsorbed heat rates are calculated as\nfunctions of the direct incident fluxes,\nthe radiant interchange factors from\nRADCON , the infrared absorptivity\nand transmissivity, the solar absorptivity and transmissivity, and the\nsurface areas .\nThe programs are written in\nFORTRAN V and Assembler for batch\nexecution and have been implemented\non a UNIVAC 1108 under control of\nEXEC 8 with the largest program\nhaving a central memory requirement\nof approximately 64K of 36-bit words.\n\nProgram usage requires several tape\ndrives (up to nine) and Fastran\nstorage\nThis program was written by J. K.\nLovin and L. W. Spradley of Lockheed\nMissiles & Space Co. for Marshall\nSpace Flight Center.

Heating rates can be computed\nrapidly for any point on the vehicle at\nany angle of attack or roll pOSition.\nThus, the heating environment for\nnumerous points on the vehicle can\nbe found accurately as a function of\ntime for thermal protection systems or\nstructural breakup studies . The programs calculate heating for freemolecular, rarefied , laminar, transitional, and turbulent-flow regimes .\nThe flow-field methods used for calculating tumbling-body entry heating\nare , in general, techniques used ultimately to compute boundary-layer\nedge conditions . The four major\ncalculations made are: oblique shock,\npressure distribution, recovery enthalpy, and specific vehicle geometry.\nAir thermodynamic and transport\nproperties are used throughout. Realgas thermodynamic and transport\nproperties of air are obtained using\nthe method of Hansen. Equilibrium\nthermodynamic properties of air are\nobtained in closed form from a set of\napproximate partition functions . The\npartition functions and thermodynamic relationships are programed\nsuch that the total enthalpy , entropy ,\nspeed of sound , average molecular\nweight , heat capacity , and species\nconcentration can be found for a given\ntemperature and pressure .\n(continued on next page)\n\n587\n\n0\n\nBefore the aerodynamic heating\ncalculations are performed , the surface distance from the forward flying\nend to the axial location of interest is\ndetermined , the wall enthalpy is\ncomputed based on the specified wall\ntemperatures , and the flight regime\n(e .g., free-molecular , rarefied, or\nboundary-layer) is determined . Regardless of the vehicle orientation , a\nzero-angle-of-attack flow-field and\nheating calculation is performed . If\nthe angle of attack (plus the body\nangle) is greater than 1 0 , then a\nstagnation-line-angle-of-attack flowfield and heating calculation is also\nperformed . A heating option for\nhemispherical geometry is available .\nThe stagnation values are obtained\nusing the method of Fay and Riddle ,\nand the distribution values are obtained using a property-independent\nform of Lee \'s heating distribution for\nlaminar flow .\nThe input is normally on cards and\nincludes variables that describe the\nvehicle geometry , test conditions ,\ntrajectory , and number of body points\nto be computed . The printed program\noutput contains free-stream variables , local heating rates, local totalheating load , heat-transfer coefficients , recovery enthalpy , and stagnation-line values .\nThese programs are written in\nFORTRAN IV for batch execution and\nhave been implemented on a UNIVAC\n11 ~O-series computer under EXEC 8\nwith a central memory requirement of\napproximately 40K decimal of 36-bit\nwords .\nThis program was written by CarlO .\nEngel of REMTECH Inc. for Marshall\nSpace Flight Center.

A continuing problem In the\ndevelopment of air-breathing propulsion systems is the design of efficient\nsubsonic diffusers . Not only is the\nengineer faced with building an\nefficient diffuser but frequently he\nmust tailor the exit flow within certain\nphysical constraints imposed by the\npropulsion engine . This task has\nproved difficult in the past since the\nengineer was forced to relay on empirical design methods based on correlations of limited experimental data.\nThe vast number of geometrical paramaters involved , such as area ratio,\nlength , wall curvature, and support\nstruts , together with the physical flow\nparameters involved, such as mach\nnumber, Reynolds number , swirl\nangle , and inlet flow distribution , make\nthe development of a sufficientlygeneralized empirical method extremely difficult.\nAnalytical diffuser-design methods\nhave generally not kept pace with\nempirical studies, with conventional\nanalytical \xc2\xb7solutions dividing the flow\nfield into an irrotational free-stream\nflow and a boundary-layer flow . The\nnew method used in this program\ninvolves numerically solving the equations of motion for the entire flow in\nthe diffuser , thereby insuring compatibility between the inviscid flow and the\nboundary-layer flow . The program\nprovides an accurate analytical tool\nfor the development of optimum\ndiffuser designs for a wide range of\napplications .\nThis analysis method represents an\nextension to compressible flow of\nanalysis methods previously developed for computing incompressible\n\nswirling flows in axisymmetric ducts .\nThe analysis solves for the entire flow\nacross the duct at each station in the\nstream flow direction . The problems of\nmatching solutions for the inviscid flow\nand boundary layer are eliminated ,\nand no difficulties exist when boundary\nlayers on the duct walls merge . The\nanalysis supposes that the streamlines\nof the actual flow through the duct will\nnot be appreciably different from the\npotential flow streamlines, an assumption that , from simple physical considerations , must remain valid for\ninternal duct flows with only small\nregions of separation.\nIt is possible to make boundarylayer-type approximations in a coordinate system based upon the stream\nfunction and velocity potential of the\npotential flow . In this manner, the\nviscous effects can be treated as a\nperturbation upon the inviscid field and\nexpressed as a parabolic partial differential equation . Elliptic properties of\nthe flow are retained through selection\nof the potential flow streamlines as the\ncoordinate system for the parabolic\npartial differential equation .\nIncluded in the analysis are the\ncapabilities for treating the effects of\nstruts , inlet guide vanes , flow-straightening vanes , and distributed wall\nbleed . Input to the program consists of\ncalculation control parameters, geometrical data , and physical data .\nOutput includes calculated wall conditions, strut data , blade forces , and\nsolutions for the flow variables across\nthe duct at selected streamwise\nstations .\nThis program is written in FORTRAN\nIV for execution in the batch mode and\nhas been implemented on a UNIVAC\n1108 under control of EXEC 8 with a\ncentral memory requirement of approximately 47K of 36-bit words .\nThis program was written by O.

A heated wax pellet\nproduces the driving force to rotate the shaft by 100\xc2\xb0. The final 80\xc2\xb0 of rotation are provided by the two springs that are\ncompressed during the initial motion. Rotational tolerance is \xc2\xb11/4\xc2\xb0; stray magnetic fields are less than 0.1 gamma.\n\nHeated wax that expands against a\npiston drives a new two-position rotary\nactuator (see figure) . The actuator\nrotates a shaft by precisely 180\xc2\xb0 and\nrotates it back on command . The\nmechanism weighs only 1/2 pound\n(0.23 kg). consumes 11 watts of\npower, and functions over a wide\ntemperature range under high vacuum\nfor long and unattended periods . It\nproduces virtually no stray magnetic\nfields and may therefore be used to flip\na magnetometer for calibration . The\nactuator is an improved version of a\nmodel described In a previous Issue of\n\nTech Briefs . [See " Cyclical\nBidirectional Rotary Actuator " (GSC11883, GSC-11974 , and GSC-11975)\non page 118 of Vol. 1, No . 1.]\nWhen a heater bonded to the wax\npeilet is energized , the heated wax\nexpands and forces the piston out\nfrom the pellet. A shoulder of the\npiston bears against the beam and\nrotates the toggle. The toggle is tied to\nthe shaft through a pin that travels in\nthe toggle slot . As the toggle rotates , it\nbears against the pin and rotates the\nshaft . This produces approximately\n100\xc2\xb0 of rotation of the shaft. An\nNASA\n\nadditional 80\xc2\xb0 are provided by the two\nflexator springs that were compressed\nduring the initial motion .\nMechanical stops accurately limit\nthe angle of rotation. A second heaterpellet and beam assembly rotates the\nshaft back to its original position. Two\ncontact switches indicate whether\nrotation has been completed, and the\nposition switch indicates whether the\nshaft is in the 0\xc2\xb0 or 180\xc2\xb0 orientation .\nThis mechanism possesses a\nnumber of advantages over other\nactuators, such as those that are\ndriven by a bimetallic coiled spring.\n(continued on next page)\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1978\n\n591\n\n0\n\nThe volume (less the magnetometer)\nis 35 in.3 (O .57 X 10-3 cm 3). It requires\nno power other than that supplied to\nthe heater during the actual rotation . It\nis therefore not susceptible to power\nfluctuations and is thermally stable .\nThe actuator functions well from -45 0\nto +65 0 C. Its rotational tolerance is\n\n\xc2\xb1 1140. Stray magnetic fields are less\nthan 0.1 gamma at 112 inch (1 .3 cm),\nwhich makes it ideal for magnetometer applications .\nThis work was done by William C.\nStange of Goddard Space Flight\nCenter.

The modified valve was\ndeveloped for arc-powered wind tunnels that often require more air flow\n(in controlled amounts) than can pass\nsafely through the arc . The valve\ninjects the extra airflow into the tunnel\ndownstream from the arc . The principle can be adapted to other equipment\nin which flow above a predetermined\nlevel must be diverted from time to\ntime .\nIn the modification, a diaphragm\npressure-reducing regulator is converted into a sensitive back-pressure\nregulator. The new version allows\nautomatic , accurate, easily adjustable transfer of the excess airflow.\nThe modification consists of adding\nan O-ring seal to the pushrod and a\nplug to the internal sensing channel\n(see figure) . The valve input port is\nconnected by a tee to the airflow line\nat a point just upstream from the arc,\nand the valve output port is connected\nto the airflow line just downstream\nfrom the arc . The upstream pressure\n(the pressure at the input port) is\nconnected to the dome s ide of the\ndiaphragm , while the desired bypass\nsetpoint pressure is applied under the\ndiaphragm (through the normal external sens ing port) . An external\nsurge volume of gas is inserted in the\nbypass setpoint pressure line to hold\nthe setpoint.\nThe O-ring prevents bypass setpoint air from leaking along the push-\n\n592\n\nDOME\n\nPLATE\n\nDIAPHRAGM\n\n~~~!~~IE~~~:~"\n\nINTERNAL\nSENSING -!-++~m"""""\'"\nCHANNEL\n\nSETPOINT\nBYPASS\nPRESSURE\nINPUT\n\nINPUT\n\nPORT__ _ ___.\n-\n\nARC\n\n-\n\nOUTPUT\nPORT\n\nAn Excess-Flow Dlverter Valve is shown here with its pushrod in the fully closed\nposition.

The diaphragm side of the dome\nplate is lightly grooved to distribute\nthe dome pressure over the entire\nsurface of the diaphragm .\nAs long as the supply I\'lressure\n(flow rate) is less than the preselected\nbypass pressure, the valve does not\nbypass any air - the entire flow\nenters the tunnel upstream of the arc .\nHowever, when the air flow to the arc\ndrives the input pressure above the\n\nbypass-setpoint pressure (maximum\nflow rate desired to the arc), the valve\nautomatically adjusts to the proper\nopening by internal feedback and\nbypasses the excess flow to its discharge port and thence to the downstream airflow .\nThis work was done by Robert F.\nMayo of Langley Research Center.\nNo further documentation is available .\nLAR-12063\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1978\n\nLow Partial Discharge Vacuum Feedthrough\nA semiconducting sleeve on the inner conductor\nreduces partial discharge by a factor of 104.\n\nGoddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland\nPartial discharges, troublesome\nmomentary electrical breakdowns that\noccur near surface irregularities on\nhigh-voltage feedthroughs, are sharply\nreduced by a new feedthrough, shown\nin the figure . Its principal feature is a\nsemiconducting sleeve around the\ninner conductor stranded wire that\nsmooth out the equipotential surfaces\nand prevents intense local electric\nfields from building up.\nThree of the new feedthroughs were\ntested at 20 kV dc and atmospheric\npressure.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA new adjustable flow restrictor\nreduces the pressure of flowing gases\nand simultaneously heats them . The\ndevice cons ists essentially of two\nmating threads (see figure) ; the small\nspace between the threads is a long\nnarrow helical path for the flowing gas\nand reduces its original high pressure\nto a low value within a short axial\ndistance .

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA flexible bellows transmits rotary\nmotion around a corner , just as bevel\ngears do but with much less weight.\nThe bellows can transmit torques in\nthe range of 100 to 1,000 poundinches (10 to 100 N-m) at corner\nang les as great as 180\xc2\xb0 .\nDeveloped for opening and clOSing\nremotely operated doors on the Space\n\n594\n\nShuttle Orbiter , th is " transmission "\nmight be useful in other situations\nwhere :\n- light weight is des ired ,\n- small motions or misal inements may\noccur between the two points of\nrotation ,\n-the passage of flu ids or electric\nwires through the hollow interior\n\nwou ld save space and we ight ,\n- a hermetic seal between the two\nrotating members is requ ired .\nPossible uses include marine or submerged mechanisms and food-processing or pharmaceutical machinery\nwhere a sealed drive line or a drive\nline without contaminating lubricants\nIs requ ired .\n\nNASA Tech Briefs , Winter 1978\n\nThe transmission consists of a\ncorrugated metal tube that cart bend\nalong its axis , but does not twist.\nThus, rotation of one end of the\nbellows produces the same rotation at\nthe other end. Both oscillating and\ncontinuous rotation can be transmitted . (However, if the arc is of small\nradius and large angle , the complete\nstress reversals of continuous rotations will shorten the life of the\nbellows .)\nFor distances greater than about 5\ncm between the pOints of rotation ,\nonly the ends need be corrugated ; the\ncenter portion can be a straight tube\nas in the figure. The bellows is welded\nor brazed to a spindle , which provides\nor accepts the rotational force.\nIf the torque is fairly high , the\nbellows has a tendency to undulate as\nit turns . This "squirming" motion can\nbe prevented by encasing the bellows\nin a sheath . The sheath performs other\nuseful functions as well : It supports an\nintermediate straight tube against\nvibration , and it protects the bellows\nagainst damage during handling and\ninstallation - particularly valuable if\nthe bellows wall is thin .\nIf no sheath is used, the bellows\nlinkage is essentially friction-free, and\nno lubrication is needed except that\nnormally used at the main pivots.\nWhen a sheath is used, the relative\nmotion between sheath and bellows\ncauses a small amount of friction in\nthe linkage .\nIf the application requires only\nlimited rotation , the bellows may be\nshaped to an angle when it is fabrica-\n\nUNCONVOLUTED STRAIGHT\n" ~-- PORTION OF TORQUE TUBE\n\nL\n\nn\n\nii\n\nRotary Motion Is Transm itted from one shaft to another at an angle of 90\xc2\xb7 by this\nbellows device.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nThe fuel-cell powerplant aboard the\nSpace Shuttle uses a drag pump with a\nliquid water separator to remove\nproduct water from the circulating\nhydrogen . A rotating filter (see figure)\nincorporated in the water separator\nsection traps contaminants before\nthey reach the critical impeller /statorhousing interface, thus preventing\npump seizure or other damage . The\nfilter is located as close as possible to\nthe critical interface.\nAn important consideration in designing the filter is the close tolerances at the impeller face and at the\nimpeller outside diameter. The tolerances are necessary for best pump\nperformance with minimum size and\nweight. When the drag pump is in a\nvibration mode, the impeller/stator\nface gap normally closes , and the\nfilter protects the face gap from\ncontamination during the vibrationinduced face closure .\nAs shown, the filter is a screen\nmesh on a conical retainer. It mounts\non the water separator and is held in\nplace by an interference fit. The centrifugal forces generated during\nthe impeller/sump/separator rotation\nclear the screen of condensed water\ndroplets that are deposited either\nduring pump operation or following\npowerplant shutdown . Tests have\nshown that the screen clears itself\nafter a normal fuel-cell shutdown and\nsubsequent condensation of water\nvapor from the saturated hydrogen\ngas .

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texa.<i\nAn annular filter used in the Space\nShuttle propellant system allows the\nunimpeded flow of fluid through its\ncenter but removes particles from\nfluid passing through it in a radial\ndi rection . The filter thus separates\nparticulates from bypass fluid without\nslowing down the main flow (see\nfigure). Possible applications include\nfluidized-bed reactors , equipment for\ncatalyst operations , and water purification systems .\nThe filter consists of stacked rings\ncontaining precise, chemically milled\ngaps . The gaps allow bypass fluid to\npass through the filter , but they retain\nparticles . The gap depth corresponds\nto the maximum-size particle that can\npass with the fluid . For example, rings\nwith 3-micron gaps would retain\nparticles larger than 3 microns .\nThe filter can withstand high differential pressures, and it can easily be\ndisassembled for cleaning . It also\ntakes up very little space, and it\nshould therefore be useful in restricted geometries . When the ring\nelements are assembled , they exert a\nspring force against each other.

However , these seals tend to\nstick, particularly when the valves\nhave been closed for a long time.\nA close examination of the elastomer material revealed that a lowmolecular-weight hydrocarbon oozes\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1978\n\nout during heat exposure , forming a\ntough sticky film . This hydrocarbon ,\nalso called "tail," is present in all\nconventional polymer seals and constitutes about 3 percent by weight of\nthe material. An additional tail is\ngenerated during peroxide-catalyzed\ncure as a result of free-radicalinduced chain splitting. In both cases ,\nthe tail causes stickiness and promotes permanent deformation of seals\nthat have been compressed .\n\nA new process removes part of the\ntail from the elastomer. The elastomer\n(in this test NASEAL-411, or equivalent , based on Nordel1635 formulation , or equivalent) is boiled in hexane\nat 1500 F (65 0 C) for 1 hour . The\nelastomer then is dried for 1 hour at\n320 0 F (160 0 C) .\nThe process extracts 2.8 percent of\nthe total weight from the finished\nelastomer , or approximately one-half\n(continued on next page)\n\n597\n\nof the extractable tail .

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA simple metall ic seal, originally\ndesigned to prevent hot gas from\nleaking through gaps between the split\nrudder and speed brake on the Space\nShuttle, could be adapted for home\nand industrial use. It could , for\nexample, be used to prevent heat from\nescaping through gaps around doors ,\nwindows, partitions , and similar structures .\nThe barrier consists of a series of\nU-shaped metal strips that are installed along the entire length of the\ngap . Each strip (see figure) is secured\nby rivets or screws to one side of the\ngap . This side also includes a channel\nfilled with room-temperature-vulcanized (RTV) silicone rubber . The rubber\nlining prevents gas from leaking into\nthe cavity on this side of the seal. The\nother side of the metallic barrier\npresses against the surface on the\nopposite side of the gap.

The belts are particularly\nsuited to use in machinery for which\nbelt replacement is difficult or impossible , such as permanently encased\nequipment, machines used in tunnels\nor mine shafts , and machines that\nrequire elaborate disassembly before\nthe belt is accessible. Unlike belts\ncomposed of plastic and polymeric\nfibers , the stainless-steel belts would\nnot degrade in a harsh environment ;\nand , unlike corrugated metal belts ,\nthe stainless-steel belts would not\nstretch or slip .\nOne design for an all-steel belt,\nshown in Figure 1, uses cylindrical\nrods that run transverse to the entire\nbelt length and serve as teeth to mesh\nwith wheel sprockets . The teeth / rods\nare held together by a number of steel\nwires that run along the length of the\nbelt . The wires form loops around\npreselected rods ; adjacent wires are\nlooped around different rods, as\nshown , to prevent the rods from\nshifting position along the direction of\nbelt travel (a common cause of belt\nfailure) .\nTo ensure correct spacing, wires\nare looped around rods according to\nthe formula\nM\n\n= K(N\n\n+\n\n1)\n\nwhere M is the number of rods making\nup the belt , N is the number of rods\nbetween consecutive loops, and K is\nan integer. For example , when N is 2\nand K is 6, M is 18. A similar procedure is used when a spiraling single\nwire is wound around the periphery of\nthe belt to form a multitude of adjacent\nwires . In this case\nM = K(N\n\n+\n\nFigure 1. Transverse Rods form the teeth In this stainless-steel drlvebelt.

The device, which was\norig inally conceived for remote unlatching of spacecraft doors, may\nalso be useful in automatic assembly\napparatus , in food-processing machinery and as a controller for\nsequentially operated valves .\nThe sequencer takes cyclic rotary\nmotion (first clockwise , then counterclockwise over the same arc) and\nconverts it to cyclic rotary motions ,\nover smaller arcs , of two separate\noutputs .\nAs shown in the figure, an input arm\nmoves a notched drive plate .

The roller\nrides in a track as the lug pushes the\ncrank , turning output arm 1 through an\narc (90 0 in the figure) .

The instrument\nwas developed for the Space Shuttle,\nwhere it is used to insert a trunnion on\nthe payload keel into a fitting in the\npayload bay. A crewmember must\ninsert the trunnion "blind ." Without\nthe aid of a position-sensing instrument, the operation is difficult and\npotentially dangerous, since the fitting\ncan be pushed aside or missed\nentirely .\nThe new device visually indicates\nthe relative positions of the trunnion\nand the fitting and shows when the two\nparts are lined up . It is also expected\nto be useful in industrial operations\nwhere parts must be blind-positioned\naccurately. One possible application is\nin the underwater assembly of rigs for\noffshore oil drilling.\nTo install the indicator , two variable-reluctance\ntransducers\nare\nmounted in a toroidal configuration on\nthe Orbiter fitting, and an armature is\nadded to the bottom of the keel\ntrunnion (see figu re). When the\noperator brings the trunnion close to\nthe fitting , the armature alters the\nmagnetic paths in the four segments\nof the transducer . If the reluctances of\nthe four paths (including airgaps) are\nnot equal, the differences in impedance are converted electronically to\nposition error signals in the x and y\naxes . The errors are displayed on a\nmeter readout.\nThe effective range of the transducer is \xc2\xb15 in . (12 .5 cm) along the x\nand y axes (in the plane of the transducer) and 1 in .

The fastener (see\nfigure) consists of a serrated stem and\nball mount, a separable disk or\nwasher , a ball socket, and a retainer.\nThe stem and the disk hold the\nblankets, and the ball and socket allow\nthe blankets to be attached to and\ndetached from the support quickly.\nThe new fastener has advantages\nover several commercial fasteners\nthat were originally considered for use\non the Space Shuttle , including\ncanvas snaps and string and tie\nbuttons . The snaps were found to be\ndifficult to install and aline ; and\nblankets held by string and tie buttons\ntook too long to remove and replace\nfor area maintenance .\nInstallation of the fastener begins by\nmounting several retainers and ball\nsockets on the supporting structure ,\nusing adhesive . An alternate version\nof the retainer is riveted to the\nstructure . Next , the ball ends of the\nserrated fasteners are inserted into\nthe ball sockets . The stem , ball, and\ndisk are made out of Torlon, or\nequivalent material .\nThe insulation blankets are mounted\nby pressing them against the protruding serrated stems until the\nblankets are pierced . The pierced\nblankets are held in place by flexible\n(metall ic or nonmetallic) disks that are\nsnapped onto the stems .

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nIn a proposed door mechanism, the\nhinge and latch are combined in a\nsingle four-part assembly . One continuous actuator stroke unlatches the\ndoor, swings it open, and finally it\nlatches the door open at 180 0 \xe2\x80\xa2 The\nassembly is simpler than the hardware\nfound on most automatic doors, which\ngenerally have separate hinge and\nlatch , each with their own actuating\nlinkages .\nAs shown in Figure 1, the four parts\nof the device include the door, the\ndoorframe, the actuator crank, and a\ncurved drag link. As shown in the\nsequence, the curved link moves the\ndoor back to unlatch its edge from the\njamb . Next , the actuator crank is\nrotated clockwise, which rotates the\ndoor through approximately 180 0\ntoward its fully open position. Further\nclockwise rotation of the crank locks\nthe door open by pulling it over a hook\nextending from the wall or other\nstructure adjacent to the door.\nAn alternate method of latching the\ndoor in the open position is illustrated\nin Figure 2. This design eliminates the\nextending hook. Instead , a springbiased hook is added to the door; the\nhook engages a matching slot in the\nadjacent structure when the door is\nlatched open . In this way the door can\nlie flush against the structure .\nThe new mechanism can be modified to lock the door in a 90 0 position .\nThis is done with minor alterations in\nthe shapes of the actuator link and the\ndrag link.\n\nHOOK\n\nDOOR\n\nDOOR FRAME\n\nDOOR FRAME\n\nDOOR ClOSED AND LATCHED\n\nL:=======q==============;~~~\nDOOR UNLATCHED\n\nACTUATOR\nMOTOR\nDOOR OPEN BUT UNLATCHED\n\nFigure 1.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\n\nx ..\nThe Stresses In I Cl se-Hlrdened Gelr\nTooth vary with distance (x) along the\nbase. The bending stress Is SO; the\ncompression stress is 51. Equations for\nthe stresses allow the fatigue behavior\nto be calculated for any point along the\nx axis .\n\nA new method for determining the\nstresses in the base of a casehardened gear tooth considers the\nentire base , not just the surface as in\nprev ious treatments . The method,\nwhich can be run on a desk\ncalculator , can help des igners to\ndetermine rapidly the gear fatigue life\nand the safety margin .\nThe outer portion of a casehardened gear tooth is a thin hard\nlayer (the case) that surrounds an\ninner core of softer , more ductile\nmaterial (see figure) . Although stress\nconcentrations are largest in the case\nand diminish into the core, it is\nposs ible for the interior stresses to\nexceed the yield limit of the core\nmaterial. The most critical region is\nthe core/case interface, where the\ncore is exposed to its greatest stress\n.concentration .\n\nIn developing the method , the laws\nof statics were used to determine an\nequation for the total stress, including\nbending and compression contributions , at any point along the base . The\nstress at the core/case boundary is\ncalculated by substituting known\nparameters , such as the case dimensions and the applied force , into the\nstress equation . The number of gear\ncycles to failure is then determined\nfrom the stress by using a modified\nGoodman diagram , which determines\nthe cumulative damage . This number\ncan be compared with the actual\nnumber of cycles to determine the\nsuitability of the gear for the proposed\napplication .\nThis work was done by Willis\nBrinkley of McDonnell Douglas Corp.\nfor Johnson Space Center.

The motor\nwould not regenerate for dynamic\nbraking due to a total loss of current\nduring switching from "run" to\n"brake " and due to a lack of consistent residual magnetism.\nA previous method developed for\nreexciting the field of a universal\nmotor from energy stored in a\ncapacitor does initiate dynamic braking . However, although this method is\neasily applied to unidirectional operation, it requires complex switching for\nbidirectional operation .\nSwitching for bidirectional motor\noperation with dynamic braking is\nsimplified by half-wave dc operation\nof the motor. (However, dc operation\ncannot be tolerated in all cases since\nbrush wear and commutation are\nadversely affected .) The circuit\nshown in the illustration was developed for remote control of a drive\nmechanism, using simple "forward,"\n"off," and "reverse " switching . The\nfield current direction is fixed and the\nmotor is reversed by reversing the\narmature current. The current path in\n"forward" is through diodes CR2 and\nCR5; in "reverse" the current path is\nthrough diodes CR4 and CR1 .

The current path for "forward" Is through diodes CR2 and\nCR5. In "reverse" the current path Is through diodes CR4 and CR1 . Diodes CR1 and\nCR2 provide a path for field current during the transition of relay contacts from the\nenergized to the deenerglzed state.\n\ncontacts (K1 or K2) from the energized to the deenergized state . This\nsustains sufficient field excitation to\nstart regeneration. The dc operation\nalso provides residual magnetism in\nthe field poles, which can start\nregeneration .\nDynamic brake-current paths are\nprovided for each direction of rotation\nby diode CR3 or CR6 . Normally\' closed\n\ncontacts of relays K1 and K2 are\nplaced in the dynamic brake paths to\navoid shunting the armature with a\nbraking resistor during "run" conditions.\nDynamic braking may be independently adjusted for each direction by\nvarying the value of the associated\nbraking resistor (R1 or R2) . If more\nspeed or torque is available than is\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1978\n\nrequired, resistor R3 may be placed in\nseries with the ac line to the motor,\nreducing motor current and improving\nbrush and commutator life . Relay\ncontacts can be substituted for two or\nmore of the steering diodes . Inter~ocking relay contacts and travel limit\n\nswitches are common additions to\nthis kind of motor control.\nWith this circuit , fast switching\nfrom forward to reverse can result in\nplugging the motor and may severely\ndamage the gear units .

Winter 1978\n\nControlling the Growth of Silicon Sheets\nAn automated system regulates sheet\nwidth, thickness, and composition.\n\nNASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nCareful process control is necessary to draw continuous, uniform\nsingle-crystal sheets from a silicon\nmelt. The operating conditions must\nbe precisely regulated to produce\nsheets of uniform width, thickness,\nand composition, such as those\nrequired for the manufacture of solar\ncells .\nA new system that measures the\nbrightness of the region where the\nsolid sheet emerges from the molten\nsilicon automatically regulates the\ngrowth of silicon ribbon sheets. The\nsystem responds to changes in the\ngrowth rate and makes compensations\nby altering the process parameters .\nThe emerging sheet is viewed at its\nleft and right edges and at its center by\nphotovoltaic sensors or vidicon tubes\n(see figure) . The brightness level at\neach sensor is a composite of the\nbrightness levels of the solid and liquid\nsilicon that falls within the sensor field\nof view . Since the solid sheet appears\nmuch brighter than the liquid, a\ndecrease in brightness implies that the\narea of liquid is increasing at the\nexpense of solid . For example, a\ndecrease in brightness at the left and\nright sensors implies that the area of\nsolid is shrinking (Le., the sheet is\nnarrowing). A decrease in brightness\nat the left end only means that the left\nedge of the sheet is growing narrower .\nIf the brightness decreased at the\ncenter, the liquid silicon meniscus is\nrising , and the sheet is becoming\nthinner.\nError signals from the left and right\nviewing devices control the flow of\nargon gas at the edges of the sheet.\nFor example, a negative error signal\nfrom the right monitor (caused by a\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1978\n\nARGON\nFEEOLINE\n\nRIGHT\nSENSOR\n\nSOLID\nSILICON\nSHEET\n\nThe Brightness of ShHt Silicon as It leaves the melt Is sensed at the left edge,\nmiddle, and right edge. Deviations from preset brightness levels create error signals\nthat alter the gas flow, crystal-pulling speed, and melt temperature to produce\nuniform single-crystal sheets.\n\ndecrease in brightness at the right)\nincreases the argon flow at the right.\nThis, in turn, widens the sheet at the\nright. The left and right error signals\nalso control the current in resistance\nheaters at the edges of the sheet.\nError signals from the monitor at the\ncenter are particularly important\nbecause they reflect not only thickness changes but also changes in\ngrowth stability and in silicon carbide\nparticle density on the sheet surface .\nTo maintain the meniscus height at a\npreset level, the middle error signal\ncontrols the sheet-pulling speed and\nthe melt temperature . For example, a\npositive error signal from the middle\n\nmonitor increases the pull speed and\ndecreases the temperature to decrease the sheet thickness and raise\nthe meniscus height.\nThis work was done by Theodore F.\nCiszek of IBM Corp. for NASA\'s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

Refer to NPO-1429S.\n\n613\n\nill\n\nAutomated Control of Crystal-G rowth\nOptical sensors detect liquid/crystalinterface growth parameters.\n\nNASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nThe edgewise growth of silicon\nribbon has been developed to reduce\nthe costs of producing silicon solar\ncells. This process can be automated\nby using optical sensing with coldcathode-discharge\n(CCD),\nlinear\nimaging devices (LID) to determine\nthe process status and to direct the\ngrowth process.\nRibbon crystal can be grown from a\nthin column of temperature-controlled\nliquid silicon, as seen in Figure 1. The\nliquid-column height is maintained by\ncapillary action that is created in a\nslitlike channel in a die . The die is\nimmersed in molten silicon . Critical\nfactors in this process are the temperature of the metal die and the height of\nthe meniscus at the crystal/liquid\ninterface. Meniscus height is directly\nproportional to the thickness of the\nsilicon crystal , and the die temperature is directly proportional to the\nmeniscus width, provided the pull rate\nand width of the die slit are constant.\nPreviously crystal growth was either\nobserved directly by the operator or\nmonitored by some nonoptical means.\nSuch methods did not lend themselves\nto automation or to close quality\ncontrol.\nAn automated approach to controlling ribbon thickness and die temperature has been tested . It uses a CCD\nlinear imaging device that senses light\ncontrasts . The CCD device resembles\na bar made up of many cells with a\ntypical center-to-center spacing of\n0.51 mil (0 .013 mm) ; its resolution\n\n614\n\ncompares favorably with more elaborate optical systems .\nTwo basic approaches have been\ndeveloped to control silicon ribbon\nthickness: one measures the ribbon\nwidth , and the other measures meniscus height. Both of these parameters\nhave an established mathematical\nrelationship to the die temperature and\nthus the ribbon thickness. Figure 2\nillustrates the ribbon-width sensing\nsystem.\nThe silicon ribbon appears bright\nagainst the dark background of the\nrelatively-cool radiation shields surrounding the die . The output from the\nLID is a clocked series of pulses, each\nof which corresponds to an optical\nsensor in the array . The amplitude of\neach pulse is proportional to the\nphoton flux that falls on the corresponding sensor . By the use of\nsampling techniques, a comparator,\nand a digital-to-analog converter, an\nanalog representation of the position\nof the image of each edge of the\nribbon is generated. Each edge\nposition sensor independently controls\nthe power applied to the respective\nend heater. Ribbon edge accuracy of\n\xc2\xb13 mils (\xc2\xb10.08 mm) is possible, but\nthe system is very susceptible to\nheater power variations .\nThe other approach to ribbon thickness control is the monitoring of the\nmeniscus height.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA simple technique for applying\nadhesive coatings to large surfaces\nkeeps the coating thickness variations\nto less than \xc2\xb10.0005 in . (\xc2\xb10.001 cm) .\nIn comparative tests against roller ,\nbrush , and spray application , thickness variations in the conventional\ntechn iques were at least three times\ngreater .\nThe new method consists of placing\na net fabric (such as nylon net) over\nthe surface to be coated , applying the\nadhesive , evening it off with a\nsqueegee blade , and then removing\nthe net while the adhesive is still fluid .\nThe adhesive settles into a smooth ,\nuniform layer and is cured in the usual\nway .\nBesides producing uniform thickness , the technique reduces application time by about one-half and saves\nroughly 30 percent in material , weight ,\nand cost.

Silk screening uses finer-mesh\n\nfabrics to apply patterns in small,\ndelimited areas , and it requires\nexpensive frames that must be cleaned after use . The new technique, on\nthe other hand, applies a uniform\ncoating over large areas by one-time\nuse of inexpensive, commercially\navailable netting .\nIn tests , a 6-mil (0 .15-mm) nylon\nnet (see figure) was stretched over a\nconvex aluminum surface and held by\nadhesive tape .

After the\nholding tape and netting were removed , the liquid coating settled to a\n\nsmooth , uniform layer that was allowed to cure at room temperature for 16\nhours . The coating was then peeled\naway and measvred. Its thickness\nvariations were found to be no more\nthan 0.0005 in . (0.013 mm) out of an\naverage thickness of 0.0065 in . (0 .17\nmm).

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA modified die-bonding machine\nspeeds the manufacture of hybrid\nelectronic circuits . The machine incorporates a pedestal to hold a tray\ncarrying a set of identical dice (IC\nchips). A second pedestal holds a set\nof substrates secured by a vacuum\nline . The dice are lifted from the tray\nby a vacuum probe and are placed at\ntheir proper locations on the epoxycoated substrates . After a set of chips\nis installed , a tray with a different set\nis brought out , and the process is\nrepeated until all the dice are installed.\nThe modified machine speeds up\nthe process significantly because an\nearlier model could handle only one\nsubstrate at a time . It therefore\nrequired more handling of the substrates, more time to fabricate each\nhybrid, and a greater likelihood of\ndamage and errors.\nThe new machine , shown in the\nillustration , incorporates two modified\npedestals : one for the die tray and the\nother for the substrate tray . The first\npedestal is equipped with a recessed\nadapter that secures the die tray . The\nsecond supports a tray holding a\nnumber of hybrid-circuit substrates\n(12 in this machine) . The substrate\ntray is secured to the pedestal\nsurface by a vacuum line .\nThe operating sequence begins\nwhen a tray of identical dice is placed\nin the proper orientation in the left\npedestal. Then a tray with the hybridcircuit substrates is placed on the\nright pedestal and is properly oriented\nby alining pins . Next, the base table is\nmoved to the right so that the pedestal\nwith the die tray is underneath the\nvacuum probe , and the vacuum probe\nis lowered to lift a die (with the\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1978\n\nThis Die-Bonding Machine uses two modifi ed pedestals: one supporting a die tray\nand the other holding a tray with substrates.

This\nprocess is continued until all the dice\n\nrequired for the hybrid are mounted on\nthe substrates on the pedestal.\nAlternately , the operator may\nmount a particular type of die on the\nsubstrates ; then he can replace this\ntray with another set of substrates ,\nand so on, until that die type is\nmounted on all the substrates .\nThis work was done by James E.\nBerg and Michael A.

The\nbackup strip for an electron-beamwelded butt joint is plated with a thin\nlayer of gold (see figure) . After\nwelding , the joint is inspected with\nX-rays . If there is no overpenetration,\nthe gold appears as a light strip on the\nX-ray negative film. However, if the\nelectron beam penetrates too far, it\ndisturbs the gold plate and causes\nlocalized voids that show up as dark\nspots on the film.\nThe gold plate can be a continuous\nstrip, or, to economize on the amount\nof gold needed , many short parallel\nstripes can be applied . Gold is used\nbecause it is highly opaque to X-rays\nand gives good contrast in the regions\nof weld overpenetration .\nThis\noverpenetration\nchecking\ntechnique was originally developed for\njoints on the Space Shuttle main\ncombustion chamber . It should also\nbe applicable to other critical electronbeam welds, such as those in gas\nturbines and pressure vessels.\nThis work was done by D . I.\nMacfarlane and F. D.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA novel dip-braz ing process joins\naluminum castings to aluminum sheet\nmade from a different aluminum alloy .\nThe process includes careful cleaning,\nsurface preparation , and temperature\ncontrol .\nThe new process causes minimum\ndistortion of the parts and is therefore\nsuperior to tack-welding in some\ncases . The method not only joins\ndissimilar alloys but also can join\nparts formed by different metallurgical\ntechniques . For example , it has been\nused to bond a wrought part to a\ncasting - a combination that complicates the already difficult task of\nbrazing dissimilar metals .\nThe process was developed for\nfabricating a base for the inertial\nmeasurement unit on the Space\nShuttle Orbiter. The base must be\nlightweight , stiff , and dimensionally\nstable . It is deSigned as a boxlike\ninvestment casting , measuring about\n55 by 30 by 25 cm, and is made from\n71 A aluminum alloy . Because the\ncasting is large and the material is\n\ndifficult to cast , the bottom is formed\nseparately from a plate of 6061\naluminum alloy sheet ; the plate is\nattached after casting .\nBefore the dip-brazing , the bottom\nedges of the casting are machined to\nform a plane seating surface for the\nplate . Both the plate and casting are\nheated to drive off oils. They are then\ndipped in a caustic solution to remove\nother foreign materials .\nAluminum brazing-alloy foil is\nplaced on toe inverted bottom edge of\nthe casting, and the plate is seated on\nit. Then the plate is tack-welded to\nhold it in place during brazing , and the\nassembly is cleaned again .\nAs a last preparation for brazing,\nthe assembly is heated in an oven\nfrom room temperature to 1,000 0 F\n(540 0 C) , at a rate not exceeding\n450 0 F (250 0 C) per hour. Finally , the\nassembly is immersed for 2 minutes\nin the brazing bath at 1,125 0 F\n(60r C) . This temperature is only\nabout 25 0 F (14 0 C) below the melting\npoint of the casting ; therefore it must\n\nbe carefully controlled .\nThe assembly is allowed to cool\nslightly so that the brazing salt\nresidue can be flushed away . Then it\nis slowly cooled ara rate of no more\nthan 180 0 F (100 0 C) per hour. The\ncooled brazed jOint is inspected radiographically .\nHeat-treatment and age-hardening\ncomplete the process . The heat treatment consists of heating the assembly to 775 0 F (415 0 C) at a controlled\nrate , holding it at that temperature for\n5 hours , then cooling it according to\nthe following schedule :\n1. 775 0 to 650 0 F (415 0 to 343 0 C) in\n2 h, minimum;\n2. 650 0 to 450 0 F (343 0 to 232 0 C) in\n1/2 h, maximum ; and\n3. 450 0 to 250 0 F (232 0 to 111 0 C) in\nstill air .\nFor age-hardening , the assembly is\nheld at 350 0 F (180 0 C) for 8 hours .\nThis work was done by H.

However , other fittings, such as pressurereducing valves , condensate traps ,\nstrainers, and the like, are often left\nunin~ulated to allow easy access for\nmaintenance and adjustments . This\ncreates a safety hazard for people\nworking near the hot exposed surfaces. The bare fittings also allow\nheat to escape , putting some extra\nload on the heating system and on any\nnearby air-conditioners or other cooling equipment.\nA practical approach to insulating\ncomponents in a steamplant is shown\nin the figure .

Moreover, ion implantation simplifies the IC fabrication\nprocedure and produces circuits with\nmore uniform characteristics .\nProcesses have been developed for\nall-ion-bombardment fabrication of an\nIC containing transistors, capacitors,\na Zener diode, and a ring oscillator .\nThe five ion-implantation steps used\nare :\n- Phosphorus implantation in the silicon substrate;\n- Soron implantation in the substrate;\n- High-dosage boron implantation in\nthe polycrystalline silicon gate;\n- High-dosage phosphorus implantation in selected sources and drains\n(those for n-channel devices) ; and\n- High-dosage boron implantation in\nthe remaining sources and drains\n(those for p-type devices) .\nThe equipment used for these steps\nincludes a low-beam-current ion implanter for the first two (low-dosage)\n\nsteps and a high-beam-current machine for the last three steps . The\nrange and spread of boron and\nphosphorus distributions in silicon\nwere studied at various beam energies\nranging from 10 to 1,000 keY , and\nexperiments with a range of implantation doses and ion-activation treatments were carried out for each of the\nimplantation steps .\nTwo basic processes for doping\nepitaxial substrate films were devised:\nSingle-ion implant (1 2 or 112) and\ndouble-ion implant (21 2) .

With the new\nprocedure , vapor-deposited or ionplated layers of aluminum or other\nmetals on plastic or other substrates\ncan be adhesive-bonded to other\n\nmaterials. The procedure may also be\napplicable to electroplated surfaces .\nOrdinarily, bulk aluminum surfaces\nare etched or anodized in an acid\nsolution to remove the oxide layer and\ncontamination that inevitably result\nfrom exposure to the atmosphere .\nSuch pretreatment exposes a fresh\nsurface that will bond securely to an\n\nadhesive . However, this approach is\ntoo rough for very thin aluminum films\nsince it can remove the film itself\nalong with the contamination .\nIn the new procedure , the film is\ndegreased with a standard solvent\n(such as benzene) that does not attack\naluminum .

In this method, the sizes of\nthe structural members are iterated,\nwith the step size depending on the\n\nratio of the total stress to the allowable\nstress . Traditionally the FSD procedure has been used to minimize the\nweight of the final design .\n(continued on next page)\n\n625\n\nFully stressed design is usually\nsatisfactory when the mechanical\nthermal\nstresses\ndominate\nthe\nstresses . However, when the thermal\nand mechanical stresses are comparable, a thermal fully-stressed design\n(TFSD) computation may be advantageous in TFSD, the therma\'l and mechanical stresses are determined\nseparately, and the thermal stress is\nsubtracted from the allowable stress\nat each iterative step to form an\neffective allowable stress . The mechanical stress is driven toward the\neffective allowable value.\nA new algorithm extends the TFSD\napproach to biaxial stress members\n(membranes). A previous algorithm\nwas applicable only to uniaxial stress\nelements (rods). The TFSD algorithm\nconverges in fewer iterations than\ndoes the FSD approach for problems\nwhere the thermal stresses are comparable to the mechanical stresses.\nThe resizing algorithms for uniaxial\nand biaxial stress members, using\nTFDS (and for comparison , FSD) are\ngiven in the accompanying table. The\nbiaxial stress model is based on Von\nMises \' failure criterion for isotropic\nbiaxial stress members.\nIn the uniaxial case, the rod cross\nsection (A) is determined ; for the\n\nFSD\n\nTFSD\n\noM!\nRODS\n\n-\'1+1 -\n\nMEMBRANES\n\'i+1 -\n\n[\n\n,\n2(0~_\'\'11)\n\nO\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2 M\xc2\xb7 On\n\n,\n\nbl\n\xc2\xb1\n\n4\n\nA\n\n(O~-\'1i ) 2\n\naMI + \xc2\xb0TI A\nI\n\n,.1 - - - a.\n\n-\'I\n\n,J\n\nvMi\n+--\n\n.~-\'1,\n\nI\n\nI\n\nV\n\n\'i+l-~ I.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nI\na\n\nResizing Algorithms for uniaxial (rod) and biaxial (membrane) stress members,\nusing thermal fully stressed design (TFSO) and fully stressed desi gn (FSO).

The FSD algorithm,\nhowever, required 18 iterations as\ncompared to only a single iteration for\nTFSD.

In tests on\na 21 ,OOO-km 2 area in Kansas, the Landsat estimate was within 2.8 percent of\nproduction reported by the Kansas\nCrop and Livestock Reporting Service.\nThe Landsat calculation is based on\na " green-measure" criterion in which\neach picture element (pixel) in a Landsat image of the Earth below it is assigned a value according to the\namount of green in its spectral signature . The method is not limited only to\nestimates of crop area, as were previous satellite measures. It also indi-\n\n626\n\ncates the yield of winter wheat by multiplying the area of each pixel by the\nyield for that pixel (determined from the\ngreen measure) and summing the\nproducts over the whole image.\nIn making the yield calculations, pixels containing water (e.g., lakes and\nrivers) are regarded as unavailable for\ncrop production and are not included in\nthe calculations . Areas containing\nclouds or cloud shadows, however, are\nassumed to have the same yield as the\naverage yield of the crop-bearing pixels and are included in the estimate .\nThe correlation between green\nmeasure and yield is established from\n\nmeasurements on known wheatfields\nwith known yields. Pixels are identified\nas "wheat " or "nonwheat" according\nto whether the green measure exceeds\na preset threshold. The correlation for\na particular area could be made even\nmore reliable by using data previously\ngathered over that area in the threshold level determination.\nThis work was done by J. E.

The Galois field is one\npromising approach to multivalued\nlogic design . This branch of logic\ntheory, a natural extension of the\nBoolean field , could be easily mapped\nonto digital hardware and implemented by LSI fabrication methods .\nA new approach to Galois field\nrepresentation systematically generates the coefficients of any mUltivariable Galois function directly from\nits truth table description . It thus forms\na basis for synthesizing multivalued\nlogic elements . The method is an\nextension to multivariable functions of\nthe series expansion representation of\nsingle-variable Galois functions that\nhas been used in the past. It should be\nuseful for both binary and multivalued\nlogic designs and in such areas as\n\ndata processing , coding , and switching networks .\nThe polynomial expansion for a\nmultivariable Galois switching function . F(X1 , x2 , . . . , xm), is given by\nF(X1 . x2 , ... . xm)\n\n=\n\npn-1\n\nL\n\nf(k1, ... , km)X1 k1 ... xmkm\n\nk1 .... , km\n\n=a\n\nwhere pn is the number of elements in\nthe Galois field and p is any prime\nnumber . In the new approach, the\nfunctions f are expanded over the field\nin terms of generalized Boolean differences such as F(O , . . . , 0)\nF(Y1 , .. . , 0) and F(O, . .. , 0) F(O, Y2, ... , 0). The exact expansion, which involves rather lengthy\nexpressions , can be obtained by\nrequesting the Technical Support\nPackage referenced at the end of this\narticle . The expansion can be pro-\n\ngramed on a computer or calculated\nby hand to determine the representation of the switching function .\nWhen the method is applied to the\nsynthesis of switch ing functions , using\nmultioutput elements called " pius\ngates " and " times gates. " economical representations of the functions\nare obtained . In testing the method on\na specific six-input two-output binary\nfunction, only 5 "plus gates" and 8\n" times gates" were needed , as\ncompared to 22 AND gates and 2 OR\ngates using a standard Boolean\nrepresentation . An efficient representation was also obtained for a fourinput two-output truth table in which\nthe variables can take on any of three\nsignal levels represented by the\nintegers 0, 1, and 2.\nThis work was done by Boonsieng\nBenjauthrit of Caltech and Irving S.\nReed of the University of Southern\nCalifornia for NASA\'s Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory.

The program\nis designed so that any two of the\nfollowing variables may be plotted as\nan ordinate:abscissa pair : the state\nvariables of pressure , density, and\ntemperature ; the derived variables of\nenthalpy, entropy , specific heats,\nsonic velocity, and isentropic expansion coefficient ; or the transport variables of thermal conductivity, viscosity , and surface tension . As many as\nfive parametric variables, including\ntemperature , pressure, denSity , enthalpy , and entropy, may be used .\nGASPLOT can be applied to (1) analysis of thermophysical data and trends\nof thermophysical-property parameters ; (2) production of high-quality\nthermophysical-properties charts ; (3)\nredrawing of charts to more useful\nscales; and (4) production of charts\nwith SI units . A special feature of the\nprogram is the capability to enlarge or\nreduce any segment of a plot to\nproduce the desi red resolution .\nGASPLOT currently uses the routine\nGASP [ " Computer Program for Calculating Thermodynamic and Transport\nProperties of Fluids " - see NASA\nTech Brief B75-10188 (LEW-12520)]\nthat calculates thermophysical properties for 10 fluids : hel ium , methane ,\nneon , nitrogen , carbon monoxide ,\noxygen , argon , carbon dioxide ,\nfluorine , and parahydrogen .

A\nsmall region near the critical point is\nexcluded from the plot. No points are\ncalculated in the liquid to vapor\ntransition region ; instead points are\ncalculated only on the saturation\nboundary. Thermophysical properties\nin the liquid to vapor transition region\nare assumed to make a smooth\ntransition . A double three-point\nLagrangian interpolation is used by all\nthe subroutines in this program . Lines\nin the liquid and vapor regions do not\nuse the geometric progression . In\nthese regions the number of points is\nincreased by dividing the lines into\nsegments and using the geometric\nprogression on each segment.

Th is\nallows the time of estimators , estimate\nmanagers , office personnel, and engineers involved in the estimating and\ncost-analysis process to be devoted to\nthe publication of ground rules and the\ncollection , analysis , and adjustment of\ninputs and rationals . The current\nprincipal use of the PACE II system is\nthe initial priCing and updating of\nGovernment estimates in support of\nSource Evaluation Board (SEB) proceedings . The system can also be\nused in tradeoff studies , change\nestimates, and budgetary studies.\nThe basic features of the PACE II\nsystem include : a uniform method of\ndepicting and numbering a Work\nBreakdown Structure (WBS) ; a uniform labor rate structure ; a uniform\nformat for data input and output ; and\nuniform methods for applying overhead , general and administrative\ncosts , fees , and escalation . Use of the\nPACE II computer system is based on\nthe development of man-hours and\nmaterials , travel , and other direct\ncosts for the lowest level of each WBS\nbe ing estimated . The application of\nPACE II is appropriate primarily where\nsufficient definition exists to define\ndesign and confguration parameters of\nhardware , man-loading , and timephasing of engineering and support\nfunctions .\nIn a design-to-cost situation , a\ngrounds-up estimate must be made\nfi rst to develop a baseline .

With MBASIC, like BASIC and\nFORTRAN, one combines English and\nsimple algebra to give instructions to\nthe computer; however, MBASIC usually results in shorter and simpler programs that are easier to write and\nunderstand.\nPractically all system commands\nneeded for management-information\nprocessing are available in MBASIC.\nThus MBASIC users need not learn\nnew executive commands or rewrite\nMBASIC programs to accommodate\nsystem changes. MBASIC should serve\nas a powerful computing language for\ntechnical or management-information\nprocessing and for scientific and engineering applications.\nThe conversational nature of MBASIC allows the user to interact with the\nprogram as it is being developed. Each\nMBASIC statement is analyzed for\nerrors as it is entered . Diagnostic\nerror messages and versatile editing\nfeatures enable one to make corrections quickly and easily. Any portion of\na program may be executed before it\nis completely assembled . This feature\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1978\n\nis one of the fundamental characteristics of MBASIC and is the principal\nreason that it has truly conversational\ncapabilities . Although individual statements may be syntactically correct,\nimproper cross-references between\nstatements , variables, or expressions\ncan interrupt a program during\nexecution .\nIf an interruption occurs , a diagnostic message is printed , and control is\nreturned to the user. If necessary, one\nmay enter direct statements and execute them immediately . After program\ncorrections have been made, execution can be resumed at any appropriate statement, including the statement\nin which the interruption occurred .\nThe power of MBASIC lies in its capacity to direct a computer to perform\na large variety of complex tasks while\nrequiring the user to supply a minimum\nnumber of simple English or algebraic\ninstructions. The program instructions\nare written as sentences, resulting in a\nprogram that is easy to read and write .\nThese instructions are combined into\nprogram modules that are written as\nparagraphs. Comments may be included to document module functions.\nThe outstanding features that contribute to the power of MBASIC include:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Multiple assignments in a single instruction ;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Conditional, assignment, and repetitive statement modifiers;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Multiple modified statements in a single instruction;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Excellent string-handling capabilities ;\nand\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Excellent array-handling capabilities,\nincluding: assigning values while dimensioning, matrix algebra written\nlike simple algebra, simple and array\nexpressions in a single instruction,\nexpressions to refer to statement\nnumbers, and reading and writing\ntapes on terminal devices during\nprogram execution.\nThe availability of these and other features leads naturally to a simplification\nof the program design process.\nThis processor is written in Assembler for interactive execution and has\nbeen implemented on the UNIVAC\n1108/1110 under control of EXEC 8\nwith a central memory requirement of\n\napproximately 28K of 36-bit words.

The prog ram remaps classification images, cleans ur;J the salt-andpepper appearance by forcing each\nobject mapped in the image to have a\nminimum size specified by the user,\nand maps a special kind of mixed feature on the image. It can be used with\nexisting image-processing software,\nsuch as LARSYS, CAMSP, and VICAR.\nThe remapped images closely resemble the familiar resource information\nmaps and can replace or supplement\nthe classification images not postprocessed by GETMEXICLEAN .\nThe program operates on binary\nclassification maps, that is, maps having picture-element (pixel) values of\n"a .. or " 1." Connected sets in the map\nare searched and identified. The sizes\nof these connected sets are determined and checked against a prespecified threshold, which is controlled by\nthe user. Connected sets smaller than\nthreshold pixels are eliminated by\nchanging their labels to the other type ;\nthat is, small sets of "1\'s" will be modified to "a" labels and "a\'s" to "1\'s."\nBy such relabeling , a final image is produced in which every mapped object\nmeets a minimum-threshold pixel-size\n(continued on next page)\n\n629\n\ntj\n\nrequirement.
