The first section describes tilt and levell\xc2\xad\ning measurements on Anegada, the most northerly of the British Virgin\n\nIslands; the second section contains a discussion of sea-level measure\xc2\xad\nments that were initiated in the region and which played a significant\n\nrole in the development of a network of sea-level monitors now tele\xc2\xad\nmetered via satellite from the Alaskan Shumagin Islands. The third part\n\nof the report is a brief description of surface deformation measurements\n\nin Iceland using equipment and techniques developed by the subject grant.\n\nThe final part of the report describes the predicted effects of block surface\n\nfragmentation in tectonic areas on the measurement of tilt and strain.\n\n\nScientific Achievements 1975-1979\n\n\nIn 1975 we applied to NASA for funds to monitor surface deformation\n\nin the Virgin Islands seismic gap in order to understand themode of energy\n\nrelease at this unusual plate boundary. The N.E. corner of the Caribbean\n\nis a seismic gap in that a major earthquake has not occurred in historic\n\ntime although areas to the west and south have experienced major events.\n\nIt is not well understood tectonically because the sense of plate motion\n\nchanges between the Leeward Islands and the Virgin Islands from underthrust\xc2\xad\ning to an oblique-slip motion along the Puerto Rico trench. The geodetic\n\nmeasurements we have made agree with the known geological history of the\n\nregion in that cumulative tilt is.not occurring (< 10-6 radians/year). We\n\nhave had no success in identifying transient strain fields that might arise\n\nfrom aseismic slip at the plate boundary, though these may have occurred\n\nduring instrument down-time, or at levels below the ambient noise. We\n\nconclude that the N.E. Caribbean plate boundary is not undergoing cyclic\n\nvertical deformation of the type characterized by the Japanese Pacific\n\ncoast. This is based more upon the lack of uplifted marine terraces than\n\nupon geodetic data since a three-year study is a relatively short time to\n\nidentify secular signals that may extend over centuries. If crustal defor\xc2\xad\nmation is occurring we consider it more likely to be transient, elastic\n\nand of relatively small amplitude.\n\nDuring the investigations we examined various modes of crustal deforma\xc2\xad\ntion based on Japanese data and formed a number of conclusions concerning\n\nsuitable methods for monitoring tilts and strains on small islands. Our\n\nconclusions are summarized in the scientific publications listed below.\n\nDuring the Caribbean investigations we developed a simple instrument\n\nfor monitoring sea level and a small recording package for monitoring slowly\n\nvarying analog data that can operate remotely for more than a year. Versions\n\nof these devices have proven ideal for measuring crustal deformation in other\n\nareas chosen for special study by Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory.\n\n\n(2)\n\n\nPresently we are operating strainmeters near Palmdale, California, water\xc2\xad\nlevel monitors-on Lake Taho, Nevada, sea-level monitors in Alaska, and\n\nfissure extensometers in Iceland using equipment passed on from the Carib\xc2\xad\nbean experiment.\n\nFinally, the grant has enabled us to initiate satellite telemetry from\n\ntiltmeters in the Virgin Islands and sea-level monitors in the Shumagin\n\nIslands in the Alaska Peninsula. The Alaska sea-level study enables us to\n\nmonitor, with a one-month delay, defbrmation precursory to a major earth\xc2\xad\nquake.\n\n\nPublications\n\n1. \t\nBilham, R., 1977, A sea-level recorder for tectonic studies, Geophys.

Data from these instruments are\n\ntelemetered via satellite and searched for internal consistency. A precise\xc2\xad\nmeasure of secular tilt is obtained from a permanent first-order geodetic\n\nlevelling line that is measured annually. We conclude that long baseline\n\ntiltmeters on small tropical islands will give at least one order of magni\xc2\xad\ntude better stability than shallow borehole tiltmeters. This finding has\n\ngiven impetus to our development of a-practical long baseline tiltmeter\n\nfunded by N.S.F. (Plumb et a., 1979).\n\n\n1\n\nTilt Measurements on a Small Tropical Island\n\n\nROGER BILEAM AND JOHN BEAVAN\n\nLanont-Doherty Geological Observatory of Columbia University,\nPaZisades, New York 10964\n\n\nABSTRACT\n\n\nTilt measurements have been made on the Caribbean Island of Anegada\n\n\n(18-441N, 64?25\'W) using precision levelling, sea-level measurements and\n\nan array of borehole tiltmeters. The tiltmeter measurements after two\n\nyears of undisturbed operation indicate a tilt rate of approximately a\n\nmicroradian per month, whereas the precision levelling indicates that\n\nthe island is stable to within a microradian per year (1976-1978).\n\nVariations in sea level appear to affect the tiltmeters coherently, al\xc2\xad\nthough tidal tilts vary significantly over 400 m distances.\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\nThere has been much discussion concerning the fidelity of short\xc2\xad\nbaseline tiltmeters installed near the Earth\'s surface because there are\n\nno published results that can be considered totally beyond suspicion. That\n\nis, redundancy and duplication of tiltmeters is rare and coherence of tilt\n\nsignals is frequently poor even over distances of kilometers. Long-term\n\nmeasurements of tilt do not agree with absolute measurements using indepen\xc2\xad\ndent methods such as levelling. Tiltmeters respond to rainfall, changes\n\nin subsurface hydrology and surface temperature and it is usually diff-i\xc2\xad\ncult to exclude some or all of these noise sources as a possible source\n\nof observed signals.\n\nMoreover, the generation of tilts can occur through .the interaction\n\nof local elastic inhomogeneity and applied strainfields. Hence, tilt ampli\xc2\xad\ntudeso-and phases can be distorted even if instruments- are of adequately\n\ngood fidelity. These secondary problems cannot be studied systematically\n\nwithout first demonstrating tiltfield coherence.\n\n\n(5)\n\n\nL\n\nIt was decided, therefore, that six of the Kinemetrics borehole in\xc2\xad\nstruments would be installed sufficiently close to each other to examine\n\nthe wavelengths of surface tilt and that additional, different tiltmeters\n\nand measurements would be introduced to provide an independent evaluation\n\nof the real tilt of the area.\n\n\nLOCATION OF THE EXPERIENT\n\n\nThe experiment was set up on Anegada in the British Virgin Islands\n\n(Figure 1). The Virgin Islands have not experienced a major earthquake\n\nin the last 500 years of recorded history but there is reason to believe\n\nthat a major earthquake may be overdue because regions to the west and\n\nsouth have experienced earthquakes with magnitudes greater than 7. An\n\nalternative explanation of the gap in significant seismic energy release\n\nmay be that strain energy is released in the form of creep or as ttslow"\n\nor "silent" earthquakes with a large component of long-period energy\n\n(minutes to days) and relatively little high frequency energy. The in\xc2\xad\nstallation of strainmeters or tiltmeters was considered to be a possible\n\nmeans to provide an insight into the two alternative tectonic mechanisms\n\nor others that might be involved. Anegada was chosen to site the array\n\nsince it is essentially horizontal, low-lying, and surrounded by a shal\xc2\xad\nlow shelf., Approximately four microearthquakes a day are detected by the\n\nLamont-Doherty Caribbean Seismic Network and there is about one magnitude\n\n4 earthquake a month. The residents on Anegada feel one or two earth-,\n\nquakes a year, which appear to be centered about 20 km to the NW of the\n\nisland.\n\n\nGEOGRAPHY OF ANEGADA REGION\n\n\nAnegada Island measures approximately 16 km east-west by 3 km north\xc2\xad\nsouth. The central and eastern parts of the island are surfaced by partly\n\nrecrystallized coral reef, calcarenites and calcareous sand which nowhere\n\nattain a height of more than 9 m above mean sea level. The western part\n\nof the island is a layer of sand which thickens westward to a maximum of\n\n10 m depth and which rarely exceeds 2 m above sea level except in the\n\nform of wind-blown dunes. The western area has a series of salt ponds\n\nthat drain poorly to the sea. The eastern part of the island consists\n\nof interleaved horizontal layers of calcarenite and coral with a vertical\n\nspacing of about 1 m between layers. Borehole information does not exist\n\nbelow 20 m.\n\n\n(b)\n\nThe island is fringed by coral reefs. To the north the shelf drops\n\nsteeply toward the Puerto Rico trench and to the east to the Anegada\n\ntrough. To the south and west the sea floor is uniformly shallow (about\n\n10 m) across to. the islands of St. Thomas and Tortolla. Three or four\n\nsubmerged terraces with a vertical spacing of 3-4 m have been identified\n\nto the south of Anegadaand Howard [1970] argues that this signifies\n\nstages of geological uplift.\n\nIn 1797 Anegada was marked by Captain Waring [1797] on a map as the\n\n"drowned island" being "almost entirely covered at spring tide". This\n"drowning" may have referred to the western half of the island which is\nnow at least 50 cm above the highest tide. If we assume that no other\nprocess is operating, the difference between Captain Waring\'s map and\nthe present implies an emergence of approximately 1 to 3 mm/year. A\nmore probable mechanism is that the present surface is the product of\nsedimentation. The rapid erosion and rebuilding of the westerly tip\nof Anegada occurs presently during storm conditions although it is clear\xc2\xad\nly restricted by the reef. According to admiralty charts made in 1890\nand more recently, shallowing of the sea floor to the south by about 1 m\n-has occurred. This is interpreted as sediment influx and although it is\n\nclear that sediment transport from east to west occurs, it\'is -uncertain\n\nwhere such quantities of sand come- from.\n\nStudiesbySchomburgk [1832h] and by developers more recently show\nlarge quantities of fresh water underlying the island. The general por\xc2\xad\nosity of the island was revealed by two experiments we performed in 1976.\nA-series of wells up to 90 m from the beach at the west end-encountered\nbrackish water -right up to the beach with a periodic modulation of height\ncaused by the 30 cm sea tide. The amplitude of the periodic effect fell\noff rapidly to about 30% of the tidal amplitude in the first 10 m and\nthen less than 5% for the next 100 m. A well 1.5 km from the coast shows\na 5 cm tide.\n\nTILTMETERS.\n\n\nIn 1976 we installed six Kinemetrics tiltmeters in boreholes in a\n\n2 km array along the island. Our intention was to examine the nature of\n\nisland tilt noise and the suitability of using borehole tiltmeters in is\xc2\xad\nland-arc -deformation studies. Operating problems in the first two years\n\nof installation encouraged us to reduce the array dimensions to a more\n\nmodest array of- three instruments (numbered 2, 3, and 4 on Figure 4).\n\nThe details of our initial installation are to be found in the Final Re\xc2\xad\nport to ItSGS contract 14-08-0001-G371. An important feature of the tilt\xc2\xad\nmeter installation is that the tiltmeters were encased in sand-filled\n\n\n4\n\n7.5 cm diameter, 3 m long aluminum tubes before being lowered into 15 cm\n\ndiameter, 3 m auger holes in the coral. The tiltmeter electronics are\n\naugmented by a servo-system for maintaining the tiltmeters close to zero\n\noutput, by a local recording system, and by a centrally located satellite\n\ntransmitter (DCP). Each installation is covered by a 1 m high mound of\n\nwhite sand canopied by an elevated sheet roof to minimize the direct ef\xc2\xad\nfects of sun and rain. The installation method successfully reduces\n\nthermal contamination of the tilt data to an acceptable level (see Fig\xc2\xad\nure 2).\n\nThe local chart recorder at each tiltmeter is multiplexed to monitor\n\nthe x and y tilt channels and the output from a thermistor thermometer\n\npositioned within the electronics unit. The chart is advanced at a rate\n\nof approximately 5 cm per day. The tilt data are dominated at high fre\xc2\xad\nquencies (3-6s) by microseismic tilt that has its origin in surf action\n\non the surrounding reefs. The microseismic noise varies in amplitude from\n\n. to .3 microradians according to surf conditions. The telemetered data\n\nare smoothed with a 20s filter to attenuate tha microseismic energy, sam\xc2\xad\npled every six hours on six channels and transmitted twice daily.\n\nDuring the first two years of operation the signals from the six tilt\xc2\xad\nmeters were greater than-0 - 5 radians per month in random directions. By\n\n1978 the drift rate had reduced to approximately 10-6 radians in a month.\n\nThe observed decay in the drift rate is presumably due to settling of the\n\ninstrument and may be an elastic adjustment of the borehole tiltmeter casing\n\nin response to installation stresses fStouder and Morrissey, 1978].\n\nWe present two figures illsutrating recent data. In Figure 2, syn\xc2\xad\nchronous data from tiltmeters 2 and 3 are shown. The x and y channels of\ntiltmeter 2 show a clear semidiurnal tide with a peak-to-peak amplitude\nof 1-2 microradians. The y channel of tiltmeter 3 shows a diurnal thermal\nsignal with an amplitude of 4 microradians and the x channel suggests a\nsemidiurnal tide with an amplitude of less than 0.5 microradians. The mi\xc2\xad\ncroseismic tilt amplitude is approximately the same amplitude on 2x, 2y,\nand 3y but is about half that on channel 2x. Three teleseismic earthquakes\nconfirm that the calibration of 2y and 3y are within 20% of each other in\nthat surface wave magnitudes recorded by each are similar. We view the\ntiltmeter 2 data with suspicion since the tidal amplitudes are larger than\nwe might expect from tidal loading and may be the result of direct influ\xc2\xad\nence of semidiurnal variations of hydraulic pressure [Van der K m , 1973].\nTiltmeter 2 is the deepest operating tiltmeter and is less than 1 m above\nmean sea level. Curiously, 1976 data from this instrument showed a dominant\ndiurnal thermal variation although its absence in recent data may be the\nresult of an improved surface cover. On the other 5 tiltmeters the maximum\nsemidiurnal tide peak-to-peak amplitude has not exceeded 0.5 icroradians.\nThe thermal signal apparent on the tilt data varies in amplitude from 1 to 5\nmicroradians. ~th of this signal is the direct effect of temperature on\n\nthe electronics unit.\n\n\n(8)\n\n\n5\n\nIn Figure 3 we plot data obtained via satellite between March and July\n\n1978 together with rainfall and sea-level data. Tiltmeter 2 behaves er\xc2\xad\nratically and eventually fails whenits negative power line is- severed by\n\na goat. Tiltmeters 3 and 4 show an interesting ,correspondence with sea\n\nlevel. Inflections in tilt and sea level occur at similar times. The\n\nsea-level data follow each other for the period plotted but the tiltmeter\n\ndata have different,trends on all channels.\n\n\nPRECISION SURVEYING\n\n\nA 2.5 km levelling line was laid out in 1 76 consisting of 38 bench\xc2\xad\nmarks in an approximately E-W line along the tiltmeter array. In 1977\n\nthe line was extended to the north. Brass levelling pins were cemented\n\ninto the coral surface at intervals of 40-100 m, although.the majority\n\nwere spaced at 70 m intervals,. -Cairns were constructed to locate the\n\nmid-points of every measurement pair to within 50 cm. We used matched\n\ninvar rods and a Zeiss Ni2 level with optical micrometer for the measure\xc2\xad\nments. A reading precision of 0.1 mm can be obtained with this equip\xc2\xad\nment.\n\nThe levelling line has been measured five times in two years (Fig\xc2\xad\n-ure 4). We adopted standard first-order levelling procedures for the\n\nmeasurements with one addition; where the outgoing and return levelling\n\nmeasurements for an adjacent pair of bench-marks differed by more than\n\n0.3 mm they were repeated the following day. Normally such errors were\n\nattributable to a dust particle on one or another of the bench-marks dur\xc2\xad\ning a previous measurement. The closure errors for the five outward and\n\nreturn levelling runs vary between 0.3 mm and 1.4 mm, that is,- within\n\nthe 1.6-mm error defined as "first order levelling" [e.g., Bcmford\n\n1971]. In most cases the errors were less than the \xc2\xb1 .6 mm we estimated\n\nas the cumulative reading-error for the line.\n\nThe island tilt tide-may be a significant source of systematic error\n\n- 6\n\nsince it has a measured daily peak-to-peak amplitude of up to 2 x 10\n\nradians. Surveying was usually done over a period of six hours in the\n\nmorning and two in the early evening. The whole line was usually sur\xc2\xad\nveyed over a period of two days. Consider two extreme possibilities.\n\nIn a period of six hours the tilt tide could tilt the surface from\n\n+ 1 urad to - 1 rad or it could tilt from zero, \xc2\xb1 1 prad to zero. In\nthe first instance, a cumulative tilt of 2 irad would be measured; in -the\n\nsecond instance, no tilt would be measured. Note that none of our measure\xc2\xad\nments result in more than a 1 grad tilt for the whole line but that there\n\nire slopes within the line that may be the result \'f tidal changes of\n\ntilt during the measurements. We plan to try to correct the levelling\n\ndata for the island tilt tide using the borehole tiltmeter measurements.\n\n\n(9)\n\n\n6,\n\nSEA-LEVEL bMASURh\n\nTS\n\n\nA number of measurements of mean sea level are being made on the\n\nisland and other nearby islands [Figure 1 and BiZh=,m 1977]. On Anegada\n\nwe are currently operating three sea-level monitors: at the west end,\n\non the NE coast, and in a water well near the center of the island. The\n\nlatter instrument shows a 5 cm tide and longer period oscillations that\n\nclosely follow sea-level variations monitored by the other gauges. The\n\ntwo coastal sea-level monitors are installed on the beach and monitor\n\nthe water table rather than sea level. This experimental arrangement\n\nwas adopted in order to avoid a direct connection to the sea that we have\n\nfound vulnerable to vandalism and erosion. The arrangement: appears to\n\nbe effective on Anegada since all three gauges track each other (Fig\xc2\xad\nure 3). Long-period changes of sea level are detected by the -tiltmeters\n\nand can account for some of the inflections in tilt rate observed by the\n\narray. Rainfall does not have any obvious effect on either the-sea level\n\nor tiltmeter data.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\n\n\nThe tidal tilt of Anegada observed by borehole tiltmeters appears to\n\nvary over a relatively short distance (400 m) by a factor of four. The\n\nmaximum measured value for daily tilt (2 irad) is sufficiently large to\n\ndisturb precise geodetic levelling surveys of the island, although the\n\ndata we present do not appear to be seriously disturbed. This may be\n\ndue to fortuitous timing of the outward and return surveys used to derive\n\na mean value for the line or it may be due to a systematic error in the\n\ntiltmeter measurements. We intend to process the levelling data more\n\ncarefully to remove the known tilt tide.\n\nAn error analysis on the numerical values obtained for each adjacent\n\npair of levelling pins provides a surprisingly low cumulative error\nestimate; \xc2\xb1 0.6 mm in 2.5 km. This is approximately three times smaller\nthan the maximum permissible error required in normal precision levelling\nalthough it has been attained by other investigators [e.g., Schellens,\n1965]. An earthquake (Xs = 5) occurred on 15 Oct. 1976, 20 km to the NW\nof Anegada. The tiltmeter array was inoperative at the time but the\n7\nlevelling line showed no change (\xc2\xb1 2 x 10-\n ) when it was resurveyed nine\n\ndays later. Over a period of two years there appears to be a suggestion\n\nof a tilt up to the NE amounting to 0.5 microradians. Since this value\n\nis barely above the estimated measurement precision and we are not yet\n\ncertain of the influence of tilt tides on the island, we do not place\n\nmuch confidence on its significance.\n\n\n(10)\n\n\n7\n\n6\nThe long-term tilt rate (. 10-\n rad/month) seen by the tiltmeters\n\neven after two years from installation is approximately an order of mag\xc2\xad\nnitude larger than that established by precision levelling. Some in\xc2\xad\nflections in the tilt rate can be accounted for by sea-level variations\n\naround and under the island. The levelling data indicate that it may\n\nbe possible to install a long baseline tiltmeter on the surface between\n\ntwo selected levelling pins to obtain a stability of at least 10-6 rad\xc2\xad\nians per year. This would represent a significant improvement in the\n\ncontinuous monitoring of surface tilt on the island.\n\n\nWe have observed nothing suggestive of a "slow" earthquake on the\ndata though this may have occurred during the numerous occasions when\nthe tiltmeters were inoperative. The seismograph network operated by\nthis observatory has revealed a complex pattern of earthquakes with\nmagnitudes from -1 to 5 in the Anegada region [Murhy-et a., 1978].\nOur measurements do not clarify the mechanism of plate collision in this\ncorner of the Caribbean. A longer span of data may help and so would\ncontinuous tilt measurements of improved fidelity.\n\nAcknowZedqents.

In the past tide gauges have provided valuable information con\xc2\xad\ncerning the vertical ground deformation associated with major earthquakes.\nAlthough tide-gauge data contain numerous sources of noise; a spacing of\nless than 40 km between gauges f indicated for a useful stbdy of dilatant\nbehaviour, and a spacing of less than 80 km may be adequate for the study\nof crustal downwarping in island arcs.\nAn inexpensive tide gauge is described which is designed to provide a con\xc2\xad\ntinuous record of sea level with a measurement precision of 1 m. Hydraulic\nfiltering is incorporated into the instrument in order to attenuate daily tides\nrelative to longer period variations of sea level. The instrument is designed to\noperate from flashlight batteries for a year unattended and to withstand\ntemporary submersion as might be caused by tsunamis. Several of these sea\xc2\xad\nlevel recorders have been installed in seismic gaps in the Aleutians and in the\nCaribbean.\nIntroduction\nFurther progress in earthquake mechanism studies depends in part on acquiring more\ndetailed information on the spatial and temporal distribution of surface deformation in the\nepicentral region. A traditional source of such data has been tide-gauge-records from coastal\nseismic regions. Careful analysis of existing records shows repeated instances of downwarp\xc2\xad\n"ing and upwelling related to major earthquakes (Omori 1913; Yamaguti \'1960; Fitch &\nScholz 1971; Scholz 1974; Wyss 1975, 1976). A discouraging feature of many such studies\nhas been the ambiguity present in sea-level data as a result of being unable to distinguish\nbetween environmental noise and vertical crustal motions. Environmental noise in tide-gauge\ndata is caused by variations in wind- and.sea-current direction, atmospheric pressure andsea\ntemperature and by changes in salinity and global sea level. Using differencing techniques\n(Tsumura 1971) the effects of some of these variables can be reduced. It is also possible to\napply an approximate correction for sea-level variation caused by changes in atmosphdric\npressure where this has been measured. Using annual means Wyss (1976) concludes that\ndifferences in mean sea level between adjacent gauges (100 km apart) can be established\nto an accuracy of 1 cm/Using an array of three gauges over 30km near Pozzuoli, Italy,\n\n308\n\nR. Bilham\n\nPalumbo (private communication) claims a similar precision for monthly means. Although\ndifferencing techniques will not be successful in areas where very local variations in sea\nlevel may occur, e.g. salinity variations in estuary locations or temperature effects in shallow\xc2\xad\nshelf seas, in general \'the\'denser the array of tide gauges the greater is\'the noise-suppression\ncapability. In an island arc environment where an archipelago exists it is possible that\natmospheric and oceanic variables may contribute less significantly to sea-level variation\nthan they would on an extended linear coastline. Under such conditions an accuracy better\nthan a centimetre may be achieved.\nAlthough present tide-gauge stations are well distributed globally they are frequently\ntoo far apart to be of use as recorders of tectonic deformation. Dilatancy diffusion models\nof earthquake mechanism require surface upwelling in the epicentral region of the order\nof tens of centimetres (Scholz, Sykes & Aggarwal 1973). For a large earthquake the lateral\nextent of this deformation may exceed 100 km requiring a tide-gauge spacing of the order\nof 30 kIn to ensure adequate coverage. In Japan, an average 100-km spacing of,tide gauges\ngave adequate coverage of the Nankaido 1946 earthquake in which the lateral extent of\ncrustal deformation was approximately 1000 kIn (Fitch & Scholz 1971). By comparison\nthe present distribution of tide gauges in the Aleutian arc is approximately every 1000 kIn\nand in the Caribbean every 150 kIn.\nSince tide-gauge data have been crucialin previous studies of major earthquakes we believe\nthat it is important to install additional instruments in particular areas of seismic risk. Con\xc2\xad\nsequently we have designed an instrument which is readily adaptable to existing coastlines, is\nsufficiently inexpensive to install in large numbers and which requires minimal annual\nmaintenance.\nWe expect that some of the shortcomings of existing tide-gauge data may be reduced by\nusing the new sea-level recorders which due to their cheapness and relative ease of instal\xc2\xad\nlation can be installed in numbers that were previously not feasible. For example, changes\nof sea currents are one of the principal sources of relative variations of sea level\' between\nnearby coastal sites. By installing a number of sea-level recorders on opposing coasts of small\nislands an average sea level for that island can be obtained .which is less dependent on\nseasonal sea current and prevailing wind direction. Optional hydraulic fitering ini the\ninstrument enables the suppression of the daily tides relative to longer period sea-level\nchanges if required. The instrument can be operated either as a self-recording device or as a\nremotely recorded device with the addition of a 40-db dynamic range telemetry link.\n\nThe instrument\nThe sea-level recorder consists of three parts; a vertical standpipe, a long flexible entry tube\nwith an inlet in deep water to provide hydraulic connection with the sea and a pressure-tight\nmeasurement package (Fig. I). The entry tube attenuates rapid fluctuations of sea level and\nenables the installation of the standpipe in a protected inland environment. A capillary\ntube can also be inserted in the entry path to attenuate the amplitudes, of the daily tides\nrelative to longer period variations. This allows greater measurement precision using analogue\nchart recorders or FM or digital telemetry of limited dynamic range.\nThe mathematics of the hydraulically filtered-tide gauge have been described in Groves\n(1965) and Filloux & Groves (1960). The time constant of the syphon is given by\n2\nr=Svla/r 4gs\n\nwhere v is the kinematic viscosity of sea water (0.01 cds),g the acceleration due to gravity,\nI is the length of the entry tube, a the inside radius of the standpipe and r the inside radius of\n\n(22)\n309\n\nA sea-level recorderfor tectonic studies\n\ntB\n\nSEA LEVEL \n\n\nT\n\nCAPILLARY\nYPASSVALVES\n\nORIGINAL PAGE IS\nPOOR QUALITY\n\n"OF\n\n\'ENTRY TUBE\n-\n\nBURIED 30CM\n\n.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2" -\n\n,MEAN\n\nSPA LEVEL\n\n7_7-\n\n-- -- -7\n\nTETRAHEDRON INLET\n\n,ANCHOR IN\n\nDEEP WATER\n\n\nFigure 1.

Thus using a 150-m long 6-mm diameter entry tube and an 11-cm diameter\nstandpipe a time constant of approximately lhr can be obtained, and by inserting a 1-m long\n0.3-mn radius pyrex capillary tube in the hydraulic path the time constant can be increased\nto about 80 hr. In the Aleutians, where the tidal sea-level variation is approximately 4 m, we\nchose an 80-hr time constant capillary which led to an attenuation factor of appioximately\n0.05 for diurnal tides. The resulting diurnal tide was arranged to record as approximately\ntwo chart widths using a 10-cm circumference measurement pulley. A 1-hr filter was found\nto be adequate in the Virgin Islands in the Caribbean where the tide is approximately 30 cm.\n\nThe reference float is connected to a counterbalance weight via a wire which passes\naround a pulley monitored by a potentiometric angular position transducer. Motions of the\n\nfloat appear as a variable voltage which feeds the galvanometer of a chart recorder. The total\ncurrent consumption of the measurement system varies from 2 to 12 pA depending on the\n\nreference float position. Two AAA type alkalide cells are sufficient to operate the sensing\nsystem-for 18 months (Fig. 2).\nThe recorder used is a conventional dotting type which uses 6-cm wide waxed pressure\xc2\xad\nsensitive paper. The recorder motor is operated at 2.8 V for 2 s every 60 s in order to con\xc2\xad\nserve power and prolong motor life. The power is supplied from a single Lithium D-Cell,\nwith a rated capacity of 10 AH. The switching system adopted in the prototype involves\na commercial clock movement with a 60 s sweep hand onto which is fitted a pill shaped mag\xc2\xad\nnet (6 mm diameter, 3 nun thick, with north-south faces). Each minute this sweeps past a\nreed relay whose fixed position is adjusted to give the required 2-s contact closure. The clock\nis operated from a separate battery (1.5 V Alkaline D). The batteries chosen are sufficient to\noperate the recorder and clock for 18 months. The switching system could employ a solid\xc2\xad\n\nstate clock with-a marginal improvement in power consumption.\nChart speed is adjusted with interchangeable gear boxes. The normal operating time is\nchosen\'to be 13 months which gives a chart speed of approximately 5 cm/day.\nThe electronic calibration depends on the state of the batteries since\'it is difficult to\nregulate the low voltage (\xc2\xb11.5 V) in the measurement system without wasting power.

For example the sea tides are never removed .totally nor are\nthey exactly centred on the chart. Thus as the potentiometer rotates from mximrnm to\nminimum or vice versa a record of amplifier calibration is produced (Fig. 6).\n\nMechanical construction and\'installation\nThe base of the standpipe is embedded inland 50 cm below mean sea \'level in a block of\nconcrete. Bolted to the top of the pipe-is the recording/measuring package. The-recorder,\nelectronics and\' batteries are all enclosed in a hermetically sealed PVC tube (Fig. 3). The\ndesign.is such that during flood conditions, such as could be causedby ahligh-tide storm or\na tsunami, water will be prevented from flooding the electronic compartment even in the\n\nevent of failure of the O-Ring seal due to the -back,pressure formed by its bell-shaped\ngeometry. The entire system can thus be flooded to a depth of several metres without\ndamage. This was considered to be a necessary design feature in view of the occasional\ndestruction of Pacific coast- tide, gauges by tsunamis. The standpipe is \'installed slightly\ninlandfrom the coast-and is more than 80 per cent buried which further prevents mechanical\ndamage. The measurement system is designed\' to be replaced annually by a spare-unit. This\nenables rapid inspection in the field and allows careful overhaul of the apparatus in a more\nfavourable environment.\nThe 150-250-m long entry tube consists of transparent PVC tubing with a 6.3-mm\ninternal diameter and a 12.5-mm external diameter. It is tough and resilient. Air bubbles\nare easily visible in the tube if it is in air or under water. The entry orifice to the system\nconsists, of a 5-cm copper tube approximately 30 cm, long, held approximately 1m above\nthe sea, floor by a heavy tetrahedral-shaped anchor. The copper tube discourages-barnacle\ngrowth and produces a\' poisonous environment in the entry tube which prevents bacterio\xc2\xad\nlogicalifouling. It points downward so that sediment accumulation cannot occur.\n\n(24)\nA sea-level recorderfor tectonicstudies\n\n311\n\nDESICCANT\n\n_RECORDER\nCLOCK t BATTERIES\nO-RING SEAL\nTRANSDUCER\n\n\n50 CM\n\n-NYLON-COATFD\n\nSTAINLESS WIRE\nWEIGHT\n\n_\n\nL-TUBE To SEA\nF- CAPILLARY\nTUBE\nSTANDPIPE\n\n\n2-5 M\n\no".\n\no.oo\n\na:\n\noo.\n......\nao\n\n=\n\nCONCRETE\n\na..oo\n\noo\xc2\xa2o\'\nooo\n"a " aoo\n....... \n **\n\nFigure 3. Sea-level recording package, The recorder operates once per minute for a year at approximaately\n5 cm/day. The sensitivity is determined by the circumaference of transducer pulley, normally 10 cm.\n\nThe long-terma stability of the sea-level recorder is dependent on the standpipe position,\nthe buoyancy-of the glass float and frictional effects in the pulley potentiometer. The latter\nis very low in friction compared to the forces exerted by the float and stainless steel wire\n(which is wrapped 1.5-times around the pulley). The 10-era diameter glass float may become\nheavier if surface bacterial growth occurs and annual inspection will be required to identify\nsuch effects. Biological activity within the standpipe is inhibited due to the absnce of sun\xc2\xad\nlight. Groves (1965) reports trouble free operation of a remote syphon gauge for many years\nusing a similar systema.\nThe standpipe position is geodetically tied to a nearby solid rock outcrop using a geodetic\n\nprecision level. Long-term settling of the standpipe is monitored to a precision of 0.2 ram.\nThe base of the standpipe has to be buried to a depth greater than the lowest expected\nsea level and the pipe has to be long enough to emerge above the high-water mark. In the\nShumagin Islands, Alaska, the tidal range can exceed 41n so that a 3-3-in standpipe was\nadopted to ensure its base was below mean sea level. The excavation was carried out by hand\nat\nto a depth of 3 mn low tide. The resulting hole measured 1.5 x 1no in area and took two\nmen 4 hr to dig in gravel, sand and soil. Two hundred-pound bags of concrete were mixed\nwith water repellent liquid (Cantihydro\') and local sand to provide a firm 40-cm deep founda\xc2\xad\n\ntion for the base of the standpipe. The remainder of the hole was filled immediately with the\n\nexcavated mateial before the turn of the tide.\n\n(25)\n312 R. Bflha The entry tube is buried to a depth-of 50 cm under the beach. Ideally this occasion is the\nlowest low-tide, of the month as -it was in the case of-the Aleutian installations. The tube is\nmore dense thansea water and njaturally sinks, when offshore. The greatest difficulty arises\nin burying the tube as it passes under water from the beach. A croquet hoop arrangement\nwas found, to be effective in constraining the tube under water on sandy beaches. The Carib\xc2\xad\nbean installations required less excavation due to the much smaller tidal range (30 cm).\nA 1.&8m standpipe was adopted which could be buried below the low watermark in half a\nday. Manual excavation in the absence of a large tide is not-easy since a major part of the\nexcavation must be carried out under water.\nInitially an electric impeller pump was used to fill the system from the -seaward end.\nThis introduced cavitation and further installations utilized a hand pump to prevent the\nproduction of bubbles. The final.adjustment of the syphon was accomplished by operating\nthe valves around the capillary tube. All bubbles were removed by vibration and bleeding\nthe system a:few days after installation. Exsolution of air bubbles in the first 24 hr-appeared\na common feature of the-installations.\nThe tide, gauge described fulfils, the need for-an inexpensive versatile device capable of\nproviding mean sea-level data over periods of years. Instruments have been installed in the\nShurnagin Islands in the Aleutian Arc and-in the Virgin Islands in the Caribbean and-further\ninstallations are-scheduled in these areas to provide-an instrument spacing of between 20 km\nand 60 kin (Figs 4 and 5). The two areas are of-scientific interest as-they are predicted to be\nthe sites of future major earthquakes based on seismic gap theory (Kelleher, Sykes & Oliver\n1973). Telemetered seismic monitoring networks are operated\' by seismologists from\nLamont-Doherty in each area.\nA short span of tidal data from the- Caribbean is-presented in Fig. 6. A feature of the\nrecord is- the automatic scale ranging- provided \'by- the,\' angular measurement transducer\nallowing-millimetre resolution of sea level over the eniire tidal range.

The precise location\n\nand time of such an event cannot be predicted without additional infor\xc2\xad\nmation describing physical conditions in the source region.\n\nA major\n\n\nsource of data indicating a relationship between seismicity and crustal\n\ndeformation has- traditionally been the measurement of sea level.\n\nCo-\'\n\nseismic deformation is dramatically illustrated in many parts of the\nworld by raised beaches and submerged cities and forests.\n\nThere are\xc2\xad\n\nalso examples of preseisic and post-seismic movements (Omor\n\n[4],\n\nIma\xc2\xad\n\nmura. [51, Yamaguti [6], Fitch and Scholz [7], Mescherikov [8-],. Wyss\n[9,101, Scholz and Kato [l],\n\nBrown et al. [12]).\n\nThere are two shortcomings to sea-level data when used to study\n\ncrustal deformation; the distribution of tide gauges is frequently poor\n\nand insufficiently dense to provide spatial details of the deformation\n\nprocess, and sea-level has numerous sources of noise-that render it far\n\nfrom being the stable geopotential surface that one would like for pre\xc2\xad\ncise measurements.\n\n\nLocation of sea-level measurements\n\nThe present distribution of tide gauges is determined by the ocean\xc2\xad\nographer rather than the seismologist.\n\nThus gauges are placed in loca\xc2\xad\n\ntions selected to give useful tidal data over a wide region.\n\nFrequently\n\n\ninstruments are spaced several hundred km apart or farther if no suitable\n\nharbor-exists. In seismotectonic studies the minimum desirable density\n\nof sea-level monitors is related both to the size 6f the earthquake and\n\nits mechanism.\n\nIn the present -study we are concerned with events- greater\n\n\n(30)\n\n\nthan M = 7 (Kanamori [13]) and with rupture lengths greater than 50 km.\nw\nWe assume that surface deformation will be detectable out to several\nfault lengths and estimate that an instrument spacing of between 10 and\n30 km may provide satisfactory details of the deformation process.\n\nThus,\n\nin comparison to oceanographic requirements, a denser distribution of\n\ninstruments is called for and ideally one that is uniformly spaced on\nthe two-dimensional surface overlaying the epicenter.\n\nThis is rarely\n\n\npossible and even with many more tide gauges most coastlines will re\xc2\xad\npresent only a fraction of the surface of interest.\n\nImprovements to\n\n\nabsolute pressure .transducers may enable measurements of sea level in\n\ndeep-water regions if monitoring and maintenance difficulties can be\n\novercome, but it seems that, at present, conventional gauges offer a\n\npractical method in suitably selected areas. of interest-.\n\nArchipelagos, island arcs and regions with incised or irregular\n\ncoastlines appear most promising. as areas for immediate study., One\n\nsuch region is the Shumagin Islinds in the Aleutian arc (Fig. 1).\n\nIn\n\n\nthis region a chain of islands stretches more than 100 km toward the\n\ntrench from the mainland.\n\nThe most southerly land mass is approximately\n\n\n120 km from the deepest point of the trench and seismic studies have\n\n.shown the Benioff zone to be less than 30 km deep at this southerly\npoint, deepening rapidly northward (Davies and House [14]). The region\n\nis identified as a seismic gap and is sited.between the 1957 Andreanof-\n\nFox Island earthquake and the 1964 Alaska earthquake, both with magni\xc2\xad\nAn earthquake in 1938 may have broken into part\ntudes greater than 8.\n\'of the Shumagin region.\n\n\nNoise\n\nIn tectonic studies any departure of the sea-level surface from\n\nthe geoid is considered noise.\n\nThus tides are as much noise as\n\n\nare the effects of storm surges, salinity variations, sea-current\n\nshifts, atmospheric pressure changes and many more variables that can\n\ndisturb the sea surface.\n\nRelatively few of these noise sources can be\n\n\nremoved numerically by measuring the appropriate variable (e.g., atmos\xc2\xad\npheric pressure) and-empirical methods designed to compensate for noise\n\n\n(31)\n\n\nISO\n\n-\n\n,_../\n\n0\n\ni\n\n"40\n\n/ Ljy\n\n6\n\nUNGA\n\nTj\n\nC)\n\nP0PF\n\n-SEA-LEVEL GAUGE\n\n816SIMEONOF\n\nLs\n\nOLVL-PROPOSEDSEA-LEVEL GAUGE\nG-PROPOSED, LEVEL LINE\nT-OGRY lILT FIGURE\nW- WEATHER STATION\n\n1610\n\n1600\n\nFigure 1. Location of tide gauges and mean sea-level monitors in the\n\nGulf of Alaska and the Shumagin Islands. The region to the west of\n\n1630 W experienced a major earthquake in 1957 and the region between\n\n1550 w and 145 0 W broke in 1964. A major earthquake may have ,partly\n\nreleased strain energy in the eastirn Shumagin Islands in 1938 (McCann\n\net aG [3]).\n\n(32)\n\n\ncan only be partially successful since most of the processes are non\xc2\xad\nstationary.\n\nFortunately, in a limited area sea-level noise is reason\xc2\xad\n\nably uniform.\n\nFor example, Ingraham et al. [15] present analyses of\n\n\ndata from the Gulf of Alaska\n\nindicating good coherence in sea-level\n\n\nover a wide region (Fig. 2).\n\nThe annual variation of sea level has a\n\n\nrange of 20 \xc2\xb1 5 cm,with a minimum in May at six gauges spaced on average\n\n300 km apart.\n\nSince we are interested in differences in sea level, i.e.,\n\n\nvariations in a region less than 200 km in extent; we hope to reduce much\n\nof the coherent noise present.\n\nWe hope to reduce some sources of in\xc2\xad\n\ncoherent noise also by installing more than one instrument on an island.\n\nWhere possible the sea-level monitors face the sea in opposing direc\xc2\xad\ntions such that a mean value partially eliminates noise introduced by\n\nchanges in current direction.\n\nA-future possibility is that space borne\n\n\nlaser altimetry will provide an independent definition of the mean sea\xc2\xad\nsurface.\n\nThe present accuracy of satellite altimetry is-insufficient\n\n\nto be useful (\xc2\xb1 10 cm) since present sea-level analysis methods appear\n\nto attain 1 cm accuracy even when widely-spaced tide gauges are used\n\n(Wyss [9]).\n\nPrecursory vertical deformation amounting to tens of cm\n\n\nhas been reported for some earthquakes (Scholz and Kato [11], Wyss [10])\n\nalthough there are many examples where any deformation that has occurred\n\nis below the noise level of affected tide-gauges.\n\nFor example, whereas\n\n\npost-seismic deformation is evidently associated with the 1957 Fox\n\nIsland and 1964 Alaska earthquakes (Fig. 2) there is no obvious pre\xc2\xad\ncursory sea-level change.\n\nThus the precision desired of a sea-!evel\n\n\nmonitor appears to be of the order of 1 mm.\n\nIt remains to be seen\n\n\nwhether noise sources even in a limited region can be suppressed to\n\nthis level.\n\n\nMEAN SEA-LEVEL MONITOR\n\n\nThe sea-level monitor is described by.Bilham [16].\n\nThe device can\n\n\nbe installed on remote coastlines and does not require a jetty or harbor.\n\n\'The system operates from batteries or solar-power and requires a minimum\n\n\n.03)\n\n\n50\n\n40 \n\n\nUnalaska\n\n\n30 \n\n\nKodiak\n\n\nU\n\nSeward\n\n\n> 20\n\nYakutat\n\nU,\n\nali0\nSitka\n\n=0 \n\n\nKetchikan\n\n\n1950\n\n196n \n\n\n1970\n\n\n1.--\n\n\nSitka\n\nU\n\n7\n\nUnalaska\n\nU\n\n0\n\n0\n\n:1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\ncycles/month\n\n\nFigure 2.\nAnnual mean sea-level data (1950-1974) from six National\n\nOcean Survey Gauges in the Gulf of Alaska.

The Unalaska data\n\nafter 1957 and the Kodiak data after 1964 show post-seismic land emer\xc2\xad\ngence following great earthquakes (Ms > 8).

Co\xc2\xad\nherence clearly falls off with distance though even at 2000 km coherence\n\n\nis shown at annual, semi-annual and ter-annual periods.\n\n\n(34)\n\nof maintenance.\n\nIt differs from a conventional tide-gauge in that the\n\n\ntides are filtered prior to recording and that it has a resolution of\n\n1 mm in sea-level change.\n\nWe discuss various problems we have encountered\n\n\nin the operation of the gauge and corresponding improvements to the in\xc2\xad\nstrument.\n\nThe instrument consists of a vertical tube of about 15 cm diameter\n\nburied inland and connected to the sea via a long thin entry tube and a\nhydraulic filter (Fig. 3).\n\nSea-level variations are monitored in the\n\nvertical tube using a float and pulley arrangement.\n\nThe hydraulic time\n\nconstant of the gauge is chosen to be large enough to suppress the ampli\xc2\xad\ntude of diurnal and semi-diurnal tides to less than 10 cm.\n\nFiltering\n\nwas originally achieved using a length of capillary tubing such that the\n4\ntime constant was given by T = 8nZa 2 r- g\xc2\xad 1 seconds where Z is the length\n\nof capillary tube of radius r cm connected to a standpipe of radius a cm,\n2\nn is the kinematic viscosity of sea water (sea water = .01 cm s\xc2\xad t ) and g\n\n\nthe acceleration due to gravity.\n\nTime constants of the order of 80 hours\n\n\nwere found convenient to reduce -diurnal tidal amplitudes tb approximately\n\n5 cm without attenuating monthly sea-level changes by more than 20%.\n\nAn.\n\n\nalternative method of filtering was to use a porous filter of large area.\n\nThe 5 cm diameter micropore disc is- not clogged by particles of grit in\n\nthe sea entry tube, which was a problem with the capillary.\n\nThe micro\xc2\xad\n\npore filter, typically with a pore size of 0.2 to 0.5 jim, is also sturdier\n\nthan the capillary but suffers from the disadvantages that it slowly be\xc2\xad\ncomes clogged with finely suspended particles so that its time constant\n\nincreases with time.\n\nFig. 4 shows the percentage amplitude -reduction at\n\n\nvarious periods of sea-level change.\n\nA fundamental problem with the entry tube is that air exsolves from\n\nthe highly aerated coastal waters and migrates as bubbles to the highest\n\npoint of the syphon, eventually blocking -the tube.\n\nRepeated visits were\n\n\nfound necessary to evacuate this air and a bubble-trap was devised to\n\nextend the useful life of the syphon.\n\nThis consisted of\n\ntainer in the hydraulic line positioned above the topmost\nsyphon (Fig. 3).\n\nThe tube remains full of water in this\n\nuntil the bubble trap empties.\n\nVisits at four-month inte\n\nthe bubble trap \'appear to be necessary to maintain syphor\nexsolution of bubbles is not a problem if\n\nthe entry tube\n\ncon\xc2\xad\n)f the\nnent\nrefill\nion.\n\nThe\n\narranged\n\nto incline gently downwards from the base of the standpij\n\ns may be\n\npossible with the assistance of earth moving machinery bt\n\nmote\n\n(35)\n\n\nFigure 3.

The higher the\n\nporosity the slower the\'decay in tidal variation inland (Fig. 5).\n\nDur\xc2\xad\n\ning many of our installations we encountered the water table on the\n\nbeach at approximately mean sea level.oily metres from the surf.\n\nThe\n\n\nstability of the water table in some sites is indicated by a marked\n\nchange in the soil chemistry, from an oxidizing to a reducing environ\xc2\xad\nment, a change that occurs over a few cm near the water table (e.g.,\n\nPirate Cove, Popof Island).\n\nIn.other sites of higher porosity, e.g.,\n\n\non a gravel spit at Eagle Harbor, Nagai Island the tide was so well\xc2\xad\ncoupled that the underground water-table dropped well below mean sea\xc2\xad\nlevel on the outgoing tide.\n\nThe mean piezometric water-level inland in a porous aquifer is\n\nhigher than sea level primarily due to rainfall- raising the piezomatric\xc2\xad\nsurface.\n\nThe elevation,is\n\ncaused byta "steady-state" fresh water lens\n\nin.equilibrium with the surrounding higher density sea.water and secondly\nby a transient additional-amount of water resulting from recent rain.\nBoth\'effects can be reduced by choosing a small landmass to: undertake\nmeasurements (Fig. 6).\n\nAlternatively spits of land, narrow headlands,\n\nand sand-bars have the necessary properties unless they-are. impounding\nfresh water (e.g., storm beaches).or near river estuaries.\n\nThe maximum\n\nelevation of the piezometric surface by fresh water is approximately\n0.03 of the depression of the saline boundary.\n\nIf we assume that the\n\n\nfresh water lens is unstable in the presence of sea currents if its\n\ndepth is more\'than one third its width, then the fresh water elevation\n\nerror can be estimated to be approximately 3 cm at the center of a 30 m\n\nwide spit.\n\nIf measurements are conducted near the edge of the spit and\n\n\nan allowance is made for partial contamination of the fresh water, the\n\nstatic error reduces to les\'s than 1 cm.\n\nThe stability of the lens of\n\n\nfresh water over periods of several weeks and longer is of fundamental\n\nimportance if the measurements are to reflect sea-level variations, and\n\nsince this -will be unknown at most locations it appears advisable to\n\nlocate piezometric gauges close to the beach where variations are less\n\nsignificant.\n\n\n(38)\n\n\n40.\n\nI\n\n14\n\n4,\n40\n\n20\n\na\n\nS,\n\nO\n\n0\n\n~a\n\n\nSEa\n\xc2\xad\n\nZCRSOLS\n\n0a$11NS\n\nFigure 5.

Although the Land-\xc2\xad\nsat is iii polar orbit and therefore can "see" the Shumagins almost every\nhour,, on some passes the sea-level monitors are obscured by mountainous\nterrain near-the site.\n\nThe lost data are not important and could be.\n\nreduced either by raising-the .antenna position or-by selecting \'sites\nwith lower horizons.\n\nAlternatively the DCP\'s can be programmed to trans\xc2\xad\n\nmit to the geostationary GOES satellite in locations with a southerly\nhorizon.\nThe DCP operates on solar power and can send eight, eight-bit words\n\nper transmission in addition to station identi\'fication information.\n\nTypically the Landsat satellite relays two or three transmissions during\n\nits traverse from horizon to horizon, hence it is possible to double\n\nthe informatio\' transmitted from each site.\n\nRoutinely we transmit the\n\n\nbattery voltage level in addition to sea level and/or piezometric level\n\nfrom each site.\n\nThe benefits of satellite transmission are twofold:\n\n\nwe are able to receive data from a remote network of islands with a\n\nminimal delay and we are able to monitor instrument malfunction.\n\nThe\n\n\nsecond of these has proved to be invaluable in planning field maintenance\n\ntrips.\n\nThe Shumagin Islands are difficult to visit due to the excep\xc2\xad\n\ntionally bad weather common in this part of Alaska.

In Fig. 8 we show data obtained\n\nin 1977 from these two islands.\n\nThe two gauges on Popof Island track\n\n\neach other reasonably well but the gauge on Simeonof diverges and ap\xc2\xad\nparently indicates a tilt to the south of several microradians.\n\nThis\n\nis consistent with levelling measurements made on two level lines near\nPopof Island and is typical of the downwarping shown at underthrust plate\nmargins prior to seismic slip (Scholz and Kato [11]).\n\nIn Fig. 7 we\n\npresent data collected since the satellite relay was initiated.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nThe measurement of hydraulically-filtered sea-level variations is\n\npotentially capable of monitoring vertical tectonic motions in island\n\narcs.\n\nWhile we have insufficient data presently to determine the accur\xc2\xad\n\nacy of our measurements, it is probable that monthly mean values will\n\nbe accurate to within 5 mm.\n\nThis corresponds to better than 10- 7 radians\n\n\ntilt precision across the Shumagin Islands.\n\nLong-term comparisons be\xc2\xad\n\nIi)\n\n~SDP\n<\n\nS MH..\n\nto43\n\n20 cm\n\na\n\nSDP\n\n]\n/j\n\nPRC\n\nsop\nSMW\n\nC)\n\nI\n\nSEP\n\nI\n\nOCT\n\n1976\n\nI\n\nNOV\n\nI\n\nDEC\n\nj\n\nI\n\nJAN\n\nI\n\nFEB\n\nI\n\nMAR\n\nI\n\nAPR\n\nI\n\nMAY\n\nI\n\nJ\n\n1977\n\nFigure 8\n\n4,\n1\'\n\n(43)\n\ntween shoreline piezometric measurements and sea level are being con\xc2\xad\nducted to determine if simpler instruments may be possible for future,\n\nwork.\n\nThe use of satellites to relay data for immediate analysis and\n\n\nto check instrument-performance makes the operation of a remote network\n\nmore reliable than-was hitherto possible,\n\nDuring the next decade a\n\n\nmajor earthquake may occur in or near the Shumagin Islands.\n\nThe abilit3\n\n\nta monitor surface deformation continuously and remotely through the\n\npreseismic and post-seismic stages is an exciting advance in tectonic\n\nstudies.\n\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe work has been funded by the.National Oceatiographic and Atmos\xc2\xad\npheric Administration (NOAA 70), the Department of Energy (ERDA EY-76\xc2\xad\nS-02-3134), and.the National Aeronautical and Space Administration\n\n(NSG 5072);\n\nThe satellite DCP\'s are on loan to us from the Geophysics\n\n\nApplications Branch of NASA and we gratefully acknowledge-the assistance\n\nof Dick Allenby, Gil Meade and Will Webster who \'ave helped organise\nthe satellite,telemetry.\n\nWe thank John Davies and Chris Scholz for\n\ntheir comments-on the manuscript.\n\nEFERENCES\n[i] \t Kelleher,, J.

The instruments consist of\' long invar wires held in\n\ntension by springs. The wire is.passed once round the rotational transducer\n\nand gives a displacement sensitivity of 0.1 mm..\n\nWe have monitored several inflation/subsidence episodes of the Krafla\n\nvolcano, although only one of the rifting episodes has migrated south toward\n\nour extensometer network. The AGU abstract below summarizes some of the\n\nconclusions derived from\'the investigation. The following pages summarize\n\na few of the important problems we hope to solve from continued operation of\n\nthe instruments.\n\nGROWTH OF LARGE SCALE GROUND FISSURES DURING RIFTING OF THEPLATE BOUNDARY\n\nIN NORTHERN ICELAND\nEgill Hauksson (Lamont-Doherty Geol.

Obs., Columbia\n\nUniv., Palisades, NY 10964)\n\nManual measurements and continuous recordings of displacements across fis\xc2\xad\nsures during rifting of the plate boundary in N. Iceland reveal continuous\n\ngrowth of fissures in the Krafia caldera, episodic growth of fissures in the\n\nassociated N/S trending rift zone, and a contemporaneous closure of fissures\n\nadjacent to the rift zone.\n\nThe Krafla caldera contains several fissures that open during periods of up\xc2\xad\nlift lasting 4-6 months and that close incompletely in subsidence episodes\n\nlasting several hours to a few days. In the four cycles we have observed since\n\n1977, we find that maximum rates of opening occur halfway through the uplift\n\nperiod at approximately 1 mm/day. Closing at rates of approximately 10 mm/day\n\nstarts 3 to 7 hours after volcanic tremors signal the onset of subsidence.\n\nDuring the September 1977 subsidence, fissure growth migrated southward in\n\nthree distinct phases: first a slow one-hour aseismic opening phase propagat\xc2\xad\ning with a speed of 0.8 m/s from the caldera 12 km along the rift; secondly,\n\na five-hour opening phase propagating south at 0.5 m/s associated with seismi\xc2\xad\ncity and magma migration; and thirdly\'an aseismic recovery phase in which the\n\nfissures closed about 25% of the maximum opening at an exponentially decreas\xc2\xad\ning rate with a time constant of approximately 1 day.\n\n\n(46)\n\nStress Measurements and Rifting in Iceland\n\n\nIceland\'s unique position on the mid-Atlantic ridge commonly evokes\n\nan assumption that the lithosphere beneath Iceland is in a state of ten\xc2\xad\nsion normal to the ridge. For example, a recent spreading episode in\n\nnorthern Iceland can be readily explained in terms of an axial rift system\n\nthat splits episodically during times of high magmatic pressures and in\n\nso doing relieves the cumulative tensional strain that has developed from\n\nridge spreading since the previous eruptive phase (Bjornsson et al., 1978).\n\nHowever, there are two fundamental problems to such an interpretation.\n\nFirstly, measurements of absolute stress in several parts of Iceland indi\xc2\xad\ncate that the crust is in compression (Hast, 1973; aimson, 1978, 1979).\n\n,Moreover the maximum compression axis is normal to the axial rift zones;\n\nif this compressive stress is general and not purely an artifact of the\n\nsurface, but extends throughout the crust, an elastic rebound mechanism\n\nalone cannot explain the recent rifting episode. Secondly, broad-anti\xc2\xad\nclinal folding indicates that compression normal to the ridge axis is a\n\nwidespread geological phenomenon (Einarsson, 1968).\n\nThere are a number of possible explanations for the existence of com\xc2\xad\npressive stresses in Iceland surface materials. Haimson (1978) discusses\n\npossible mechanisms;and proffers a glacial rebound model with accretion and\n\nmagma injection occurring during loading. A differential cooling model can\n\nalso produce surface compression; in this, the surface layers cool first\n\nand result in surface tensions. As subsurface layers cool, tensional char\xc2\xad\nacteristics are "healed" and the surface layers are eventually compressed.\n\nIn such a model one might predict compressive stresses to be a function of\n\ndistance from the axial rift zone and-also a function of depth. Other\n\nhypotheses are that surface compressional stress can arise from broad\n\nsynclinal flexures away from the ridge or gravitational loading on an inclined\n\nlithosphere.\n\nA suggested mechanism to account for simultaneous rifting and horizontal\n\ncompression is that magma injection forcibly thrusts the plate boundary apart.\n\nA simple model is presented by Koide and Bhattacharji (1976). In this model\n\nan oblate ellipsoidal magma chamber exerts lateral compression on adjacent\n\ncrust but puts the shallow crust above the chamber in tension. This model\n\nalso results in a reduction of stress with proximity to the axial rift zone.\n\nA weakness of these models is the poor constraints imposed by available\n\ndata. Stress measurements are few and show values of between 70 and 100 bars\n\nat distances of between 60 km and 300 km from rift zones. An important source\n\nof information is the recent rifting episode that is occurring in N. Iceland.\n\nBjornsson et al. describe the current rifting episode as a series of cyclic\n\nprocesses involving:\n\n1) Slow inflation (3-6 months) of the Krafla caldera by magma migration\n\ninto a spherical reservoir at a depth of 3 km (Tryggrasson, 1978),\n\n2) Rapid subsidence of the caldera sometimes but not always accompanied\n\nby an eruption.\n\n\n(47)\n\n\n3) Onset of low stress seismicity and migration of magma south or\n\nnorth into fissures.\n\n4) Sequential and permanent opening of axial fissures and simultaneous\n\nclosure of fissures outside the rifting region during dyke injection.\n\n5) Elevation of flanks of rift zone relative to central region.\n\n6) Cessation of seismic activity in a few high-stress type earthquakes\n\nand end of dyke injection.\n\nIt is generally considered that the inflation/deflation episodes of the\n\nKrafla caldera involve different processes from the dyke injection episodes\n\nthat immediately follow deflation. Thus, although it is tempting to inter\xc2\xad\npret the seismic activity signalling the onset of dyke injection as signifying\n\ngeneralized low stress, on account of low b-value measurements (Einarsson, 1978)\n\nit must be remembered that the area involved is on either side of the in\xc2\xad\nflated caldera. The inflated caldera imposes relative compression (Koide and\n\nBhattacbarji, 1975) on the surrounding materials which it presumably "hydro\xc2\xad\nfractures" when some critical stress is reached. The hydrofracture direction\n\nis normal to the direction of maximum compression, which agrees perfectly\n\nwith direct and indirect measurements of stress in Iceland. Hence it is possib\n\nthat large compressive stresses surround the caldera during inflation even thoui\n\nTow stress-drop-earthquakes accompany, lateral dyke injection.\n\n.e discuss the possibility that the cyclic magma injection process\n\ncan itself provide a source of the-observed-compressive stress. Observed\n\nmagmatic presdures appear to be quite low since eruptions do not fountain\n\nmore than 20-50 m, implying excess surface pressures of the order of 2-6\n\nbars. It is possible to argue that excess pressures at depth are likely to\n\nbe less since the density of the erupting lava is lower than that of the\n\nfrozen outgassed host rock. However, in their model, Koide and Bhattacharji\n\nassume excess magma pressures of 1000 bars at depths of 10-30 km (Roberts,\n\n1970). The effects of viscous flow as magma tunnels to the surface will\n\nresult in a significant drop in pressure that is difficult to estimate since\n\nwe know little concerning the viscosity of the magma at depth and the dimen\xc2\xad\nsions of the supply routes. It may be misleading to assume that magma pres\xc2\xad\nsures are simply related to eruptive pressures for another reason. Deflation\n\nof Krafla is invariably preceded by the onset of dyke injection. We know that\n\nthe limited magma supply rate filters rapid pressure fluctuations arising at\n\ndepth. Hence, at the onset of deflation and therefore a few hours before\n\neruption, the magmatic pressure has started to decrease due to the rapid ex\xc2\xad\ntension of the magma chamber. Our extensometdr measurements indicate that\n\nthe deflation of Krafla is approximately three orders of magnitude faster\n\nthan the inflation rate (-l Tom/hour against + 2 mm/day). The onset of dyke\n\ninjection leads to an immediate and much larger decrease in available pres\xc2\xad\nsure at the surface. In the model of Bjornsson et al. (1979) the magma in the\n\nlrafla caldera redistributes itself into dykes at depths between 3 and 5 km\n\nand from seismic evidence this occurs after deflation has commenced (Brands\xc2\xad\ndottir and Einarsson, 1978).\n\n\n(48)\n\n\nAn interesting geometric condition can arise in the caldera if com\xc2\xad\nplete subsidence of the inflated region has not occurred before surface\n\neruption or near-surface dyke injection has commenced (Figure 1). The\n\ninjected dyke will freeze in contact with the host rock and create a\n\nspace problem, preventing complete closure in the deflation phase. This\n\nwill tend to maintain the inflated geometry of the caldera but with an\n\nimportant difference. During inflation the caldera dome was supported from\n\nbelow by magma pressure,. During deflation the magma pressure has dimin\xc2\xad\nished rapidly and the dome is supported by lateral stresses in the adja\xc2\xad\ncent rock. If the doming is small the gravitationally induced lateral\n\nstress can be many orders of magnitude larger than stresses attributable\n\nto magma pressure. Indeed, the forces can be so large that if this pro\xc2\xad\ncess is widespread it is difficult to deny that it plays an important\n\nrole in the generation of horizontal compressive stresses at the ridge\n\naxis.\n\nClearly, the mechanism of dyke injection would be aided considerably\n\nby collapse of the caldera dome and lateral wedging. Unfortunately., tilt\n\nmeasurements do not indicate that significant doming occurs anywhere ex\xc2\xad\ncept near the caldera so that it is unjustifiable to assume the process\xc2\xad\ngenerally occurs along the rifting boundary. The wedging mechanism \'\n\nmay be a purely local effect restricted to the Krafla caldera. Neverthe\xc2\xad\nless it is interesting to speculate whether a similar mechanism might not\n\non a scale of several.-hundredvkilometers be responsible for ridge spreading.\n\nThe tilts generated by large-scale doming could be sufficiently small to\n\nbe undetected by levelling or tilt measurements in Iceland yet the result\n\nof a rifting episode involving a meter of dyke injection during a meter of\n\nuplift and collapse would be to generate horizontal stresses of several\n\nkilobars. The stress would appear towards the end of the spreading epi\xc2\xad\nsode when magmatic pressure diminished and rift activity became dormant.\n\nThe resulting stresses should give rise to earthquakes on transform faults\n\nand the plates within a few active-rifting dimensions from the -ridge axis,\n\nTransform earthquakes observed a year after spreading support the hypo\xc2\xad\nthesis but are insufficient to constrain the model. If sea-level measure\xc2\xad\nments along the Northern Iceland coastline in.the next few decades show\n\nevidence of widespread deflation or strain and geodetic measurements show\n\nan increase in compressive strain normal to the ridge there would be com\xc2\xad\npelling arguments favoring axial-wedging as an important aspect of sea-floor\n\nspreading. Conversely, if geodetic measurements in future years -reveal ex\xc2\xad\ntension adjacent to the present rifting zone, the mechanism that generates\n\nthe observed compressive stress is not generated by axial wedging.\n\nThe measurements we have initiated will help us.understand.the mechanism\n\n\nof dyke injection tetter (Figure 2).\' The proposed models depend critically\n\non the precise timing of deflation, seismicity,\'tilt and displacement. The\n\npresent network of instruments has enabled verification of the dyke injec\xc2\xad\ntion velocity (5 km/s) estimated from seismic migration by Brandsdottir and\n\nEinarsson (1978), and has demonstrated that strain measurements can be used\n\nto monitor the subsurface movements of magma in three dimensions. We plan\n\nto seek support elsewhere to continue and to expand the measurements to\n\ninclude strainmeters and tiltmeters.\n\n\n(49)\n\n\nII\n\n\nSPS\n\n\nFigure 1. Wedging.

We argue that such\n\nbehavior will confuse the interpretation of strain, tilt and vertical\n\ndeformation data if investigators are unaware of its existence near instru-\'\n\nmental locations. We examine the probable elastic and visco-elastic effects\n\nof surface block fragmentation and provide a number of examples of strain\n\ndata that support the existence of active blocks. A fundamental difficulty\n\nin identifying block fragmentation exists if levelling data are not avail\xc2\xad\nable. In such-circumstances (e.g., island arcs) it is vital to monitor tilt\n\nand vertical movements (sea-level measurements) to fully understand tectonic\n\ndeformation.\n\n\nSTRNS AND TILTS ON CRUSTAL BLOCKS\n\n\nR.G.

King.et al:., 1976), and\n\nsome progress has been made in discriminating between certain types of\n\nsurface noise and signals of tectonic interest (Wood and King, 1977).\n\nNew\n\n\ninstruments with longer baselines may also result in improved data (Davis,\n\net al., 1978).\n\nWe are concerned about a more fundamental problem associated with\n\nmeasuring strains and tilts near the surface.\n\nThere is considerable evidence\n\n\nthat parts of the Earth\'s crust behave as a mosaic of loosely-coupled blocks.\n\nC4\n\n\nsurface fragmentation result in,behavior that cannot be predicted in terms of li\n\near elastidt heory?\nassumptions.\n\nNon-linear behavior may result in the failure of several\n\n\nFor example, if block interaction is frequency dependent, it\n\n\nis clearly incorrect to assume that the response of a region to periodic\n\ntidal strains is the same as the response of the region to secular strains.\n\nIf the coupling of blocks is stress dependent, the transmission of strains\n\nand tilts across a -regionmay exhibit phase and magnitude anomalies not\n\npredicted by present inhomogeneity theory.\n\nIt is clearly of the utmost\n\n\n3\n\n(55)\n\n\nimportance.to clarify the influence that block structures may have on surface\n\nstrainfields and tiltfields.\n\n\nGEODETIC EVIDENCE FOR CRUSTAL BLOCKS\n\n\nAlthough geodetic survey data of high-quality have been obtained in\n\nmany parts of the world in the last century, it is only in Japan that large\n\nnumbers, of strainmeters and tiltmeters have been operated simultaneously for\n\nmany years (Harada, 1976; Hosoyama, 1976).\n\nThe results of geodetic relevel\xc2\xad\n\ning rather than trilateration or triangulation are of inter&st since the pre\xc2\xad\ncision obtained by levelling is systematically better than other techniques\n\nat any given time and also because the distribution of fixed benchmarks\n\n(approximately 2 km spacing in Japan) is far denser than triangulation or\n\ntrilateration points.\n\nIn the late 1920\'s and early 1930\'s, a series of papers describing re\xc2\xad\nlevelling lines in Japan \'werepublished by .some half-dozen authors.\n\nPivotal\n\n\nto their interpretation of these levelling data was an intense discussion of\n\nblock movements which were clearly identified in central and southern Japan\n\n(Yamasaki, 1928; Muto and Atsumi, 1929; Imamura, 1930a; Miyabe, 1933; Tsuboi,\n\n1933).\n\nThe geodetic blocks that were identified were sometimes, but not al\xc2\xad\n\nways, the structural units into ,which geologists and geomorphologists had sub\xc2\xad\ndivided the crust.\n\nThe Japanese geodetic data present compelling evidence\n\n\nthat at least some of the geological processes that gave rise tb observed for\xc2\xad\nmations are presently active.\n\n\n4\n\nin Figures 1-4 we present typical data from the papers of Imamura and Tsubo:\n\nthat illustrate evidence for block movements.\n\nNote that the data presented have\n\n\nnot been corrected for "spurious" data points nor have they been smoothed by\n\nlinear or weighted averaging processes.\n\nIn many cases the data have not been\n\n\nadjusted for the miselosure of long geodetic lines.\n\nThe intentional display of\n\n\nraw data enables the identification of discontinuities in the levelling lines\n\nif they exist.\navailable.\n\nThis is especially easy if several relevelling profiles are\n\n\nUnfortunately, spurious benchmark movements can sometimes appear\n\n\nas systematic discontinuities in the data; however, two remaining tests are\n\navailable.\n\nFirst, the location of the apparent discontinuity can be related\n\n\nto the knowngeology.\n\nIn many cases discontinuities correspond to known active\n\n\nfaults but occasionally they correspond to "dormant" geological faults (Ima-\xc2\xad\nmura, 1929 - 1935).\n\nSecondly, the discontinuity may coincide with an inflec\xc2\xad\n\ntion of the levelling profile that frequent relevelling reveals as a consistent\n\nhinge-line-about which the adjacent surfaces appear to rotate.\n\nImamura (1933a) generalized the observed behavior of a sequence of block\n\nsurfaces into two categories.\n\nSurfaces with-"N-shaped faults" in which adja\xc2\xad\n\ncent block surfaces rotate in the same sense and surfaces with "V-shaped faults"\n\nwhere adjacent block surfaces rotate in an opposing sense (Fig. 5).\n\nHe remarks\n\n\nfurther that surfaces with multiple N-shaped faults are associated with compres\xc2\xad\nsive horizontal strains and that surfaces with V-shaped faults are generally\n\nassociated with tension.\n\nWe adhere to Imamurals original visually-descriptive\n\n\nterminology in which he describes the crustal surface pattern in terms of the\n\ndiscontinuities as it has the advantage of brevity.\n\nAn important property of V\xc2\xad\n\nshaped faults is that the hinge-type motion which occurs need not necessarily\n\ninvolve vertical or horizontal offset and- therefore the fault may be dismissed\n\nas inactive during surface geological mapping.\n\nMoreover, if a-V-shaped fault\n\n\nis covered by superficial-deposits, its presence may only be detectable by\n\ngeodetic methods (Imamura, 1931).\n\nActivity suggestive of V-shaped fault be\xc2\xad\n\n5\n\n(57)\n\nhavior has been reported in California by Buchanan-Banks et al.

(1977).\n\nBlock activity is most pronounced at times of seismic energy release\n\nor volcanic activity.\n\nCoseismic block motion forms the bulk of the ob\xc2\xad\n\nserved phenomena but postseismic activity on boundaries has been documented on\nnumerous occasions (Scholz, 1972).\n\nFor example, earthquakes in 1925 (Tazima)\n\nand 1927 (Tango) activated the same block boundaries (Tsuboi, 1933) but in suc\xc2\xad\nceeding years, block motions continued (Figure 1).\n\nImamura (1929) pointed out"\n\n\'that block motions associated with the 1923 South Kanto earthquake were bounded\nby existing geological faults.\n\nIn the same region, Scholz and Kato (1977)\n\nusing a seventy year: data base with 23 repeat levellings along several levell\xc2\xad\ning lines, showed conclusively that these block boundaries were active in the\nfollowing 15 year postseismic episode and their presence could still be\' detected\nin.1963.\n\nOf great significance\' is their observation that the, faults bounding\n\nblocks between Tokyo and Atami assume different roles during the various phases\n\nof deformation.\n\nThus the Oiso hill block mimics the crustal deformation to the\n\n\nNE between 1924 and 1939 and is decoupled from the SW region by the proposed\n\nOdawara fault (Sakawa fault, Imamura,1930a), whereas between 1939 and 1963\n\ninflection.occurs at the- Isehara fault -such that the Oiso Hill block\n\nnow follows the general deformation of the region to the SW.\n\nla less\n\nIn \n\n\nconspicuous fashion the faults bounding, the Kanagara, Haneda and Omori blocks\n\nto the west of Suruga Bay are alternately active and passive between 1883\n\nand 1930 (Imamura, 1931 and Figure\n\n2).\n\nMiyahe (1933) notes several examples\n\n\nof adjoining blocks which sometimes move independently and sometimes behave as\n\nthough locked together.\n\nBLOCK DIMENSIONS\n\n\nIt is of interest to review what is known of the lateral dimensions of\n\nobserved crustal blocks.\n\nTsuboi (1933) classes minor land blocks as generally\'\n\n\n(58)\n6\n\nbeing of the order of 7-10 km wide and major blocks approximately 50 km in\n\nextent.\n\nIn the works of Tsuboi and others, smaller and larger blocks are\n\n\ndocumented.\n\nIt is significant, however, that the normal 2 km spacing of the\n\n\nJapanese levelling network provides little positive information on the exis\xc2\xad\ntence of blocks with a width of less than 6 km.\n\nThe exception to this occurs\n\n\nwhen a levelling line runs obliquely across an elongated block -leading to the\n\ndetection of block motion but to the overestimation of the block size.\n\nThe West-Momaya 4.5 km block was clearly defined by Imamura (1934) using\n\na 500 m spacing of. benchmarks near-Osaka.\n\nMiyabe (1933) argues that secon\xc2\xad\n\ndary block fragmentation down to 1 km may occur based partly on the observa\xc2\xad\n4\ntion that horizontal strains exceeding 10-\n have been measured within 10 km\n\n\nwide blocks.\n\nIn the Tien Shan region blocks with dimensions of 3-5 km have\n\n\nbeen documented (Pevnev etal., 1975) and in Iceland block dimensions of less\n\nthan 500 m have been reported by Tryggvason (1970, 1974) and Tomasson (1976).\n\nIt is curious that the inferred block structures invoked to explain anoma\xc2\xad\nlous tilts at tidalperiods (Tomaschek and Groten, 1961; Melchior, 1967; Lam\xc2\xad\nbert, 1970) and also to explain anomalous tilting in response to atmospheric\n\nloading (Tomaschek, 1953, 1959) often require blocks with dimensions exceeding\n\nseveral hundred kilometers.\n\nBlock dimensions of this size are seldom apparent\n\n\non geodetic relevelling profiles although oscillatory movements with long\n\nwavelengths frequently occur (e.g., Mizoue, 1967).\n\nUnfortunately, the tilt\n\n\ndata upon which the above-mentioned claims for block structures were based\n\ncontain systematic errors that were unsuspected by early investigators (King\n\nand Bilham, 1973a; Zschau, 1977) and must be regarded as unreliable.\n\n\n7 (59)\n\n\nCONSEQUENCES OF BLOCK STRUCTURE\n\n\nThe dangers of measuring surface strain and tilt in the presence of\n\nvertical elastic discontinuities have been known for some time (King, 1971;\n\nKing and Bilham, 1973b):\n\nThe rigorous correction of tiltmeter data for geo\xc2\xad\n\nmetric and elastic inhomogeneities has been achieved recently by Harrison\n\n(1976a) and for strainmeter data by Berger and Beaumont (1976) and Levine\n\nand Harrison (1976) for a limited number of sites in the USA. The agreement\n\nbetween observed tidal data and predicted values is encouraging (Table 1,\n\nitalics) and indicates for these sites, as Berger and Beaumont point out,\n\nthat the elastic theory is complete and that problems of "site" effects can\n\nbe overcome.\n\nIn practice this means that a site transfer function can be\n\n\ncomputed for surface instruments in the presence of gross elastic and topo\xc2\xad\ngraphical inhomogeneities by observing any precisely known strain signal\n\nrather than by predicting the effects of the inhomogeneities.\n\nKing et al.\n\n\n(1976) suggest a method for determining this site tensor which requires the\n\nobservation of at least three strain signals that must be different but whose\n\namplitudes need not be precisely known.\n\nCan block movements or the presence of crustal blocks result in -types of\n\ninhomogeneity which cannot be defined in terms of the effects of underground\n\ncavities, surface topography and the lateral distribution of elastic moduli?\n\nWe discuss some of the observed behavior of crustal blocks with this question\n\nin mind.\nfield".\n\nIn the discussion we frequently make use of the term "applied strain\xc2\xad\nThis we define as the strain that would be present on a laterally\n\n\nhomogeneous Earth.\n\n\n(60)\n\n8\n\n\n(1) Incoherent strainfields.\n\nIndependent motion of adjacent blocks may\n\n\ngive rise to the fragmentation of the applied strainfield into\'small scale\n\nstrainfields.which are related in a complex way to the applied strainfield.\n\nTo an observer within the fragmented region, the strains on adjacent blocks\n\ncould be described as spatially incoherent with each other.\nwithin a block will appear coherent.\n\nHowever, strains,\n\n\nIn the context of the idealized V- and\n\n\nN-shaped faults of Imamura, a strain array between two faults has internal\n\ncoherence but a strain array with one instrument per block shows poor coherence\n\nor no coherence.\n\nAn important corollary is that if coherent. strains or tilts\n\n\nare sought in order to reduce the surface noises in strain or tiltmeter arrays,\n\nfor example, the spacing of instruments should be much smaller\'than the block\n\ndimensions.\n\nKasahara (1973) argued that the direction and amplitude of tilts\n\n\nand strains measured with tiltmeters and strainmeters at Nokogiriyama and Abur\xc2\xad\natsubo ate not in close agreement with each other or with geodetic data in the\n\nsame region, and attributed this to inhomogeneity and block structure.\n\nScholz\n\n\nand Kato (1977) demonstrate convincingly that the two observatories are on\n\ndifferent crustal blocks which move differently from each other and from the\n\ngeneral trend of the region.\n\nYamada (1973) and Shichi (1973), however, re\xc2\xad\n\nveal a curious similarity between the tilt vectors if the vector coordinates\n\nof one station are bilaterally inverted, rotated slightly, an isotropic scaling\n\nfactor applied and the phase of the Aburatsubo ,station delayed by about a year.\n\nExcept for the phase delay, the coordinate transform required can be interpreted\n\nas the result of complex block interaction.\n\nThe phase delay is suggestive of\n\n\na migrating deformation source (Kasahara, 1977) although it is possible to\n\nderive similar delays by invoking non-linear elastic behavior at block boun\xc2\xad\ndaries (5 below).\n\n\n(61)\n\n9\n\nAn important feature of surface strainfields is that although topographic\n\nand elastic inhomogeneity can distort applied strain amplitudes considerably\n\nthe rotation of the principal strain axes is minimal (Berger and Beaumont,\n\n1976).\n\nIt is possible, however, that a mosaic of loosely-coupled blocks might\n\n\nintroduce large rotations of the applied strain axes under certain conditions.\n\nFor example, if a strainfield is applied to one side of a sequence of crustal\n\nblocks, the observed strains well into the fragmented region may be largely\n\nthose arising from random contacts on block boundaries.\n\n\n(2) Strain attenuation:\n\ntilt enhancement.\n\nHorizontal strains within\n\n\na block bounded by free surfaces will tend to zero although the decoupled\n\nblock will respond to basal tilts.\n\nThis suggests an argument in favor of\n\n\nusing geodetic levelling to search for the existence of active blocks.\n\nIn\n\n\npractice it is not possible for a fissure to remain open at any great depth\n\n(e.g., Reasenberg and Aki, 1974) so that strains will be diminished to a\n\nmarked degree only near the block boundaries and according to the degree and\n\ndepth of the weaker boundary zone.\n\nLatynina (1975b) reasons that vertical\n\n\ndiscontinuities may be widespread, resulting in a global attenuation of tidal\n\nstrain.\n\nRecent observations of tidal strain do not favor this hypothesis.\n\n\nIn Table I, we compile tidal admittance results from several observatories.\n\nThe admittance is the ratio of the observed tidal strain amplitude to the\n\ncombined amplitude of the theoretical tide and the estimated ocean-loading\n\nstrain tide.\n\nFigures in italics are the tidal admittance after correction for\n\n\nthe distorting effects of local cavities, surface topography and known geology.\n\nUnity admittance and zero phase are expected where the predicted value agrees\n\nwith the observations.\n\nAlthough the average tidal admittance is low for data\n\n\n10\n\n\nwhere site corrections have not been applied, it would appear that except in\n\na few cases, site geometry can account for much of the observed attenuation\n\n(Berger and Beaumont, 1976).\n\nThe lack of evidence for a general attenuation\n\n\nof strain amplitudes at tidal frequencies need not necessarily exclude the\n\noccurence of crustal blocks if block boundaries behave viscoelastically.\n\n(3) Strain concentration at block boundaries.\n\nStrain applied to a re\xc2\xad\n\ngion of elastic contrast will concentrate in the relatively compliant zones.\n\nThat block boundaries are generally zones of low elastic moduli has been sub\xc2\xad\nstantiated by many investigators.\n\nSeismic velocity anoialies associated with\n\n\nmajor faults have been reported by Alewine and Heaton (1973), Bakun and Bufe\n\n(1975), and Healy and Peake (1975).\n\nIn a finite element model of the San.An\xc2\xad\n\ndreas fault zone, Wood et al. (1973) show that tidal tilts are particularly\n\nsensitive to the effective stiffness of the fault zone.\n\nThe enhancement of\n\n\nstrains across a block boundary was studied by Latynina (1975a,b) who reports\n\ntidal strain magnifications of 100% across parts of the Kondarinsky fault and\n\n-abnormally large secular strains.\n\nTidal strains within the San Andreas fault\n\n\nzone are not reported although the apparent modulation of the velocities of\n\nseismic waves traversing the zone suggests substantial enhancement (McEvilly\n\nand Johnson, 1977).\n\nDiscrepancies in the magnitudes of transient tilts mea\xc2\xad\n\nsured by tiltmeters near the San Andreas fault zone are presumably\' caused by\n\ncontrasting rock types. (McHugh and Johnston, 1976) although these data were\n\nnot corrected for topographic effects.\n\nThe effects of varying the -shearmodulus\n\n\nin the zone are discussed by McHugh and Johnston (1977).\n\n(4) Local block boundary strains.\n\nDifferential movement of adjacent\n\n\nblocks may generate local strains at block boundaries. -Local strainfields\n\nmay-be generated near locally rigid asperities on adjoining block surfaces.\n\n\nThey are important because they will generally occur at the same times as change\n\nin the applied strains inducing block motion.\n\nConsequently, it will be diffi\xc2\xad\n\ncult to distinguish between the applied strains and the induced ldcal strain\xc2\xad\nfields, especially if the latter are much larger in magnitude.\n\nWhereas\n\n\nstrain concentration described in (3) will be restricted to the weak parts\n\nof block boundary zones, local strainfields will be transmitted within the\n\nadjacent blocks.\n\nThe principal axes of these induced local strains need not\n\n\nnecessarily be the same as the applied primary strains.\n\nA possible manifes\xc2\xad\n\ntation of block behavior which may include the generation of local strains is\n\nthe observation of strain-steps in certain tectonic regions -and to the some\xc2\xad\nwhat uneven way which strain-steps have been observed to decay with distance\n\n(Jap. Network Crustal Movement Observ..,\n\n1970).\n\n\nThe generation of strainfields at block boundaries by non-tectonic stresses\n\nmay occur.\n\nStrain measurements across the Yamasaki fault zone (Oike et al.,\n\n\n1976) indicate that strains within the fault occur at times of heavy rainfall.\n\nSimilar effects are observed on the Lake Cavazzo fault, Italy (Caloi and Mi\xc2\xad\ngani, 1972).\n\nTomasson (1976) and Tomasson et al. (1976) present data for a\n\n\nfissured region in Iceland which indicates clearly that block movements are\n\nrelated to water-table changes.\n\nHerbst (1976) proposes a model for near\xc2\xad\n\nsurface, hydraulically-induced tilt noise that requires a similar mechanism.\n\n\n(5) Non-linear elastic behavior.\n\nAs has been remarked before, adjoining\n\n\nblocks do not always move independently but sometimes appear to coalesce and\n\nbehave as a larger unit.\n\nIs this to be interpreted as a variation of the pro\xc2\xad\n\nperties of a fault zone subject to a uniform applied strain or as the response\n\n\n12\n\nof weakly-coupled blocks to changing applied stiainfields?\n\nEvidence of short-term elastic modulichanges may be found in the study\n\nof the Kondarinsky fault zone, north of Dushambe, Tadjikistan.\n\nFigure 6 is\n\n\ncompiled from Gzovsky et al. (1972), Latynina et al. (1974), and Latynina and\n\nRizaeva (1976).\n\nDuring the first few months of\'1967, strains across part of\n\n\nthe fault indicate compression and insignificant tidal amplitude variation.\n\nIn about July a decrease in the strain rate occurs and at about the same time\n\nthe fault zone stiffness increases as indicated by the decrease in tidal ad\xc2\xad\nmittance.\n\nThe compression of the fault zone resumes when the.tidal amplitude\n\n\nassumes its former value.\n\nThe observed elastic modulus change is transitory\n\n\nand does not coincide closely with the strain compression data.\n\nNonuniform\n\n\ncompression of the fault zone is to be expected in view of the probable un\xc2\xad\neven boundaries between the two blocks and this may account for the lack of\n\ncloser agreement of the two curves.\n\nFlexing of block boundaries characteristic of V-shaped faults may give\n\nrise to time dependent changes in elastic modulus or viscoelastic behavior.\n\nFor small variations about a quiescent strain level in the fault zone, the\n\nblock boundary may behave linearly but if the strain departs significantly\n\nfrom this level, the fault zone may exhibit non-linear properties.\n\nIt is interesting to combine the properties of a viscoelastic material\n\nwith the additional constraint of non-linear elasticity within the fault\n\nzone.\n\nA simple model is shown in Figure 7. For rapid strains over a small\n\n\nrange, the elastic properties of k\n\nare dominant.\n\nFor slowly applied com\xc2\xad\n\npressive strains, the system has negligible stiffness until k2 is engaged.\n\nIf the stiffness of k2 approaches that of the block material displacements\n\nare transmitted across the system with good fidelity at all frequencies.\n\nEx\xc2\xad\n\n(E\n\n13\n\nperimental evidence for fractured rock behaving in this way is presented by\n\nGoodman (1976, p. 172).\n\nAn important feature of the model is that it enables\n\n\nthe transmission of long-period (secular) deformation with a delay.\n\nA series\n\n\nof such block boundaries could result in an extremely slow (delay-line) pro\xc2\xad\npagation of crustal strain.\n\nA second feature of the model is the increase in.\n\n\nstrain rate that accompanies the eventual transmission of the applied strain.\n\nThese two characteristics of the model agree with the observed tilt data from\n\nJapan where slow propagating tilts are recognized by rapid inflections in tilt\n\nvectors (Kasahara, 1977).\n\nThe model allows the propagation of crustal defor\xc2\xad\n\nmation without the entity of a deformation front (Scholz, 1977;-Kasahara,\n\n1977) or a strain wave-(Bott and Dean, 1973; Spence, 1977); however, it still\n\n\nrequires the existence.of a remote source of strain to -initiate the disturbance.\n\nA discussion of the physical conditions resulting in behavior similar to the\n\nproposed model is outside the scope of the present article, \'although it is\n\n.probable that the role of fluids is significant.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n\nWe have reviewed some of the evidence for block motion in areas of in\xc2\xad\ntense tectonic deformation.\n\nIt is important to understand whether active block\n\n\nstructures occur in a given area where strainmeters or tiltmeters are to be in\xc2\xad\nstalled singly or in arrays,since some of the elastic properties-of the re\xc2\xad\nsulting surface fragmentation can cause interpretive ambiguity in observed\n\ndata.\n\nIn general, observed strainfields will be incoherent across block boun\xc2\xad\n\ndaries compared to strains within integral blocks.\n\nStrain magnitudes can be\n\n\n14.\n\nreduced\' significantly within blocks which may exhibit large tilts.\n\n(6\n\n\nThe\n\n\nazimuth of observed principal strain axes may differ from the azimuth of\n\napplied strain axes in places where local strainfields are generated\n\nat flock boundaries. \'Applied trains will normally be intensified\n\nat block boundaries if these are represented by relatively weak fault\n\nzones.\n\nIn many ways the effects of crustal blocks can be described in terms\n\nof geometrical and geological inhomogeneities (Harrison, 1976b; Blair,\n\n1977).\n\nThe theory developed for treating these forms of inhomogeneity assumes\n\n\nlinear elasticity.\n\nIt is possible, however, that some block boundaries must\n\n\nbe modelled as non-linear rheological systems involving frequency dependent\n\nor strain-dependent elastic.properties. \n If these occur, their effects do\n\nnot appear to modify tidal strains significantly (Levine and Harrison, 1976;\n\nBeavan and Goulty,. 1977), although they may affect secular strains.\n\nA pos\xc2\xad\n\nsible strain-delay mechanism based on viscoelastic, block-boundary behavior\n\nis suggested that can account for the slow transmission of secular tectonic\n\nsignals.\n\nBlocks with surface dimensions ranging from below I km to greater than\n\n50 km have been inferred.\n\nThough not of great tectonic significance,\n\n\nblocks with dimensions of a few kilometers potentially create seri\xc2\xad\nous difficulties to the interpretation of strainmeter.or tiltmeter\n\ndata;- A history of levelling data can reveal the presence of active\n\nblock motion in a given region better than other geodetic techniques since\n\nthe density of fixed markers is greater than for triangulation or trilatera\xc2\xad\ntion data, the precision is cofisistently good and, in Japan at least, the\n\n\n15\n\n(67)\n\n\nidentification of active block motion is assisted by the recognition of\n\ndiscontinuous surface tilt.\n\nFor this application, it is permissible to\n\n\nuse parallel nearby relevelling profiles which may not have a common datum.\n\nNormal geodetic levelling data, however, will not reveal blocks with dimen\xc2\xad\nsions less than about 5 km.\n\nThe density of strainmeters or tiltmeters re\xc2\xad\n\nquired in regions in which blocks may be less than a few kilometers is\n\nclearly economically prohibitive.\n\nA compromise between a dense array of\n\n\ncontinuously monitoring instruments and frequently repeated geodetic work\n\nis indicated in which the spacing of fixed reference markers is some fraction\n\nof a kilometer...\n\n.\n\n\nAn understanding of the behavior of crustal blocksand block boundaries\n\nis important if we are to interpret long-period strainmeter and tiltmeter\n\ndata.\n\nThe study of block boundaries is a promising area for future research.,\n\n\n16\n (68)\n\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\n\nWe are indebted to Chris Scholz who drew our attention to the wealth of\n\ngeodetic data published by Japanese researchers and who has provided con\xc2\xad\nsiderable encouragement for the work.
