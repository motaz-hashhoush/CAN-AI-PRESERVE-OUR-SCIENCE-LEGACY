The FINDS algorithm is designed to provide reliable estimates for aircraft position, velocity, attitude, and horizontal winds to be used for guidance and control laws in the presence of possible failures in the avionics sensors. The FINDS algorithm was developed with the use of a digital simulation of a commercial transport aircraft and tested with flight recorded data. The algorithm was then modified to meet the size constraints and real-time execution requirements on a flight computer. For the real-time operation, a multi-rate implementation of the FINDS algorithm has been partitioned to execute on a dual parallel processor configuration: one based on the translational dynamics and the other on the rotational kinematics. The report presents an overview of the FINDS algorithm, the implemented equations, the flow charts for the key subprograms, the input and output files, program variable indexing convention, subprogram descriptions, and the common block descriptions used in the program.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19880015235, "id": "e17919ea86fa4e6d9814328a0dcd5062", "publicationDate": "1988-06-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19880015235.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19880015235/downloads/19880015235.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19880015235/downloads/19880015235.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19880015235/downloads/19880015235.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
