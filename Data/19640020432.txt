Today we are taking up subjects that are less glamorous,\nbut certainly just as\ndeserving of our best thought and effort. Maintain-\n\nGovernment laboratories have a special competence-to supervising, integrating, and administering\nour contracts with industry, universities, and private research\norganizations.\nThe discussions of this conference so far divide\n\ning and improving the dose cooperation\nof government, industry,\nand the scientific community\nis a\nprimary concern essential to mission success.\nAlmost every project NASA has undertaken during\nthe past 5y2 years has been characterized\nby newness\nand innovation.\nIn many ways the space program\n\neasily into four general\n\nhas been without precedent.\nIt is, therefore,\nnot\nsurprising\nthat along with our efforts to solve the\nproblems\nof space exploration,\nwe have found it\nnecessary to devote a great deal of study to determining the best ways of managing a program of this\n\nManned\n\nscope.\nIn our early\n\nefforts\n\nto overtake\n\nthe\n\nlead of the\n\nSoviet Union and gain preeminence\nin space, we had\nto form an organization and draw together a number\nof separate organizations and programs.\nTo accomplish this, NASA from the start has continually\nappraised its organizational\nstructure\nand\nmanagement\nmethods.\nWe lfave made every effort\nto meet the needs for change as they have arisen.\nProblems have never been permitted to pile up to the\npoint where a major overhaul or massive reorganization was required in order to get on with the\nmission.\nNASA\n\nPROGRAM\n\nThis is not the time nor the place to go into a\nlengthy discussion of the changes made over the years\nin NASA\'s internal structure. In brief, our philosophy is to limit our inhouse activity--except\nfor a\nrelatively small amount of research for which existing\n\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n\nareas:\n\nManned Space Flight\nSpace Science and Applications\nAdvanced Research and Technology\nTracking and Data Acquisition.\nSpace\n\nFlight\n\nProgram\n\nThe Manned Space Flight program has as its objective the exploration and utilization of space by man.\nSteps toward this goal involve the development\nof a\ncapability for extending stay times in space, the development of techniques for rendezvous and docking in\nspace, and the capability for landing\nmen on the\nMoon and returning them safely to Earth by the end\nof this decade.\nIntegral with this program is the\ndevelopment of new and powerful large launch vehicles with the associated capability for constructing,\ntesting, and launching these vehicles and their complex manned payloads.\nThis has been and will\ncontinue to be a difficult program, but one which we\nhave every confidence of being able to accomplish.\nSpace Science\n\nand\n\nApplications\n\nProgram\n\nIn the Space Science and Applications\nprogram, we\nare interested in developing our understanding\nof the\nEarth and the space about it, our solar system, our\ngalaxy, neighboring\ngalaxies, and the interplanetary\nspace; in this program we are producing\nthe technology that provides the basis for the commercial\ndevelopment\nof operational\nspace systems such as\nweather and communications\nsatellites.\nWe are study197\n\n198\n\nPEACEFUL\n\nUSES\n\nOF\n\nSPACE\n\njt\ning the Moon, the Sun, and the nearby planets.\nInvestigations of the nearby planets include efforts to\ndetermine the existence and possible forms of life on\n\ntheory and often developed the measuring instrument.\nA comparison of the anticipated and actual data permits either validation or rejection of the theory.\n\ntheir surfaces.\nThe program also examines the effects\nof space environment on terrestrial forms of life.\nAdvanced\n\nResearch\n\nand Technology\n\nThe prime objective of the Advanced\nTechnology\nprogram is the provision\nsound, technical base for this Nation\'s\n\nProgram\nResearch and\nof a broad,\nfuture aero-\n\nnautics and space activities.\nMuch of this effort is\nconducted within Government,\nuniversity, and NASA\nlaboratories.\nHowever, some flight projects are required to support the laboratory program.\nThe fields\nof interest range from propulsion\nto spacecraft, aircraft, and human factors.\nTracking\n\nand Data\n\nAcquisition\n\nProgram\n\nThe Tracking and Data Acquisition program supports all the manned and unmanned\nmissions of\nNASA.\nIts worldwide operation is an essential element of the total NASA program.\nIt is obvious that\nfrom the space and aeronautics missions little will be\ngained unless useful data are returned to our engineers\nand scientists.\nPROGRAMING\n\nCONCEPTS\n\nWe use the term programing in NASA to cover the\ntotal process of establishing goals, breaking these goals\ndown into specific feasible missions, .Fghasing these\nmissions in such a way as to take maximum advantage of each mission\'s results in terms of subsequent\nmissions, and applying appropriate emphasis.tothese\nmissions in terms of the country\'s and NASA\'s total\navailable resources.\n\nFIGURE\n\nThe\n\nadvancement\n\n1.--Project\n\nof\n\ncycle.\n\ntechnological\n\ndevelopments\n\nfor space operations follows the same type of cyclic\nprocess.\nTheoretical concepts are derived in Government, university, and industrial laboratories for modified or new types of propulsion,\npower, stabilization,\nguidance,\ncommunications,\nlife support,\nstructures,\nand reentry techniques that might lead to improved\nlaunch-vehicle\nand spacecraft\ncapability.\nExperimental models are designed, fabricated_, and tested to\nprove or disprove the concept.\nOftentimes\nthis requires extensive ground-based\'\nfacilities such as wind\ntunnels, shock tubes, and space chambers.\nUltimately,\nas in the attainment of scientific objectives, flight tests\nare required to confirm\nlaboratory results.\n\nor deny the\n\ntheoretical\n\nand\n\nAn examination of our scientific objectives in space_\nshows that a key element is the collection and evaluation of data and information.\nThis collection and\n\nThe entire cycle for both scientific investigation and\ntechnology advancement\ntakes an extended period of\ntime because it includes the design and fabrication\n\nevaluation is a cyclic process (fig. 1).\nGaps in man\'s\nknowledge, whether in terms of basic natural phenomena or in methods and techniques, excite possible\ntheories based on knowledge already available.\nSubstantiation of a new scientific concept must be based\non flight experimentation.\nIn other words, a theory\non the origin of the Moon must be translated into\n\nof spacecraft, launch vehicles, tracking and data acquisition systems;

As indicated in Table 11, 70 percent of the total procurements are\nplaced directly by NASA, 5.4 percent through the Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory, and 17.5 through other Government agencies.\nSome 2,500 prime contractors, located in 49 States\nand the District of Columbia, are engaged in NASA\nwork. Something over $4 billion will be paid to\nindustry for its work under NASA contracts this year.\nLess impressive from a dollar-and-cents viewpoint,\nbut of basic importance to our program, is the research into the space environment-its measurement,\nobservation, and use-that is being conducted in more\nthan 100 university laboratories throughout the\nNation. More than 4,000 experimenters are participating in this work, in cooperation with at least 20\nGovernment agencies.\n\nC0"TRACI\'ING PROCEDURES\nIn view of all this, it is clear that NASA\'s contracting policies, practices, and administration are a\nkey part of our overall management process.\n\nTABLE\n11.-Zndustry\'s Role in\n\nNASA Program for\n\nFiscal Year 1963\n\nHow contracts are placed\n\nPortion of total\nprocurements, %\n\nMillions\n\nDirectly by NASA _ _ _ . - . . _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n$2,261.7\n\n70.0\n\nThrough JPL. ______._-..__._.___ 5.4\n174.8\nThrough other Government\nagencies.*\n\n__\n\nTotal.. _ _ _ _____. _ _\n_ __ __ _\n\n565.2\n\n1\n\n3,001.7\n\n17.5\n\n[\n\n~~\n\n92.9\n\n*Army 5 5 7 6 , USAF 36%, Navy 476, others 5%.\n\nWe have had to learn-sometimes the hard wayabout the many ways that the form of an original\ncontract will affect the quality of a contractor\'s management and the end product that he contributed to\nthe program.\nMuch of our initial work, in particular, was exploratory or "first-of-a-kind," and as a result NASA\n\n202\n\nPEACEFUL\n\nUSES\n\nOF\n\nSPACE\n\nhas often been faced with a serious problem in its\nendeavors to develop firm specifications\nand to estimate costs in situations of substantial technological\nuncertainty.\nFor these reasons, many of our early\n\nIt is almost always easier to pinpoint\nthe shortcomings of contracting procedures than it is to come\nup with new and better ways of achieving the objective.\nWe believe, however, that we have made con-\n\nresearch and development\ncontracts were on a costplus-fixed-fee\n(CPFF)\nbasis.\nThis appeared\nto be\n\nsiderable progress in doing\nout CPFF contracts entirely,\n\nthe best way to give NASA project management\nthe\nflexibility needed to respond to changes in technological requirements.\n\ndifficulty is that the profit is to all intents and purposes built in at the beginning of a project, on the\nbasis of estimated costs at the time; it, therefore, does\n\nIt was recognized, even at the time, that the management of such contracts could be influenced to only\na relatively limited extent by governmental\nadministrative controls. This is not meant to imply, of course,\neither a blanket condemnation\nbf CPFF contracts or a\n\nnot relate nearly so much as it should to the manner\nin which the contractor actually performs.\n\ndismissal of the importance of administrative\ncontrols.\nOn the contrary, they offered us in many cases what\nwas probably the only way to proceed with our early\nproiects.\nWhat\n\nwe need to do, in the future,\n\nis to devise\n\noriginal types of research and development contracts\nwhose form and provisions\ncan strongly motivate\nindustrial management\ntoward improving methods,\nand ultimately, products.\nIt is for this reason that\nwe in NASA have devoted so much of our attention\nto ways of improving\ncontract forms.\n\nour contracting\n\nprocesses\n\nand\n\nBecause of varying practices in effect at a number\nof the NASA centers, nonuniformities\nin administration of contracts has sometimes been a problem.\nSo\nmany different elements were drawn together to make\nup the new agency that this development\nwas more\nor less to be expected.\nHowever, we are taking steps\nto achieve uniform\nmethods as rapidly as possible.\nThere are still a number of important areas that are\nin need of attention, and we are collaborating\nwith\nthe Department\nFinally,\n\nof Defense\n\nimproper\n\nin this regard.\n\nuse of letter contracts\n\ntimes been a serious source of potential\nlessen the Government\'s\nbargaining\n\nhas some-\n\ntrouble.\npower\n\nThese\nat the\n\nnegotiating\ntable.\nThey often slow down the definitizing process, and in extreme cases can lead to\nsituations\n\nwhich\n\ncentage-of-cost\nletter contract\ndoing business,\n\napproach\nrelationship.\n\nthe\n\nillegal\nWe\n\ncost-plus-per-\n\nhave\n\nfound\n\nto be a generally unsatisfactory\neven if a cost-plus-incentive\n\nthe\n\nway of\ncontract\n\nis finally reached. As a matter of policy, we are\nstriving to eliminate letter contracts except in some\nvery special cases where a specific exception\nNASA\n\nheadquarters.\n\nis made in\n\nboth.\nWithout\nruling\nwe recognize the chief\n\n,/\n\nAlong with this deficiency come other problems-different but dosely related. There is no real financial\npenalty to the contractor\nwho performs\npoorly, or\noverruns\nhis costs, or misuses his manpower\nby\npulling people off the job to help write proposals\nbeing submitted in efforts to get other contracts.\nYet\nanother important deficiency of CPFF contracts is that\nthere is no workable financial deterrent or penalty that\ncan be taken against a contractor that underbids\nthe\njob to make sure that he gets it and then escalates\nthe cost once the contract is firmly in hand.\nThere is no reward for efficiency, and no penalty\nfor its absence, eveh in those overhead and administrative areas which do not relate directly to the technical\neffort.\nThere can be little accomplished\nby governmental monitoring\nof such items because efficiency\nstems from correctly making literally thousands of\nsmall, day-to-day decisions by contractor\npersonnel.\nA Government\nfollowup\nmore to the costs.\n\nwould\n\nsimply add that much\n\nTo put things into the vernacular of the "carrot\nand the stick," we are primarily interested in a bigger\nand better carrot, but we recognize that we cannot\nafford to throw away the stick.\n\nDuring\n\nwe have experimented\nwith a\nforms of contracts.\nAt the same\nto begin converting some of our\ntracts into some form of incentive\nINCENTIVE\n\nthe past year,\n\nvariety of incentive v\ntime, we took steps\nexisting CPFF concontracts.\n\nCONTRACTS\n\nWe are searching for a type of contract that will\nmotivate the contractor\nto become more deeply involved in performing\nwork of high quality with maximum speed and minimum cost.\nIn this way we hope to reduce the number of persons presently required to carry out what are essentially policing actions.\nThese would be largely unnecessary if we could place more of the responsibility\nfor basic decisions of performance,\ntime, and cost in\n\nGOVERNMENT\n\nAND\n\nINDUSTRY\n\n203\n\nthe hands of industry management.\nOnly through\nsuch an approach can we hope to reverse the constant\nescalation of costs that stems from adding persons on\nboth sides of the equation.\nThis is, as the Government adds people, the contractor has to add people\nto respond to our people,\nfactory to either side.\nGoing\n\ninto incentive\n\nand the result\n\ncontracting\n\nis not satis-\n\nis not, of course,\n\nan easy matter.\nIt is hard to properly establish the\nincentives in the manner in which they relate to cost\nand schedule, and particularly\nto performance--how\ndo you measure performance?\nBut these are the\nthings we are working on and think we .are making\ngood progress.\nWe do have some of these contracts\nworking for us now.\nTable III shows our increased\nemphasis on incentive contracts, from none at all in\n1961 to some 30 as of April\n\nCONTRACTOR\nFIGURE 5.--Incentive\n\n1964.\ncore of a major evolution\npolicy and practice.\n\nTABLE III.--Emphasis\n\non Incentive\n\nContracts\n\nNumber of\ncontracts\n\nFiscal year\n\nValue in\nmillions\n\n1961 .....................................\n\nNone\n\n1962 .....................................\n\n1\n\n1963 .....................................\n\n7\n\n162\n\n23\n\n313\n\nTo February1964*\n\n*At\neach\n\nthis\n\nwere\n\n.....................\n\ndate\nalso\n\n18\n\nunder\n\nadditional\nnegotiation\n\ncontracts\nwith\n\nof\nselected\n\nover\n\n$\n\n$5\n\n7\n\nmillion\n\ncontractors.\n\nAgain it should be emphasized that there are three\nfactors we want the contractor to be involved in--cost,\ntime, and performance\n\n(fig. 5).\n\nWe want contracts\n\nto be written in such a way that industry management\nwill carefully weigh and consider what any change\nin his operation will do to all three items. Obviously,\nthere cannot be an alteration in any one of them without a concomitant effect on the other two. We believe\nthat only in this way can the present performance\nimproved at the contractor level.\nThe\n\nincentive\n\nprinciple\n\ncontracting.\n\nholds\n\nthat\n\nbe\n\na contractor\'s\n\nprofit should be related to his ability to: turn out a\nproduct that meets significantly advanced performance\ngoals, improve on the contract schedule, substantially\nreduce the cost of the work, or complete the project\nunder _tweighted combination\nof some or all of these\nobjectives.\nThe principle\nis not a new one, but the\nemphasis that it is receiving is new, and it is the\n\nin NASA\'s\n\nprocurement\n\nProbably the most important\nadvantage of the incentive contract is that, since profit depends on how\nwell the contractor performs,\nthere is an extremely\nstrong motivation for the con.tractor to do his utmost.\nThere is a further benefit in that the incentive arrangement forces both parties to consider performance\nversus schedule versus cost throughout\nthe program.\nThe gains that we achieve through incentive contracting are not achieved without additional effort,\nand certainly not without incurring certain risks.\nIf\nthe incentive contract places too much emphasis on\nreducing costs, the contractor may be tempted to cut\ncosts at the expense of timely delivery or product\nquality.\nWe believe, however, that this can be prevented by\nweighting the various features of bonus and penalty\nto channel the contractor\'s\nefforts to meet all objectives.\nIn this regard,\n\nit might\n\nbe mentioned\n\nthat we are\n\nexploring\nthe possibility\nof incorporating\nmuch\nsharper cost reduction incentives in those administrative and overhead areas that do not affect the technical\neffort. The objective, briefly and simply, is to tailor\nincentives to each particular\ncase, programmatically\nand functionally.\nThis is also a good discipline from the standpoint\nof NASA\'s internal operation.\nThese remarks are\ncertainly not intended\nto imply that the need for\nimprovement applies to industry only; we are fully as\nconcerned with improving\nthe manner in which we\ncarry out our business in-house.\nIt is our aim when-\n\n204\n\nPEACEFUL\n\nUSES\n\never possible, through careful planning, to define our\ncontracts more clearly and accurately beforc thcy arc\nlet.\nIt is clear that the Government\'s\nprocure the maximum\nreasonable combination\nsame time, NASA\n\ngoal must be to\n\neffective effort at the most\nof costs and time.\nAt the\n\nneeds to maintain\n\nflexibility\n\nin that\n\nas many management\nand procurement\nalternatives\nshould remain open to us as possible during the life\nof the project.\nAnd we cannot neglect our responsibility of assuring appropriate quality of performance.\nIn terms\n\nof\n\nprocurement\n\npractice,\n\nproach to a wholly new NASA flight\nrun along these lines.

This\nposed new\nall funded\nAfter\n\nwould\ngroup\nproject\nat the\n\nthe\n\nideal\n\nap-\n\nproject might\ncontract with\nstudy which\nconcepts and\nor groups of\ncompetitively\nthe technical\n\npropose to make available for this\nof contracts dealing with the prowould normally be fixed price and\nsame level.\n\nthe results\n\nhave been evaluated\n\nby NASA,\n\nthe next step would be a detailed feasibility and preliminary design effort based on the work already done.\nNASA would have the opportunity\nhere of selecting\ntwo or more of the study contractors\nbased on the\nprevious competition\nthought of selecting\n\nor might compete again with the\nthe top teams that are proposed.\n\nThis phase of the cycle would normally be CPFF but\nsubject to careful direction by the field center project\nmanagement group.\nAt the time the feasibility studies\nare undertaken, it would be made clear that the followon development\neffort leading to flight hardware\nwould, if approved,\nbe let to the more effective\ncontractor.\nAt the appropriate\nmoment in the conduct of the\nparallel feasibility studies, NASA would select one for\ncontinuation while terminating\nthe others.\nThe contractor selected for continuation\nwould\nthen be\nawarded a CPFF phase I contract.\nThis would not\ninclude flight hardware but would cover the detailed\ndesign specification,\nbread-board\nmodels, and test\nschedules required for the final project.\nDuring this\nphase, the detailed project cost estimates and schedule\nalternatives would be developed.\nWhen\n\nthe decision\n\nflight hardware\n\nis made\n\nto continue\n\nstage, an incentive\n\ncontract\n\ninto\n\nthe\n\nwould\n\nbe\n\nOF\n\nSPACE\n\nnegotiated on the basis of the total previous effort and\nthe agreed upon designs and testing programs.\nThe\nincentive phase would normally include the proof test\nmodels and the first several flight units required for\nmissions accomplishment.\nIn the event that follow-on\nquired, two\ncontinuation\n\nhardware\n\nitems are re-\n\nalternates are open:\n(1) a fixed-price\nwith the original contractor or (2) a\n\nfixed-price competitive\ndrawings and designs\nincentive contract.\n\ncontract based on the detailed\nprepared\nunder the previous\n\nThis outline of the ideal procurement\napproach is\nnecessarily a difficult one to follow in that it requires _\nthe maximum NASA engineering\neffort prior to actually having a contractor\non board and apparently\nrequires more time between initiation and flight than\nother approaches.\nOn the first point, greater effort\nspent in the area of specifications\nand systems conceptual design will pay dividends in the form of lower\ntotal project cost and higher reliability and higher\nprobability of mission success. As to the second point,\nsometimes the longest route really is the shortest way\nhome.\nWe believe that by establishing\ndiscipline in such\na way that incentive profits accrue from keeping costs\ndown, meeting or beating schedules, and maintaining\nhigh standards of quality and workmanship,\nwe will\nafford maximum benefit to both industry and Government.\nWhat we are really striving for, in the final analysis,\nis not some esoteric, far-out goal.\nWe are striving\nfor mission success, while meeting our schedules and\nstaying within cost.\nWe have been making--and\n\nwill continue\n\nto make\n\n---every effort to ensure that working for NASA will\nbe attractive to industry, providing, of course, that the\nwork is well done. We want success to be extremely\nattractive.\n\nConversely,\n\nwe intend\n\nsloppy work, or wastefulness\nextremely unattractive.\n\nto make\n\nfailure,\n\nof the taxpayers\'\n\ndollars\n\nWe believe that a contract should be designed to\nencourage\nindustry to be as proficient\nas possible,\nrather than assume that industry requires\nconstant\npolicing.\nto become\n\nIf top industrial management\nis motivated\ndeeply and personally involved in the work\n\nthey are performing\nfor NASA, the risks to themselves and to the Government\nwill be minimized.\nBy\nproper\n\nuse of this team concept,\n\nwe believe it will be\n\nGOVERNMENT\n\npossible\ndecade.\n\nto achieve\n\nGOALS\n\nFOR\n\npre-eminence\n\nin space\n\nin this\n\nAND\n\n205\n\nINDUSTRY,#\n\nlunar\n\nj.\n\nsurface\n\nand\n\nselected\n\npossible\n\nlanding\n\nsites.\n\nThese major program elements are scheduled so that\na manned lunar landing and return can be conducted\nTHIS\n\nDECADE\n\nWe plan to develop the Saturn I-B and Saturn V\nlaunch vehicles capable of placing 34,000 pounds and\n220,000 pounds, respectively, in Earth orbit.
