A collaboration between the Mission Design Division and the Intelligent Systems Division, the objective of the lab is to provide testing data and general test protocols for advanced sensors, actuators, and processors for CubeSat-class spacecraft. By developing test schemes for advanced components outside of the standard mission lifecycle, the lab is able to help reduce the risk carried by advanced nanosatellite or CubeSat missions. Such missions are often allocated very little time for testing, and too often the test facilities must be custom-built for the needs of the mission at hand. The G-NAT lab helps to eliminate these problems by providing an existing suite of testbeds that combines easily accessible, commercial-offthe- shelf (COTS) processors with a collection of existing sensors and actuators.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20150023526, "id": "2b6e1b6bb0c44fb997a6c93d062b8e33", "publicationDate": "2015-08-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20150023526.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20150023526/downloads/20150023526.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20150023526/downloads/20150023526.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20150023526/downloads/20150023526.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
