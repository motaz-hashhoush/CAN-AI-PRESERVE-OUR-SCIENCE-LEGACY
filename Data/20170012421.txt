b'Overview of SLS Aeroacoustic Environment Development\nThe Space Launch System (SLS) ascent aeroacoustic environments provide the externally\ndriven noise levels predicted for vehicle ascent during transonic and supersonic flight, and serve\nas an important input for component and secondary structure vibroacoustic design criteria. This\naerodynamically induced noise is predominantly generated by unsteady flow within the local\nboundary layer due to free stream interaction with the outer mold line (OML). Additional\nsources are shear flow interactions, shocks, protuberance flows, and wake flows. This\npresentation provides an overview of the aeroacoustics discipline along with the SLS\nenvironment development process, including wind tunnel testing and general data reduction\nmethods. The state of the discipline is also presented with a summary of aeroacoustic\nmeasurement and computational techniques currently on the horizon.\n\n'
