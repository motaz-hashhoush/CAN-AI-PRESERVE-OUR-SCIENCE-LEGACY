C. 20546\n\nAbstract\nCommuting imposes serious cost, time, and\nsocial burdens on individuals and society. It\nshould not be considered primarily as a transportation problem but as a part of a complex\neconomic and behavioral system in which the functions and structure of the work locatic,n and the\ncommuter\'s residence are of greater import. A\npotential alternative to routine commuting is the\nconcept of "remote work," by which a worker conducts office-type activities in his house or\napartment or r.hrough a neighborhood work and\ntelecommunications center, yet travels to his\nemployer\'s off-\'ce at appropriate times for orientation and motivation. With substantial transpr,rtation and office rent savings and enhanced\neconomic utilization of residential space, this\nnew approach may be cost effective in reducing\nintracity as well as suburban commuting. Technologically feasible, the partial substitution of\ntelecommunications for commuting requires behavioral changes that would be hastened by requiring\n"door to door" pay by employers as a management\nincentive to revise job patterns and develop\ninnovative office output procedures. It also\nwould encourage the socially desirable merging\nof office structures and residences, perhaps\nreversing urban decay through self-interest and a\nsmoother transition to a possible future patterr\nof closer-in, "walk to work," hiring implied by\npresent energy crises and administrative decisions\non local minority employment. A development\nprogram to demonstrate the effectiveness of remote\nwork, evaluate its impact on economic and social\npatterns, and promote phased implementation is\nproposed.\nIntroduction\nSecretary of Housing and Urban Development\nGeorge Romney once made the humanitarian suggestion\nthat we offer a "tithe of time" -- 10 per cent of\nthe nominal 40-hour week -- in well-conceived\nvolunteer efforts to help solve urban problems.(\')\nThis seems unlikely of realization unless a substantial amount of disposable time were added to\nwhat we now have. Most of us do not work just an\n8-hour day, but must put in 10, 11, or more hours,\ndoor to door, because of the relentless demands\nof commuting. If we could reduce travel to work\nsubstantially, we would gain not just 10 per cent,\nbut 20 to 30 per cent or more in potentially productive hours. It is startling to realize that\nin commuting just one hour each way we expend in\nunproductive activity the equivalent of well over\none 8-hour day every week. During a full career\nof 40 years or so, we discard 10 years of equivalent working time. Curiously, while society is\ngravely concerned with depletion of natural resources, there is little awareness of this major\n\nwaste of human potential.\nConcern over the physical and environmental\naspects of commuting has Crown dramatically over\nthe past decade, and today there is widespread\nrecognition of the congestion caused by rush-hour\nhighway traffic, the effect of throughways on\nurban life, ieterioration of mass transit, pollution by i.. i , .e and exhaust fumes, and the high\ncost of uranspoitation systems. In fact, commuting `.s fast approaching (and for some has exceeded) a threshold of intolerability. To note only\none apposite and vivid presentation, Newsweek\nearly this year featured an article that it apErupriately titled "The Agony of the C r nuter".(2J\nMost solutions conceived today turn sensibly -- in\nthe present context of unthinking acceptance of\ncommuting as an unalterable condition of economic\nlife -- on construction and rehabilitation of\nmass transit systems, or even to starting all\nover with "new towns." Few have asked the\nquestion, "Why commute at all?", and even fewer\nhave given this question any systematic consideration.\nAn in-depth analysis would require that we\ntake a systems ap p roach to the economic and social\nnetwork in which commuting is embedded. Commuting,\nafter all, is only a means (today almost the\nexclusive means) by which the expertise of a given\nindividual is brought to bear on the production of\nthe world\'s goods and amenities by physically\ntransferring him from his horse to his place of\n.:ork. Analysis of the commuting problem must\ninclude a consideration of the functions of the\nplace of work (a desk in an office building is\nmost typical today) and also of the home in which\nthe employee is refurbished and stored until again\nbeing required at his distant work station.\nWhen we thus extend our thinking about cormauting beyond the transportation network to the\noffice that the commuter entere, we are struck with\nthe extraordinary effort that today\'s economy expends in getting us together to do our jobs. We\nbuild enormous buildings at high cost (the World\nTrade Center will cost $650 million to house\n50,000 workers, for example). and these buildings for the most part stand empty 128 of the 168\nhours in the week, 76 per cent of the time.\nSo many office buildings are going up in New\nYork City (25 gr cent of all such construction\nin the countrys(3) that serious concern has been\nexpressed over the disappearance of life from large\nareas of the city after the five o\'clock exodus.\nT^ move millions of commuters to these empty\nshells and silent streets, we are building multibillion dollar mass transit systems -- the new\nSecond Avenue subway in New York City, the Bay\nArea Rapid Transit (BART), and the Washington,\n\nA-\t\n\ni\n\nI\n\nD. C., METRO. Great capital and labor costs are\nimposed by the "peaking" of passemer loads\nduring the rush hours, with manpuwer and vehicles\nKept idle during off-peak hours. Of\' course,\nothers than commuters will use these systems, but\nthe needs of shoppers, medical patients, vacationers, and school children could be met for many\ngenerations by less costly arrangements. The\nlarge capital costs slo pe, per employee and r e\ny\ncommuter, of office structures and commuting\nsuggest strongly that a search for practical alternative ways of accomplishing the same ends,\ntaking account of both economic and human factors,\nwould be highly justified from a cost benefit\npoint of view.\n\nMost of us, certainly municipal administrators,\nif faced unequivocally with such a future, would\nbe shocked into searching for new ap p roaches. For\ntnose who have been, Lue;e has been a common,,\nearly perception that a technology already exists\nthat, subject to deeper analysis, should provide\na feasible alternative. The concept -- and we\nmust not jump to conclusions as to how it would\nbe applied in practice -- is that of substituting\n,.\ntelecommunications for commutin g The National\nAcademy of Engineering, which has studied ways\nIn which telecommunications may be used to alter\nmetropulitan functioning and to shape metropolitan\nf\'onn, states: "The concept of a direct substitution of telecommunications for l.ranSLQrt.ation is as old\nas telecommunications itself". -\n\nThe Unused Home\n\nAt the other end of the commuting trail, we\nfind a house or apartment that, like the office,\nis surprisingly underutilized, partly as a result\nof today\'s trend to smaller families, with the\nchildren soon into their school years, and an\nincreasin, pe-tentage of working wives, currently\nestimated at 40 per cent. At the some time.\nan increasing percentage of homes are equipped\nfor full-time living, and for that matter, working.\nOffice facilities such as the telephone and environmental amenities such as air conditioning are\nbecoming universally duplicated in homes. Floor\nspace equivalent to that occupied by the worker\nat the office also is available. (The existence of\nurban housing that does not conform to these\nconditions may be in part a result of the present\ncommuting system; this is discussed later).\nResidences constitute a large part of our\nnational wealth (over 25 per cent), and are valued\nin the aggregate at some 800 billion dollars.\nAbout $33 billion is spent. annually on housing\nand apartment buildings, curiously just. about the\namount spent on nonresidential construction.(4)\nYet, except for a few artists and professional\npeople, no one in urban areas works at home.\nAre there alternatives to the home-office-commuting system that might tap the vast unused\ncapital represented by the space, communication\nfacilities, and presence of workers in individual\nplaces of residence?\nSuch considerations lead directly to the key\nquestion: "Is commuting an economic necessity?".\nThis is not stated too precisely. We could give\nup all commuting to go back to subsistence\nfarming on an acre of land, never traveling farther\nthan the nearest village, dying at age 30, and\nuntil then using the barest minimum of mechanically\nproduced goods. So the question might be expressed\n"Is continuation of the present pattern of working\nand living, in which massive commuting is an\nindispensable element, an imperative if we are to\nmaintain a high standard of living, and for which\nwe shall be forced, by economic necessity, to pay\nin lost time, tension, unlivable cities, and unhealthful environment?". If so, and we have not\nmerely become habituated to only one of many\nequally effective (or superior) work patterns,\nthere is nothing that can be done except to watch\nand participate while displacement of urba-L life\nby buildings continues, more massive commuting\nsystems are built, and commuters make longer and\nlonger trips to ever more distant suburbs.\n\nThe concept has received some academic\nattention and has been crA mented on offhandedly\nby various commentators and writers; but only\nh few significant evaluations have been published,\nand these have not presented quantitative projections nor in-depth analyses. It is time that\nthe potential contributions of telecommunications\nto revised and enhanced living and working patterns be brought into full public awareness,\nand that the concept receive the attention of\nscientists, engineers, management, administrators,\nurban planners, and ell others concerned with\nthe city and with society.\nAs science writer Arthur Q. Clarke says,\n"Don\'t commute, commu-licate".(6)\nWhen we examine the substitution in more\ndepth, we find that there is much, much more to\nthe idea than merely reducing the time we spend\ntraveling to the office. It has the most profound social and cultural implications for urban\nliving -- and not necessarily negative implications. The negative attitude that telecommunications will mean the end of the city by dispersing\nits inhabitants all over suburbia and exurbia\nis well shown in an advertisement by an electronics firm that asks, "Is New York really\nnecessary?".( 7 )\t\nClarke also states a belief\nthat telecommunications will mean the "death of\ncities". As we shall see, perhaps just the\nopposite will be demonstrated, with the city\nbeing enhanced for desirable living.\nA Nation of Message Handlers\n\nSpeculation on substituting telecommunications\nfor commuting bases its feasibility claims on the\nlarge percentage of work that is done in offices,\nrather than factories. Today, four out of five\nnew jobs in the city are in white collar work,\nand industry continues to drift away. White\ncollar work consists in handling messages, either\nvocal or written. When we hold face-to-face\nconferences, read incoming letters and answer\nthem, refer to files -- either by going to a file\ncabinet or by calling up a computer record for\ndisplay on the screen of a cathode ray tube --we\nare processing messages. The final output\nis a message to sumeone else and it must go\nthrough some communication process or media.\nOffice workers do not work at machines -- unless\nthe machines are typewriters, duplicators,\ncomputers, or microfiLu cameras and readers, all\nof which are simply extensions of human message\nhandling activities.\n\nBecause we are nodes in a message-processing\nnetwork, we can, hypothetically, be located anywhere that can be connected to the network. The\npresent close proximity to others in the same\noffice could -- to the extent that the proximity\nis not essential in a behavioral sense to accomplishing the office goals -- be expanded to remote\nlocations connected by electronics, by rapid\ndelivery of written communications, or by travel\nto the office when needed but at less structured\nhours than those compelled by rush-hour commuting.\nSuch an expanded work pattern is referred to\nas "remote work" or "remote employment."\nWith spaceborne communications satellites,\nremote work could be performed anywhere on Earth.\nBut equally advanced technology exists or is\nrapidly being developed in ground-based telecommunications -- coaxial cables, waveguides,\nlaser beams, coding, message switching, etc. -- for\npractical use in handling the operations of the\nremotely located work stations of possibly\nmillions of individuals and their expanded workrelated communication needs. One is particularly\nstruck by the extraordinary compactness of tel_ecommunications in contrast to the vast spaces\nneeded for highways and subways to physically\ntransfer people instead of their conversations;\nclusters of coaxial cables, waveguides under\ndevelopment, and laser beams in the research stage\ncan transmit 90,000; a quarter-million, or millions\nof conversations or equivalent computer data,\nrespectively, yet all can be transmitted through\ntubing only a few inches in diameter. We might\ngive thought to the immensity of the transportation systems that would be needed to bring enough\npeople physically face-to-face to carry on that\nmany conversations.\nTechnology thus would not be the limiting\nfactor in a phased development of a remote work\neconomy. Of course, the quantitative aspects of\nconstruction of alternative communications networks\nto meet possibly quite different requirements under\na remote work culture must be carefully and\nrealistically analysed. Capital costs of communication plant construction are not negligible,\nand projection of increased network needs will be\nof utmost importance to avoid breakdowns in service\nsuch as we have recently experienced with unexpected loads.\nAwaiting further detailed analysis, however,\nneither technology nor costs appear to be critical\nrestraints in moving toward a system where a large\n^*A\xc2\xa2e of office-type work might be done\nremotely.\nHow many persons might be able to work remotely? The Natibnll Academy of Engineering\'s\nCommittee on Telecommunications gave thought\nto this in the aforementioned NAE report( 5) j and\nmade the particularly siemificant estimates -- for\ncommuting -- that 65 per cent of all professional\nand technical white collar personnel and 75 per\ncent, of all clerical workers might be able to\naccomplish their tasks from remote work locations\n(Figure 1). These two groups alone total almost\n15 million out of the U.S. white collar work force\nof 33 million. These estimates are not broken\ndown further; subtracting those who commute from\none point to another in the suburbs would raise\n\ntheir magnitude and significance for the notential\nimpact of remote work on commuting to the central\nbusiness district.\nIt will be noted in Figure 1 that only 20 per\ncent of the work of white collar managers, officials, and proprietors could be done remotely,\naccording to the NAE estimate. This is understandable; a manager must interact frequently\nwith members of his staff, and must often\npersuade and motivate, tasks that might be\ndifficult to accomplish other than in a face-toface mode of communication. The recognition that\nmany jobs can not be done remotely should not\nblind us to the potential over-all economic,\npersonal, and social advantages of having those\nthat can be, possibly a large majority, done in\nthis way. It might also be considered that 20\nper cent amounts to each manager operating from\nhis home only one day a week on the average,\nsurely not an inconceivable situation.\nSubstitution in Practice\n\nThe NAE report does not go into any consideration of how the substitution might be made\nin practice. However, concept formulation has\nbeen attempted over the years, with perhaps\nincreasing sophistication, but with little or no\nincorporation of quantitative data or projections\nof t .st elements.\nA proposed pilot study in substituting\ntelecommunications for transportation was outlined\nHe questioned the wisdom\nin 1963 by Memmott.( 8 )\t\nof making large investments in physical transportation facilities to accommodate person-to-person\ninteractions and concluded that because of\nincreasing congestion:\n"There is a strong probability that the\nsubstitution phenomenon will be\nforced upon us whether we desire it\nor not."\n(There are possibly stronger mandates than congestion, as will be discussed.)\nA ercentive analysis was made in 1968 by\nHealy 9)\t\nHe speaks of the Home Remote Work\nCenter and the Neighborhood Remote Work Center,\nwhich would be within walking distance of many\nindividual residences. While the former, a\nsimple home office, might be tied satisfactorily\nto the telecommunications network by telephone,\nthe latter would permit more cost/effective sharing\nof expensive facilities such as computer terminals\nor facsimile transmission devices. Healy does not\ndiscuss the organization and operation of a\nNeighborhood Remote Work Center, but we may picture\na suburban version as occupying a typical residence\nshell, with attractive landscaping to preserve\nthe esthetic environment. (A precedent is the\nhouse-like enclosure of substations by electric\nutility firms.) For an urban version, one floor\nof an apartment complex could be equipped to\nprovide remote work facilities for the residents,\nwho would then "commute" by elevator to use\ntelecommunications facilities complementing tho,;e\nin their cwn apartment work areas. Combination\nof offices and apartments is increasingly urged\nto assu \xe2\x80\xa2e the continued existence of a. "24-hour\ncity"; remote work would still be advantageous in\n\nClearly, what is now needed is an intensive\ndevelopment of remote work on a broad interdisciplinary front, analysing all aspects of itu\nim pact on the complex structure of our economic\nlife and particularly on the urban environment.\nViewpoints as diverse as those of architects\n(adaptation of buildings for remote work and\nredesign of compacted offices), executives\n(work discipline of remote workers), union officials (concern for employment), fiscal officers\n(receipts from mass transit), sociologists\n(increased or decreased work for disadvantaged,\nuneducated, mothers of dependent children), and\nurban planners ( return of workers to city or\nfurther urban sprawl) will have to be examined\nand reconciled. The task will be complex and\nchallenging. In his study of urban dynamics,\n\nincreasing the flexibility of residence location\nin relation to the employer\'s central office.\nAlso, remote work need not be more remote than across the street or even in the next apartment.\nThe reduction in office space made possible by\ngreater utilization of the employee\'s residence\nwould actually make apartment-office mergers more\nfeasible.\nHealy discusses the elements of a conceptual\ndecision matrix (Figure 2), in which all elements\nof advantages -- economic, psychologic, and\nsocial -- to the employee, his company, and society\nare multiplied by weighting factoro. By evaluating the elements of this matrix for each mode\nof substitution being considered and using some\ndecision model, a decision could be made on the\n\nAssumed Susceptibility of Work-related Trips\nof the White-collar Work Force to Substitution\nby Telecommunications\n(19+ = t;\trw t.a )\nWhite-collar Subgroup\n\nSusceptibility of\nWork-related Trips\nto Substitution\n\nNumber of\nPeople Involved\nin Substitution\n\nProfessional and\ntechnical\n\n65%\n\n6,051,000\n\nManagers, officials\nand proprietors\n\n20%\n\n1,481,000\n\nClerical workers\n\n759\n\n8,859,000\n\n5%\n\nSalesworkers\n\n227,000\n\n16,618,000\n\nTOTAL\n\nAfter NAE=\t 7)\nFigure 1\nrelative over-all value of the changeover.\nEconomic elements include savings in commuting\nexpenses, reduced office space (a large savings\nat today\'s rents), reduced parking facilities,\nand savings to the city on construction and\nmaintenance of unneeded transportation systems,\nas well as costs of additional comn\xe2\x80\xa2nications\nequipment, furnishing the home office, maintaining\nthe neighborhood remote work centers, and so on.\nAbundant cost data is available if these elements\nwere to be projected. Psychological and social\nelements of job satisfaction, change in living\nconditions, closer family ties, and possibly\nhome distractions while working, could be probably\nmeasured only by surveying partic{pants in a\ndemonstration project.\nHealy does not attempt to quantify this matrix\nfor any particular- substitution mode, and raises\nthe question as to who will be the decision maker.\n"It is apparent that employee, company, and society\nas potential decision makers, will not put the same\nweight on the various elements of the measurement\nmatrix."\n\nForrester(10) points out that complex systems,\nsuch as an urban area or an economic process,\nresist policy changes, have long term effects\nquite different from short term responses, and\nwill usually react counter to intuitive solutions.\nNevertheless, complex systems may have a high\nsensitivity to some changes; perhaps there is an\ninherent feature of remote work that, if implemented, could bring it in time into general use and\nalso generate major improvements in the whole pattern of urban life.\nBroader discussions of concrete examples of\nremote work are needed to bring in into more\ngeneral awareness as a practical possibility. For\nexample, the first step to practical implementation\nof remote work is the recognition that it is not\nnecessary to make a vast technological and cultural changeover in a single day, suddenly dropping\nall rush hour commuting and hav;ng everyone start\nwork at home or in his neighborhood. Instead,\nremote work development lends itself very well\nto gradual implementation in phased steps, with\ngreat flexibility by individual companies\n\nf\n\nand their employees. We need\n\nto\n\nrealise.\n\ntoo, that the em,)loyee will not be spending 100\nper cent of his time et home, that he will not\ndisappear into what has been termed "electronic\nisolation." Healy mentions one disadvantage of\nthe home remote work center as being the "psychological problems related to isolation from one\'s\nbusiness associates:"\nAlternate-Day Commuting\nIn fact, if an employer, whether in the city\nadministration, or in the Federal government or\nprivate industry, were to start a remote work\nprocram, the first thing he might try would have\nnothing to do with telecommunications. He might\nsimply provide a group of his employees, say\ntypists, with adequate office equipment in their\nhomes and have them come into the office on\nalternate days to deliver their previous day\'s\noutput, work at an unused desk, and pick up\nmaterial for home transcription. Even the savings\nfrom such a simple arrangement might be substantial.\nHalf the employee\'s commutinC trips would be\n\nJobs, applicable technology also is available.\nRecords and c o rrespondence files on microfilm\nor microfiche can be set up at any number oY\nremote locations, recorded data can be obtained\nfrom computer storage over a T. , uch-Tone phone,\nPicturephones could be Installed where visual\ncontact is essential, computer terminals can be\ninstalled when the cost is ,lustifled, and so on.\nConference and group calls are already familiar\nworking tools in business and would be particularly useful in \'.ransfcrring information to a\nremotely located staff.\nAssembly Line Remoting\n\nEven factory operation is susceptible to\nremote work procedures. So-called numerical\ncontrol of machine tools relieves even the\noperators of being in close proximity to the\nproduction equipment, and adds to the percentage\nof managerial, clerical, and service personnel,\nwho are much less tied to the ritual of commuting.\nAutomation may be about to enter a new phase\nof acceleration.

The employer\nwould have an immediate benefit in compacting his\noffice space, at the cost of some relatively\ninexpensive typewriters and furniture.\nAs experience is gained at this level of\ninnovation, the employer could move on the next\nstep: instead of having the typist pick up dictated work at the office on her alternate days, he\ncould couple the office dictation equipment to the\ntelephone system (equipment is already available)\nand transmit the dictated material to a corresponding recorder at her home. Advances in telecommunications are assuring that telephone lines\nto individuals\' homes will have broader band\nwidths so that faster transmission and more\nefficient use of the whole communication system\nbecomes possible.\nFor the higher technical and professional\n\nCommission on Technology and Automation predicted\nthat if all productivity gains from 1965 to 1985\nwere taken in the form of leisure, one possibilit\'\nwould be a typical work week of only 22 hours.(11)\nHowever, unless the present trend to increasing\ncommuting distances is reversed, we may merely\nreplace the saved time by extra hours of commuting.\nIn fact, unless technology makes a change possible,\nor social or legal forces impose a drastic revision\nof work patterns, we may see the day when more time\nis spent traveling to work then working.\nIn a futuristic, unrantified, look at remote\nmechanization, Albus( 12 ) stresses the potential\ntechnical and social advantages of robot operation\nof machines and services from very distant control\ncenters, and proposes that the development of\nremote employment opportunities via advanced\ncommunications and robotics be established as a\nprimary national goal.\n\nOnce we are tuned in to the Idea that remote\nwork techni q ues are practicable, we can Lake\na systems approach to the over-all process by which\noffice-type work is accomplished. We no longer\naccept commuting as an end in itself, so that only\nvarious modes of transportation are studied.\n\nThis is not to say that we can abandon our\npresent mass transportation efforts. Innovative\nConCeDts Pre urgently required to satisfy genuine needs for shopping, medical services, cu.Ltural\nand recreational activities and essential travel\nto work that can riot be done remotely. What the\nremote work concept does is make us aware that\nthere are options to the ultimate futility of\nunending expansion of commuter transit, as\nrecognize b^^(( urban planners. On this point,\nForresterll0l says:\n"Urban transportation systems can\nencourage land separation into large\nnonintercommunicating sectors. The\nbetter the transportation system, the\nless the interleaving of population\nclasses and the less the proximity of\nhousing to industry. As sector separations increase, commuting cost rises\nrapidly in transportation cost, in psychological trauma, and in time lost from\nproductive activity. Furthermore,\ntransportation can span the deteriorating areas, helping to hide them and\nmaking renewal less pressing and\nless likely."\nHe suggr-sts that for production needs, urban\ntransportation planning should be focused on\ntransportation between industrial centers. In\nNew York City, for example,this would be between\nthe new industrial parks that the city\'s Economic\nDevelopment Administrator reports are beginning\nto place industry in significant numbers.0 )\n"The transportation would serve the\nc omm u ni cation needs of effective\neconomic activity but would not be\nprimarily for long-distance commuting\nfrom home to work."\nRecognizing the necessity for transportation,\nas well as its limitations, we can move on to\nexamine the fundamental problems of remote work\nand to establish incentives to bring about a conversion from antiquated work practices to the\neconomic and social advances inherent in remote\nwork principles.\nManagement Accommodation\n\nBehavorial, rather than technical, problems\nwill be the critical barrier to full remote work\nimplementation. Fortunately, both management\nscience and practical business experience offer\nassurance that this barrier can be overcame. New\nmanagement skills will have to be developed, but\nthere is no reason to question the ability of\nbusinessmen and government administrators to develop\nthese for their respective employment situations.\nWe know that some firms are impl a ting innovations\nsuch as the 4-day, 40-hour week." \t\nThis presents\nproblems of rearranging work hours that would also\nbe encountered in any remote employment variation\nthat involved spending part of the time at a central\n\noffice. Office managers would have to pay more\nattention to identification of :cork units, planning work assignments, and scheduling their\ncompletion. They would become more taskoriented to the actual work output rather than\nto the presence of employees at their desks\nbetween certain hours. Personnel would have to\nbe trained for effective work at home or at their\nneighborhood center. Here, the experience of\nprofessional writers and others accusLomed to\nworking individually can be applied. For example,\nwriters often advise that a desk is reserved solely\nfor their "official" work, so that they became\nconditioned to start work as soon as they sit\ndown. Remote work development will include\ncollecting such experiences and testing them on a\nprogressively widening circle of participants in\nvarious types of jobs.\nThe real problem in bringing the remote work\nconcept up to the takeoff state is the old one of\ncultural inertia. A strong motivation is needed\nto assure that management takes serious steps to\nbreak the habits of a lifetime, and more specifically to take commuting costs and possible\nalternatives into account in every management\ndecision. An ideal incentive would be directly\nmeasurable in dollars for precise accounting and\nfor demonstration of the cost effectiveness of\nremote work procedures over work patterns that\nrequire extensive commuting.\nDoor to Door Pay\n\nUndoubtedly, there are many incentives and\npressures that society, as represented by the\ncity, state, or Federal government, could use to\nencourage business firms to initiate remote work\nprograms. Such incentives might have strong\nsecond - order impacts on many aspects of our complex society; for example, on urban renewal or on\nthe relative location of industry in the suburbs\nvs. the city. Any incentive must be carefully\nstudied as part of a progressive, phased implementation. The following suggestion, therefore, is\nnot one to which we should became irrevocably\ncommitted, but is presented as a particular option\nthat would appear to make a profoundly beneficial\ncontribution to the viability of the city as a\ncontinued center of life, culture, and economic\ndevelopment. Furthermore, it avoids an authoritarian external control over specific aspects of\nbusiness operations in favor of an internal, selfinitiating mechanism that would produce its results\nas ray t ural by-products of business lo g ic and\nrationale.\nSuch a motivation and internal directive would\nbe brought into action immediately if the Federal\ngovernment were to require that firms pay all the\ncommuting expenses of ee ,-h employee -- including\npayment for his time at his regular salary or wage\nrate -- as part of the costs of doing business.\n"Door to door" pay would then become as accepted\nas the portal to portal pay that workers have won\nin some industries. Needless to say, all levels of\ngovernment, with their very large numbers of\nemployees, would also have to conform to the new\npay practice.\nThis is an admittedly audacious proposal, so\nit should be emphasised that it is not intended to\nbenefit the commuter nor to further tax the\n\ni\n\nbusLnecsman, but to bring about automatically the\nhighly desirable social and cultural changes that\nare inherent in remote work principles. Clearly,\ndoor to door pay is not air added economic burden\non the nation, for it neither increases energy\nconsumption nor requires additional labor.\nBasically, it is just e. paper transaction from\npresent pay systems. The dollar figures for\nsalaries, arid prices arid costs of coxmmuterproaueeu goods woula aujuot across the economy with\nno net change in value. What is really significant, every employer would have alwa;%s on his\nledgers before him a substantial dollar f\'1gure\nthat would encourage him to think about ways to\nreduce it. If he had to pay an extra $4 or $5 a\nday ($1000 to $1250 a year) to, say, a typist,\nhe would very quickly see the cost benel\'lt to\nhimself\' of delivering a typewriter and other\noffice equipment to her home, arrangin g, for her\nto come to the office less frequently, and searching out advanced technology by which work could\nbe transferred to her and the finished product\nreturned to the office. For his higher salaried\nprofessional staff\', his decision would be even\nmore quickly triggered.\nEven more important -- and here we come to\nthe beneficial impact of remote work on the city\nas distinct from the sprawling suburbs -- door to\ndoor pay would throw the whole subject of home\nlocation vs. work location into negotiation.\nLet\'s dlrress for L moment. One /treat.\nadvantage claimea for the remote work concept is\nthat we could live where we wanted to. "The ageold problem of how to live in that idyllic\n\'Shangri-La\' and sti11 ring home a paycheck would\nhe solved (for some). \xc2\xb0_ ) It sounds wonderful\nif\' we give no thought to inevitable ^hanges, but\nsecond thoueh t.s may make us aware that\nthe aavantages of remote living are advantages\nonly so long as relatively few take advantage of\nthem. The great majority of us must fa,e up to\nthe fact that we cannot escape to a natural\nparadise and we must cane to a mature recognition\nthat if we want a Shangri-La, we must build it\nwhere we are. We should certainly be aware that\nthe continuing flight to the suburbs is destroying\nthe city. Yet it is possible to conceive of so\ndesigning and maintaining a city -- if there were\na strong motivation to do so -- that it would be\npleasurable to live in.\nSo let\'s look in on an employer in downtown\nManhattan in the near future. lie has set up a\nremote work procedure and finds that it is working well. In fact, he is accomplishing the same\nwork with half the oiTice space that he once\nrented. lie is also operating under the legal\nreq uirement to pay his employees the (till cost\nof their commuting. l.ven though they work\nremotely half or more of their work time, their\nremaininF. commuting is still a recognizably large\nsum in his operating expenses. What will be his\nnext step in attempting to maximize his profits?\nlieturn to Cityi\n\nClearly, he would like to negotiate with his\nemployees to move closer to the office; undoubtedly\nnew job applicants would have their addresses\ntaken into account before being hired.\n\nThis LE, a shocker. Perhaps we feel that even\nthe implication of any restraint on where we\nmight live would be an unbearable Infringement\non our personal liberty. Before we commit ourselvc:: to that unproductive generalizutlon, let\'s\nthink it out. Often, freedan to live where we\nwant really means the freedom to cut arid run from\na perfectly satisfactory location to one with\nmany less desirable 1\'eaturec (such as comnuting)\nus a primitive reactive response to some social\nchange, such as the in-migration of minorities,\nor the very beginnings of problems such us pollution or crime. Changes would go more smoothly\nand problems would not get out. of control if\' we\nstayed put and cooperated in and insisted upon\nrational solutions. True freedom in this context might be interpreted as the assurance that\nall locations where we work or live, as our\ncareers and interests change through lire, will\nbe int rinsically equivalent in space, environwunt, good schools, and access to recreation and\nentertainment; different in style, or course, but\nthoroughly acceptable as a new and worthwhile\nliving experience. But to establish this reach\nof freedom will require strong forces of selfinterest; once established, it might be so\nattractive and so embedded in custom and revised\nadministrative regulations (e.g., zoning) that it\ncould continue on its own.\nThis is not just dilettante futurism. There\nare strong economic and social forces pointing to\nmajor changes in the residence-work relation,\nand unless understood and accommodated to, they\nare likely to be unexpectedly and erratically\napplied, disruptive, and probably will lead far\nafield from the optimum arrangement we have just\ndiscussed.\nEconomically, we have suddenly become -onscinue of a crisis in the assured supply o"\nadequate energy. The brownouts and blackouts\nthat we can expect indefinitely are something\nof a handwriting on the wall. All natural\nresources are being subjected to a far more\ncompetitive demand than in the near past. Every\nautomobile that is bought in the rapidly developing countries of the world is an added inducement\nto oil producers to raise prices arid adopt more\nstringent conservation measures. Nuclear power\nwill not be cheap and may be limited in output\nby environmental considerations. We are facing\ndrastic increases in the operating costs of everything that consumes fuel -- automobiles, busses,\nsubways, heating and air conditioning, and lighting of hones and offices. The situation is not\ncatastrophic -- we can still maintain a high\nstandard of living, even an increasing one -- if\nwe revise our living, and working habits to accomplish the same ends but with substantially reduced\nenergy use. One way this can be done is to save\non transportation and dual upkeep of offices and\nhomes by converting to remote work.\nJudicial In<crventiom?\n\nMore important than natural resources In\nforcing us to consider a substantial change in\nour living-commuting-working complex will be the\ndynamics of social pressures rising to some\neffective action as expressed in administrative\nand judicial decisions. What will judges likely\nhold in the future that will influence the work-\n\nE.\n\nresidence relationship? We typically do not\nattempt to make such projections, yet proponents\nof systems analysis warn us that to ignore any\npossible factor is to make a decision concerning\nit: that it will remain constant, or in this case\nthat courts will stop making decisions. For\nexample, it would be a futile exercise to design\na guideway to carry large numbers of personal\nvehicles downtown if we can project that downtown residents, backed up by the city adi inir,tration and the courts, have made a firm anu lasting\nemotional commitment against letting any such\nvehicles come into the city at all. Or at least,\nthe designer would have to include a highly\nconvincing demonstration that the proposed system\nwould be acceptable to the community\'s new\nconsciousness of adverse environmental and social\neffects.\nIn light of numerous administrative and\njudicial decisions in the past few years, there\ndoes appear to be a strong trend in a direction\nthat ultimately may cut the ground from under\nthe whole rationale of commuting -- to live at a\ndistance from one\'s work. Higher income taxes\non commuters, suggestions for confiscatory parking fees, and readiness to block off streets to\nautomobile traffic are examples. However, these\nare minor when compared to the implications of\nrecent examples of the increasing readiness of\nFederal administratorF and judges to intervene in\nthe labor market and in the provision of municipal\nservices in behalf of minorities. There is a\ngrowing readiness to consider the actual percentages of identifiable groups (blacks, SpanishAmerican surnames, American lndiars, etc.) that\nare resident in given areas and to correlate these\nnumbers with their relative access to jobs. Pacts\nin the construction industry, for example, commit\nthe industry to aim for minority representation in\nthe work force "at least propgrtionace to their\npercentage in the community". Labor Department\nguidelines for minority hiring by all Federal\ncontractors suggest specific g oals and targets\nWith a\nrelated to minority pereentages.( 14 )\t\ngrowth in commitments to this attitude, it is conceivable that the courts will hold in time that, as\na matter of justice, employment by any firm in a\ncertain location must approximate the group-bygroup percenta g e makeup of the residents within\na certain distance. The ultimate impact on\ncommu t ing, provided conditions of segregation\nremain somewhat as they are now, is obvious.\nNeedless to sey, the large numbers that work\ndowntown, and the relatively limited number of\nresidences in the city at present, would act\nagainst any precipitous drop in commuting. Nevertheless, the combination of much higher transportation costs and employment restraints might be\na strong incentive to toll many suburbanites (the\nnext generation, probably) back to town and keep\nthe newly successful city dweller (of whatever\ngroup) from leaving. This reversal of the present\ntrend away from the city would operate more positively and with more acceptance and approbation if\nit were assisted by job use of residence space and\nwith place-of-residence negotiations based on\ndoor to door pay.\n\nWalk to W \xc2\xad rk\nPlace-of-residence negotiations would\nnecessarily be drawn out over many years because\nof the inertia in construction of new residcnces\nIn the city (or remodeling of many that are now\nbeing abandoned) and the fact that millions of\npeople are involved. (Door to door pay would\naffect every member of the work force, not merely\nthose white collar em p loyees that can do some of\ntheir work remotely as tabulated in Figure 1.)\nThe dynamic changE toward a complex balance among\nthe distances of the employees\' residences from\nthe office, the cost of commuting, and the\nInfluence of whatever factors (economic, social,\nand cultural) causr the office to be in its particular location perhaps could be simulated,\nusing existing techniques of urban economics,\nurban dynamics, and business location analysis.\nIn any case, the employer would want to have the\nbulk of his emp loyees as close as possible,\npreferably within close walking distance. Suddenly,\neconomic logic would be ,joined to the social\nbenefits of mergi,.Z office and residential construction. Making it possible to live close\nenough to -calk to one\'s central work location\nwould su_ie:ly become a major goal of city planners\nand construction firms (the latter in part because\nless office space would be needed). As Mayor\nLindsay says of the Battery Park development:\n"The walk-to-work principle Is very important.. "(1>)\nIn actual p ractice, the remote work, system\nwould be more comr\n_.iex than we can fully hypothesize at present. New businesses might develop; to\noperate neighborhood remote work centers, for\nexample. New o ffice techniques would evolve; for\nexample, there almost certainly would be an\naccelerated trend to replace written records by\nelectronic characters in computer storage and\ndisplay, or by oral messages switched to home tape\nrecorders. A more rational distribution of work\nand residences is strongly indicated, including\nperhaps the location of more work where people\nneed it. Architects would evolve new designs\nappropriate to human value in a combined workresidence culture. Certainly some options -ffer\nthe hope of returning the e. n tral city to one with\na better mix of income levels, of improving city\ntransportation by \'insisting on its ra t ional purpose of moving people when they really need moving\nand not when they don\'t, i.e., for\'daily commuting,\nand, above all, of reversing the trend toward the\ndisappearance of lire in the city.\nProgram Development\nWhatever the potential of this new direction\nin applying technology with social awareness, we\nmust realize that it will not be realized unless a\ncontinuity of effort Is assured and an effective\npolicy-formulation procese is established. Professional societies concerned with urban tcehnolugy\ncould contribute by including in their future\nmeetings sessions devoted to alternatives to\ncommuting.
