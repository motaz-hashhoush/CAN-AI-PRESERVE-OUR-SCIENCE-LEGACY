This simultaneous four-band receiving capability is a unique feature of the\nKVG system. The KVG has started o\xef\xac\x83cially in October 2008. A new geodetic VLBI station will be\nconstructed at Sejong city (about 120 km south of Seoul and about 20 km north-northwest of Daejeon)\nand construction of all systems will be completed in 2011.\n\n1. Introduction\nThis paper describes the state of the geodetic VLBI station project in Korea which is carried\nout by the National Geographic Information Institute (NGII). We focus on the overall status rather\nthan give technical explanations. Firstly, we give information about NGII such as vision and main\nmission. Secondly, the state of the Korea VLBI system for Geodesy (KVG) is explained. Finally,\nwe talk about the development direction and future plans.\n\n2. Korean Geodetic Datum\n2.1. About NGII\nThis section gives an introduction to NGII. NGII is tasked with establishing surveying standards\nand implementing surveying policies in Korea. More speci\xef\xac\x81cally, NGII\xe2\x80\x99s tasks are to:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 maintain the national control points,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 produce a national base map,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 construct a national geo-spatial database,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 publish the geographic book and land survey results,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 operate geographical names committee,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 develop surveying and GIS technology, and\nIVS 2010 General Meeting Proceedings\n\n95\n\nHyunhee Ju et al.:\n\nStatus of the Geodetic VLBI Station in Korea\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 strengthen the relationship with overseas organizations.\nNGII consists of six divisions under the President. These divisions are Planning & Policy,\nGeneral Service, Geodesy, Geospatial Imagery Information & Photogrammetry, Geographic Information, and National Land Information Survey division, employing a total of 103 civil servants.\nThe directors in each division work with high technology equipment for geodesy, photogrammetry,\ncartography, and print and computerized management systems. Figure 1 shows an organizational\nchart of NGII.\n\nFigure 1. Organization of NGII\n\n2.2. History of the Korean Geodetic Datum\nA locally de\xef\xac\x81ned datum was used as Korean Geodetic Datum until 2002. It was realized through\nBessel coordinates by carrying out astronomical surveys from 1981 to 1985. As the geodetic\nreference system of Korea was changed to geocentric in 2003, the Korean geodetic datum was\nredetermined accurately based on GPS and VLBI measurements. To maintain a Korean geodetic\nreference network, NGII has maintained 68 GPS stations continuously observing since 2000, 16,400\ntriangulation points, and 7,000 BMs, and it provided and published accurate coordinates and\nheights.\n\n3. The State of the Korea VLBI System for Geodesy\n3.1. Overview of the KVG Project\nThe \xef\xac\x81rst Korean VLBI experiment was done between NGII (National Geographic Information\nInstitute, Korea) and GSI (Geographical Survey Institute, Japan) in 1995 using a 3.8-m mobile\nantenna at the Korean end. Step by step, the KVG project was proceeding. After that, the Korea\nVLBI system for Geodesy (KVG) started o\xef\xac\x83cially in October 2008. Construction of all systems\nwill be completed in 2011.\nAjou University, High Gain Antenna Co., Ltd, and GigaLane Co., Ltd, are involved in a domestic collaboration in the project. NICT (National Institute of Information and Communications\n96\n\nIVS 2010 General Meeting Proceedings\n\nHyunhee Ju et al.:\n\nStatus of the Geodetic VLBI Station in Korea\n\nTechnology) and GSI participate as international partners. Figure 2 shows an overview of the KVG\nproject.\n\nFigure 2. Overview of the KVG project.\n\n3.2. Antenna Site\nA new geodetic VLBI station for the KVG project will be constructed at Sejong city, which is\nlocated about 120 km south of Seoul and about 20 km north-northwest of Daejeon. Three VLBI\nantennas at Seoul, Ulsan, and Jeju are for a radio astronomical project, which is called KVN.\nSejong is located within the triangle formed by the KVN stations. Figure 3 shows the location of\nthe KVG antenna and the KVN antenna sites.\n\nFigure 3. Location of the KVG system.\n\nIVS 2010 General Meeting Proceedings\n\n97\n\nHyunhee Ju et al.:\n\nStatus of the Geodetic VLBI Station in Korea\n\nFigure 4 shows a bird\xe2\x80\x99s eye view of the KVG antenna site.\n\nFigure 4. Bird\xe2\x80\x99s eye view of the KVG site.\n\n3.3. System Outline\nConstruction of the antenna is carried out by High Gain Antenna Co., Ltd. This company\nalso built part of the antennas of the KVN project in a domestic collaboration. The type of the\nantenna is Cassegrain. The KVG antenna will look similar to the KVN antennas after completion.\nThe receiver is designed to be able to receive 2, 8, 22, and 43 GHz bands simultaneously. This\nchoice was made in order to be able to carry out geodetic VLBI observations with the current\ngeodetic VLBI stations equipped with 2/8 GHz receivers and also with the KVN stations that will\nbe equipped with 22/43 GHz receivers in the future. This is an outstanding feature of the KVG\nsystem, distinguishing it from other geodetic VLBI stations. Figure 5 summarizes the speci\xef\xac\x81cations\nof the KVG system. The unique features of the KVG system and its optics are shown in Figure 6.\nThe development of the backend system progressed in close cooperation with NICT. The backend system consists of two parts. The down converter, phase-calibration-signal generation system,\nand E/O transmission system will be installed in the antenna cabin. The IF selector, PC-based\nformatter and recorder, frequency standard, and software correlator will be installed in the observation building. The color of the equipment indicates a progress schedule.\nThe 22 and 43 GHz receiver systems, as well as the K5/VSSP32 and S/X down converter, are\nshown in Figure 7. Figure 8 shows a block diagram of the backend system.\n\n4. Conclusions\nThe Korea VLBI system for Geodesy (KVG) has o\xef\xac\x83cially started in October 2008. Construction of all systems will be completed in 2011. We believe that the KVG system will play an\nimportant role for the Korea Geodetic Datum. Furthermore, we hope to become an IVS Network\nStation, and we look forward to exchanging information with IVS partners.\n\n98\n\nIVS 2010 General Meeting Proceedings\n\nHyunhee Ju et al.:\n\nStatus of the Geodetic VLBI Station in Korea\n\nFigure 5.
