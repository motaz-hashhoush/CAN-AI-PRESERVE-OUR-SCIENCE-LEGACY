It was determined if any technical, economic, or performance benefits could be gained by introducing intersatellite links into a domestic satellite communication network. Several key systems issues of domestic ISL's are addressed. These include the effect of a skewed traffic distribution on the selection of ISL satellite orbit locations, tolerable satellite spacing, and crosslink traffic-handling requirements. An ISL technology assessment is made by performing a parametric link analysis for several microwave and optical implementations. The impact of the crosslink on the end-to-end link performance is investigated for both regenerative and nonregenerative ISL architectures. A comparison is made between single satellite systems operating at C-, and Ku-bands and the corresponding ISL systems in terms of ground segment cost, space segment cost, and net link performance. Results indicate that ISL's can effectively expand the CONUS orbital arc, with a 60 GHz ISL implementation being the most attractive.", "title": "Application of intersatellite links to domestic satellite systems", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T19:52:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19860044842, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Ponchak, D.
