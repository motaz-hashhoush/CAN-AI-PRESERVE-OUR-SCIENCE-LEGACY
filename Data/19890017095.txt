H d g e expressed the Army3 concern for promoting safety through A&R as one\nr\nof \'soldier survivability\'. Here telerobots might be used in activities rangiag from\nremoving fuses from unexploded armaments to initial engagement of an enemy.\nSafety was .is0 considered in an aspect other than human protection. In the case\ndiscusd. Dr. H o l h indicated that the one possible application of telerobotics as Is s e\nytm\nin ckctronics/semiconductor manufacture would be in clean rooms.

A consideration here\nrelated to tekrobotics is how to provide a apability for failure or fault pndiction and to\nallow n c a r - ~ t a n e o u sinterruption by the human controller.\nThe panel noted that NASA progress in telerobotics b important to the -securiW\ncategory of motivation because NASA demonsation of technology a n offer confidence to\nthose in the commercirl sector who must first minimize risk in applying automated\nsystems. NASA applications should ibo help identify those parameters of teleoperation\nentailing higher risk than others.\nproductiv& Safety and security considerations have been the most importrnt motivations\nfor the industries (i.e., nuclear and undersea) which have kd the way in telerobotics.\nHowever, these motivations may be cbsely related to productivity, and it was interesting\nto find that the panel emphasized incread productivity in considering tekrobotics for\ncommercial applications. This agrees with the needs for automation in s p a a described in\nthe original report by the NASA Advanced Technology Advisory Committee, \'Advancing\nAutomation and Robotics Technology for the Spra Station and for the U S Economy\'\n(NASA Technical Memorandum 87566).
