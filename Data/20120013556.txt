A temporal rate of alga growth from one stage to the\n5 next stage is estimated, and this rate is correlated with accumulated time, t\xe2\x80\x94t0, to allow an estimate of sensitivity of\naccumulated lipid content with a time for cut-off of alga\ngrowth.\nIn a fourth embodiment, one or more relevant environmen10 tal parameters (light intensity, light wavelength, temperature,\niron content, etc.) is varied for the alga, and a time At(hours)\nrequired for the algae to progress from an initial stage to a\nspecified "end stage" is determined, based on variation of the\nparameters one at a time. The inverse 1/At(hours) is taken to\n15 represent an average growth rate of the algae. A particular\ncombination of environmental parameter values is identified\nfor which the average growth rate is greatest (1/At(hours) is\nsmallest).\n20\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\nIn many approaches to production of fuels, nutraceuticals\nand other useful products by growth and conversion of algae\nproducts, a growth stage of alga in a controlled environment\nmust be evaluated, for purposes of estimation of lipid contant\nand for other metrics. It is often very inaccurate to estimate\nalga growth stage based only on time of growth, because of\nvariations in important environmental parameters during different growth cycles.\nWhat is needed is a more accurate approach that does not\ndepend solely on time of growth and that implicitly factors in\nthe variable environmental parameters and provides a useful\nerror estimate for alga growth stage. Preferably, the approach\nshould implicitly or explicitly take account of the environmental history of growth of the alga.\n\n25\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n40\n\nThese needs are met by the invention, which provides a\nmethod using selective modification of light in different\nwavelength ranges to estimate (i) alga growth stage and (ii)\nalga growth rate in an ambient fluid (e.g., air, vacuum, fresh\nwater, marine water and/or brine). In a first embodiment,\nabsorption of light is measured for a beam, having a specified\nlight intensity in each of two or more specified narrow wavelength ranges of light, (n=1, 2, ... , N; N?3).\nOptionally, light absorption is compensated for absorption of\nlight in the same wavelength range by the ambient medium\n(vacuum or a specified fluid). The net absorption of light in N\nwavelength ranges (N?3) is compared with a reference set of\nnet absorption values for the alga for different growth stages.\nAn algorithm is applied to differences between measured net\nabsorption values and reference net absorption values to estimate a growth stage (one of a discrete sequence of growth\nstages). Compensation for light reflection from a liquid (absent alga) is similar.\nIn a second embodiment, lipid content of the alga is measured or estimated at each of a selected set of growth stages.\nIn some algae, the lipid content increases to a maximum, and\nthe lipid content thereafter reaches a plateau. In some other\nalgae, the lipid content increases to a maximum and thereafter\ndecreases to a lower value, indicating that the alga growth\nprocess should be terminated at some time in order to accumulate the largest lipid content from that alga.\n\n30\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\nFIG.1 schematically illustrates an experimental set-up for\npracticing an embodiment of the invention.\nFIG. 2 is a flow chart of a procedure for practicing the\ninvention.\nFIGS. 3-8 are graphical illustrations of alga absorption\nversus wavelength for selected algae.\nFIGS. 9-10 are graphical illustrations comparing alga\nspecitic mass and alga lipid content versus alga growth time.\nDESCRIPTION OF BEST MODES OF THE\nINVENTION\n\n35\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\nFIG. 1 schematically illustrates a system 11 for practicing\nthe invention. A specified alga AL is suspended in a chamber\n12 in an ambient fluid medium 13 (vacuum, air, fresh water,\nmarine water, a specified gas or vapor at a specified pressure,\netc.), where the chamber 12 has first and second windows (or,\noptionally, a single wraparound window), 14-1 and 14-2, that\nface each other and that are substantially transparent throughout a range of wavelengths, X(lower)-X-X(upper), that\nincludes the wavelengths of interest. A light beam 15, preferably filtered to transmit light in only one of a sequence of N\nwavelength ranges, (n=1, ... , N; N?3), illuminates the alga AL through the first widow 14-1. Light not\nmodified by the alga and not absorbed (or reflected) by the\nambient medium within the chamber 12 passes through the\nsecond window 14-2, or a second portion of the first window,\nand modified light is received by a light measurement mechanism 16, which sequentially or simultaneously measures light\nintensity I(n) received in the wavelength ranges X\n(n=1, ... , N; N?3)\nA computer 17 associated with the light measurement\nmechanism 16 receives the measured (modified) light intensity value I (n) for each of N wavelength ranges,\nand estimates light modification in each wavelength range of\ninterest. Optionally, the computer 17 applies a procedure to\ncompensate for light intensity modified by the ambient\nmedium (with alga absent) and by the window material in\neach wavelength range of interest,\nFor example, if a simple Beers\' law exponential absorption\nmodel is applied, the total light absorption is a sum of the\nexponential absorption factors, a(alga;n) and a(ambient;n)\nand a(window;n), for the alga and for the ambient medium\n\nUS 8,244,477 B1\n4\n\n3\nand window(s), respectively; and the net alga transmission is\nthen expressible as\nI(netn) 4(n)exp{a(ambientn)+a(window;n)}exp{a(alga;n)},\n\n(1)\n\nwith a(alga;n) replaced by a(alga refl;n) for light reflection in\nEq. (1). The factor exp{a(ambientn)+a(window;n)} is estimated in a separate experiment and is made available as a\nreference value for different algae. The computer 17 computes the net transmission I(net;n)\' and estimates net alga\nmodification in the wavelength range, Optionally, the computer 17 can estimate a volume or opaqueness\nfactor for the alga (displacement of fluid by the alga) within\nthe chamber and can further modify the alga modification\nfactor a(alga;n) to account for absence of the ambient fluid\nwherever the alga is present.\nA suitable wavelength range width for measurement of\nalga absorption may be X2\xe2\x80\x9e\xe2\x80\x94X1\xe2\x80\x9e=5-50 mu, depending upon\nthe average wavelength, IX2\xe2\x80\x9e+X1\xe2\x80\x9e}//2. Where the absorption\nfactor a(alga;n) is changing rapidly with the index n, the\nwavelength range width should be smaller; use of non-uniform widths is preferred here.\nA sequence of net absorption values {a(alga;n)}\xe2\x80\x9e for each\nof the wavelength ranges of interest is compared with a reference set of values jo#ef;n;alga growth stage g)}\xe2\x80\x9e to estimate an error, between reference value and measured value,\nfor each of G stages of growth, numbered g=1, ... , G (G? 2).\nFIGS. 3-8 illustrate a representative group of N net light\nmodification values (N=3) for different growth stages of an\nalga, Chlorella vulgaris, Chlorella (mixed species) and\nScenedesmus.\n\nOne estimate of the associated error is\n\nN\n\n(2)\n\ns(g) _ , w\xe2\x80\x9e j.(n,t; n) - a(ref ; n; growth stage g)l"(g = 1, ... , G),\nn\n\nwhere {w\xe2\x80\x9e}\xe2\x80\x9e is a sequence of selected non-negative weight\nvalues and p is a selected positive number, for example, p=1,\np=2 or p=selected rational or irrational number. The growth\nstage error values e(g) are compared with each other and with\na threshold error value e(thr). Where a particular growth stage\nerror value, e(g=g0), satisfies the conditions\ne(go)=min{e(g=1), ... , e(g - G)],\n\n(3A)\n\nE(gO) \'e(thr),\n\n(3B)\n\nthis is interpreted as indicating that the alga growth stage\ng=g0 is the most likely growth stage, based on the N measurements of alga net absorption.\nFIG. 2 is a flow chart of a procedure for practicing an\nembodiment of the invention. In step 21, an alga, having a\ngrowth stage that may be unknown, is placed in a chamber\nthat also contains an ambient fluid (liquid or gas or vacuum),\nthe chamber having one or more windows that are substantially transparent to light in a selected wavelength range R.\nIn step 22. N light beams, having initial light beam intensities Io (n) (n1, ... , N; N?2) within the wavelength subranges, respectively, within the range R, are passed through\nthe one or more chamber windows, through the ambient fluid\nand through the alga, and at least one of the ambient fluid and\nthe alga is allowed to absorb a portion of at least one of the N\nlight beams, to produce N modified light beam intensities I (n)\nthat issue from the chamber.\nIn step 23, the N modified light beam intensities are\nreceived and measured or estimated.\n\nIn step 24, the N modified light beam intensities I(n) are\ncompared with the corresponding N initial light beam intensities Io(n)\nIn step 25, N reference light beam intensities I(ref;n;g) are\n5 provided for the N wavelength ranges for each reference\ngrowth stage g (g=1, ... , G;G?2).\nIn step 26, an error value e(g) is computed, based upon\ndifferences between the N modified light beam intensities and\nthe corresponding N reference light beam intensities for each\nio of the reference alga growth stages, g=1, ... , G,\nWhen (1) the error value e(g=g0) for a particular growth\nstage, g=g0, is less than or equal to the error value e(g) for any\nother value of g and (2) the error value e(g0) is no greater than\na selected threshold error value e(thr), these conditions are\n15 interpreted, in step 27, as indicating that the alga is more\nlikely in the reference growth stage g=g0 than in any other\nreference growth stage.\nWhen (3) the error value e(g0) is greater than the selected\nthreshold error value e(thr), these conditions are interpreted,\n20 in step 28, as indicating that it cannot be determined, from\nthese conditions alone, whether the alga is more likely in a\nparticular one of the reference alga growth stages.\nIn step 29 (optional), the lipid content LC(Q of the alga is\nestimated for each of a sequence of absorption measurement\n25 times, t=t m (m=1, ... , Mo, and the estimated value LC(Q is\nassociated with the estimated alga growth stage, g=g0, determined in the preceding step. In step 30 (optional), the system\ndetermines whether the estimated lipid content LC(Q\nincreases (strictly), expressed as LC(t.,Ji?LQQ. Where\n30 the answer to the query in step 30 is "yes," the system interprets this response as indicating that the estimated lipid content does not (yet) decrease with increasing time, t=t m, and\nalga growth is allowed to continue, in step 31 (optional).\nWhere the answer to the query in step 30 is "no" so that the\n35 estimated lipid content is no longer increasing (strictly)\nmonotonically, the system interprets this response as indicating that estimated lipid content may decrease with time\nbeyond a certain growth stage. One consequence of this last\ninterpretation is that alga growth should be terminated, in step\n40 32 (optional), before growth continues, in order to maximize\nlipid content that may be extracted from the alga.\nCertain algae, when fully grown, have a relatively high\nlipid content and can be used as a feedstock for extraction of\nbiofuels, diesel fuels, nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals, fertil45 izer, animal feed and other useful products. Algae to which\nthe invention has been applied to evaluate alga growth stage\nand alga lipid content include Chlorella vulgaris, Chlorella\n(mix) and Scenedusmus.\nFIGS. 3 and 4 are graphical illustrations of measured\n5o absorption a(alga;n) in Chlorella vulgaris versus wavelength\nX(mu) for a wavelength range of about 300 nm: ~~X~ 750 nm at\nfour days growth (FIG. 3) and at nine days growth (FIG. 4).\nThe following differences are observed between FIGS. 3 and\n4: (1) a local maximum in absorption value at X-370 nm for\n55 four days growth is larger than the corresponding peak for\nnine days growth; (2) a local minimum in absorption at X-390\nmu for four days growth has a larger value than the corresponding absorption minimum value for nine days growth;\n(3) the maximum absorption value (at X-400 mu) for nine\n6o days growth is larger than the corresponding absorption peak\nfor four days growth; (4) a local minimum absorption value\n(at X-420 mu) has a higher value for nine days growth than\nthe corresponding local minimum absorption value for four\ndays growth; (5) a local maximum absorption value (at X-700\n65 mu) for four days growth has a higher value than the corresponding local maximum absorption value for nine days\ngrowth.\n\nUS 8,244,477 B1\n5\nFIGS. 5 and 6 are graphical illustrations of measured\nabsorption a(alga;n ) in Chlorella (mixed species ) versus\nwavelength X(mu) for a wavelength range of about 300\nnm<X<750 nm at growth stage four days growth (FIGS. 5)\nand 16 days growth (FIG. 6). The following differences are\nobservedbetween FIGS. 5 and 6: (1) a local absorption maximum (at X-380 mu) for 16 days growth is more pronounced\nthan the corresponding peak at four days growth; (2) a subsequent minimum absorption value (at X =395 nm) for 16 days\n-395\ngrowth is larger than a corresponding minimum absorption\nvalue for four days growth; (3) the wavelength for the minimum value in (2) for 16 days growth is shifted relative to the\nwavelength for the corresponding minimum value for four\ndays growth; (4) the maximum absorption peak (at X-470\nmu) for 16 days growth is larger than the corresponding\nmaximum absorption peak for four days growth; (5) a subsequent local absorption maximum value ( at X-520 mu) for 16\ngays growth is larger than the corresponding peak for four\ndays growth; ( 6) a local minimum value for absorption (at\nX-680 mu) for four days growth has disappeared at 16 days\ngrowth; and (7) a local maximum absorption peak (at X-710\nmu) for four days growth is larger than the corresponding\nlocal maximum absorption peak for 16 days growth.\nFIGS . 7 and 8 are graphical illustrations of measured\nabsorption a(alga;n ) in Scenedesmus versus wavelength\nX(nm) for a wavelength range of about 300 nm: ~~X~ 750 nm at\ngrowth stage seven days growth (FIG. 7) and 15 days growth\n(FIG. 8). The following differences are observed between\nFIGS. 7 and 8: (1) a local maximum absorption value (at\nX-380 mu) for 15 days growth is larger than the corresponding local maximum value for seven days growth; (2) a local\nminimum absorption value (at X-395 mu) for 15 days growth\nis larger than the corresponding local minimum value for\nseven days growth ; (3) the maximum absorption value (at\nX-480 mu) for 15 days growth is larger than the corresponding maximum absorption value for seven days growth; (4) a\nlocal minimum absorption value (at X-500 mu ) for 15 days\ngrowth is larger than the corresponding minimum value for\nseven days growth ; ( 5) a local maximum absorption value (at\nX-500 mu) for 15 days growth is larger than the corresponding maximum value for seven days growth; and (6) a local\nmaximum absorption value (at X-690 mu) for seven days\ngrowth is larger than the corresponding maximum value for\n15 days growth, where this local maximum value has nearly\n\ndisappeared.\nOne or more of five factors contributes to absorption graph\ndifferences between two or more distinct alga growth stages:\n(i) differences in (local or absolute ) absorption maximum\nvalues; (ii) differences in wavelength value for the (local or\nabsolute ) absorption maximum values; (iii) differences in\nlocal absorption minimum values; (iv) differences in wavelength value for the local absorption minimum values; and (v)\nappearance of a prominent feature (e.g., maximum or minimum absorption value ) at one growth stage that is absent at\nanother growth stage. Reflection graph differences between\ntwo alga growth stages arise from: (i) appearance or disappearance of a prominent reflection feature at a growth stage\nand (ii) reflectivity differences at different growth stages.\nFIGS. 9 and 10 graphically illustrate alga mass (gms/liter)\nand percent lipid content for Chlorella vulgaris, for a bag\nfilled with City of Sunnyvale primary effluent plus CO 2 (FIG.\n9) and for a bag filled with BG-11 media plus CO Z (FIG. 10),\nversus number of days of alga growth (1-14). With reference\nto FIG. 9, the alga specific mass increases to a value of about\n15 gm/liter at about seven days growth and thereafter plateaus\nor decreases slightly, while lipid content of the alga continues\nto increase to about 22 percent at about ten days growth, and\n\n6\nthereafter decreases sharply and plateaus at a lower value of\nabout 12 percent on day 14. These responses indicate that, for\nChlorella vulgaris, in the Sunnyvale effluent, the alga should\nbe harvested shortly after the alga first achieves maximum\n5 growth in order to obtain maximum lipid content.\nWith reference to FIG. 10 the alga specific mass increases\nthrough day 12; the lipid percent increases until day 10 and\ndecreases sharply beyond day 10, when the alga specific mass\nis still increasing These responses indicate that for Chlorella\n10 vulgaris, in the BG-11 media, the alga should be harvested\nbefore or shortly after the alga first achieves maximum\ngrowth, in order to obtain maximum lipid content. Delaying\nthe harvest beyond about nine or ten days growth will result in\nreduced total lipid content. The differences inn the lipid con15 tent response in FIGS . 9 and 10 indicate that lipid growth may\ndepend upon the particular alga and upon the alga growth\nmedium,\nFrom FIGS. 9 and 10, one notes that the rate of alga growth\nvaries substantially with its present " age," and accurate pre2o diction of ultimate (saturated) specific mass of the alga is\nprobably not possible. However, one can estimate a present\nrate of alga growth , using two or three rates at preceding times\nas a predictor. When the estimated present rate of growth is\nbelow a specified threshold (e.g., 2-4 gm/liter/day), one can\n25 conclude that alga growth saturation is near and treat the\ncurrent state of the alga as an end state.\nEstimated lipid content associated with the alga growth at\nan alga harvest time can also be optimized by the following\nprocedure. The rate of alga growth at each of the sequence of\n30 measurement times, t=t m, is estimated as follows. For three\nmeasurement times, t=t m_ 1 , tm, and tm+l, with tm_ 1 <tl <t m+l\nthe quadratic function\n,\n\n,\n\n.\n\n,\n\nQ(t m-1, m, m+1,)LC(m-1) (t- m)(t- _,1A m-1- m)\n(m-1- m+1)+LC(m)\n35\n\n(m - m+1)+LC(m+i)\n( m+1 - m)\n\n(4)\n\nreproduces the lipid content values LC(t__) (x=-1, 0, +1) at\nthe respective time values t=t m_x. The time derivative of Q(t\ntm_ 11 tm, tm+l, at the intermediate time value, t=t m), is\n)\n\n40\n\ntm+,)+LC(m) (2 m - m-i - m+i)/(m - m-i)(m tm+,)+LC(m+,) (t- __1A m--tm-1)(tm+1- m)-\n\n(5)\n\nWhenthe lipid content growthrate {3Q/3t}, t_ is negative, is\n45 zero, or is positive but small relative to preceding values of the\nlipid content growth rate, alga growth should be terminated\nand the alga (and associated lipid content should be harvested at a time contemporaneous with the alga termination\ntime t(term). A computer can be programmed to compute the\n50 quantity 13Q/3tj, at each of the measurement times, t=t m,\nand to determine when to terminate alga growth.\nWhat is claimed is:\n1.
