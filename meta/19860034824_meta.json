These complements are evolved in such a way that the DDL payloads can be left intact between flights. This requires the dedication of flight hardware to specific payloads on a long-term basis and raises the concern that the purchase of additional flight hardware will be required to implement the DDL program. However, the payoff is expected to result in significant savings in mission engineering and assembly effort. A study has been conducted recently to quantify both the requirements for new hardware and the projected mission cost savings. It was found that some incremental additions to the current inventory will be needed to fly the mission model assumed. Cost savings of $2M to 6.5M per mission were projected in areas analyzed in depth, and additional savings may occur in areas for which detailed cost data were not available.", "title": "Spacelab dedicated discipline laboratory (DDL) utilization concept", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T19:12:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19860034824, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Wunsch, P."}, "organization": {"name": "Teledyne Brown Engineering", "location": "Huntsville, AL, United States"}}, "id": "0ba706b51c0849d48855446fb565fe45"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19860034824, "meta": {"author": {"name": "De Sanctis, C."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Marshall Space Flight Center", "location": "Huntsville, AL, United States"}}, "id": "0eb8c48eea984fdfb8281167f653ab1b"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19860034824, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19860034824, "id": "b1218bfd581749079ec54b15892d7ee1", "publicationDate": "1984-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
