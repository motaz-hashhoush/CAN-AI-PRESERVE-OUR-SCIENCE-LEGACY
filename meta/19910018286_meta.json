Drought prone Mexico provides an excellent case to study how technological and social changes alter the impact of drought on food and agricultural system. A goal is to document and understand how relationships between climate and agriculture in Mexico have changed in the last fifty years. The results for several locations will be interpreted in light of the prospects of regional climate change due to global warming. This analysis will be complimented by four case studies of vulnerability to drought which will use local records and interviews to try and show how environmental, technological, and social changes may have altered the impacts of climate on local agricultural systems.", "title": "Climate and society in 20th century Mexico", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T14:43:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19910018286, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Liverman, Diana M."}, "organization": {"name": "Pennsylvania State Univ.", "location": "University Park, PA, United States"}}, "id": "c210212f6a464144b13572ae8465b554"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19910018286, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19910018286, "id": "a875eb45ae114d3c8b44aefc3a8e6863", "publicationName": "An Assessment of NASA Master Directory(Catalog Interoperability for Interdisciplinary Study of the Global Water Cycle", "publicationDate": "1991-05-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19910018283, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "An assessment of NASA master directory/catalog interoperability for interdisciplinary study of the global water cycle", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19910018286.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19910018286/downloads/19910018286.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19910018286/downloads/19910018286.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19910018286/downloads/19910018286.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
