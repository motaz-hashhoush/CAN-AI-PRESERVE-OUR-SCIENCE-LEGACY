The majority of them are famiiiar nith the concept of the Schuler\npendulum. However, the fact that the period of both is identical to the period of lour earth orbit (LEO)\nsatellites and to the period of the oscillatory change of the relative location of two adjacent LEO satellites is\nnot widely known in the INS community, if at all It is also not widely known that %.henthe INS is installed\non a LEO satellite traversing a near-circular orbit, the INS error equations are the same as the HillClohessy-Wiltshire equations that describe the change of the relative location of two adjacent LEO\nsatellites. On the other hand, orbital mechanics professionals are well aware of the orbital period of LEO\nsatellites and the equations of their relatifve motioq but in general they are unfamiliar aith the Schuler\npendulum and Schuler oscillations in INS:and thus are unaware of the identity between all four periods. In\nthis paper we esamine the four phenomena; namely: the Schuler pendulum, Schuler oscillations, the LEO\nsatellite orbital period, and the period of the relative motion between two adjacent LEO satellites. In\nparticular we show- why the LEO satellite\xe2\x80\x99s orbital yenod is identical to the well-known INS Schuler\nperiod. We also show that if the INS error equations are generalized to a non-terrestrial case, a generalized\nform of the Schder oscillation exists, which takes the form of the Hill-Clohessy-Wiltshiie equations for\nsatellite relative motion.\n\nSCHULER PENDULUM\nIn a 1923 paper [l],while claiming that INS could not be realized because \xe2\x80\x9cdifferentiation bekveen the\nforce of graviq and acceleration is impossible\xe2\x80\x9d, the German Physicist, Masimilian Schuler, explained that\nif one can build a pendulum that has the length of the earth\xe2\x80\x99s radius then one could move at will the\npendulum point of support and still have the pendulum point in the direction of the vertical. (Schuler\nexplained that this stemned from the fact that the center of mass of the apparatus remained at the center of\n\nSenior Aerospace Engineer;Flight Dynamics Analysis Branch, Mission Engineering and System\nAnalysis Dnision, Code 595, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD 20771.

It is vers; well h o w that,\n\nT,,, the period of such inatheinatical pendulum, is\n\ngiven by\n7\n\nTp=:i2\n.\nwhere R is the radius of the earth, and g is its grayity.\n\nSCHZTLER OSCILLATIONS IN Jk3 ERROR PROPAGATION\nThe simplest i k y to describe the generation of oscillations in INS is to esanline the behavior of a\nstable-platform INS i response to tilt error.\nn\nFor siniplicity, consider a stable-platform INS where the platfonn control systein is programmed\nto keep the platform horizontal with one of the platfonn axes, say the x-axis, pointing north, the y-axis\npointing east and the z-axis pointing i the direction ofthe local nadir. Consequently the preferred platform\nn\ncoordinate system is the North, East, and Down system. Suppose that there is a platfonn tilt error, denoted\nby cp, about the platform North-axis (see Fig. 1). A a result the East accelerometer reads gravity as\nS\nacceleration coinponent f = -g. sin cp (the sign is negative because the acceleroineter reads raiiity as\nacceleration in the opposite direction). The INS computer is set to integrate this iiieasured f to obtain\nvelociq. Thus the computed East velocity is the integral off, in other words,\n\nFig. 1: Generation of Miss-lwel Error in a Stable Platform INS.\n\nUsually cp z 0, therefore we can l i t e\n\nv = -0cp\nJ\nIn order to keep the platform level, the platform control system rotates the platforni about the North axis by\nthe angular rate v / R ,thus\n@.--\n\nv\n\nR\n\n.\nDifferentiation of the last equation and substitution of 0 froin Eq. (2.b) into the resultant equation yields\n\n,\nThe last equation is that of a harmonic oscillator whose period, T\n\n,is given by\n\nThis period, known as Sclider period, is well known in Inertial Navigation technology. A comparison\nbetween Eqs. (5) and (1) reveals that\n\nT\n,\n\n= T,\n\nIt is only ironical that this period, a characteristic feature of INS, is named after Scliuler who maintained\nthat the construction of INS was \xe2\x80\x9can entirely impossible undertaking\xe2\x80\x9d [I 21.\n~\n\nLEO SATELLITE ORBITAL PERIOD\nConsider a LEO satellite on a circular orbit at the surface of a hypothetical perfectly smooth\nairless earth. In order to be in orbit the satellite has to travel at the orbital velocity where the csntrifugal\nacceleration balances gravity. That is, the orbital velocity, ,has to satisfy the relation\n\nv\n\nv?\n\n-=u\n\nR\n\n\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nthus\n\nV=&E\nThe distance covered after one orbit is the circumference of ea& which is 21iR . Therefore w i t e :\n\nVT, = 2xR\n\n(9)\n\nTobeing the duration of one revolution. Substituting V from Eq. (8) into the last espression yields\n\nIt means that the orbital period also equals the Schuler period!\nThis can also be shown in the following way. It is well known that the Keplerian parameter,\nalso ho\\vn as Mean Motion, is given by\n\nn,\n\nbut\n\nwhere R is the rector of earth radius from the center of earth to the satellite, and 1 is a unit vector in the\n,\ndirection of tliis vector. therefore\n\nFroin Eqs. (12) and (14) we obtain\n7\n\nand since n = 2n:/To, obtain\nwe\ne\n\nd%\n\nTO=2r which is the Schuler period.\n\nGEhXR4LIZATION OF TKE: SCRLTLER OSCILLATION IN D T SERROR PROPAG-4TION\nThe above derivation uses a siinplified scalar INS error model to describe the Schuler oscillation\n\nThis section generalizes that eqlanation to the vector case. It then shows how the generalized form of the\nINS error equations results in Hill\'s equations.\nThe INS senses a specific force, f , consisting of the true acceleration, and the acceleration of\ngravi@>g ,where the latter is interpreted 2s a negative acceleration, thus:\n\nf =a-g(R,)\n\n(17)\n\nR,.\n\nThe INS accelerometer ineasurenient, f, , is\n\nwhere gravity is a vector function of the true position,\n\ncorrupted by bias (among other errors neglected here), Fa thus:\n~\n\nAs a result, the INSreconstruction of the true acceleration is as follo~~~s:\n\n(19 . 4\nwhere\n\nR, is the computed position vector. Using Eq. (1 8) the last equation becomes\n\n+ 6a\n\n(19.b)\n\n+ 6R) - g (R,)]\n\nfl ?.c)\n\na, = a - g(Rt) i\ng(R,)\n\n:\n.\nwhere 6R =\n\na, = a +Fa t m(R,\n\nR, - R, . Then using a truncated Taylor series expansion yields\n4\n\ng(R,)\n\n+$I\n\n6R - n(n.)] -+ ...\n\n(19.d)\n\nOR R,\n\nConsequently\n\n(19.e)\n\nTherefore, to coinpute its position, the INS perfonns the following integration:\n\nR, = ija, dt dt = jJ(a\nwhere\n\nG(R,) = 2g/ 5RI\n\n.\n\n+ Fa +G(R,)FR + ...)dt d t\n\nSince (see aq. 13)\n\nRl\n\nwhere 1 = [0\n,\n\nT .\n\n0 1 I t can be shown in a straightfonvard manner that\n3\n~\n\n0\n\nG(r)=-L(I-31Rl:)\nR\nIn reality, the true position is\n\nR, = Jjacltdt\nTo get a differential equation for the INS errors, insert Eq. (23) into Zq. (20) to get\n\nR, = R,\n\n+iJ(\nSa+G(R,)GR+ ...)dtdt\n\n(24)\n\nand differentiate Eq. (24) with respect to an inertial frame. This yields\n\nR, = R , + s ~ + G ( R , ) G R +\n...\nwhich, using the definition of\n\n6R ,can be witten as:\nSR - G ( R , ) ~ R 6a + ...\n=\n\nSubstitution of G(R,) froni Eq.

(27) becomes\n\n6R+&[1 1 -2]FR=6a\nR\n\n(29)\n\nThe horizontal; that is, the x and y components of Eq. (29) form harmonic oscillators, with a natural\nfrequency given by the square root of the scalar coefficient of the gravity gradient, and a corresponding\nperiod\n\nT =2\n,\n7\nc ,which is identical to the espression given in Eq. (5).\nm\n\nTHE PERIOD OF HILL\'S EQUATION\nConsider a LEO satellite in the vicinity of another LEO satellite. We name the f i t satellite\nPrimary Satellite (Ps) and the second Secondary Safellife (SQ. Define an orbital coordinate system whose\norigin is in the PS. Its x-asis is in the direction of the satellite zenith, ths y-axis is in the direction of the\nsatellite Telocity vector, and the z-axis is nonnal to the orbital plane on the side that completes the set to a\nright-hand coordinate system (see Fig. 2). The differential equations that describe the relative displaceinent\nof the 5 with respect to the PS in this coordinate system are known as Hill\'s equations or Clohessy"\nWiltshire equations [3]. In the absence of external forces these equations are:\n\n7\n\nPrimary Satellite\n\ny Secondary Satellite\n\n* .\n\nFig. 3 The Orbital Coordinate System for Relative LEO.

It has been shown [3]that\n\n6\n\n(30.b)\n(30.c)\nQ\n\n(for the z-component this is\n\n(we approsimate here the radius of the circular orbit by the earth radius) and as we saw before, T, the\nperiod that corresponds to such angular frequency is\n\nIn fact it is easy to see without mathematical deyelopments that this is the period of the z component. For\nsimplicity assunie that the orbit of the PS is circular and that the initial conditions on the x. y: and z\ncomponents, and their derivatives are as follows S, = So = J\', = 9, = 0, z, = 0 , z, f 0.Then the\norbit of the SS is also a circular orbit that intersects the orbit of the PS mice in an orbit as shown in Fig. 3.\nObviously the distance\nA\n\nx\n\nt=to=O\n\nSecondary Satellite\nFig. 3: The Relative Location of the Secondary Satellite with Respect to\nthe Primary Satellite along the z-axis.\n\nbetween the two satellites changes direction once on every orbit and the frequency at which this happens is\nthe orbital frequency which, in the preceding section, was found to be the Schiller frequency.\n\nEXTENSION OF THE rns ERROR EQUATIONS TO NOWTERRESTRIAL MECHAPJTZATLON\nIf we consider an INS installed on a sateIlite circling the earth in a near-circular orbit, and if\nEq. (26) is Written in a local-Tiertical Iocal-horizontal frame, Ilill\'s Equations result. To see this, consider\nthe following general INS position error equation [4]:\n\nx 6R +arx (0\' x 6R) - G(R)GR\n\nwhere\n\n= Aa\n\n~\n\nxf\n\n(33.a)\n\naris the angular velocity of framer ulth respect to an inertial frame, and the pre-superscripts of the\n\nd/dt operator indicate the frame in which the derivative is taken. The vectors Aa and\n\ndenote,\n\nrespectilvely, the acceleroineter errors and the angular error caused by the g r o errors which are denoted by\nthe vector E . (The latter errors are known as \xe2\x80\x98psi\xe2\x80\x99 errors). The \xe2\x80\x98psi\xe2\x80\x99 angular error develop according to [4]\n\n\xe2\x80\x98d\n\n--yS+o\xe2\x80\x99 x w = &\ndt\n\n(33.b)\n\nAt rest on earth 0 contributes a 24 hour oscillatory mode in the propagation of\n\xe2\x80\x98\n\nterm\n\n-w x f\n\nw ,nrhich througll the\n\non the right side of Eq. (33.a) contniutes this mode to the propagation of\n\n6R . In our case of\n\na LEO satellite Wr is the orbital angular velocity at which the satellite orbits the earth, and accordbig to\nEq. (1 I ) the orbital pcriod corresponding to Oris esactly the Schuler period. As a result, the oscillatory\nmode in the \xe2\x80\x98psi\xe2\x80\x98 angular error has a Schuler period rather than a 24 hour period. Because c?)* 1s constant\nthen the third term on fhe left of Eq. (33 a) drops, and so is the tern1 -\\v X f on the right side of Eq. (33.a)\nbecause in orbit\n\nf = 0 .Therefore, if we consider only accelerometer bias, Eq. (33.a) becomes.\n\n(33 .c)\nwhere, as before, 6a ,is a vector whose three components are the components of the threc corresponding\naccelerometer biases. Let us denote the inagnitude of\n\nEq. 15)\n\nxi2\n\nO\xe2\x80\x98\n\nby n, that is\n\nn\xe2\x80\x99=\n\nI I . In a circular orbit (see\n\n= g / R ,so Eq.

We conclude that When on a circular orbit, the\nINS position error due to accelerometer bias behaves like the relative position between two adjacent\nsalclliles on low earth orbit.

Moreover, the \xe2\x80\x98psi\xe2\x80\x99 angular error too has a Schuler period, which,\nunlike in terrestrial INS, is not coupled into the INS position error.\n8\n\nRemark: In some spacecraft the INS reference coordinate systein is an inertial one. In such cases equation\nI\n\n(33.a) reduces to \xe2\x80\x98 d \\ y l d t = E where designates the inertial frame. In such cases all three of the N S\nchannels exhibit unbounded error growth due to IO drift, and the spaceflight MS must use eternal aids\nsuch as star trackers to periodically re-align its attitude.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this paper we haye presented results that may assist orbital flight dynaiiiics and attitude conttol\nsystem engineers in the design and analysis of INS-equipped spacecraft, by showing how phenomenon\nthat occur in terrestrial INS generalizes to spacecraft applications. We showed that the period of the\nSchuler pendulum, the Schuler period i INS error propagation, the LEO orbital period, and the period of\nn\nthe oscillatoIy part of the well-knom Hill-Clohessy-Wiltshire equations of LEO satellites\xe2\x80\x99 relative motion\nare identical. We have also shown that generaliizhg the INS error equations results in Hill\xe2\x80\x99s equations.\nThe satellite relative position in this case corresponds to the INS position error, thus the Schuler frequency\nthat is present in the errors of the level channels of terrestrial INS generalizes to an out-of-plane relative\nposition oscillation at the orbit frequency. Although these oscillations do not directly enter into the attitude\nerrors of a spacecraft-mounted INS, they do affect pointing of the spacecraft relative to the earth, since\ntheir effect on the navigation states corrupts the spacecraft\xe2\x80\x99s on-board computation of the local level\nreference frame. We also described how INS gyro drift produces an additional Schuler oscillation in the\nattitude error when the INS reference coordinate system is the orbital local-level system. However, when\nthe INSreference system is inertial, the attitude eshibits unbounded error growth due to gyro drift.\n\nREFE.RENCES\nSchuler, M., \xe2\x80\x9cDie St6rung von Pendel und Kreiselapparatendurch die Beschleuniprg des Fahrzeuges\n(The Disturbance of Pendulum and Gyroscope by the Acceleration of a Vehicle),\xe2\x80\x9d Physikalische\nZeitschrift, Vol. 24, July 1923, pp. 334-350.\n\n\xe2\x80\x99 MacKenzie, D., Inventing .4ccuracy: A ilisforicalSociology of h;ucleai-Adissile Guidance flnside\nTechnology),MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 1990.\n\nVallado, D.A., Fundamentals of AstroL+mnics and ApplicoSons, hkGraw-Rill, New York, 1997. pp.\n313-347.\nPinson J.C., \xe2\x80\x9cInertial Guidance for Cruise VehicIes,\xe2\x80\x9d Guidance and Control o Aerospace Vehicles,\nf\nedited by C.T.
