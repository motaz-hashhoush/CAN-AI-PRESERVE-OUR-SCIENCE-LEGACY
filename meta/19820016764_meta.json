The piston is connected to a shaft and produces work as it moves outward and inward. A displacer plate moves between an absorber plate and a cooling plate to form an air space between the displacer and one or the other of these two plates for heating and cooling the fluid. The displacer plate is moved from one plate to the other by the displacer push ring as the piston nears the midpoint of its travel on the outward stroke and again on the inward stroke.", "title": "Solar engine", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-04T14:58:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19820016764, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Jensen, R.
