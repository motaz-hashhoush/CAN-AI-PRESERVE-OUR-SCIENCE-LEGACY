The international partners of the Institute have pursued a broad program of lunar science stimulated by scientific partnerships enabled by the SSERVI community. Furthermore, regional partnerships have been formed such as the new pan-European lunar science consortium, which promises both new scientific approaches and mission concepts. International partner membership requires long-term commitment from both the partner and SSERVI, together with tangible and specific plans for scientific interaction that will produce results of mutual benefit to both the institute's U.S. Teams and the international partner. International partners are invited to participate in all aspects of the Institute's activities and programs, on a basis of no exchange of funds. Through these activities, SSERVI researchers and international partners participate in sharing ideas, information, and data arising from their respective research efforts, and contribute to the training of young scientists. This talk will present an overview of the Institute and the international nodes. We will also discuss the various processes to become a SSERVI partner as well as the opportunities available for collaborations with the SSERVI national teams.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "France", "submissionId": 20160006478, "endDate": "2015-10-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Astronomical Society", "location": "Washington, DC, United States"}}, "meetingId": "d12a0f71a778470eb015811bfb204485", "id": "6580b62876214055b45d865b8a3e1621"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Europlanet Research Infrastructure", "location": "Toulouse, France"}}, "meetingId": "d12a0f71a778470eb015811bfb204485", "id": "fa45e93357ec494c9749261bd4a1be6f"}], "name": "European Planetary Science Congress 2015", "location": "Nantes", "id": "d12a0f71a778470eb015811bfb204485", "startDate": "2015-09-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20160006478, "id": "37cdf1f1c7984e55af3611afc400e37c", "publicationDate": "2015-09-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20160006478.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20160006478/downloads/20160006478.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20160006478/downloads/20160006478.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20160006478/downloads/20160006478.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
