Subject matter experts can share exciting\nscience and science-related events as well as help to\n\xe2\x80\x9ctranslate\xe2\x80\x9d science being conducted by professionals.\nThe Expedition Earth and Beyond (EEAB) Program\n[1], facilitated by the Astromaterials Research and\nExploration Science (ARES) Division at the NASA\nJohnson Space Center, has been providing virtual access to subject matter experts through classroom connection webinars for the last five years. Each year, the\nreach of these events has grown considerably, especially over the last nine months. These virtual connections not only help engage students with role models,\nbut are also designed to help teachers address concepts\nand content standards they are required to teach.\nThese events also enable scientists and subject matter\nexperts to help \xe2\x80\x9ctranslate\xe2\x80\x9d current science in an engaging and understandable manner while actively involving classrooms in the journey of science and exploration.\nExpedition Earth and Beyond (EEAB): This\nEarth and planetary science education program is designed to inspire, engage, and educate teachers and\nstudents by getting them actively involved with NASA\nexploration, discovery, and the process of science.\nThe program provides a structure for students in\ngrades 5-12 to conduct authentic research about Earth\nand/or other planetary bodies. At least once a quarter,\nthe program provides the opportunity for students to\nengage and interact with scientists and STEM experts\nthrough classroom connection webinars.\nClassroom Connection Webinars: These online\ndistance learning events are designed to connect students and teachers across the nation with subject matter experts. Events are facilitated through the use of\nWebEx, a web-based collaborative tool. Technical\nrequirements are minimal -- an internet-connected\ncomputer and a speaker phone. As an alternative to a\nspeakerphone, participants have also utilized SKYPE\nor Google Voice. WebEx can easily connect distributed participants and allow them to be actively engaged\nas they interact with subject matter experts during\nwebinar events.\nEach webinar event, depending on presenter availability, is scheduled twice during a given week to accommodate the schedules of teachers across the nation\nand across time zones. Sessions are scheduled for one\n\nhour, however, the subject matter expert remains on\nthe line for up to an additional thirty minutes to accommodate additional questions student groups may\nhave. To ensure events capture and keep the attention\nof the participants, presentations utilize a variety of\nengaging media. This includes image-intensive slides\nwith little text, video clips, and questions for participants to interact with the presenter.\nSessions begin with introductory information including the purpose of the webinar before turning the\ncontrols over to the STEM expert. Before the main\npresentation begins, STEM experts introduce themselves providing students with insight into their career\npath. Once the presentation begins, the subject matter\nexpert not only shares their knowledge and science\ncontent, but involves participants as well. The interactive nature of the presentation enables classrooms to\nanswer questions posed by the presenter and share\ntheir observations. This enables the presenter to gain\ninsight into the prior knowledge of the participants or\nsimply allows participants to share their understanding\nof content being shared. Questions posed often include thought-provoking scenarios that ask students to\napply similar concepts scientists take into consideration when conducting their research. This enables\nparticipants to gain experience in \xe2\x80\x9cscientific thinking.\xe2\x80\x9d\nParticipants are acknowledged as they contribute feedback using the chat window.\nWebinar topics generally focus on a broad range of\nthemes such as remote sensing, comparative planetology, and planetary exploration. Topics are often chosen based on subject matter expert areas of expertise,\ncurrent and exciting events (such as Earth Day or mission milestones), and mission updates, to name a few.\nTopics and content are also geared to help teachers\naddress standards they must teach in the classroom as\nwell. The Next Generation Science Standards guide\ntoday\xe2\x80\x99s educators, and are designed to reflect a new\nvision for science education. They aim to reflect the\ninterconnected nature of science as it is practiced and\nexperienced in the real world [2]. \xe2\x80\x9cThe framework is\ndesigned to help realize a vision for education in the\nsciences and engineering in which students, over multiple years of school, actively engage in scientific and\nengineering practices and apply crosscutting concepts\nto deepen their understanding of the core ideas in these\nfields\xe2\x80\x9d [3]. This integration of knowledge and practice\nis what practicing scientists (and engineers) do on a\ndaily basis. What better way to model this than engag-\n\ning students with subject matter experts and having\nthem practice these same skills? These webinars provide students with an authentic means in which to experience scientific practices through current scientific\nresearch shared by STEM experts.\nRecent Classroom Connection Webinars: Six\nEEAB classroom connection webinar events facilitated\nfrom March through December 2014 engaged approximately 4000 students and teachers during \xe2\x80\x9clive\xe2\x80\x9d\nevents. Thousands of additional students were reached\nthrough event archives. Events focused on work being\nfacilitated from the International Space Station, updates on the Mars Science Laboratory mission, and\ncomparative planetology. Participation in each of\nthese events ranged from ~500 live participants to over\n1000 live participants. The reach of these events has\nexceeded participation from previous years\xe2\x80\x99 events and\nhas extended our reach of participants beyond our expectations. The continual growth of these events has\ndemonstrated an increase in interest in connecting and\nengaging students with subject matter experts.\nSubject matter experts that participated in these latest six events included Dr. Elizabeth Rampe, Mars\nScience Laboratory science team member; Dr. William\nStefanov, International Space Station Program Associate Scientist for Earth Observations; Dr. Lisa Vanderbloemen, oceanographer and manager of the International Space Station (ISS) Earth Science Remote\nSensing (ESRS) Unit at NASA JSC; Melissa Higgins,\nmeteorologist and earth scientist in the ISS ESRS Unit\nat NASA JSC; and Paige Graff, educational professional and Expedition Earth and Beyond program lead.\nThe diversity of expertise of each subject matter expert\nand exposure of these experts to classrooms nationwide enable students to see a range of STEM experts\nas well as experience the different personalities and\npresentation styles of each guest speaker.\nFeedback gathered from the events in addition to\nrepeat participation by classroom teachers has indicated that teachers find these connections exciting, inspiring, motivating, and extremely valuable. This is confirmed by comments such as \xe2\x80\x9cThese experiences motivate our students, promote their curiosity, and help\nthem understand the bigger picture of science,\xe2\x80\x9d and\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe thoroughly enjoyed this experience. The opportunity to engage with a real scientist working in such a\nthrilling capacity is immeasurable.\xe2\x80\x9d Teachers have\nalso indicated that these events help them address content standards they need to teach. As both students\nand teachers continually ask for more webinars, this\nreveals the overall success and interest in these types\nof connections.\nConclusions: Engaging students and teachers with\nsubject matter experts enables the excitement and story\n\nof science and exploration to come to life in classrooms across the nation. These virtual events capture\nparticipants\xe2\x80\x99 attention while increasing their science\nawareness, giving them access to subject matter experts, and reinforcing Next Generation Science Standard concepts. Classrooms no longer have to simply\nread about science in a textbook or from the internet;\nwebinars enable classrooms to interact with, engage in,\nand become part of the journey of science and exploration.\nReferences: [1] Expedition Earth and Beyond,\nhttp://ares.jsc.nasa.gov/ares/eeab/index.cfm, [2] Next Generation Science Standards (2013) Appendix A, [3] The\nNational Academies Press (2011) A Framework for K12 Science Education: Practices, crosscutting concepts, and core ideas (p10).\nAdditional Information: For additional information on Expedition Earth and Beyond and classroom\nconnection webinars, contact Paige Valderrama Graff\nat paige.v.graff@nasa.gov.\n\n'
