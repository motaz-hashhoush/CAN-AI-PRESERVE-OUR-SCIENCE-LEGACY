As used here, starting force signifies the magnetic force exerted by the actuator at one end of its stroke when the gap in its magnetic circuit is the widest. A solenoid of conventional design exerts a large force when its gap is closed. The magnetic force decreases as the gap increases. Hence, typically, the starting force exerted by a conventional solenoid is small; depending upon the specific application, the starting force may even be insufficient to initiate closure. Whereas a conventional solenoid design provides for only one core, the proposed design calls for three cores, two of these being fixed to one another with a separate core between these two. Analysis shows that in comparison with conventional solenoids, the solenoids of the proposed design would not have a cost impact, could have longer operational lives, and exhibit larger forces in an open position. It was also reported that the proposed design could be extended to multiple-staged solenoid design, which would yield increased force in the middle of the stroke as well.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20110016699, "id": "023d2c4c8ca34b50bec98ebbc10ba5b9", "publicationName": "NASA Tech Briefs, May 2004", "publicationDate": "2004-05-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20110016673, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "NASA Tech Briefs, May 2004", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20110016699.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20110016699/downloads/20110016699.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20110016699/downloads/20110016699.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20110016699/downloads/20110016699.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
