In development since 2001, it has been successfully demonstrated in support of a number of actual missions within NASA s Suborbital Science Program. Improvements to software configuration control were needed to properly support both an ongoing transition to operational status and continued evolution of REVEAL capabilities. For this reason the project described in this report targets REVEAL software source documentation and deployment of the software on a small set of hardware platforms different from what is currently used in the baseline system implementation. This report specifically describes the actions taken over a ten week period by two undergraduate student interns and serves as a final report for that internship. The topics discussed include: the documentation of REVEAL source code; the migration of REVEAL to other platforms; and an end-to-end field test that successfully validates the efforts.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20110013558, "id": "851b24928ae84aa7b837dfb4118e7419", "publicationDate": "2008-06-21T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20110013558.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20110013558/downloads/20110013558.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20110013558/downloads/20110013558.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20110013558/downloads/20110013558.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
