Discrepancies between predicted data and flight test data are\nnoted and an alternate method of simulation is presented.\nThis study was conducted under the provisions of Contract NAS3-3232, to\nsatisfy the requirements of Item 129, of the Centaur Documentation Require-\n\nln\nments P a , Report Number 55-002073.\n\niii/iv\n\nGD/C-BTD65-089\n2 1 June 1965\n\nSUMMARY\nAcceleration data telemetered from Centaur guidance accelerometers was compared with preflight predictions. A consistent pattern was found which justifies:\n1. A reduction in drag coefficient at low supersonic velocity\n\n2. Inclusion of an additional base thrust term, both due to base pressure effects.\n\nIn the past this base thrust has been considered a s a negative drag effect and computed\n\nas a function of dynamic pressure. However, test data has shown that this base thrust\nstill exists and is nearly constant even when the density approaches vacuum conditions,\nTherefore to properly simulate this effect a more realistic simulation is required. A\nproposed simulation model is presented which will give much better agreement with\nflight data.\nDuring the investigation another factor w a s discovered which contributes to the\ndifferences between predicted and flight test acceleration. This is the hold-down force\nexerted by the launcher during the rise beyond 2-inch motion.\n\nThis force can last up\n\nto one second and although the velocity loss is small, the weight change (about 700\npounds propellant) is significant, The proposed changes to trajectory simulation a r e\n\nas follows:\n1. Revise CA versus Mach number\n2. Add a base thrust t e r m equal to base thrust at near vacuum multiplied by\n(1-L),\nwhere\nP\no\n\nP\n- is the ratio of\n%\n\nambient pressure to sea level pressure.\n\nBase thrust at vacuum might be as low as 2500 pounds o r as high as 7000\npounds. A probable value of 3400 pounds is suggested. A conservative value\nof 2500 pounds is recommended for immediate inclusion.\n3.\n\nProgram a hold-down force of 30,000 pounds for one second beyond 2-inch\nmotion. This can best be simulated by adding 30,000 pounds to the launch\nweight and jettisoning the same weight at one second.\n\nV\n\n\xe2\x80\x99\n\n.\n\nGD/C-BTD65-089\n2 1 June 1965\n\nItems 1 and 2 (conservative value) will increase Surveyor mission payload by 25\nand 36 pounds respectively (61 pounds total, due to change in base force), and Item 3\nwill decrease payload 8 pounds. The over-all effect is a payload increase of 53 pounds\nf o r a mission to the moon. AC-4 trajectory re-assembly using this technique with the\nprobable value of 3400 pounds base force gives good results, and overwhelming evidence\nfrom all previous flights dating back to 1958 indicates that this base force has been the\ncommon denominator in the deviations which in the past have been charged to hot engines o r low launch weight.\nRecommendations are made to incorporate as soon as possible into any and all\n\nAtlas flights, base pressure measuring devices of small scale (0 to 1 psi) and high accuracy to verify the results of this study. Based on this study alone it would appear to\nbe good engineering practice to take at least the conservative estimate gain while further\n\ntest data is accumulated.\n\nvi\n\nGD/C-BTD65-089\n2 1 June 1965\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSection\nNumber\n\nI\n\nPage\n\nI\n\nI1\n\nINTRODuc TION\n\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n1- 1\n\n1.1 Background\n\nI\n\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n1-1\n\nDERIVATION OF NEW FORCE SIMULATION FROM ANALYSIS OF\nCENTAUR FLIGHTS . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n2 . 1 General\n\n.\n\n2- 1\n\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n2-1\n\n. . . . . . . . .\n\n2-5\n\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n2-9\n\n. . . . .\n\n3-1\n\n. . .\n\n3- 1\n\n. . . . . . .\n\n3-3\n\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n4- 1\n\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n5-1\n\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n6-1\n\n2 . 3 New Altitude-Dependent Base Thrust\n2 . 4 Hold-Down Force\n\n11\n1\n\nANALYSISOFATLASB, C y D, AND SLVFLIGHTS.\n\n3 . 1 Base and Engine Compartment Pressure Measurements\n3 . 2 Atlas Acceleration Deviations from Nominal\nI\n\nIV\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nV\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\nVI\n\nREFERENCES\n\nvii\n\nGD/C-BTD65-089\n. 2 1 June 1965\n\nLIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS\nFigure\nNumber\n\nPage\n\n. .\n\n2-2\n\n. . . .\n\n2-3\n\n2-1\n\nAC-4 Axial Acceleration Increment between Test and Predicted\n\n2-2\n\nAC-4 Axial Acceleration Increment versus Time, Atmospheric\nPressure and Mach Number\n. .\n.\n\n2-3\n\n. . . . . .\n\nComparison of Flight Data with Predicted Data; Force Increment\n. . . . . . .\n. . .\nversus Pressure Ratio\n\n. . . .\n\n.\n\n.\n\n2-4\n\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\n2-6\n\n2-4\n\nCorrelation of Test with Predicted Drag\n\n2-5\n\nAxial Drag Coefficient versus Mach Number.\n\n3-2\n\n.\nTypical N e t Force at Liftoff . . .\nBase Pressure Measurements . .\nWind Tunnel Test Data . . . . .\n\n4-1\n\nTotal Base Force,\n\n4-2\n\nAC-4 Re-Assembly Results,\n\n2-6\n2-7\n\n3-1\n\n.\n\nq-Dependent Base Drag Coefficient\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n. .\n. .\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n. . . .\n. . . .\n\n. . .\n. .\n. . .\n. .\n. . . .\nProposed versus Previous Simulation . . .\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\nAxial Acceleration versus Time . . .\n\n2-7\n\n2-8\n2-10\n\n3-4\n3-5\n4-2\n4-3\n\nLIST OF TABLES\nTable\nNumber\n\nPage\n\n. . . .\n\n3-1\n3-2\n\nviii\n\nAtlas Engine Compartment Pressure Test Measurements\n\nAtlas Booster Acceleration, Test versus Predicted (Series D and\nSLV Vehicles with Data Available)\n.\n.\n\n. . . . .\n\n. . . .\n\n.\n\n3-2\n3-6\n\nGD/C-BTD65-089\n2 1 June 1965\n\ni SECTION I\nINTRODUCTION\n1\n\n1.1 BACKGROUND\n\nOver the past years there has been much discussion of the drag simulation of the\nAtlas booster stage. The problem focuses on the base pressure term in the drag buildup. Since the base force is a pressure term, and since all pressure terms a r e usually\nconsidered drag effects, it seemed logical to try to determine a drag coefficient for\nthe base. No difficulty is encountered during the early part of the boost phase, but\n\nas the trajectory approaches booster burnout, the dynamic pressure approaches zero\ndue to the atmospheric density. A slight change in trajectory flight path has a pronounced effect on the dynamic pressure at Mach numbers beyond 2. The solution used\nover the past several years was to take a Yypical trajectory" and reference the drag\ndata to that q versus Mach number history.\n\nThe typical trajectory still being used for\n\nCentaur flights is one selected long ago for some "average" Atlas mission.\n\nThere has\n\nalso been reluctance to show very high negative values of drag coefficient. However,\ndue to the fact that the base still shows positive pressure at vacuum in all wind tunnel,\nflight test and theoretical calculations, the drag coefficient required at near vacuum\nconditions, regardless of Mach number , approaches -a. This situation points out the\nobvious deficiency of the method presently used.\n\nThis study presents an aiternate\n\nmethod of simulation which more closely relates predicted data to actual test data.\n\n1-1/1-2\n\nGD/C -BTD65-089\n2 1 June 1965\n\nSECTION I1\nDERIVATION OF NEW FORCE SIMULATION\nFROM ANALYSIS OF CENTAUR FLIGHTS\n2 . 1 GENERAL\n\nAcceleration data obtained from the Centaur guidance (Reference 1)was compared\nwith preflight nominal predicted acceleration for AC-2, AC-3, and AC-4 flights. The\ndifference in acceleration is shown typically for the AC-4 flight in Figure 2-1.\nscatter is due to incomplete smoothing.\n\nData\n\nFigure 2-2 shows the acceleration increment\n\nafter complete smoothing, along with pressure and Mach number scales. The same\ndata was obtained for AC-2 and AC-3 flights; then several schemes for relating these\nacceleration differences to dynamic pressure, Mach number and/or altitude were tried.\nThe method which gives the best solution w a s evolved by shifting the time scales horizontally so that a few seconds after liftoff the acceleration matches. This has the\neffect of eliminating thrust and weight deviations and also tends to get the Mach numb e r s closer for preflight and test data during the drag rise at transonic speeds. This\nacceleration difference was then converted to force difference and plotted versus atmospheric pressure ratio.\nFigure 2-3 shows the force increment for all three of the Atlas/Centaur flights.\nAll three flights show the same general trend; that is, a dip in force just prior to Mach\n\n1, then\n\n2\n\nhrge bulge. peaking near maximum dynamic pressure. A s the pressure\n\napproaches zero near burnout the increment in force approaches a near constant value.\nIn AC-2 and AC-4, the value is nearly 8000 pounds and in AC-3 it is about 2800 pounds.\n\nIf a straight line is drawn from the low subsonic part of the curve to the booster burnout end of the curve, the difference in force between the intercepts atP\n- -- 0\n\nP\n\nP\nO\n\n= 1 and\n\ncan be attributed to a base force term which would vary like a conventional\n\nP\nO\n\nrocket engine\'s thrust with altitude. The remainder of the deviation can be attributed\nto drag difference; that portion of the deviation below the straight sloping line indicates\nmore drag than assumed and that portion above indicates less drag than assumed.\n\n2- 1\n\nGD/C-BTD65-089\n21 June 1965\n\n2-2\n\nGD/C-BTD65-089\n21 June 1965\n\nI\n\n2-3\n\nGD/C-BTD65-089\n21 June 1965\n\nPo\nI\nPI\n\n\\\n\ng\n4\np:\n\nz\nm\nm\n\nw\n\nE\n\n( ?0001) 33x06 M L N 3 W 3 H 3 N I\na\n\n2-4\n\nGD/C-BTD65-089\n21 June 1965\n\n2 . 2 NEW q-DEPENDENT DRAG\n\nFigure 2-4 shows the results of computing this drag increment in coefficient form.\nThe increment in drag coefficient w a s added or subtracted from the predicted drag coefficient and a very good agreement for the three flights w a s obtained, if points with a\ndynamic pressure of less than 10 are ignored. The ignored points are those which\nwould indicate a very high drag coefficient at Mach numbers below 0.15 where drag\nbased on q contributes little anyway. Using these computed drag points a curve was\nfaired that gives a slightly higher drag coefficient subsonically, a lower peak CD, a\ndefinitely sharper drop beyond the peak through the low supersonic region and finally\napproaches a constant hypersonic value. This curve was compared with the drag coefficient of the vehicle less base and the difference is shown in Figure 2-5. The solid\nline shows the newly predicted base drag which is q dependent. It has the same static\nvalue, nearly the same peak value at sonic speeds but does r i s e earlier and drops off\nsharper. Between Mach 2 and 3 it approaches a constant negative value which is not\nreally too critical as the value of q approaches zero. The finalized q-dependent drag\ncoefficient is shown in Figure 2-6.\n2 . 3 NEW ALTITUDE-DEPENDENT BASE THRUST\n\nThe difference in intercepts shown in Figure 2-3 then is treated as a base thrust\nP\n\nt e r m varying from zero at sea level to full value at vacuum by the relation (1 - -)\n\nP\nO\n\n.\n\nRigorous theoretical proof is lacking for this assumption but it looks iike the best emperical f i t to the data. The base force term can also be treated as a pressure acting\nover the base area. Since the base area is about 11,300 square inches a very small\np r e s s u r e exerts a fairly large force. A search through all previous Atlas flight test\ndata w a s made in an attempt to define this pressure more accurately. The results of\nthis search, which a r e discussed in Section 111, show that a pressure of at least 0.20\npsi has been substantiated in previous Atlas test flights, and it could be considerably\nhigher.\n\nFrom the Centaur flight data, indications are that the base thrust could be as\n\nlow as 2500 pounds o r as high as 7000 pounds. A probable value of 3400 pounds is\n\n2-5\n\nGD/C-BTD65-089\n21 June 1965\n\n,\n\n\xe2\x82\xac\nc\n\nE\n\nc\nu\n\n0\n\nE\n0\n.rl\n42\n\ncd\n\n4\n\nQ)\n\n0\n\nu\n\n0\n\nGD/C-BTD65-089\n21 June 1965\n\nk\n\ni\n\nM\n\n1\n\n0\n\n2-7\n\nGD/C-BTD65-089\n21 June 1965\n\nM\ncd\n\n4\n\nd\n\n2-8\n\n_L\n\n0\n\nGD/C-BTD65-089\n2 1 June 1965\n\nsuggested (base pressure = 0.30 psia). A conservative value of 2500 pounds is recommended for immediate inclusion in Atlas boosted flights.\n2 . 4 HOLD-DOWN FORCE\n\nDuring the base drag investigation, study of the acceleration at liftoff revealed\nanother factor which should be simulated better.\n\nThat is the hold-down force existing\n\nbeyond 2-inch motion. This hold-down force is that force beyond the initial release\nand is caused by the kick struts restraining the pitching moment produced by crosswinds, engine differences, etc. This force can last up to one second beyond 2-inch\nmotion with oscillating hold-down forces nearly equal to the thrust minus weight difference as shown in Figure 2-7.\n\nAlthough the velocity loss is small during this period it\n\nis equivalent to the loss of a s much as 700 pounds of propellant. To simulate this force,\n\na programmed hold-down can be included by simply increasing the launch weight 30,000\npounds and jettisoning this weight one second beyond 2-inch motion.\n\n2-9\n\nGD/C-BTD65-089\n21 June 1965\n\n:\nw\n\nPI\n\nh\nl\n\nR\n\n0\n\nm\n\n0\nc1\n\nGD/C-BTD65-089\n21 June 1965\n\n! \'\nSECTION III\nANALYSIS OF ATLAS B, C , D AND SLV FLIGHTS\n\nA search was conducted of all post flight test evaluation reports (Reference 2) to\ndeter mine\n1.

On which flights the drag was evaluated.\n\n3.1 BASE AND ENGINE COMPARTMENT PRESSURE MEASUREMENTS\nBase pressure measurements were conducted early in the tests, not to determine\nbase force, but to provide information to solve the base heating problem which existed\n\nat that time. The pressure measuring devices were either of 15 psi range with a resulting 5% accuracy deviation of 0.75 psi o r a i\'. psi gage, which still did not have the\n5\naccuracy required.\n\nMeasurements were made inside the engine compartment so they\n\ndo not represent the base itself. Measurements were made on some later Atlas flights\nwhich show that through the transonic region the base pressure deviates from the compartment pressure due to delay in flow through the engine boots. Here again the absolute\nvalue cannot be obtained with good accuracy. in cases w1iei-e high positi.:s l.ra!ws nf\nengine compartment pressure were obtained, apologies were made for the fact that the\ncurve did not go to zero and data was considered qualitative only. Actually a smooth\ncurve showing the pressure going exponentially from about 15 psi to some low value was\n\nall that was being sought. A buildup in engine compartment pressure would mean a hot\ngas flow in, a condition which was to be avoided.\nDuring all the hundreds of Atlas flights, actual high accuracy absolute pressure\nmeasurements of the base pressure were never obtained. However an attempt was\nmade to determine the base pressure from that data available. Taking the data as\n\n3-1\n\nGD/C-BTD65-089\n2 1 June 1965\nshown in Table 3-1, assuming that zero scale is accurate, the engine compartment\npressure on flights ranged from -0.30 to +O. 80 psia.\n\nTABLE 3-1.\n\nATLAS ENGINE COMPARTMENT PRESSURE TEST MEASUREMENTS\n\nVehicle\n4B\n5B\n6B\n8B\n9B\n12B\n3c\n4c\n5c\n7c\n8C\n\n11c\n\nEngine Compartment Pressure (psia)\nLaunch\nBooster Burnout\n\n-\n\n14.85\n14.7\n14.7\n\n(14.7)\n(14.7)\n\n---\n\n*\n\n*\n*\n*\n13.9\n\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\n+O. 30\n+O. 30\n\nFailed\n-0.30\n+o. 75\n-0.30\n\n(+O. 15)\n(+O. 30)\n\n- --\n\n0\n\n(14.7)\n+O.\n+O.\n+O.\n+O.\n\n0\n30\n30\n15\n30\n\n(+O. 80)\n\n+o. 20\n+o. 20\n\n5D\n11D\n14D\n15D\n17D\n18D\n119D\n\n14.9\n\n(14.7)\n\n0\n+O. 75\n\n(+O. 55)\n\n7101\n7 102\n7 103\n\n14.25\n14.4\n14.55\n\n(14.7)\n(14.7)\n(14.7)\n\n+O. 30\n0\n+O. 05\n\n(+O. 75)\n(+O. 30)\n(+O. 20)\n\nI\n\n4F\n5F\n~\n\nI,\n\n8F\n\n16F\n\n*\n**\n()\ni\n\n3-2\n\n*\n*\n*\n**\n\n+O. 15\n\n+o. 20\n+O. 80\n\n+o. 20\n+O. 50\n\n-0.10\n+O. 15\n\nPressure gage scale = 7.5 psi maximum\nPressure gage scale = 5 psi maximum\nNumbers in brackets indicate pressure if data is adjusted to\ngive 14.7 psi at sea level.\n\nGD/C -BTD65- 089\n21 June 1965\n\nThe mean of the 25 values as shown by the distribution in Figure 3-1 is about +0.21psi.\n\nIf the measurements, where both sea level and burnout pressure were determined, are\nI\n\ncorrected so that sea level values are 14.7 psia, then the mean value of these seven\ntests is about 0.43 psia at burnout. I these seven values a r e averaged with the 25 unf\n\nI\n\nmodified values, the mean is then about 0.26 psia.\n\nThe seven modified values a r e\n\nshown in dashed lines and the best estimate value of engine compartment pressure is\nnoted as 0.26 psia.\n\nFrom looking at differential pressures across the base heat shield\n\nan additional 0.04 psi might be reasonable, giving a total base pressure of +O. 30 psi.\nThis value of +O. 30 psia appears to be consistent with results obtained from the Centaur\nflights and with the wind tunnel tests conducted at Arnold Engineering Development\nCenter. Figure 3-2 shows a curve reproduced from this tunnel data (Reference 3)\nwhich also shows the increment between base pressure and ambient pressure approaching 0.3 psi with jets on at high altitude.\n3.2 ATLAS ACCELERATION DEVIATIONS FROM NOMINAL\n~\n\n~\n\n~~\n\n~\n\nThe test evaluation data was then studied to obtain trends in how closely the vehicle\nacceleration compared to predicted nominal. Here we get the greatest clue that the\nexisting simulation is in e r r o r . A s shown in Table 3-2, out of 110 Atlas D and SLV\nflights, 89 had a steeper acceleration history between launch and BECO than predicted.\nOf these flights, 62 had an acceleration difference of more than 0.2 g at BECO and 40\n\nhad more than 0.3g. Approximately nominal performance w a s obtained in 11.8% of the\nflights and only 7.2% show lower than a nominal acceleration histmy.\n\nThis has been\n\ninterpreted by others to mean that the engines were all high thrust o r the vehicles were\n\nall underweight.\n\nThis report proposes the conclusion that the base force was the com-\n\nmon denominator in producing this consistent acceleration increase in the booster phase\nof Atlas as it approaches BECO.\nStrangely, those few cases where the acceleration was close to nominal were\nchosen for extraction of drag coefficient data, and not so strangely, agreement of predicted data with test data w a s always good.\n\n3-3\n\nGD/C-BTD65-089\n21 June 1965\n\nn\n\nd\n\nU\n\nv1\n\na\n\nY\n\n0\n\nx\nm\n\n8\n\n3\n\nm\nm\n\n8\n\n0\n\n3\n3-4\n\nGD/C-BTD65-089\n21 June 1965\n\n48\n\n52\n\n56\n\n60\n\n64\n\n72\n\nALTITUDE (1000 FT)\n\nFigure 3-2.

Revise CA versus Mach number.\nP\n\n2 . Add a base thrust term equal to base thrust at near vacuum multiplied by (1--),\n\nwhere\n\nP\n- is the ratio of\nP\nO\n\nP\nO\n\nambient pressure to sea level pressure.\n\nBase thrust\n\nat vacuum might be as low as 2500 pounds or as high as 7000 pounds. A probable value of 3400 pounds is suggested. A conservative value of 2500 pounds is\nrecommended for immediate inclusion.\n3 . Program a hold-down force of 30,000 pounds for one second beyond 2-inch mo-\n\ntion.\n\nThis can best be simulated by adding 30,000 pounds to the launch weight\n\nand jettisoning the same weight at one second.\nThe results of these changes a r e as follows:\n1. Revision of q-dependent drag increases Surveyor mission payload by 25 pounds.\n\n2. Addition of a base thrust term increases Surveyor mission payload by 36 pounds\nbased on conservative base force of 2500 pounds, o r 49 pounds based on the\nprobable base force of 3400 pounds.\n3. Addition of hold-down force decreases Surveyor mission payload by 8 pounds.\n\nvalue is 53\nThe over-all effect of these three changes based on tiis coi~serv~tivc?\npounds more payload to the moon. Using the 3400 pounds probable value gives a payload\nincrease of 66 pounds to the moon.\nThe total base force acting during booster phase is shown in Figure 4-1 for the\ncase of a 3400 pounds base force. For comparison, the force using previous drag simulation technique is shown.\nAC-4 re-assembly using this proposed simulation with the probable value of 3400\npounds gives very good agreement as shown in Figure 4-2.\n\n4- 1\n\nGD/C-BTD65-089\n21 June 1965\n\nE\n0\n\n2:\n\nE\n\n3\n\nd\nLL\n\n.\n\na\n,\n0\nk\n\n0\n\nFrc\na\n,\nrn\ncd\n\na\n\nd\n\ncd\n\nc\n,\n\nGD/C-BTD65-089\n21 June 1965\n\na\n,\n\nE\n..\n\ni\nl\n\n4 -3 /4 -4\n\nGD/C-BTD65-089\n21 June 1965\n\nSECTION V\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\nThe following recommendations are made:\n\n1 Incorporate a s soon as possible into any and/or all Atlas flights, base pres.\nsure measuring devices of small scale (0 to 1psi) and high accuracy.\n2. Change the present trajectory simulation technique to include the base thrust\n\nterm and hold-down force.\n3. Use revised drag coefficient data and conservative value of base force of 2500\n\npounds in all Atlas booster simulations.\n4.\n\nIncrease base force if warranted by later test data.\n\n5-1/5-2\n\nGD/C-BTD65-089\n21 June 1965\n\nSECTION VI\nREFERENCES\n1.
