b'Physical Sciences\nImproved Cryostat for Cooling a Wide Panel\nLess technician time and lower consumption of helium translate to lower cost.\nMarshall Space Flight Center, Alabama\nAn improved cryostat has been developed for cooling a wide panel evenly over\nits surface to a temperature of \xe2\x80\x93423 \xc2\xb0F (\xe2\x89\x88\xe2\x80\x93253\n\xc2\xb0C) by use of liquid helium. Originally, the\ncryostat was to be used in measuring apparent strains in wide aluminum/lithium\npanels as functions of temperature in\norder to develop data for temperature\ncompensation of the readings of strain\ngauges on a tank containing liquid hydrogen. Relative to the cryostat used previously for this purpose, the improved cryostat can be prepared for a test in less time,\nand it loses less helium during each test.\nEach wide panel to be tested is instrumented with thermocouples in preparation for a test. The previous cryostat was\nmade of two aluminum halves that, for\neach test, were sandwiched together and\nsealed around the instrumented wide\npanel to be tested. The panel was thus\nenclosed in a plenum. The cryostat and\nadjacent panel areas protruding from\nthe cryostat were then coated with a\nthermally insulating foam.\nDuring a test, liquid helium was made\nto flow into the plenum through a port on\nthe bottom. The helium vaporized and\nexpanded, filling the plenum with cold\nhelium gas, which eventually flowed out\nof the plenum through a port on the top.\nThe nature of the flow was such that a significant portion of the helium did not\ncome into contact with the wide panel;\nhence, cooling was less efficient than it\nmight otherwise have been.\nAfter completion of each test, the\nfoam and the cryostat were separated\nfrom the panel. The cryostat was\ncleaned and prepared for installation\n\nLiquid-Helium-Injection Manifold\n\nHelium In\n\nTop Section of Cryostat\n\nWide Panel\nTo Be Tested\n\nBottom Section of Cryostat\n\nThe Liquid-Helium-Injection Manifold in the improved cryostat forces the helium to flow in a pattern\nin which it cools the panel more efficiently than in the previous cryostat.\n\non another instrumented wide panel for\nthe next test. It took 28 hours to install\nthe cryostat onto the instrumented\npanel, apply the foam, and perform ancillary operations in preparation for a\ntest. The volume of liquid helium consumed during each test was 750 liters.\nThe improved cryostat (see figure) includes an upper section and a lower section, both of which include permanent\nhousings made of a thermally insulating\nfoam 2-in. (\xe2\x89\x885-cm) thick. A liquid-helium-injection manifold is attached to the\ninside of the top section. The bottom section includes an outlet for helium gas.\nThe manifold contains slots that, when\nthe cryostat is installed on the panel, are\nlocated approximately 1 in. (\xe2\x89\x882.5 cm)\nfrom the wide panel. The array of slots\nspans a substantial portion of the area of\nthe panel. The top and bottom sections\nof the cryostat are sealed to the panel by\nuse of polytetrafluoroethylene cord and\n\naluminum tape.\nLiquid helium is fed into the manifold\nfrom the top. The helium leaves the\nmanifold through the slots and thus impinges directly on the panel. Hence, all\nthe helium entering the cryostat must\ncome into contact with the panel before\nleaving the cryostat. After a test, the\ncryostat is removed from the panel and\nreinstalled onto another panel for the\nnext test. Installation of the cryostat on\nan instrumented panel takes a negligible\namount of time, in comparison with the\n28 hours associated with the previous\ncryostat. The amount of liquid helium\nconsumed during a test in the improved\ncryostat is 500 liters \xe2\x80\x94 250 liters less\nthan before.\nThis work was done by W. B.

It has been proposed to utilize\nsuch momentary enhancements of cooling in applications in which diode lasers\nand other semiconductor devices are required to operate for times of the order\n\nof milliseconds at temperatures too low\nto be easily obtainable in the steady state.\nIn a typical contemplated application, a\nsemiconductor device would be in contact with the final (coldest) somewhat\n\n23\n\n\xe2\x80\x9340\n\nTemperature, \xc2\xb0C\n\n\xe2\x80\x9350\n\nMaximum\nTemperature\nOvershoot\n\n\xe2\x80\x9360\nSteady-State Temperature at Optimum Current\n\n\xe2\x80\x9370\n\nMaximum Enhancement of Cooling\n\n\xe2\x80\x9380\n\n5\n\n10\n15\nTime, Seconds\n\n20\n\n25\n\n20\n\n25\n\n2.0\nCurrent Pulse\n\nCurrent, Amperes\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\nOptimum Steady Current\n0.5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n15\nTime, Seconds\n\nA Pulse of Current greater than the optimum steady current was applied to a thermoelectric device, giving rise to transient enhancement of cooling followed by transient heating followed by gradual decay toward the steady state.\n\ntaller stage of a multistage thermoelectric\ncooler. Steady current would be applied\nto the stages to produce steady cooling.\nPulsed current would then be applied,\nenhancing the cooling of the top stage\nmomentarily.\nThe principles of operation are straightforward: In a thermoelectric device, the\n\ncooling occurs only at a junction at one\nend of the thermoelectric legs, at a rate\nproportional to the applied current. However, Joule heating occurs throughout the\ndevice at a rate proportional to the current squared. Hence, in the steady state,\nthe steady temperature difference that the\ndevice can sustain increases with current\n\nonly to the point beyond which the Joule\nheating dominates. If a pulse of current\ngreater than the optimum current (the\ncurrent for maximum steady cooling) is\napplied, then the junction becomes momentarily cooled below its lowest steady\ntemperature until thermal conduction\nbrings the resulting pulse of Joule heat to\nthe junction and thereby heats the junction above its lowest steady temperature.\nA theoretical and experimental study of\nsuch transient thermoelectric cooling followed by transient Joule heating in response to current pulses has been performed. The figure presents results from\none of the experiments. The study established the essential parameters that characterize the pulse cooling effect, including the minimum temperature achieved,\nthe maximum temperature overshoot,\nthe time to reach minimum temperature,\nthe time while cooled, and the time between pulses. It was found that at large\npulse amplitude, the amount of pulse supercooling is about a fourth of the maximum steady-state temperature difference.\nFor the particular thermoelectric device\nused in one set of the experiments, the\npractical optimum pulse amplitude was\nfound to be about 3 times the optimum\nsteady-state current. In a further experiment, a pulse cooler was integrated into a\nsmall commercial thermoelectric threestage cooler and found to provide several\ndegrees of additional cooling for a time\nlong enough to operate a semiconductor\nlaser in a gas sensor.\nThis work was done by G.

These color meters could be\nsuitable for use in a variety of applications in which there are requirements to\nquantify or match colors for aesthetic\npurposes but there is no need for the\nhigh spectral resolution of scientificgrade spectrometers. Such applications\n\n24\n\ntypically occur in the paint, printing,\nand cosmetic industries, for example.\nThe figure schematically depicts a\ncolor meter of this type being used to\nmeasure the color of a sample in terms of\nthe spectrum of light reflected from the\nsample. Light from a white source (for\nexample, a white light-emitting diode)\npasses through a collimating lens to the\nsample. Another lens collects some of\nthe light reflected from the sample and\n\nfocuses the light onto the input end of\noptical fiber. Light emerging from the\noutput end of the optical fiber illuminates an array of photodetectors covered\nwith metal/dielectric-film interference\nfilters like those described in \xe2\x80\x9cMetal/Dielectric-film Interference Color Filters\xe2\x80\x9d\n(NPO-20217), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 23,\nNo. 2 (February 1999), page 70.
