b'Exploration Atmospheres for Beyond-LEO Human\nExploration Missions\nDonald L. Henninger, Ph.D.1\nNASA Johnson Space Center, 2101 NASA Parkway, Houston, Texas, 77058\n\nAtmospheric pressure and oxygen concentration of human-occupied space vehicles and\nhabitats are an important life support parameter. The atmosphere is critical in terms of not\nonly safety but also in terms of maximizing human capabilities at the point of scientific\ndiscovery. Human exploration missions beyond low earth orbit (LEO) will include\nextravehicular activity (EVA). EVAs are carried out in low pressure (4.3 psi/29.6\nkilopascals) space suits running at 100 percent oxygen. New suits currently in development\nwill be capable of running at a range of pressures between approximately 8.2 psi/56.5\nkilopascals and 4.3 psi/29.6 kilopascals. In order to carry out high-frequency EVA phases of\na mission safely and more efficiently, it is advantageous to have cabin or vehicle atmospheres\nat lower total pressure and higher oxygen concentrations. This allows for much reduced\npre-breathe times for a fixed risk of decompression sickness and thus more efficient EVAs.\nThe recommended oxygen concentration is 32% and represents a trade with respect to\ncontrolling the risk of decompression sickness and risk of fire. Work carried out by NASA\nin 2006 and continued in 2012 established an atmospheric pressure and oxygen\nconcentration to optimize EVA. This paper will review previous work and describe current\nrecommendations for beyond-LEO human exploration missions.\n\n1\n\nDivision Chief Technologist, Crew & Thermal Systems Division/EC, AIAA Senior Member.\n1\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n'
