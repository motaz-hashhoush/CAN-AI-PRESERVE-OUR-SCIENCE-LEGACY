A t t h e present time N A S T M i s i n s t a l l e d on over 100 computers.\nGovernment users include, i n addition to NASA centers, DOD, DOT, and t h e AEC.\nUsers i n t h e p r i v a t e sector include most aerospace firms, t h e automotive\nAT A\nindustry, a r c h i t e c t u r a l engineers, and those who use N S R N a t computer data\ncenters. A p a r t i a l sampling of some i n t e r e s t i n g domestic NASTRAN applications\ni s included i n a N S R N b e n e f i t s study which was conducted for t h e Office\nAT A\nof Technology U t i l i z a t i o n , NASA Headquarters ( r e f . 2 ) . O t h e i n t e r n a t i o n a l\nn\nscene I U S T W has been made available by American firms a t computer data\ncenters world wide. NSMO has received expressions of i n t e r e s t i n NASTRAN\nfrom firms i n nearly every West European country, Japan, and I s r a e l .\nThe purpose of t h i s report i s to inform NASTRAN users of s i g n i f i c a n t\nNASTRAN-related events o f t h e past year, to describe t h e present operation\no f t h e N A S T M Systems Management Office (NSMO), to discuss t h e new capabili5\nt i e s and improvements incorporated i n Level 1 of NASTW, and t o discuss\np r i o r i t i e s for f i t u r e l e v e l s o f NASTRAN.\nS I G N I F \' I C m MIUSTONES\n\nOctober 1971-September 1972\nFour a c t i v i t i e s seem worthy of discussion a s s i g n i f i c a n t milestones:\nt h e NASTRAN Newsletter, t h e SPR Log, t h e generation of Level 15, and the 2nd\nNASTRAN Users\' Colloquium including a NASA-Industry Working Session.\nNewsletter\nThe first NASTM Newsletter was published August 20, 1971. Subsequent\nNewsletters w e r e published December 7, Syi\'l, March 13 and J u l y 20, 1972. A\nv a r i e t y of topics i s normally included under NM Communications. Other\nSO\nitems o f user interest discussed i n these Newsletters have included Level 15\nAnnouncements, N S R N Publications, Level 1 2 Errors, D A Programs, and\nAT A\nMP\n\ni g i d Format Alter Packets.\n,000 copies.\n\nThe Newsletter c i r c u l a t i o n i s presently over\n\nsm\n\n7;og\n\nA computerized data base of information f r o m a l l Software Problem Reports\n\n(SPR\'s) was created i n February. The f i r s t released SPR Log was designated\nLog 16 and was d i s t r i b u t e d by NSMO to 2 1 organizations f o r evaluation and cornment. b g 17 was generated i n March and was sent to 16 additional organizations\nand t o COSMIC f o r m r t h e r d i s t r i b u t i o n . Log 19 was generated in July and i s\npresently available f r o m COSMIC. SPR Logs 16 and 17 consist of two p a r t s .\nThe f i r s t p a r t i s an alphabetical sort of the NASTRAN module i n which the\ne r r o r was discovered. This i s a b r i e f l i s t i n g and should be used as an index\nto t h e second p a r t which i s a l i s t i n g by assigned SPR number and includes a\ncomplete description of the e r r o r and i t s present s t a t u s . I n SPR b g 19 a\nt h i r d l i s t i n g i s included which lists by SPR number the Level I 2 e r r o r s t h a t\nhave been corrected i n Level 15.\nAT A\nThe SPR Log i s a valuable reference for any N S R N user group. It\nprovides a rapid assessment of a l l previously reported e r r o r s i n any N S R N\nAT A\nmodule\n\n.\n\nLevel 15\nThe generation of Level15 posed several formidable problems. Certain\nnew c a p a b i l i t y and improvements which had been developed by t h e MacNealSchwendler Corporation (MSC) i n t h e i r Level 11-based NASTRAN were scheduled\nto be incorporated i n Level 15. These included a new GINO, efficiency improvements, heat t r a n s f e r capability and several others. A contractural require4\nment s t a t e d t h a t Level 15 would be b u i l t from MCISA\'s Level 1 which was\ngenerated by t h e interim maintenance contractor, Computer Sciences Corporation\n5\n(CSC), from Levels I 2 and 13. I n order to build Level 1 Ln a systematic,\nreproducible fashion and t o r e t a i n a l l e r r o r corrections made by CSC i n Level\n14, t h e corresponding decks of both t h e MSC system and Level 14 were compared\nOTA\nand t h e differences analyzed. O f a t o t a l of 939 decks 717 F R X N decks\ncommon to both systems were first compared l i n e f o r l i n e using a special purpose\n4\ncomputer program. Either t h e Level 1 or t h e MXC deck was modified u n t i l a\ncomparison showed perfect coincidence of t h e two decks. This computerized\ncomparison e f f o r t resulted i n changes to 307 decks from Level 14 and 370 decks\nfrom the MSC system. The remaining 222 decks were t o t a l l y new design F R R N\nOTA\ndecks o r were machine dependent and were not d i r e c t l y compared l i n e f o r l i n e .\nO f these, 125 decks were new additions from the MC system, and 97 decks had\nS\ned i n both systems. For these decks t h e arduous task of hand\nbeen\ncompa\nwas performed. After thorough analysis and discussion, dec\nwere made which preserved nearly a l l previous e r r o r corrections and ass\ns would be f r e e from previously reported e r r o r s . The Level\nt h a t t h e new\n1 archive system was generated i n My and incorporated a l l e r r o r corrections\n5\na\n2\n\nwhich had been made by March 31. The completed code f o r each machine version\nwas shipped to COSMIC e a r l y i n July.\n\n5\nLevel 1 documentation was a pacing item throughout t h e year.

Butler\nNASA Goddard Space Flight Center\nSUMMARY\n\nr\nSome estimates a e made as to the direction in which a new generation\nof general purpose applications programs can be expected to migrate. NASA\nhas released its new general purpose structures program, NASTRAN (NASA\nSTRuctwal ANalysis). Predictions are made as to the impacts that this newly\navailable space technology is liable to have within the field of structural\nengineering and on the society in which it interacts.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nNASTRAN is the first of a new generation of general purpose application programs for\nindividual disciplines. It was established for the discipline of structural analysis. There is\na strong possibility that other disciplines can adapt the NASTRAN format for a general\npurpose approach to their problems, and it is therefore timely to discuss this topic in an\nopen forum such as the NASTRAN Colloquium.\n- The primary feature of NASTRAN as a general purpose management framework that\nshould make it attractive for other disciplines is its freedom from semantic implications. It\ncan manage a host of problem types without having the individual natures of these\n\ndisciplines influence the logic of the management of the associated problems during the\nsolution process on the computer. The basis for this statement will become apparent in\nthe following discussion on characteristics.\n\nCHARACTERISTICS\nComputer Independence\n\nAl interfacing between the problem solution (Functional) Modules and the computer\nl\noperating system is confined to a small section of the program called the \xe2\x80\x9cExecutive.\xe2\x80\x9d This\nallows the program to operate with and under the computer operating system. The Executive\nis organized about a central driver that stays resident in core. The central driver calls\nExecutive Modules into core, consults a tape stored scheduler (called by the acronym\nOSCAR, which stands for Operating Sequence Control ARray) for the initiation of each\nmodule, and consults a file status table for peripheral service needs. The central driver also\nconsults core resident tables that do the bookkeeping for file and core assignments and that\ncontain the values or names of parameters, depending on whether they are constant or\nvariable. These parameters either exert problem control or act as communication links\nbetween modules. The Executive Modules intercede for a Functional Module in invoking\nsupport from the operating system, such as reading and writing, or peripheral storage\nassignments. Naturally, some of these Executive Modules must be machine dependent, but\nthese are a small fraction (about 1 percent) of the total program code so that there is a\nminimum of machine dependence.\nThe other design feature that has contributed to machine independence is the almost\nexclusive writing of Functional Modules in FORTRAN and using FORTRAN wherever\npossible (bven in writing the machine-dependent Executive Modules). The FORTRAN\nlanguage used was derived from the intersection of IBSYS FORTRAN IV, OS 360 FORTRAN\nIV, UNIVAC\xe2\x80\x99s FORTRAN V, and CDC\xe2\x80\x98s FORTRAN. Certain exceptions were allowed,\ne.g., in the area of nonstandard returns. Hence an interpreter is needed to generate the\nsource decks for the CDC 6600 from the basic library.\nThe gross link/overlay design is essentially the same on each machine, but here again\nthere are certain inherent uniquenesses that have to be accommodated. Thus for almost\neach computer model (not only for each computer manufacturer) there will be an individual\nstrategy to build the architecture of the NASTRAN executable. The dimensions of\nNASTRAN level 15.0 are roughly 14 links wide with a depth of 7 levels of overlay in each\n\nlink. To achieve seven levels of overlay on the 6000 class of CDC machines, a separate\nlinkage editor/loader had to be written to replace that provided by the SCOPE operating system.\n\n16\n\nInternal Storage Management\nInitially, the operating system will make an assignment of core and an assignment of a\ncombination of secondary storage deyices with both serial and random access devices. A\ncombined minimum of 30 serial and random access files is required for NASTRAN. From\nthis point on, NASTRAN does its own internal dynamic management of files and core. File\nrequirements are defined in terms of predetermined sets of data (called data blocks).\nDepending on the peculiarities of a given structural problem, a given physical file during one\nproblem execution may have been occupied by a large succession of data blocks entirely\nunder the control of a NASTRAN Executive Module. Each Functional Module is overlaid\ninto core in a tightly packed fashion so that the maximum amount of remaining core is\navailable as working space for the storage of matrices. This management of core and files,\n\nit must be reemphasized, is internal and is under the control of an Executive Module.\nModularity, Open-Endedness, and Maintainability\nThe working basis of NASTRAN is through the companion pairs, modules, and data\nblocks. It takes the execution of many modules and several link control transfers to achieve\na total cycle of a problem type relating to a given discipline. It takes a number of subroutines\nto compose the many functional steps of a module through several levels of overlay. A\npredetermined set of input data blocks, output data blocks, and scratch files belongs to\neach module. Information sources for data blocks can be tables or matrices. In nearly\nevery instance, these various working parts have been made open ended. For instance, the\nnumber of links can be extended, the number of levels of overlay can be increased, the\nnumber of problem types can be expanded, the number of modules can be enlarged, the\nnumber of entries in tables can be augmented, the quantity of tables can be opened up, and\nthe number of subroutines can grow. In rare instances, operational considerations have\ncircumscribed the entries in a table, but these are sufficientlyrare that it is fair to say that\nNASTRAN is generally open ended.\nThe modular design allows for program maintenance. Each module communicates\nonly with the Executive and is not allowed to communicate directly with another module.\n\nAny communication that is needed between modules is accomplished by passing information\nto output data blocks that are used as input data blocks to succeeding modules or by\n\npassing parameter values to parameter tables that can be accessed by a succeeding module.\nIn this way, the interface with the Executive is fixed module by module so that an entire\nmodule can be replaced or revamped, so long as it maintains the same interface as previously.\nHence no internal module change of t i type has a cascading effect through the program.\nhs\n\nThis modularity also allows for an internal input/output routine to process internal quantities in a machine-independent fashion. As the technology advances, new subroutines and\nmodules can be added or inserted in place of old ones and the program can be kept modern\nwithout any organizational modification.\nThe matrix operations performed by the modules do not require that the amount of\ncore working space be of a size to hold an entire matrix or set of matrices at once. Solution\nlogic allows only portions of each matrix in an algebraic step to be present at any one time\nwhile the remaining portions are fed from secondary storage as operations on preceding\nportions are completed. This type of core usage vis-a-vis matrix operation is given the name\n\xe2\x80\x9cspill logic\xe2\x80\x9d and allows the program to operate on matrices of virtually unlimited size.\n\nModules\nBeside Executive Modules, the bulk of the program is composed of three kinds of\nmodules: Utility, Mathematical, and Functional. Most of these are useful for any discipline.\nThe Utility Modules are certainly disciphe independent (having to do with printing matrices,\nperforming coordinate transformations, etc.) and need no further discussion. The\nMathematical Modules were written to perform operations on large matrices, because those\nroutines provided by standard operating systems are not efficient enough to be functional\nfor large matrices. \xe2\x80\x9cLarge\xe2\x80\x9d is defined to be a combination of order and density\xe2\x80\x9d so that\nthe matrix will not fit in core even in packed form. A number of Mathematical Modules\nwere written to take matrix characteristics into account, such as sparsity, bandedness, type\n(real or complex), or positive definiteness. Mathematical Modules are immediately adaptable to other disciplines.\nFunctional Modules currently favor structural mechanics, but conceivably they would\nbe useful t other disciplines under different names. They have names such as Geometry\no\n\n*Density is a ratio of the nonzero elements to the maximum possible number of matrix elements.\n\n18\n\nProcessors, Constraint Eliminators, Elastic Properties, Mass Properties, Damping Properties,\nWeight Generators, Load Generators, Simultaneous Algebraic Equation Solver, Eigenvalue\nExtraction, Stress Data Recovery, Piecewise Linear Analysis, and Differential Equation\nIntegration. If there are other functions that other disciplines require, they can be generated\nand made part of a problem sequence, then their existence can be noted in the Module\nProperty Table.\n\nInternal Compiler and Scheduler\nThe heart of its ability to adapt this Executive management to other applications\nprograms resides in the way it organizes the functions to be performed. Various problem types\npeculiar to a given discipline (and in this case structural mechanics) are classified into categories\nsuch as statics, eigenvalue analysis, dynamic analysis, random analysis, and others. The steps\nneeded to accomplish the solution of a problem of a given type are presented in an orderly\nsequence of module executions and Utility Executive operations. The statements of these\nsolution steps are written in an internal language called \xe2\x80\x9cDMAP\xe2\x80\x9d (for Direct Matrix Abstraction Process). An internal reference library of statements for each problem type has been\nestablished with appropriate cataloguing. In the spirit of open endedness there is no requirement as to problem types to be kept in the library, so a given discipline (or combination of\ndisciplines) can have as many problem types catalogued in the library as is convenient to\nthe user. No matter to what discipline a set of statements belongs, the Executive merely\ncalls out the set of statements by catalogue number according to an analyst\xe2\x80\x99s command.\nIn response to a user\xe2\x80\x99s call in the control section for a particular problem type, the\nExecutive selects the corresponding sequence of DMAP statements and directs this sequence\nto the DMAP compiler. The output from the compiler in effect becomes the scheduler of\nmodule and utility executions. Al loops are unwound and all jumps are translated into a\nl\npurely serial string; all associated data block names and their file storage needs are tabulated\nin the scheduler. This scheduler, the OSCAR, is written onto tape and does not occupy\ncore or disc space. The Executive central driver consults with OSCAR at the end of each\nmodule before calling a succeeding module. It is now evident how the Executive can\noperate on any discipline without semantic implications.\n\nThere are two operations that the Executive performs in conjunction with the problem\ntype and the control section, to be discussed later. These operations have semantic implication and are only quasi-Executive operations. They are called, respectively, the Input File\n\nProcessor (IFP) and the Output File Processor (OFP). The IFP checks on the legality of\ninput bulk data and the logic of control section statements and organizes these input data\ninto data blocks for eventual processing by the Functional Modules. The OFP does sorting\non the solution vectors and organizes these results into formats that are suitable for a\nparticular discipline. The IFP and OFP would have to be replaced entirely for the Executive\n\nto manage another discipline.\n\nControl Versus Sets\nThe system to be analyzed is treated as the basic entity for purposes of defining a\nproblem. In the case of structures the basic system is the geometric arrangement among.\nelastic members. Most other quantities affecting the problem are less basic and are liable\nto frequent change, such as loads on the system, or constraints on the system, or partitions\non the system from which response information is desired. The scheme for managing these\nvarying conditions is based on sets.\n\nAs many sets of varying conditions that one desires may be assembled in a pool of\ninformation. These sets wl remain dormant until they are individually activated. The\nil\nanalyst consequently is in a position to exercise quite precise control in the Case Control\nSection of the program by creating subcases wherein any of a particular load, a particular\nconstraint, a particular spectrum, a particular sequence of time steps, or a particular series of\noutput quantities and output locations can be activated from the data pool merely by\nspecifying the appropriate set identifiers. As many subcases can be prepared for a single\ncomputer submittal as is convenient for the analyst.\nThe quantities that fall under the surveillance of the Case Control Section are kept in a\ntable. In keeping with the open-ended spirit of the program, the table can be augmented so\nthat unique quantities pertaining to other disciplines can be accommodated.\nAnother hierarchy of control is exercised to distinguish among major options within\nthe program. This does not operate on the basis of sets but by fixed names. This portion\nis called the Executive Control Section.\n\nPlotter Independence\nAll interfacing between the solution results and the plotters that will be used to display\nthem is confined to a section of the program called the Plot Module. The sorting by sets,\nthe projection, the orientation, the color, labeling, and the general commands to produce\nthese effects are accomplished without regard to the display hardware. A small translator\nsubroutine will convert these plot commands from general internal expression to specific\ncommands for execution on individual plotting machines. In this instance again, the general\npurpose character has been preserved with essential plotter independence.\n\nADAPTATION TO OTHER DISCIPLINES\nThe ease with which the current NASTRAN general purpose organization can serve\nother disciplines will be examined by major program units. The reason for adaptation is to\nprovide a general purpose applications program as opposed to a special purpose program.\nExecutive\nThe general purpose character of the Executive Section can make it immediately adaptable to other disciplines. The link/overlay management amply provides\nfor the needs of most applications. The lean organization of having only a central driver\npermanently resident in core along with its vital tables, while all other Executive functions\nare provided by modules that are brought in temporarily to perform their jobs and then\nvacate core, is a concept that warrants preserving. The interrelationships between the\nExecutive operations and computer operating systems have already been made and should\ncertainly not be duplicated unnecessarily. When other computers have been added to the\nNASTRAN set, these too will become publicly available.\nModules\nThe particulars of a given discipline with respect to Functional Modules are considered here. It appears that if a discipline is based on potential theory., just as structural\nmechanics is based on the linear theory of elasticity, the existing Functional Modules could\nnicely serve merely by a change of name. If this is so, the existing forms could be preserved\nin their applications to another discipline simply by providing a new mask for input card\nmnemonics, headings of the output listings, and terms in the diagnostic messages. Because\nelectrical engineering is based upon the potential theory. of electromagnetics, we can draw\n\n21\n\non analogies in NASTRAN. The existing Mass Properties Module could apply to an\nInductance Property Generator; the existing Elastic Property Module could\nCapacitance Property Generator; and the existing Damping Property Module could apply\nto a Resistance Property Generator. Geometry Processor Modules could apply to the\ndescription of the Circuit/Nodal Pattern, while the Load Generator Module could apply to\nthe External Voltage Array (or. the Potential Gradient) at Nodes. Similar reasoning can be\nused in optics, electronics, and fluid flow. Presuming the universality of some of the\nFunctional Modules, it is germane to return to the Executive Modules. IFP\'s can be\npreserved with respect to data input card reading and data block generation. Adaptation\nto electrical engineering would require a new mask for the terms in diagnostic messages\nconcerning legality of input.\nCompiler\nOne would not expect too much similarity between the way problem types\nare formed in different disciplines. It is reasonable to assume then that the catalogue\nof statements referring to the module executions for various problem types would be\ncompletely replaced. Because the sequence of statements is written in DMAP language, the\ncreation of \'a new library of problem types is relatively trivial. The compiler and the\ngeneration of the OSCAR would remain intact. Quite possibly some new Functional\nModules may want to be added to the existing structural set to round out the field for a\ngiven discipline, such as the counterpart to the Stress Data Recovery Module. Each discipline\nwill probably have unique collateral characteristics recoverable from the solution vector.\nIn summary, a new discipline may provide a new name for the solution vector, such\nas acidity, voltage, humidity, light intensity, or population instead of elastic deformation,\nbut most of the working portion of the program can probably be preserved with only a\nreplacement mask for the names assigned to data.\nThe important factor in the ability to convert the program to other disciplines is the\ngeneral purpose management approach in the Executive. Even though a few new modules\nand all new problem types will need to be added, the open-ended design will allow them to\nbe easily integrated. Of course, it is a grubby job to comb through the code to prepare a\nnew language mask, but the point to be made is that it is a relatively minor task compared\nto the generation of an entirely new general purpose applications program.\n22\n\nOne of the huge benefits of adapting an existing general purpose applications program\nlike NASTRAN to another discipline is the freedom from a major debugging exercise. The\ncorollary advantage is the reliance on,future maintenance that NASA is currently practicing.\n\nIMPACT ON THE STRUCTURES COMMUNITY\nIn narrowing the topic of discussion to general purpose programs in structural engineering only, it.is interesting to indulge in some philosophical reflections.\nSome sort of analysis has always been part of the design process in structural engineering,\nbut until recently, analyses have been limited to the engineer\xe2\x80\x99s ability to solve only simpler\napproximations to the real structure and the usual attempt was to solve a pair of such\napproximations to bracket the real case. Analysis has advanced to the point where a very\nclose representation of complicated three-dimensional structures is now possible. Because\nthere was uneven advancement of structural analysis capability by problem type, for years\nthere was a tendency to limit one\xe2\x80\x99s analytical skill to one or two specialties. A sufficiently\nbroad range of structural Frgblem types has advanced enough to warrant the investment in\ngeneral purpose programs. Having access to general purpose programs, the structural\nanalyst at long last is abandoning his fragmented approach to analysis and is applying a\ncohesive approach. As a result, analysis is now coming into its own as a vital part in the\ndecision-making process of structural design.\nThe aerospace industry is a heavy user of analysis for structures. Here a large variety\nof tried-and-true special purpose programs does most of the analytical tasks. The full range\nof structural problems is generally being dealt with analytically in the aerospace industry.\nEngineers, however, are finding an increasing need to communicate analytical data. They\nwould like to feed data that are being output from one special purpose program as the input\nto another special purpose program; but they find that they are frustrated by the lack of\ncompatibility. A general purpose program on the other hand has the solution capability of\nthe combined special purpose programs with no commensurability nor compatibility\nproblems. In addition, the continual updating of some of the major general purpose\nprograms is causing general purpose programs to enjoy increased popularity.\nThe civil engineering profession is rapidly moving toward analysis as an everyday\ntool. Static analyses for stress and deflection responses dominate the activity in civil\n\n23\n\nengineering problems; however, vibration analysis is on the increase. Only an occasional\nattempt is made at solving transients and most of these are from seismic excitation.\nBecause their problems can become quite large, civil engineers are making use of general\npurpose programs.\nMachinery manufacturers show the most diversity in their attitude toward analysis.\nThe automotive and turbine industries head the list of those pledged to analysis; mining\nis the least active. As to the range of problem types, heavy industry is also the most\nvaried. Boiler people are about the only oms doing random analyses. Rotating machinery\ndesigners are analyzing for vibrations. Statics is definitely the most popular. In several\nyears, it is expected that heavy industry will become more involved with analysis.\nEconomics tends to prevent the use of analysis in consumer goods. Only on\noccasion when a sticky local problem is annoying him will a consumer goods manufacturer ask an engineering analyst to bail him out. Usually such problems are solved by\nconsultants rather than by in-house engineers. It is not easy to say how big a part\nanalysis will play in the design cycle of consumer goods in the years to come.\n\nAs part of the structures community, universities are showing an increased awareness of\nproduction analytical tools as opposed to those that concentrate on academic niceties.\nProbably general purpose programs will have the most far-reaching impact on engineering\ncolleges and on the way that the engineering profession is practiced. The structural\nfield has been fragmented into civil engineers, mechanical engineers, and aeronautical\nengineers. In industry the profession was further fragmented into dynamicists, thermal\nspecialists, hydraulic engineers, propulsion specialists, weights engineers, and stochastics\nsr>ecialists. With the advent of general purpose programs, the tools are at the disposal of\nevery engineer, enabling him to readily inquire into a host of problems. General purpose\nanalytical capability will give rise to the education and training of engineers with broader\nbackgrounds. Eventually they will become structural engineers spanning the whole range\nfrom statics through thermal to dynamics.\n\nSOCIAL IMPACT\nIncreased emphasis on analysis is bound to have an influence on deemphasizing\nsome activities and promoting still others. The extensive development of general purpose\n\n24\n\nprograms is symbolic of the maturity of analysis. As such, a revolution of sorts is being\nset into motion. The social impact of this revolution will be the realignment of the\nwork force.\nUntil recently, the structural engineer has depended upon testing to serve two\nmasters: as a proof of design and as a proof of manufacture. Constant improvement in\ninstrumentation and test equipment has enhanced the dependency on testing. As an\nengineer becomes more proficient at analysis, he will find that the cost of using analysis\n\nfor design certification will be far less than that of testing and that the time lapse between\nthe completion of a design and the performance results will be far shorter. Lastly, he will\ndiscover that he will be able to inquire into the behavior of locations that were too remote\nto be accessible by instrumentation. The triple impact of less cost, less time, and more\ncomplete information will wean designers away from testing for design certification. W\ne\npredict that analysis will eventually take its proper place so that the roles of analysis and\ntesting can be encapsulated asAnalysis is for proof of design.\nTesting is for proof of manufacture.\n\nThis does not mean, of course, that no testing will be used for proof of design. For\ninstance, photoelastic testing of machine parts with severe stress gradients will certainly\nremain as a practical check of design. For the most part, however, it is safe to say that\nanalysis will invade the province of testing as the primary tool for checking on designs.\nWhat will be the social impact of this shift of emphasis away from testing? It\nmeans that less mechanical test equipment will be manufactured, fewer testing laboratories\nwill survive, and fewer testing personnel will be employed. The demand for the manufac-\n\nture of test articles will slacken, with its attendant reduction in the need for model builders.\n\nAs the dependency on analysis increases, the need for digital programmers will be\nfelt in the areas of debugging, advanced module writing for updating programs, the writing\nof pre-processors and post-processors to take the drudgery out of data handling, and the\nintensification of the writing of support routines for on-line interactive graphics. The net\neffect will be increased business for software houses and their increased employment\nof programmers.\n\nProbably the design cycle will change to the extent that some design tasks will be\ndone by the computer instead of being strictly the province of the designer. Conceivably\nfor highly complicated structures, the task of producing the initial design would devolve\non a highly creative designer. Subsequent tasks would be performed by structural\nanalysts on the computer, first to analyze, then to synthesize in response to the characteristics shown by analysis, and last to optimize for achieving the most acceptable design\nwith respect to a parmeter such as cost or weight. Probably a minimum of demand for\ndetailing the parts of the conceptual design will be made during the computer phase of\nthe design evolution. At the termination of the computer phase, designers and detail\ndraftsmen will be needed to make final manufacturing drawings. The social impact of\nreemphasis on the computer during the design stage will be the increased demand for\nhighly creative designers and decreased demand for routine designers and detail draftsmen.\nThere will also be an increase in demand for engineers who are structural analysts.\nThe shift in emphasis toward analysis should not have a depressing effect on the\nsmall design office or small consulting businesses. Even though the small offices cannot\nafford to install their own computers, they can nevertheless operate all of the latest\nanalytical tools in support of these tasks. Fortunately, hardware technology has kept\npace with software technology and the little man did not get caught in the squeeze.\nComputer terminals have come to the rescue of the small design offices. They can communicate via the terminals to the central computers operated by such companies as\nMcDonnell Automation, CDC\'s Cybernet, CSC\'s Infonet, and IBMs Service Bureau. A\nrather complete library of structural analysis programs is available at these central\ncomputer installations to support the range of problems that the remote offices need to\nsolve.\nThe social impact of this remote terminal support wl be to preserve small business\nil\nand to stimulate competition. Small design and consulting firms will be maintained and\n\nwill possibly grow. Business from these numerous smaller f m s should contribute to the\nincentives for competition among terminal manufacturers and among central computer\noperators. The demand for repairmen should offer new employment.\nFinally, the increase in structural analysis has produced a further need for plotting\nequipment. The computer printout is an orderly form of record-keeping but is too\n26\n\nawkward for digesting the quantity of data that gush from these new analytical pi-ograms.\nPlotters and cathode ray display tubes are starting to fill this need. More and more clever\nways of presenting plotted data are abetting programming employment. This mode of\ndata reduction is also helping the plotter manufacturer and his staff of repairmen as well.\nIn presenting the social side of the trends in structural analysis, we plead that we\nhave painted only a qualitative picture. W have not braved the more risky path of\ne\nreducing these social effects into quantitative values in manpower or in a time frame.\nNevertheless, we firmly believe that a minor revolution is currently in motion and that\nthis revolution will not reach its full development for another 5 years. NASTRAN is an\nimportant influence in provoking this ferment. It is well checked out and available to\nthe general public at a nominal cost. Its general purpose character and its degree of\nmachine and plotter independence make it particularly attractive to those who are looking\ntoward longevity of methods.\n\n27\n\nBUCKLING ANALYSIS OF A MISSILl3 INTERSTAGE\nB David P.

Wight\nNASA Goddard Space Flight Center\n\nSUMMARY\nThe computer run time required for a buckling analysis using NASTRAN is considerably greater than for a linear static analysis of the same structure. For this reason it\nis very important to obtain an optimal model size for the structure being analyzed, such\nthat the model is neither so large as to increase running time unnecessarily, nor so small\nas to hinder accuracy. This paper studies the problem of critical load accuracy versus\nmodel complexity for a thin walled cylinder, using both Level 1 2 and Level 15 NASTRAN\nreleases.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nBuckling is generally the failure mode for thin-walled shells carrying axially compressive loads and NASTRAN has the capability of solving for the critical load of such\nproblems. The problem which initially stimulated interest in this study was the buckling\nanalysis of a thin,walled cone to be used on a NASA spacecraft. NASTRAN analysis yielded\na wide range of answers by varying the finite element model used. No analytical solutions\ncould be found for buckling of a cone which could be used to verify the NASTRAN results.\nTherefore the buckling analysis of a thin-walled cylinder of approximately the same dimensions as the Sone was performed to determine the model complexity needed to obtain good\nagreement between NASTRAN and analytical solutions. The cylinder analyzed is 78.12 cm\nin diameter by 55.88 cm long with a wall thickness of 0.102 cm.\nThere have been complaints about the crudeness of the NASTRAN plats element for\nbuckling analysis. (See, for example, ref. 1.) The majority of the runs made for this\nstudy used NASTRAN Level 12.1.2 on the IBM 360/95 computer at the Goddard Space Flight\nCenter. These results a r e compared to Level 15.1.0 which includes a greatly improved\nplate element for buckling. This improvement was obtained by including an improved algorithm for the bending effects, whereas Level 12 analysis relied primarily on membrane\ncontributions. A procedure was formulated to measure the effect of this improved plate\nelement, as well as verify the advertised decrease in running time for Level 15.\n\n39\n\nSYMBOLS\naa\n\nstiffness matrix\n\nKdt\nJ\n\ndifferential stiffness matrix\n\nh\n\neigenvalue\n\nU\n\neigenvector\n\nuc r\n\ncritical stress\n\nE\n\nYoungls i n d u l u s of elasticity\n\nIr\n\nPoissonls ratic,\n\nt\n\ncylinder wall thickness\n\nm\n\nnumber of half sine waves\n\nL\n\ncylinder length\n\nR\n\ncylinder radius\n\nPcr\n\ncritical load\n\nF\n\napplied axial compressive load\n\n0\n\nangle subtended by one element\n\nNASTRAN MODEL AND THEORY\n\nThe bulk data required for a NASTRAN buckling analysis (Rigid Format 5 ) is identical\nto that required for a static analysis, with the addition of an EIGB card similar to the\nEIGR card used for normal mode analysis. The steps NASTRAN uses for solving the\nbuckling problem as presented in ref. 2 are:\n1 Solve the linear statics problem ignoring differential stiffness and calculate the\n.\ninternal element forces.\n2 U s e the element forces to obtain the differential stiffness matrix.\n.\n\n3. Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors from the matrix equation:\n\n=o\nwhere the eigenvalue (A) is the factor by which the arbitrary applied load is multiplied to obtain the critical load and the eigenvector (u) represents the buckling\nmode shape.\n\nPlate elements were used to model the cylinder. The AXIS data generating program\nwas used to generate the NASTRAN data deck. (See ref. 4.) This program generates the\nGRID, CQUADB and PQUADB cards for a shell of revolution. The grid points are sequenced along circumferential rows to obtain the minimum band width and no active\ncolumns.\nThe critical load of the cylinder was obtained for various model sizes. A l of these\nl\nmodels were only portions of the complete cylinder, thus yielding only axisymmetric buckling modes. The effect of the rest of the cylinder is simulated by constraining to zero\ncertain degrees of freedom along the edge of the model as described in ref. 3. These\ndegrees of freedom are tangential translation, longitudinal rotation and radial rotation.\n(Degrees of freedom 2, 4, and 6 in Figure 1.)\n\nANALYTICAL SOLUTION\nThe analytical critical stress of a thin walled cylindrical shell under an axial compressive load is given in ref. 5 as\nUcr\n\n=\n\n12(1\n\n-\n\n112)\n\nThe number of half sine waves the cylinder buckles in is given by m in the above equation.\naf\nOnly the number of h l sine waves which produces a minimum u,, is of interest, the\nothers being fictitious numbers the cylinder will never see. This minimum occurs when\n\nAssuming the cylinder being andlyzed is made of aluminum yields:\n\nm\n\nE\nZ\n\n16\n\nu,\n,\n\n=\n\n1.0859 x lo8 newton/meter2\n\nP,,\n\n= 2.7076 x lo5 newtons\n\n41\n\nThis critical load ( P c R )was applied as a static 1\nthat the eigenvalues would approach unity as the acc\nforce (F) applied to each grid point (See Figure 1)is calculated from\n\nF = L(L)Pcr\n2 360\n\nent model so\ne value of the\n\n(4)\n\nMODEL VARIABLES AND RESULTS\nThe model parameters which were varied are: the number of longitudinal elements,\nthe number of circumferential elements, the length of the cylinder, the end fixity of the\ncylinder and the type of finite elements used. The eigenvalue (1)for each model was obtained by using NASI\'RAN.\n\nLongitudinal Elements\nThe accuracy of the solution is a function of the number of longitudinal elements, because the more elements per half sine wave the closer the actual buckling mode can be\napproximated. The purpose here is to perform a systematic variation of model complexity to obtain a curve of accuracy a s a function of model complexity. Models containing 20, 40, 60, 80 and 120 longitudinal elements were analyzed. A l l these models were\none element wide. Figure 2 plots the eigenvalue of each buckling mode for the various\nmodels as a fuuction of the number of half sine waves. The analytical solution from\nequation (2) is also plotted. As was stated before, the only points on these curves which\nhave real meaning are the minimum points. These minima are plotted to obtain thecurve\nof primary interest (Figure 3). The number of elements per half sine wave required to\nobtain a given accuracy can be read directly from the graph. Also, the increased accuracy obtained from Level 15 can be seen.\n\nCircumferential Elements\n\nA model more than one finite element wide, as has been used in ref. 1, does not\nnecessarily increase the accuracy of the critical load obtained, because we a r e dealing\nwith an axisymetric phenomenon. To study this area va.rious models of one, two and\nfour circumferential elements were investigated. Table 1 clearly shows that the accuracy\nis not a function of the number of circumferential elements, but only a function of the\nn s e r of 1ongituiiina.l elements.\n\nLength\nEquations (1) and (2) show that the critical stress, and therefore the critical load, is\nnot a function of length. Table 2 shows how this parameter was varied i n the NASTRAN\nmodel. The length of the 80celement, single-row model was cut in half and then in half\n\n42\n\nagain, keeping the same element size. The theoretical solution was verified - the critical load is independent of length. This allows one to decrease the grees of freedom of\nthe axisymmetric model and still obtain the same accuracy a s a full length model.\n\nExperimental solutions show that the critical load is independent of end fixity for\nlong cylinders. (See ref, 6 . ) Ideally, failure of a pinned-pinned cylinder will occur simultaneously a t each half sine wave along the length, but for a fixed-flxed cylinder the\nfailure will occur near the center where the amplitude of the half sine wave is the same\nas that for a pinned-pinned condition as shown in Figure 4.\nTable 3 shows the results of varying the end f x t of the NASTRAN model. The variiy\niation in critical load is less than one percent. This fact relieves the ana3yst of the burden of accurately approximating the actual end conditions of a thin-walled cylinder experiencing buckling.\n\nType of Finite Elements\nThe use of triangular plates instead of quadrilateral plates will double the number of\nfinite elements while keeping the degrees of freedom and the bandwidth, and therefore the\ndecomposition time, constant. In the problem being studied this was done by dividing\ndiagonally the quadrilateral plates, as shown in Figure 5. This substitution increased the\naccuracy of the solution as shown in Table 4. In the case being studied quadrilateral plates\nwere more convenient, however, because the AXIS program generates quadrilateral plate\nelements.\n\nLEVELS O F NASTRAN\n\nA s was shown earlier in Figure 1,the improved plate element of Level 15 offers a\ngreat improvement in the accuracy of the critical loads obtained using Rigid Format 5.\nThis allows the user to decrease the model size and still obtain the same accuracy as\nLevel 12. Another great improvement in Level 15 is the decrease in running time for\nbuckling problems. Running time for a fiaite-element model with a given bandwidth and\nnumber of degrees of freedom is reduced by a factor between 3 and 4, as shown in Table\n\n5\n.\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nMany things can be done to reduce the computer time required to do a NASTRAN\nbuckling analysis of a thin-walled cylinder. The optimal number of elements per half sine\nwa,ve can be obtained from the graph of accuracy versus number of elements. For\n\n43\n\n&symmetric buckling no increase in accuracy is obtained by increasing the number of\nrows of elements modeled. The critical load was found to be independent of length, allowing a reduction in model size. The use of triangular plate elements is recommended\nfor improved accuracy, unless a data-generating program that producsa quadrilateral\nplate elements is being used. Finally, Level 15 offers an increase in accuracy and a decrease in running time over the previous Level 12 NASTRAN.\nAlthough this paper dealt with a thin-walled cylinder, which is easily solved by analytical methods, the conclusions reached me applicable to other problems which are more\ndifficult to solve analytically. These problems include stiffened cylinders, thin-walled\ncones and cylinders wi\xe2\x82\xach variable wall thickness.\n\nREFERENCES\n1\n.\n\nBrolliar, Richard H. : A NASTRAN Buckling Analysis of a Large Stiffened Cylindrical Shell with a Cutout.

In the\no r b i t e r configuration shown i n f i g u r e 1, t h e tank was i n t e g r a t e d i n t o t h e\no r b i t e r as p a r t of t h e primary fuselage s t r u c t u r e and, t h e r e f o r e , was\nsubjected t o o v e r a l l s t r u c t u r a l loads, such as a x i a l compression, i n addition\nt o t h e loads induced by i n t e r n a l pressure. The f a b r i c a t i o n method s e l e c t e d\nf o r t h e tank required t h a t s e c t i o n s of t h e tank approximately 3.0 m (10 f t )\ni n length be joined by f u l l circumferential welds. Automatic welding was\ns e l e c t e d as t h e method t o provide t h e weld q u a l i t y required, but automatic\nwelding equipment would not function s a t i s f a c t o r i l y i n t h e cusp formed by\nt h e i n t e r s e c t i o n of t h e two cylinders. Therefore, a l o c a l p e r t u r b a t i o n from\nt h e double-bubble shape was required t o provide an acceptable r a d i u s on the\n\n53\n\nI\n\nshell wall, as shown in figure 2.\nThe selection of an analysis method for the problem was limited by the\ncomplexity of the structure. The lack of axisymmetry precluded the use of\nshell-of-revolution programs for other than preliminary studies of modeling requirements and the existing form of a general shell program, STAGS, (ref. 1) was\nincapable of analyzing the shell with the perturbed shape. Thus, recourse to a\nfinite element technique was required for detailed analysis.\nThe purpose*ofthis paper is to present the results of a study using\nNASTRAN to determine the effect of the shape perturbation on the stress distribution and axial buckling load of the tank. A secondary purpose is to\npresent some observations based on experience gained during the study in the\nuse of NASTRAN for shell analyses.\nPRELIMINARY STUDIES\nShell-of-Revolution Study\n\nA preliminary study of a ring- and integral-stringer stiffened cylindrical\nshell having the same diameter and stiffener dimensions as one lobe of the\ntank was made using the shell-of-revolution analysis of reference 2 to gain\nsome insight into modeling requirements for the tank analysis. Simply\nsupported cylinders with a length equal to (1) a complete lobe between end\ndomes, and (2) one bay of a lobe between tank rings were analyzed for a loading\nconsisting of positive internal lateral pressure and net axial compressive\nloads. The results of this study (fig. 3) are that the longer cylinder (with\nrings and stringers considered distributed) buckles axisymmetrically and hence\nis independent of the ratio of the hoop stress resultant/axial stress resultant\n(Ny/Nx). The buckling mode half-wave length of 23.0 cm (9.1 in.) approximates\nhalf the bay length between rings. The shorter cylinder buckles asymmetrically\nfor small negative values of N /N but approaches the analytical buckling\nY x\xe2\x80\x99\nload of the longer cylinder and buckles axisymmetrically with a half-wave\nlength of 25.4 cm (10.0 in.) for values of N /N less than about -1.0.\nY X\nThese results and the details of the tank geometry, stiffness, and loads\n( /N < - 1 for the stiffened area of the tank) suggest that a satisfactory\nN\nY X\napproximation to the complete double-bubble tank could be obtained by limiting\nthe model to one-half of one bay longitudinally and about twice that distance\ncircumferentially to give a model covering an area of 25.4 by 55.4 cm\na . The effect of the remainder of the structure was\n(10 by 21.8 in.) (fig. 2 )\nincluded by the use o f assumed boundary conditions.\nModeling Detail Studies\nSeveral short studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of modeling\ndetails on the NASTRAN results. rn one study, the effect of radius to\nthickness ratio (R/t) on the axisymmetric buckling load of an unstiffened\n\n54\n\ncylinder was calculated using N S R N with a model composed completely of\nAT A\nAT A\nq u a d r i l a t e r a l elements (CQUAD2). For dimensions similar t o t h e N S R N\ndemonstration problem (R/t of 32,\'ref. 3 ) , t h e buckling load was 1 . 4 percent\nabove t h e c l a s s i c a l buckling load and the buckling mode shape was t h e\nc l a s s i c a l shape of two longitudinal half-waves. A s R/t was increased for a\nmodel containing t h e same number of elements (by decreasing t h e s h e l l thickness), the discrepancy between buckling loads calculated with N S R N and\nAT A\nthose obtained from c l a s s i c a l theory increased t o 6.8 percent a t R/ of 320.\nt\nIn addition, t h e N S R N analysis predicted a mode shape with s i x half-waves\nAT A\ncompared t o seven f o r t h e c l a s s i c a l solution. The increase i n t h e number of\nhalf-waves with an increase i n R/ requires more severe element deformation\nt\nand i s probably t h e cause f o r t h e increased discrepancy. These r e s u l t s\nsuggest t h a t f o r axisymmetric buckling problems, t h e number of elements per\nhalf-wave should be g r e a t e r than t h e value of 3.3 obtained i n t h e reduced\nthickness demonstration problem (R/t = 320).\nAnother modeling d e t a i l study was designed t o check t h e modeling of t h e\nlongitudinally s t i f f e n e d a r e a of t h e tank, A s t i f f e n e d c i r c u l a r cylinder of\nt h e same dimensions as one bay of the tank loaded by i n t e r n a l pressure and\na x i a l forces was analyzed using NASTRAN. BAR elements with bending stiffness\nwere used i n modeling t h e s t i f f e n e r s t o obtain t h e proper combination of\na x i a l and bending s t i f f n e s s and adequate d e t a i l of s t r e s s output. However,\nmodeling of a longitudinal s t i f f e n e r as an o f f s e t BAR element produced unreasonable discrepancies i n t h e s t r e s s e s i n adjacent elements when r a d i a l\nexpansion of t h e end of t h e cylinder was prevented e i t h e r by a r i n g o r by\nr a d i a l displacement boundary conditions. A q u a d r i l a t e r a l shear panel between\nthe beam element and the s h e l l was used t o improve the model. Figure 4 shows\nt h e stresses due t o a s t a t i c loading i n a longitudinal s t i f f e n e r with and\nwithout t h e q u a d r i l a t e r a l shear panels i n t h e model.

This buckling load was about 2 percent higher than t h a t given by\nthe s h e l l analysis of reference 2 and the buckling mode shape which had\ntwo half-waves was t h e same as t h a t given by t h e s h e l l analysis. I t would\nappear, therefore, t h a t the addition of longitudinal s t i f f e n e r s t o the\nr e l a t i v e l y t h i n s h e l l with an R/t of 1277 increases t h e l o c a l moment of\ni n e r t i a s u f f i c i e n t l y t o force a longer wave length f o r t h e buckling mode\nshape of the s t i f f e n e d s h e l l (10 elements per half-wave) and thus provides\n\n55\n\nsatisfactory correlation between buckling predictions made with the use of\nclassical theory and NASTRAN.\nIn the final modeling detail study, the validity of representing a\ncomplete cylinder by use of a single bay of that cylinder with assumed\nboundary conditions to simulate the remainder of the cylinder was evaluated\nby comparing the axisymmetric buckling load for a complete multi-bay cylinder\nwith that for a single bay cylinder with assumed boundary conditions. NASTRAN\nwas used to calculate the axisymmetric buckling load and mode shape of a\n)\ncomplete five-bay cylinder. The cylinder selected (fig. 5 had relatively\nlight rings and shorter end bays with rotationally restrained ends to insure\nbuckling in the center portion. The loads were internal lateral pressure\nand enforced axial displacement. For the buckling calculation, the axial\nrestraint was removed by the use of an ALTER package provided the NASTRAN\nSystems Management Office by Malcolm W. Ice of Boeing Computer Sciences, Inc.\nThe buckling load for the five-bay cylinder was essentially the same as for\nthe single bay cylinder and the bdckling mode shape (fig. 5 is antisymmetric\n)\nabout the centerline, but the node locations do not occur at the frames.\nThis may be due to the small frame extensional stiffness which is only about\n12 percent of the shell extensional stiffness in the hoop direction. This\nagreement in the axisymmetric buckling loads for the two cylinders indicates\nthat the use of assumed boundary conditions is satisfactory even with the use\nof light rings which do not force nodes to occur at the rings.\nDOUBLE-BUBBLE TANK STUDY\nModel and \'Loads\nThe tank was analyzed both with and without the shape perturbation to\ndetermine its effect on deflections, stresses, and buckling loads. The part\nof the double-bubble tank that was modeled is shown in figure 2, and the\nfinite element model, a contour plot of the shape perturbation, and the shell\nthickness are shown in figure 6. The cylindrical portions of the shell were\nmodeled with flat quadrilateral elements having membrane and bending\nproperties (CQUAD2). The transition section of the perturbation was modeled\nwith triangular elements having similar properties (CTRIA2). The integral\nlongitudinal stiffeners were modeled as offset BAR elements with quadrilateral\nshear panels to provide a better approximation of the local shear transfer\n)\nmechanism as determined in the preliminary studies (see fig. 4 . The frame\nsection was composed of rod elements and quadrilateral and triangular membrane\nelements. The frame was considered to elastically restrain the tank in the\nplane of the frame, but buckling of the frame was prevented by the imposition\nof deflection constraints normal to the plane of the frame.\nTo simulate the effect of the remainder of the structure on the portion\nof the tank that was modeled, appropriate restraint conditions were assumed\nfor the boundaries of the model. Symmetric boundary conditions were assumed\nalong the centerline of the double-bubble tank for both the prestress (static)\nand buckling computations. Symmetric boundary conditions were assumed along\n\nthe o u t e r edge p a r a l l e l t o the tank c e n t e r l i n e f o r both p r e s t r e s s and\nbuckling computations. O the boundaries a t the frame and along t h e bay\nn\nc e n t e r l f n e , zero r o t a t i o n i n t h e circumferential d i r e c t i o n was assumed f o r\nt h e p r e s t r e s s c a l c u l a t i o n s . F o r buckling, four combinations of symmetric\nand antisymmetric r e s t r a i n t s were used t o i n s u r e t h a t the minimum value of\nt h e buckling load was obtalned.\n\nThe loads imposed f o r p r e s t r e s s on the double-bubble tank r e s u l t e d from\na p o s i t i v e i n t e r n a l pressure of 207 kN/m2 (30.0 p s i ) and an enforced axial\ndisplacement of 0.051 c m (0.020 i n . ) , which corresponds t o a s t r a i n of 0,002.\nThe enforced displacement was used t o simulate o v e r a l l compression of a\ns t r u c t u r e of v a r i a b l e thickness a t a d i s t a n t location from t h e ends of t h e\ns t r u c t u r e . This combination of loads produces a stress r e s u l t a n t r a t i o\nAT A\nN / N of approximately -1.1.

In both cases, buckling\noccurred a t an eigenvalue less than 1.0 i n d i c a t i n g that t h e assumed p r e s t r e s s\nloading was higher than the buckling load.

A t t h e o u t e r\nboundary (right edge), t h e mode shape becomes symmetric due t o t h e assumed\nboundary conditions and t h e presence of t h e maximum r a d i a l displacement on\nt h i s boundary i n d i c a t e s t h a t an extension of t h e model i n t h e circumferential\nd i r e c t i o n would probably be d e s i r a b l e t o reduce t h e effect of t h e boundary\nconditions on the mode shape.

A\n\n58\n\ncomparison of t h e run times f o r the first three problems [NASTRAN demonstrat i o n problem and the demonstratlon problem with reduced thickness) shows t h a t\nrun times may vary considerably f o r what appears t o be a similar problem.

The presence of cutouts in the sides\nof these structures can significantly reduce their load carrying capability\nas well as complicate the buckling analysis.\nA limited number of experimental (refs, 1, 2, and 3) and finitedifference analytical (refs, 3 and 4) studies ofthe effects of cutouts on\ncylindrical shell buckling behavior have been reported. These investigations\nhave been limited to isotropic cylinders with unreinforced circular cutouts\nand reinforced and unreinforced rectangular cutouts.\nCurrent activities at the Langley Research Center include testing and\nanalysis of small scale isotropic cylinders and very large waffle stiffened\ncylinders with cutouts. The NASTRAN finite-element program was used to\nperform the analytical studies of the buckling characteristics of these\ncylinders, Analytical studies were made of an isotropic cylinder with a\nsingle circular cutout at +,hemidlength of the cylinder and a waffle stiffened\ncylinder with two diametrically opposed\'rectangular cutouts at midlength,\nThe sizes of the cutouts were changed to determine the effect on the buckling\nload. The current paper describes the details of the NASTFUN analysis,\npresents some of the analytical results, and makes a comparison with exgerimental results for the buckling of a typical isotropic cylinder with a\ncircular cutout.\nTEST CYLINDERS\nIsotropic Cylinder\nThe isotropic cylindrical shell test specimen studied in this investigation was 25.4 cm long, had a shell radius of 10.2 cm and a wall thickness\nof 0 0 5 cm. The test specimen was made from Mylar1 polyester film. The\n.2\nmodulus of elasticity of this material was experimentally determined to be\n2\nequal to 5.0 GN/m and Poisson\'s ratio was taken from reference 5 to be\nequal to 0 3 A series of single circular cutouts with selected radii\n..\n\'DuPont\n\n74\n\nr e g i s t e r e d trademark-\n\nranging up t o approximately 3 1 c were cut i n t o t h e cylinder w a l l at mid\'1 m\nlength.\n\nThick aluminum end p l a t e s were attached t o t h e ends of t h e cylinder\n\nt o provide a clamped end boundary condition,\n\nA concentrated compressive\n\nforce was applied at t h e center of t h e top end p l a t e .\nWaffle Stiffened Cylinder\nA l a r g e waffle s t i f f e n e d c y l i n d r i c a l shell soon t o be t e s t e d i s i l l u s t r a t -\n\ned i n f i g u r e 1.

Five cutout radii\nwere considered ranging from approximately 0.406 cm to 1 2 cm and the\n.7\ncorresponding models contained from 334 to 362 grid points. CQUAD2 and CTRIA2\nplate elements were used to model the shell wall. Only symmetric boundary\nconstraints were considered along the artificial boundary lines to limit the\ncomputational costs.\nWaffle Stiffened Cylindrical Models\nFour separate models were used in studying the buckling behavior of the\n\nwaffle stiffened cylinder shown in figure 1 Details ofthe four models are\n.\npresented in figure 4. The first configuration (model A ) was a model of\nthe complete cylinder without cutouts. The uniformly spaced network of 540\ngrid points used for this model consisted of nine axial stetions and sixty\ncircumferential stations. The second configuration (model B) was a oneeighth cylindrical segment with grid point spacing identical to model A and\nincluded 80 grid points. The third configuration (model C) was developed\nfrom model B by removing two grid points and the associated elements in order\nto represent two diametrically opposed cutouts at the cylinder midlength. The\ncutouts in the cylinder represented by model C were rectangular and have a\ncircumferential arc length and axial length equal to 0.64 ~1 and 0. 60 m\nrespectively. The actual cylinder shown in figure 1 was modeled using CQUAD2\nflat plate elements to represent the skin and CBAR elements to represent the\nrings and stringers. Since the spacing of rings and stringers was closer for\nthe actual cylinder than for model C, equivalent properties were assigned to\nthe CBAR elements on the PBAR card. Each CQUAD2 element was bounded on all\nfour sides by a CBAR element. The fourth configuration (model D) was a l s o a\none-eighth cylindrical segment representing a cylinder with two equal\ndiametrically opposed rectangular cutouts. Two cutout sizes were considered\nfor model D; one with dimensions 0.61 m by 0.69 m,and the other with\ndimensions 0.91 m by 0.69 m in the circumferential and axial directions,\nrespectively. The grid point network in the vicinity of the hoiz was refined\nfor model D such that a skin panel bounded by rings and stringers was represented by four CQUAD2 plate elements.\n\nCTRIA2 plate

The CPU time t o generate t h e s e two r e s u l t s w a s 5.5 minutes f o r model B\n1\n\nand 79 minutes f o r model A.\n\nAlthough a l l e i g h t combinations of symmetry and\n\nantisymmetry were not executed f o r model B, it i s projected t h a t even i f they\nhad been, t h e cumulative t i m e would have been l e s s than t h a t required f o r t h e\ns o l u t i o n f o r t h e e n t i r e cylinder (model A ) ,\n\nI n addition, a l a r g e r core\n\nstorage i s required f o r t h e execution of the e n t i r e cylinder model.\n\n82\n\nBuckling results obtained using models C and D for a simply supported\ncylinder containing two diametrically opposed holes are presented in table I1\nas cases 3 and 4. The hole sizes for these two models were slightly different\ndue to differences in modeling. The critical compressive buckling loads are\nin relatively close agreement (within eight percent).\n\nContour plots of the\nbuckling mode shapes for the two mdels is presented in figure 8.\nDisplacements have been normalized with respect to the maximum displacement\namplitude which has been scaled to a value of 100. A discussion of the\ncontour plotting technique is presented in reference 12. These two mode\nshapes are similar in character with the largest displacements occurring in\nthe vicinity of the cutout. Although it is assumed for this solution that\nsymmetric constraints exist along the three artificial boundaries (lines 2,\n3, and 4 in figure 2), it may be assumed from a study of the displacement\ncontour plots that it probably would not be necessary to exercise a l l eight\ncombinations of symmetric and antisymmetric constraints to obtain the lowest\neigenvalue. For example, an antisymmetric constraint along line 2 should\nyield essentially the same result as a symmetric constraint along this line\nsince the magnitudes of the buckling displacements in the vicinity of line 2\nare relatively small. The difference in the critical buckling load for\nmodels C and D with clamped case I boundary conditions (cases 5 and 6 ) was\ntwelve percent. As for the simple support case, the buckling mode shapes\nwere similar.\nThere was approximately a five percent decrease in the buckling load\nfor cylinders with clamped case I1 boundary conditions (cases 7 and 8 in\ntable 11) when the circumferential hole dimension was increased by\napproximately fifty percent. Apparently, the rings and stringers in the\nvicinity of the hole are sufficiently stiff to allow a redistribution of the\nprebuckling stress to prevent significant decreases in the buckling load.\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nN S R N has been used t o study t h e complex problem of t h e buckling of\nAT A\nc y l i n d r i c a l shells w i t h and without cutouts.\n\nReasonably acceptable agreement\n\nw i t h known a n a l y t i c a l results was achieved f o r i s o t r o p i c and waffle s t i f f e n e d\n\ncylinders without cutouts when t h e appropriate prebuckling and buckling\nboundary conditions were imposed.\n\nThe capability of imposing d i f f e r e n t pre-\n\nbuckling and buckling boundary conditions (which i s usually required f o r a\nl i n e a r bifurcation buckling analysis) was made possible through the use of a\n\nDMAP a l t e r sequence.\n\nFor isotropic cylinders w i t h cutouts it was found t h a t\n\nN S R N provided an upper bound f o r available experimental r e s u l t s f o r s m a l l\nAT A\ncutouts, and provided solutions lower than t h e experimental r e s u l t s f o r large\ncutouts.\n\nFor the l a r g e cutouts, the nonlinearities of t h e problem become\n\npronounced, and therefore the l i n e a r bifurcation buckling analysis capability\nof NASTRAN cannot be expected t o provide more than an approximation t o the\nsolution.\nThe computational cost of conducting a buckling analysis f o r a structure\ni s several times the cost of performing a s t a t i c s t r e s s analysis f o r the same\n\nTherefore, the user of Rigid Format 5 should seriously consider ways\n\nmodel.\n\nt o reduce computational costs and t h e p o t e n t i a l l y high demands placed on\nthe computational f a c i l i t y .\n\nI n general, taking advantage of problem loading\n\nand geometric symmetries can reduce the cost of preforming a buckling analysis.\nAn argument can a l s o be made t h a t it i s usually cost e f f e c t i v e t o s e l e c t an\n\neigenvalue search range on t h e EIGB card which is l e s s than t h e expected\neigenvalue t o insure t h a t the lowest root i s obtained and therefore, t h a t a\nr e s t a r t i s not required.\n\nIt i s recognized that some modules within t h e Rigid\n\nFormat 5 DMAP sequence have g r e a t e r storage requirements than others.\nAdditional computational cost reductions and improvements i n f a c i l i t y management could be made i f it were possible t o determine core storage requirements\nf o r c e r t a i n DMAP modules before the module i s executed.\n\nWith t h i s information\n\nit would be possible t o adjust core storage requirements during the\nexecution of a problem t o a specified minimum and therefore release unnecessary\ncore.\n\nThis capability might be achieved automatically on c e r t a i n computer\n\nsystems or by t h e user through exercising t h e N S R N checkpoint and restart\nAT A\nfeature\n\n84\n\n.\n\nThe systematic approach used i n formulating a N S R N model s i m p l i f i e s\nAT A\nt h e t a s k of generating input data for general s h e l l s with complex geometries.\nSolutions for t h i n s h e l l buckling problems by t h e use of NASTRAN, however,\nrequire an understanding of s t r u c t u r a l behavior t o i n t e r p r e t properly t h e\n\nresults.\n\nTherefore, NASTRAN must be used with d i s c r e t i o n t o obtain buckling\n\nloads f o r general s h e l l s t r u c t u r e s because of t h e complexity of t h e problem,\nand t h e l i m i t e d reported user experience for these problems.\n\nAPPENDIX\nDMAP ALTER SEQUENCE FOR PRESCRIBING DIFFERENT\nPREBUCKLING AND BUCKLIHG BOUNDARY CO&DITIONS\nALTER 2\nFILE KDGG=APPEND,SAVE/KNN=SAVE/GM=SAVE $\nALTER\n47\nLABEL\nPOINT1 $\nALTER\n80\n/ /C , ,\nN SUB/V, ,TESTl/C , ,2/V , ,\nN\nN\nN NSKIP $\nPARAM\nCOND\nPOINT2,TEST1 $\n*ALTER\n104\nPARAM\n//C,N9MPY/V,N,NSK1P/C,N,2/C,N,1 $\nREPT\nPOINT1,l $\nLABEL\nPOINT2 $\nENDALTER\n\n* - Use ALTER\n\n109 f o r l e v e l 15 ar 104 f o r l e v e l 1 2 .\n\nThe execution o f t h e a l t e r sequence requires t h r e e subcases i n t h e Case\nControl Deck.\n\nSubcase 1 governs t h e prebuckling solution and subcases 2\n\nand 3 govern t h e buckling solution.\n\nSUBCASE 1\nLOAD =\nSPC =\n\nm\nc\n\n=\nOUTPUT\n\nSUBCASE 2\nMETHOD =\nOUTPUT\nSUBCASE 3\nSPC =\nMc =\np\nOUTPUT\n\n86\n\nREFERENCES\n1.\n\nStarnes, J, H : The Effect of a Circular Hole on the Buckling of\n.\nCylindrical Shells.

When a normal mode analysis of one of these substructures is desired, this data, along with other user supplied data, is\nloaded into NASTRAN for the dynamic portion of the analysis by means of the\ninterface program.\nThe input deck to the interface program is the NASTRAN executive control\ndeck, the case control deck, and the bulk data deck, excluding grid point and\nelement data. The interface program reads the input deck, converts any\nEBCDIC characters to BCD, and stores the card images in an output file\nfor processing by NASTRAN. When processing the bulk data deck, the stiffness\nmatrix for the substructure is inserted in its sorted position by placing\nthe stiffness coefficients on DMIG cards. Likewise, GRID cards are also\ninserted in the bulk data deck in their correct sorted position.\nAn additional program processes the original data used to generate the\nsubstructure to determine the mass at each grid point by means of the lumped\nmass method. The mass at each grid point is then partitioned out to the\nkept grid points surrounding the grid point. This program then punches CflNM2\ncards for the masses at each of the kept grid points. These cards are then\nread in as part of the bulk data input to the interface program.\nDummy rod elements are used to define the shape of the structure for\nplotting the mode shapes. To avoid changing the stiffness matrix, the rods\nare given an elastic modulus value of zero.\nGrid point constraints imposed on the structure in the in-house finite\nelement program are duplicated in the NASTRAN bulk data deck. This avoided\ncalculating extraneous eigenvalues.\nThe stiffness values on the DMIG cards are read into the normal mode\nanalysis format by means of the ALTER program shown below.\nALTER\n\n26,27\n\nMTRXIN,\n\n,~TP~~L,EQEXIN3SIL,/STIF,,/V,N,LUSET/VyN,NflMl/C3N,O/C,N,O\n$\n\nSMAl\n\nECPT ,\nGPCT , /KGGY,,\nDIT\nGPST/V, ,\nN NflGENL /V ,N,NflK4GG $\nCSTM ,MPT,\n\nADD\n\nKGGY,STIF/KGGX/C,N,(l.O,O.O)/C,N,(l.O,O.O)\n\nCHKPNT\n\nKGGX,GPST $\n\n$\n\nENDALTER\nThis is similar to the alter program given in reference 1\n.\n\n112\n\nMODIFICATIONS TO NASTRAN\nUsing the DMIG bulk data cards for inputting the stiffness matrix into\nNASTRAN creates several problems. Even though the stiffness matrix is\nsymmetric, the entire matrix has to be read in since the direct matrix input\nmethod does not take advantage of symmetry. This requires reading in nearly\ntwice as many cards as would normally be needed. When reading in large\nmatrices, such as a 184 by 184, these extra values consume several minutes of\ncomputer time in order to pass through the input file processor.\nAnother disadvantage of the direct matrix input method is that only\nsingle precision values f o r the stiffness matrix can be read in. For the\nIBM 370, single precision is only six significant figures, therefore, roundoff errors may significantly affect the accuracy of the solution. In order\nto read in six significant figures in an E field format, the large field\nformat has to be used. A sorting problem developed when the large field\nformat was used on the second DMIG type header card. The interface program\noutputs the DMIG cards in the correct sorted order such that GJ and CJ were\nin an increasing numerical order. However, NASTRAN sorted the deck with\nCJ in a decreasing numerical order. When the cards were input with CJ\nin a decrasing order, NASTRAN sorted them into the correct order of increasing\nCJ number. This problem could not be resolved, so it was reported to the\nNASTRAN system office for further study.\nThe sorting problem does not occur if the small field format is used\nfor the second type header cards. However, if the small field format is\nused, a stiffness value must be placed on this header card, and the small\nfield width does not allow inputting a stiffness value of six significant\nfigures in an E field format. To overcome this restriction, a completely\nconstrained fictitious grid point with a zero stiffness value is placed in\nthis field.\nAfter the sorting problem was corrected, problems still occurred in\ntrying to pass a large number of cards (20,000) through the input file\nprocessor. Nine minutes of central processing time failed to pass these\ncards through the XSQRT subroutine. The problem was traced to a double\nD8 L@8P in the XSQRT subroutine in which a check was made for duplicate\ncontinuation cards. It appeared that in this subroutine each continuation\ncard was compared to every other continuation card, resulting in (N)*(N-1)/2\ncomparisons. Approximately 19,000 of the 20,000 cards were continuation\n.\ncards resulting in approximately 1 8 x lo8 comparisons. At about 5 microseconds for each comparison on the IBM 370/165, it would have taken about\n900 seconds to complete this cycle. By removing this double D8 L@@P without\nany other modifications to the subroutine, the 20,000 cards were processed\nby the XS@RT subroutine in 138 seconds.\nSince most of the bulk data deck was created by\nwhich had been thoroughly checked out, and since the\nit was felt that most of the checks performed by the\nneeded. A very brief, modified version of the XSQRT\n\nthe interface program\ndata was already sorted,\nXSgRT subroutine were not\nsubroutine was created\n\ni)\nx. This modified\nespecially for use with the interface program (\nsubroutine reads in the data either from direct\n, a UMF tape, or a\ncheck point tape, and outputs the data on the NPTP file tape. This subroutine\ncan only be used for UMF tape or check pointed tape problems that require no\ncorrections to the bulk data deck. The new subroutine further reduced the\ntime to process the 20,000 cards from 138 to 79 seconds.\nInitially, an attempt was made to read in the entire mass matrix by\nmeans of DMIG cards, using the ALTER program given in reference 1 However,\n.\nthe mass matrix MGG must be opened before the program reaches the ALTER DMAP\ninstruction where the mass values, read in by the ALTER program, are added to\nMGG. If not, MGG will be an "ill defined matrix," and the addition would\nnot be possible. The mass matrix must be opened by some means at DMAP\noperation 28, where MGG is formed. The easiest method is to put in a small\nmass at any grid point. For the problems that were considered only the\ndiagonal mass terms were needed, and it was found to be easier to read\nin the mass matrix by means of the C@4\'!42 cards. This method avoids the\nill defined mass matrix problem.\nOMITTING ROTATIONAL DEGREES OF FREEDOM\nAt first, all the degrees of freedom of each grid point were passed to\nNASTRAN for the dynamic analysis. The rotational degrees of freedom were\nthen omitted in NASTRAN, since only the translational degrees of freedom\nwere needed to adequately define the fundamental modes of the structures.\nThe substructuring program was changed so that it performs a Guyan reduction\nof the stiffness matrix, omitting the rotational degrees of freedom, before\npassing the stiffness matrix to the interface program. This change has\nseveral advantages. Most of the structures considered are made up from several\nsubstructures, resulting in stiffness matrices which are densely populated.\nThe Guyan reduction process, which tends to fill up the stiffness matrix, had\nlittle effect on the fullness of the stiffness matrix passed, but it did\nsignificantly reduce the size of the matrix. The structure which initially\nrequired 20,000 cards to define the stiffness matrix was reduced to 6,000\ncards with very little change in the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Since\nthe number of cards was greatly reduced, the input file processor time\nwas reduced from 79 seconds to 27 seconds.\nThis method has the advantage that the reduction process is performed\nwith the original sixteen significant figures for each stiffness coefficient,\ninstead of the rounded off six significant figures passed to NASTRBN when\nthe rotational degrees of freedom are left in. Because these rotational\ndegrees of freedom are omitted before being passed to NASTRAN, these degrees\nof freedom have to be constrained in the bulk data deck of the NASTRAN run.\nBack substitution to obtain deflections for the rotational degrees of freedom\nis not possible with this method.\n\n114\n\nSPACE FRAME VERIFICATION PROBLEN\nFigure 1 shows a diagram of the structure used to verify the interface\nprogram. The space frame structure shown consists of 22 grid points\nconnected together by 32 rod elements. The space frame was modeled entirely\nin NASTRAN, and the resulting eigenvalues and eigenvectors were compared to\nthose obtained by modeling the space frame in the substructuring program and\npassing the stiffness matrix over to NASTRAN by means of the interface program. A NASTRAN-generated mass matrix was used for both runs, being read in\nas C m data in the interface case. The values for the 66 eigenvalues and\n@ 2\neigenvectors agreed to four significant figures. This example problem provided an assessment of the l o s s in accuracy due to the restriction of passing\nonly six significant figures for the stiffness values. A comparison of the\nstatic analysis results between the two finite element programs produced\nexact agreement for the displacements.\nThe eigenvalues and eigenvectors for the analysis in which the rotational degrees of freedom were omitted before the data was passed to\nNASTRAN were closer to the values obtained by using NASTRAN directly than those\nvalues in which the stiffness values for the rotational degrees of freedom\nwere passed to NASTRAN for omitting.\nOmitting the rotational degrees of freedom with the substructuring program\nfor the space frame increased the number of card images passed from 1,473\nto 3,674. The reason for the increase was that the stiffness matrix for the\nspace frame was very sparsely populated. The Guyan reduction process,\nalthough it reduced the size of the matrix, produced an almost fully populated\nmatrix.\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nThe interface program has been used on considerably more complicated\nstructures than the space frame shown. The largest structure analyzed was\na car body composed of 15 substructures which together contained over 3,000\ndegrees of freedom. The substructuring program was used to reduce the structure to 186 translational degrees of freedom for passage to NASTRAN for the\nnormal mode analysis. The dynamic analysis of the structure was successfully\ncompleted in 425 seconds with the input file processor requiring 137 seconds.\nThe modifications made to the XS@RT subroutine, and the use of the substructure\nprogram made this analysis technically feasible and computationally economical.\nREFERENCE\n\n1 Jones, T.

It started with existing stages that were comprised of the Thor\nfirst stage and Vanguard second and third stages. Since that time it has been\nproject policy to upgrade the Delta booster fcr increased performance and\nreliability at a minimum cost growth as shown on figure 1 The current launch\n.\nvehicle and improved configurations are shown on figure 2.\nOne of the many upgraded design features of these new Delta vehicles is\nthe incorporation of a cylindrically shaped isogrid structure. This design\nforms the external skin structure of the booster. The new tank skin is\ninitially machined from flat 1.27-em (1/2-in. ) thick 14sT6 free-machining\naluminum alloy plate, brake-formed into curved shapes, and finally welded into\n2.44-111\n(8-ft) diameter tank shells. Typical integrally machined structures,\nwaffle and isogrid, are shown in figure 3. Isogrid now replaces the less\nefficient rectangular waffle tank and skin, stringer, and frame interstage and\nfairing structures. The improved Delta isogrid tank construction is about 50\npercent more efficient (weightwise), than the waffle and equivalent in efficiency\nto the built-up assemblies with regards to compressive local and general buckling capabilities. It is also interesting to note that isogrid is orthogonally\nisotropic in its overall strain characteristics.\nThe first vehicles to employ the isogrid structure are now planned to\ncarry the IMP H and TELESAT A spacecraft into orbit by the end of this year.\nIsogrid hardware is not only being fabricated for Delta vehicles but it is also\nbeing developed for the Shuttle (ref, 1) and Skylab programs under the cognizance of MSFC and is being proposed for more efficient Delta/Agena replacement\n)\nsecond stages (fig. 4) in the Versatile Upper Stage (WS) study (ref. 2 t o\nGSFC requirements. Preliminary evaluations performed on Delta and the W S indicate that isogrid structures are approximately 50 percent the cost of skin,\nstringer, and frame structures. This was the reason why the interstage and\nfairing were designed using isogrid for new model Deltas.\nANALYSIS OF ISOGRID BY NASTRAN\nThe new structure, a relatively fine rib-node mesh, was modeled using\nNASTRAN program elements and procedures. Both static and buckling analysis\nwere performed to give the Delta project a good understanding of the new structure being designed for Delta. Loadings applied to the isogrid model initially\nwere only compression type but later were expanded to include pressure effects;\ni e , hoop loadings. The compression loading included axial compression, equiv..\nalent axial compression due to bending, and offsetting axial tension forces\npR/2 ,due to internal pressure. The buckling analysis also included, for comparison only, the effects of an external pressure loading.\n\n124\n\nPROOF OF ISOTROPY OF ISOGRID\nV\n\nFor an isogrid orientation having\nthe a\n\' and @\'\na\nperiodic grid distances\nshown to the right, it has been proven\nP\n(ref. 3) that the material has isotropic\n- a\'\n2\nelastic properties and that it obeys\nHooke\'s law.\n\nwhere the isogrid elastic modulus\nE Sy E = trE/h.\n\nE is related to the actual material modulus\n\nSubsequent to the previous analysis, the rib-and plate elements were\ncombined to produce an equivalent skin thickness t such that the booster tank\ncould be treated like an equivalent monocoque cylindrical structure. The\nequivalent monocoque skin thickness is\n\n-It+\n\ntr\n\n1.270cm\n(0.500in.)\n\nt\nThe 5 relation is important in solving f o r skin and rib compression allowables\n( ref. 4 , which are\n)\nSkin buckling :\n\nRib c r i p p l i n g :\n\nfrc =\n\nt\n\nIsogrid, being isotropic, does possess an i,-xyncrasy,\ni . e . , i t s deta 1\ns t r e s s e s must vary i n t e r n a l l y within t h e i s o g r i d depending on t h e d i r e c t i o n i n\nwhich loadings are applied.

To l e a r n more about t h i s novel s t r u c t u r e , a small f i n i t e element model\nwas fashioned using NASTRAN bar (CBAR) and t r i a n g u l a r p l a t e (CTRIA2) elements,\nf i g u r e 5. Specifically, t h i s model was prepared to check t h e o v e r a l l i s o t r o p i c\nproperty of t h e i n t e g r a l r i b and skin combination and to review t h e i n t e r n a l\nr i b and s k i n s t r e s s e s t h a t r e s u l t when t h e same magnitude of loading i s\nplaced i n e i t h e r t h e x o r y d i r e c t i o n s .\nThe compression loading was s e l e c t e d from a t y p i c a l Delta loading p r o f i l e\nand i s equated as follows:\nP\n4M\nNx = 3 -I- p = 308.2 kN/m (1760 l b / i n . )\n\nNx was applied f i r s t i n t h e negative x and then i n t h e negative y I i r e c t i o n s .

The\nresults of this analysis compared with test data and other methods of analysis\n(ref. 6) will be summarized later. Before discussing the model and the results,\na brief description of the theory will be presented.\nBUCKLING THEORY\nNASTRAN buckling analysis (ref. 7) is based on the elastic an& differen.\ntial stiffnesses of the structure analyzed. The elastic properties of 3 structure are generally dependent on shear AG/K, torsion JG, bending EI, and\naxial AE stiffness characteristics. The differential stiffness is based on\nthe static loading, displacement, and geometry of the structure. An example of\n)\na bar element dicferential stiffness matrix is shown in figure 13 (ref. 7 .\nThe approach presented in reference 7 is essentially based on using Lagrange\'s\nequations of motion on a structural system with a finite number of degrees of\nfreedom\n\n.\n\nThe steps (ref. 7) for including differential stiffness in a structural\nproblem are as follows:\n(1) Solve the linear static response problem for the structure in the\nabsence of differential stiffness and compute the internal forces\nin each element.\n\n(2) Using the results of ( ) calculate the differential stiffness\nl,\nmatrix for the individual elements and apply the standard reduetior!\nprocedure ( constraints and partitioning) to form the differential\nstiffness matrix CKaad] in final form.\n\n(3)\n\nFor the buckling problem, find the characteristic eigenvalue and\n\neigenvectors for\n\nFor the isogrid cylinder buckling problem, the inverse power method was used to\n\ndetermine the eigenvalues. Because the above-deftned set of buckling equations\nare homogeneous, the assignment of one arbitrary eigenvector (within NASTRAN)\nmust be made to start the analysis. The solution of the first trial eigenvalue\npermits the determination for convergence; the redetermination of the eigenvalue, if necessary; and the subsequent final solution of all eigenvector\nratios (u} or of the mode shape.\n\n18\n2\n\nIt i s t h e eigenvalue t h a t i s t h e f a c t o r by which t h e applied compression\ns t a t i c loading i s multiplied to produce the t h e o r e t i c a l threshold of buckling.\nOnce obtained, t h e t h e o r e t i c a l buckling load i s multiplied by a 65-percent\nreduction f a c t o r .

This model s i z e i s believed to be t h e\nl a r g e s t s t r u c t u r a l model analyzed a t NASA Goddard Space F l i g h t Center. The\nmodel was composed of N S R N t r i a n g u l a r p l a t e (CTRIAP) and bar (CBAR) elements.\nAT A\nA complementary computer program, MOVE ( r e f . 8 , was u t i l i z e d to simplify t h e\n)\ntask. A model such as ours, having 1850 g r i d points and 7986 elements, would\nhave been extremely\' d i f f i c u l t , i f not impossible within t h e time available, to\nconstruct had it not been f o r t h e help of t h e MOVE program.\nThe MOVE program was designed to generate repeat bulk d a t a f o r s t r u c t u r e s\nhaving a number of i d e n t i c a l segments. All one need do i s to generate one\nbasic NASTRAN bulk data segment and MOVE does t h e r e s t . The s t r i p model\ns e l e c t e d for our problem was a l o n g i t u d i n a l segment shown i n f i g u r e 14. By\nmoving t h a t segment 66 times (5.45\' per move circumferentially), t h e complete\ncylinder was generated as shown i n f i g u r e 15. It should be noted here t h a t a l l\nof t h e undeformed and deformed f i g u r e s i n t h i s r e p o r t were made by t h e StrombergCarlson 4060 p l o t t e r , which i s one of s e v e r a l systems t h a t may be s p e c i f i e d i n\nNASTW programing.\nWhen t h e MOVE program was f i r s t programed, it was designed f o r a r e l a t i v e l y\nsmall s t r u c t u r a l problem. Thus, t h e i n i t i a l t r i a l of t h a t program on a l a r g e\ns t r u c t u r a l model was not successful. The reason was t h a t t h e MOVE program\ncould not handle CBAR continuation cards and a very l a r g e number of repeat\ncycles. Further, t h e MOVE program was w r i t t e n to place i t s bulk d a t a output\non punched cards. This f e a t u r e could have been q u i t e cumbersome to handle f o r\nour l a r g e buckling problem (approximately 8 data card f i l e boxes, or 8000\ncards). Including t h e output d a t a on tape was a f a r superior way of handling\nan immense q u a n t i t y of data. That program, w r i t t e n i n PL-1 language, was\nsubsequently revised to r e c t i f y the above problem areas and to s t o r e i t s output d a t a on magnetic tape.\nHaving accomplished t h e MOVE programing successfully, t h e next s t e p was\nHere too, i n i t i a l attempts\nwere not good because of an assortment of program problems involving t h e\n\nto input t h e d a t a using N S R N programing methods.\nAT A\n\napplication of the MOVE data tape and the determination of a practical size\nstorage requirement for our isogrid structural model. 5he solutions were\nreadily available by properly arranging the executive control section of\nNASTRAN and adjusting the storage requirement from 500 0 0 to 1000 0 0 places.\n0\n0\nIncidentally, the isogrid tank buckling computer analysis required all but 5000\nplaces for some of the NASTRAN routines--that was measuring storage qui+,e close.\nYet still another problem occurred: The computer program timed out at 120 min\nof requested central processing unit ( C P U ) time. Rather than increase the run\ntime, the model was reduced, but reduced in such a way that the original size\ntank configuration could be maintained. This was achieved by reducing the\nBASTRAN model to one-quarter the original size, limiting the buckling problem\nby analyzing only the first four symmetric-symmetric modes as shown in figure\n16, and establishing the constraints or degrees of freedom accordingly.\nTo accomplish the reduction in model size to one-quarter the original,\nthe grid points were modified to include 1 through 13 (fig. 14) only and the\nMOVE rotations (5.45\xc2\xb0/rotation) were reduced from 66 to 33. The MOVE program\nwas rerun and the reduced data (on tape) were submitted via NASTRAN for a plot\nof the one-quarter-scale model shown in figure 17.\nThe buckling analysis was again attempted and constraint problems were encountered. A more careful look at the symmetric-symmetric modes and the loaded\nend conditions led to grid-point degrees of freedom revisions that subsequently\n.\nproduced good buckling results as shown in table 2 Plots of the statically\n8\ndeformed and buckled structure are presented in figures 1 to 24.\nBut how dependable was the general instability buckling analysis using\nNASTRAN? To answer this question, the NASTRAN output was compared directly to\nanother analysis (ref. 6) and to isogrid tank compression test data (refs. 4\nand 9) as shown in figure 25. For that figure the theoretical buckling values\nwere multiplied by a 65-percent test correlation factor (ref. 4) and compared\nto 99 percent probability buckling test values (2.34~\nlower than the average of\nnine test data points). The lower than theoretically predicted buckling allowables thus achieved account for imperfections that are inherent in large structures. Such imperfections are generally attributable to built-in residual forming stresses, slight amounts of tank out-of-roundness, and local rib and skin\nwaviness.\nFigure 25 graphically documents instability buckling levels for the Delta\nisogrid and waffle designs as compared to monocoque designs. It also shows the\nallowable skin buckling running load for the isogrid design. The graph has\nh .\nbeen produced by placing the weight equivalent thickness ( t eq.) along the\nabscissa and the allowable compressive load (NGI o r Nsb) along the ordinate.\nBy scanning figure 25, it becomes apparent that the general instability\nallowables obtained through the use of NASTRAN correlate very well with the test\ndata point and the cylindrical shell analysis by W. Flugge (ref. 6) and McDonne11 Douglas H312 analysis. Because the symmetric-symqetric buckling results\nappeared to be quite good, further analyses in the asymmetric buckling modes\nwere not performed.\n\nn\n\n0\n\n!\ni\nrl\n\nh\n\n0\nrl\n\n3\n\ncr\n.\n\n8\nLn\n\nrl\n\nV\n\nv\n\n.\nh\n\nv\n\nh\n\nn\n\ncn\n\nLn\n\n-3\nN\n\nm\ncu\n\nP-\n\nv\n\nd\n\nW\n\n09\n\nm\n\nM\n\n3\n\nh\n\nn\n\n0\n\nM\n\nN7\n\nV\n\ns\n\nV\n\nv\n\n"9\n\n09\n\n"9\n\n0\n\nm\n\n0\nM\n\nr-\n\n."I\n\n0\n\n0\nM\n\n84\n-\n\n8\nM\n\nN\n\n$;\ncu\n\nm\n\nco\n\n9\nrl\n\n-?\n4\n\n9\nrl\n\n$I\n\nM\n\nr(\n\nN\n\nN\n\nN\n-3\n\na\n,\n\nc\n\nw 5\n+ k\ncd\n\nQ%\n\nt\na\n,\n\n--.\nr-i\n\nM\n\n-.\nc\n-\n\n.?\ncu\n\nM\n\nN\n\n54\n\n\\\nM\n\n0\na .\nw o\n+ e\nH\n\nr-i\n\ncu\n\nM\n\nNote a l s o t h a t t h e i n s t a b i l i t y p l o t s a r e based on compression loadings and\nno i n t e r n a l pressure.

Thornton\n\nOld Dominion University\nSUMMARY\nTo evaluate the effectiveness o f NASTRAN for predicting the\nvibration modes of panels with bending-membrane coupling, a crossstiffened ship\'s deck has been analyzed. In correlations with\nexperimental data, one NASTRAN finite element representation gave\nresults slightly more accurate t h a n a previous analytical solution.\nComputational time was excessively long due to the Guyan method\no f reducing the eigenvalue problem.\nIt is recommended that a\nmore efficient method of matrix reduction be implemented for the\nlumped mass formulation.\nINTRODUCTION\nIn studies concerning the shock environment o f surface ships,\nthe dynamic behavior of decks is of basic importance. Studies\n(References 1 - 4 ) performed at the Naval Ship Research a n d Development Center have established that the shock response of a deck\ncan be predicted i n terms of the input motions of the deck provided the modal characteristics o f the deck are known.\nThe classical approach used to analyze the bending behavior\nof stiffened decks has been to use the concept of a n equivalent\northotropic plate. After modification to include the effects of\na few large, widely spaced stiffeners (References 3 a n d 2 1 , the\northotropic plate approach has been used to successfully predict\nthe vibration modes of a cross-stiffened ship\'s deck. In addition\n(References 3 a n d 41, the effect of local mass loadings on the\nvibration modes of the deck model has been studied by incorporating point masses in the modified orthotropic plate approach.\nThe application of this type of analytical representation\nis limited, of course, to h i g h l y idealized mathematical models\no f realistic ship structures.\nFor this reason, it is of interest\nto evaluate the effectiveness o f general purpose Finite Element\nprograms such as NASTRAN by correlations with previous analytical\na n d experimental studies.\n\n145\n\nA s t i f f e n e d

In the NASTRAN Model 1 analysis, the\nGuyan reduction required approximately 3000 CPU seconds out of a\ntotal of 5300 CPU seconds. Of the 3000 seconds required in the\nGuyan reduction, over 70% of the time was required in reduction\nof the mass matrix.\nOne of the reasons that NASTRAN was relatively inefficient\nin the present analyses is that no attempt is made to take\nadvantage of the lumped mass formulation. Considerable timesavings would have been accomplished if a distinctlon was made\nbetween the reduction used for the lumped mass and consistent\nmass formulations. For a considerable number of vibration\nproblems (see Reference 51, the g a i n in computational efficiency\noffered by the lumped mass formulafion more than offsets advantages of the increased accuracy a n d bounded nature of the conststent mass formulation.\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of NASTRAN f o r predicting the\nvibration modes of panels with bending-membrane coupling, a\ncross-stiffened ship\'s deck has been anal-{zed. A fine mesh of\nbeam a n d plate elements was used. T o obtain a large number of\nmodes and to insure that all modes were obtained, the matrix\neigenvalue problem was reduced by a Guyan reduction and solved\nby the Given\'s method.\nfor one NASTRAN finite element model, the matrix reduction\nfor the stiffness matrix required about 850 CPU seconds, a n d the\nmass matrix reduction required about 2200 CPU seconds. The long\ncomputational time was required because of large matrix multiplications in the Guyan reduction.\n\nIn correlations with experimental data one NASTRAN finite\nelement model was slightly more accurate for frequency predictions\na n d nodal patterns than a previous analytical method. Agreement\nwith experimental results was good.\nit can be concluded that NASTRAN was effective in meeting\nall o f the evaluation criteria with the exception of computational time. Excessively large computer time was required because\nof the Guyan method of reducing the mass matrix. It is\nrecommended that the NSMO consider investigating a n d implementing\nother more efficient methods of mass matrix reduction for the\nlumped mass formulation.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nT h i s s t u d y was p e r f o r m e d a t t h e NASA L a n g l e y R e s e a r c h C e n t e r\nd u r i n g t h e summer o f 3973 u n d e r t h e s p o n s o r s h i p o f t h e NASA-ASEE\nSummer F a c u l t y F e l l o w s h i p p r o g r a m .\nThe a u t h o r i s p l e a s e d t o acknowledge t h e a s s i s t a n c e of a\nnumber o f LRC p e r s o n n e l p a r t i c u l a r l y B a r b a r a J .

G. Hill\nHanford Engineering Development Laboratory\n\nS M AY\nU MR\nA lumped-mass model has been used t o represent the impact condition\nbetween a f u e l duct and an IVHM (In-Vessel Fuel Handling Machine). The nonl i n e a r e f f e c t s of a B e l l v i l l e spring and t h e f r e e f a l l impact of t h e f u e l\nduct on t h e IVHM were included. The purpose of t h e t e s t s was t o determine\nt h e loads on t h e f u e l duct due t o t h e impact. A comparison between experimental and t h e o r e t i c a l r e s u l t s i s presented.\nINTRODUCTION\n\nI n t h e operation of t h e F R (Fast Test Reactor) an IVHM i s used t o handle\nT\ncore components under various component and core conditions. The component\nunder consideration i s a f u e l duct which i n t e r f a c e s with t h e IVHM by means of\na grapple mechanism. The grapple g r i p s a nozzle-handling socket mounted on\nt h e end of t h e f u e l duct. Under c e r t a i n operating conditions t h e f u e l duct\ndrops a short distance t o impact on t h e grapple fingers. A simulated mechanic a l mockup of t h e FTR core and t h e IVHM was s e t up, and IVHM f u e l duct withdrawal and i n s e r t i o n t e s t s were conducted. During these t e s t s high accelerat i o n s were measured on t h e simulated f i e 1 duct. The experimental d a t a i n d i cated t h a t t h e acceleration loads were due to t h e impact of t h e f u e l duct on\nt h e grapple. This paper describes how t h e results of t h e analysis and t e s t s\nof t h e impact are i n t e r p r e t e d i n terms of t h e response of t h e simulated f u e l\nduct and t h e I V H M s t r u c t u r e .\n\na\n\nacceleration\n\nB\n\ns c a l a r damper\n\nd\n\ndrop distance\n\ng\n\ns t r u c t u r a l damping\n\nt\n\ntime\nDESCRIPTIOW OF IVHM\n\nThe FFTF (Fast.Flux Test F a c i l i t y ) simulated core t e s t f a c i l i t y and an\nIVHM positioned f o r f u e l duct i n s e r t i o n are shown i n f i g u r e 1 The IVHM con.\nsists of a motor-driven mechanism mounted on a l e a d screw and a grapple\nassembly a s shown i n figures 1 t o 3. Four f u e l duct support f i n g e r s ( f i g . 3 )\nsupport t h e weight of t h e f u e l duct during i n s e r t i o n and provide f o r t h e withd r a w a l forces. The IVHM i s used t o t r a n s f e r f u e l duct components from t h e\n\nI\n\na c t i v e core t o f i x e d storage positions located outside t h e core region. Fuel\nhandling problems can occur due t o d i s t o r t i o n of t h e individual f u e l ducts and\nt h e core. The d i s t o r t i o n e f f e c t s can be induced by s t a i n l e s s s t e e l swelling\nand thermal creep ( r e f . 1). Twelve core r e s t r a i n t yokes located hexagonally at\ntwo l e v e l s maintain t h e l a t e r a l p o s i t i o n and compactness of t h e core.\nFree F a l l Condition\nThere a r e two operating conditions of t h e IVHM t h a t have been investigates\ni n t h i s r e p o r t . The f i r s t i s a f r e e f a l l impact of t h e f u e l duct on t h e grapple\nand, secondly, a f r e e f a l l impact combined with an i n i t i a l condition of pre-load\non t h e IVHM and f u e l duct. During t h e i n s e r t i o n of t h e f u e l duct, t h e above\n)\ncore load pad contacts t h e core ( f i g . l , and a gap e x i s t s between t h e fingers\non t h e grapple and t h e f u e l duct. The core r e s t r a i n t yokes a r e r e t r a c t e d , t h e\nrespective f u e l duct p o s i t i o n opens and t h e f u e l duct drops t h e gap distance t o\nimpact on t h e grapple support f i n g e r s .\nPre-Load Conditions\nCertain core conditions ( r e f . 1) require t h a t a compressive force be\napplied t o t h e f u e l duct f o r i n s e r t i o n . The l e a d screw on t h e IVHM i s used t o\napply t h e compressive force through the grapple (turnbuckle e f f e c t ) t o t h e fuel\nduct. Again, a s t h e grapple engages t h e top of t h e f u e l duct f o r t h e compressive\nload a gap e x i s t s between t h e grapple fingers and t h e nozzle-handling socket on\nt h e f u e l duct.\nWhen i n s e r t i o n occurs t h e f u e l duct experiences a f r e e f a l l with an i n i t i a l\ncondition of pre-load.\nThe compressive pre-load (turnbuckle e f f e c t ) i s relieved\non both t h e f u e l duct and t h e IVHM during t h e f i r s t milliseconds of f u e l duct\nf r e e f a l l . The f u e l duct then impacts on t h e grapple support fingers. The load\nc e l l oscillogram indicated t h a t t h e 1000 lb pre-load i n i t i a l condition was a\nramp function with a time duration of 0.026 second. The e f f e c t of t h e pre-load\non t h e i n i t i a l acceleration of t h e f u e l duct i s unknown. Due t o t h e manner i n\nwhich t h e accelerations were recorded, t h e change i n f r e e f a l l time due t o t h e\npre-load could not be determined.\nL M E -MASS MODEL\nU PD\nBasic Model\nAfter a review of t h e t e s t f a c i l i t y and t e s t data, it was decided t o use a\nr e l a t i v e l y simple model t o represent the IVHM and f u e l duct so t h a t t h e r e s u l t s\nof t h e analysis would be a v a i l a b l e quickly. The physical properties used i n t h e\nmodel i n most cases were calculated f r o m t h e r e s u l t s of load d e f l e c t i o n and\nother t e s t s on t h e simulated IVHM. Figure 4 shows t h e s c a l a r elements t h a t were\nchosen t o represent t h e s t i f f n e s s e s , masses, and damping properties of t h e IVHM\nand t h e f u e l duct. The IVHM and f u e l duct were idealized with s i x degrees of\nfreedom w i t h instrumentation locations and areas of nonlineax response considered\ni n t h e s e l e c t i o n of g r i d points and lumped masses. The s c a l a r damper values\nshown i n t h e NASTFtAN Input ( f i g . 3) were calculated from t h e frequency and\nmeasured s t r u c t u r a l damping values (see r e f . 2 f o r equation). A s t r u c t u r a l\n\n12\n6\n\ndamping value ( g = 15 percent) w a s calculated f o r t h e assembled IVHM by considering t h e r a t e of decay and of successive rebounds of t h e f u e l duct on\ngrapple support fingers, as shown by t h e IVHM load c e l l oscillogram ( f i g . 6). A\ns t r u c t u r a l damping value of g = 2 percent was calculated f o r f u e l duct. The\nf u e l duct w s empty. except f o r a lead weight mounted i n bottom of the duct t o\na\nsimulate t h e components of t h e f u e l duct.\nNonlinear Considerations\nTwo nonlinear conditions were considered i n t h e model shown i n f i g u r e 4, a\nB e l l v i l l e spring w i t h s t i f f n e s s d i f f e r e n t i n tension than i n compression,\nElement 4, and t h e f r e e f a l l gap, Element 3 . For these conditions the nonlinear\nprovision of NASTRAN w a s used. The nonlinear e f f e c t s were t r e a t e d through t h e\nuse of an additional applied load vector and by means of a t r a n s f e r function,\nt h e NONLIN 1 and TF input cards. (See f i g u r e 5 f o r NASTRAN input.) To use t h e\nnonlinear provision requires r i g i d format 9, Direct Transient Response. I n t h i s\nformat ( r e f . 3 ) numerical i n t e g r a t i o n of t h e coupled equations i s achieved by\nemploying a c e n t r a l difference equivalent step-by-step procedure. It was found\nt h a t t h e solution became unstable a s t h e time s t e p was increased or a s t h e value\nof t h e lum ed masses was reduced.

Skattum\nResearch Laboratories\nGeneral Motors Corporation\nWarren, Michigan\nABSTRACT\nWarping constraints of thin-walled beams of open cross sections may\nsignificantly add to the torsional rigidity of the beams. This property is\nnot included in the conventional beam element available in NASTRAN and makes\nit impossible to model such beams properly.\nThis paper presents a composite element which includes the effects of\nwarping and offset shear centers. It is shown to be mathematically consistent\nwith thin-walled open beam theory and can easily be incorporated into any\nstructural analysis program by use of NASTRAN\'S standard elements.\nA numerical example analyzing the vibration of a channel beam is presented,\nand, by using the composite element, the numerical results agreed very well\nwith theoretical data.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThin-walled beams of open cross sections are commonly used in automotive\nand aircraft structures where it is imperative to insure maximum flexural\nefficiency without violating practical fabrication and assembly requirements.\nI turns out that for many cases the static and dynamic response of these\nt\nstructures depends strongly upon the warping constraints of the members. Consequently, proper modeling techniques are essential to insure good numerical\nresults.\nThe most general beam element available in the present version of NASTRAN\n(level 12) is based upon the well-known Timoshenko beam theory. This theory,\nhowever, neglects warping displacements and assumes that the elastic and\ncentroidal axes -coincide. Both these conditions are usually too restrictive\nwhen thin-walled open beams are modeled.\nSeveral books and articles have been published treating the theory and\napplications of thin-walled beams of open cross sections. A thorough presenta)\ntion is found in Vlasov\'s book (Ref. 1. Timoshenko and Gere have done a\n\nbuckling analysis (Ref. 2), and contributions to the vibrational analysis\nare due to Timoshenko (Ref. 3 ) , Gere (Ref. 4 ) , Gere and Lin (Ref. S), and\nChristian0 and Salmela (Ref. 6 ) .\nThis paper presents a new element which includes the effects of warping\nt\nand noncoincidal elastic and centroidal axes. I is a composite element\nderived from a variational principle consistent with the thin-walled open beam\nformulation. Also, in addition to being mathematically correct, this model can\nvery easily be incorporated into any structural analysis program by using\nelements now available in NASTRAN.\nAs a numerical example on how the model is constructed, the vibration of\na channel beam is analyzed, and good agreement between theoretical and numerical results are obtained.\nTHEORY OF THIN-WALLED OPEN BEAMS\nA thin-walled beam is usually defined by restricting its dimensions so\n\nthat\n\nL > 10d\n\n(1)\n\nwhere L is the length of the bar, d the depth of the cross section, and t the\nlargest thickness (Fig. 1. The first relation makes it possible to assume\n)\nuniformity of the longitudinal stresses along the axis (St. Vernant\'s\nPrinciple) while Eq. 2 is used in making assumptions on the shear stresses in\nthe section. Particularly for beams of open cross sections which will be\nconsidered in this analysis, it will be assumed that the middle surface is\nfree of shear. In addition, the material and sectional properties of the beam\nare assumed to be constant along the length, and the displacements are considered to be small such that the cross sections do not change shapes during\ndeformation.\nFigure 1 shows a general thin-walled open beam. Included is also a\ndetail of the cross section giving the locations of the center of gravity (CG)\nand the shear center ( C . The shear center is the point on the cross section\nS)\nthrough which the resultant of the transverse shearing forces always passes.\nLocus of the shear centers along a beam is called the elastic axis, and\nsimilarly, the centroidal axis passes through the CG of the cross sections.\nBefore the differential equations can be presented, it is very important\nto clearly define the coordinate and displacement system used. Referring to\nFig. 1, the x-coordinate coincides with the centroidal axis of the beam, and\nthe y- and z-coordinates are the principal axes of the cross section. The\ndisplacements are defined by\nu = longitudinal displacement of centroid\nv = vertical displacement of shear center\n180\n\nw = horizontal displacement of shear center\n8 = rotational displacement of shear center\nand are also indicated in the figure.\nBased on these definitions and the assumptions mentioned above, the\nfull set of differential equations for a thin-walled open beam can be written\nas (Ref. 1\n)\n\nEA d 2u dx2\n\n-\n\nI\n\'-\n\nd4v\nE11 - dx4\n\n-\n\nqx\n\nqY\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\n- = QZ\n\nE12 d 4w\ndx4\n\nd4e\nECw dx4\n\nd20\n- GJ -= me\ndx2\n\nin which E = modulus of elasticity; G = shear modulus; A = cross sectional\narea; I1 = moment of inertia about z axis; 12 = moment of inertia about y-axis;\nJ = torsion constant; CW = warping constant; qx = longitudinal surface load\napplied to the centroid; qy and qz = transverse loads applied at the shear\ncenter; and me = twisting moment about the elastic axis.\n\nI should be observed that the above set of differential equations\nt\ndiffers from the regular beam equation by the fact that v, w, and 8 (and\ncorrespondingly qy, qz, and me) are displacements (and forces) relating to\nthe shear center rather than the centroid, and that the term\nE,\nC\n\nd48\n-\n\ndx4\nrelating to the warping of the cross section, has been added. Also, the\nfour equations are completely uncoupled, a very desirable feature made possible by letting some of the displacements be associated with the shear center.\nMODELING OF THIN-WALLED OPEN BEAMS\nThe conventional beam element available in the NASTRAN computer program\nis essentially based upon the same assumptions given above, but in addition,\ntwo other conditions are made:\n1 Plane sections remain plane ( . . no warping deformations)\n.\nie,\n2 Centroidal- and elastic-axes coincide.\n.\n181\n\nThese two additional restrictions\nby looking at the differential e\nWarping is a phenomenon that occurs in a1\nwith the exception of cir\nsections though can the s\nted with the warping be large enough\nto cause significant cont\nBy excluding warpirrg, the rotational st\ntwo or more is quite common depending upon the cross-sectional properties\nand how the beam rotates. There have been some attempts to incorporate warping in the conventional beam element by defining an effective torsional constant Je. From Eq. 6 it is observed that this can be accomplished by the\nequation\nde\nGJe - =\ndx\n\n-\n\nde\nGJ - - ECw d3e\ndx\ndx3\n\nbut it is also noticed that J then necessarily must depend upon the solution\n,\n8. For static analysis, this-approach might be used effectively where the\nrotational displacement (3 can be estimated fairly accurately, but for dynamic\nanalysis, where different modes are extracted in the same analysis, large\nerrors will be introduced.\nWhen centroidal and elastic axes do not coincide, the beam element\nshould be modeled along the elastic axis. Otherwise, it can easily be observed\nthat the bending moment created by the applied transverse forces will not be\nencountered. This modeling will unfortunately introduce new problems, namely,\nthe bending moment caused by the longitudinal forces which, according to Eq. 3,\nshould coincide with the centroidal axis. In many cases, though, the effect\nof axial forces can be neglected.\nIn order to treat thin-walled open beams in a finite element computer\nprogram and include the effects of warping and offset shear center, it will\nbe necessary to either 1 develop a new element that includes these effects,\n)\n2) model the beams by a number of plate elements, or 3) arrange the available finite elements in a way consistent with the thin-walled open beam\ntheory. While there exists an element (Ref. 8 ) with the above features, it\nis noL readily available, and in particular, not for NASTRAN users. A beam\nmodeled by plate elements usually increases the number of grid points tremendously. This also increases the degrees of freedom, and the procedure will\noften become impractical and uneconomical. One is thus often left to model a\nthin-walled open beam by the existing beam element which will introduce errors\nas discussed above or create a new composite element. The following section\npresents such an element where the effects of warping and offset shear centers\nare included.\n\n182\n\nDERIVATION OF A COMPOSITE ELEMENT\nBefore describing a suitable finite element model, a fictitious continuous beam is presented (Fig. 2). The differential equations of vibration\nand the corresponding boundary conditions for this beam will be derived\nby the Hamilton\'s Variational Principle\n\nwhere T is the total kinetic and U the total potential energy of the system.\nReferring to Fig. 2, the fictitious element consists of a rod coinciding\nwith the centroidal axis, a beam coinciding with the elastic axis, and two\nflanges displaced h from the elastic axis in a direction parallel to the\ny coordinate. The rod accepts only axial deformations, and the corresponding\nstrain energy over the whole length, L, of the rod can thus be written as\n\nR\n\'\n\n2\n\n=2\nL\n\nEA(g)dx\n0\n\nwhere u is the longitudinal displacement of the centroid as defined in the\nlast section.\n\nAs indicated in the figure, the beam has all capabilities of a regular\nbeam except that the area is neglected such that no axial strain exists.\nThe strain energy is then given by\n\nin which I2* is the moment of inertia about the y-axis while the other\nproperties, including the displacements, are as defined earlier.\nThe two flanges are displaced from the elastic axis an arbitrary distance h which will be determined later. Only bending deflections are admitted\nfor the flanges, and by defining the displacements parallel to the z-axis as w\nl\nand w2, as indicated on Fig. 2 , the strain energy becomes\n\nF\n\'\n\n= 2\n\nEIF\n\n~~)\n\n2\n\n+(-)I\n\ndx\n\nThe rod is assumed to carry all the mass of the elements such that the\nkinetic energy will be written in terms of the rod displacements u, v*, #,\nand 0*. Neglecting rotational inertia, the kinetic energy is\n\nwhere Ip is the centroidal polar moment of inertia and\nof the material.\n\np\n\nis the mass density\n\nThe nine displacement parameters used will next be reduced to four by the\nrelations\n\ne*\n\n= 0\n\nv*\n\n=\n\nv\n\n(13)\n\n+ czO\n\nw*=w-ce\nY\n~1 = w + h0\n\ncy and c z are the distances between C . G . and S . C . in the y and z direction\nrespectively. Substituting these equations into the above expressions for\nstrain and kinetic energies, Hamilton\'s equation ( 8 ) can be formed. The\nvariation is then accomplished by varying u by 6u, v by 6u, w by 6w and 6 by\n6 0 where it is understood that the variation vanishes at t = to and t = tl.\nThis procedure produces the differential equations\n\nax2\n4\n,\nE11 -a=\nax4\n\nE (2\nI*\n\n-\n\nat2\n\na 2~\npA - - pAcz\n\nat2\n\nat2\n\na%\na4\n,\na%\n+ 21~)-= - PA -+ pAcy ax4\n\n2E1~h\'\n\na%\n-ax2\n\nGJ\n\na%\n-=\nax2\n\n-PA\n\n(\n\ncZ2\n\nand the boundary conditions (at x\n\n184\n\na%\n-\n\n+ cy2 +\n\n">\nA\n\n=\n\nat2\n\nat2\n\n0 and x\n\n=\n\nat2\n\n1\n)\n\npAc,\n\na2v\n--?at2\n\npAcY\n\nat2\n\n(1\n2)\n\na 3~\n-. w = o\nax3\n\n- .u=o\nau\nax\n\n--\n\n(2EIFhz a 30\n\nax3\nThe differential equations presented for the thin-walled open beam,\nEqs. 3 through 6 , can easily be transformed into the form given for the fictitious beam by substituting inertia loads for qx, qy, qz, and m (Ref. 1.\n)\n0\nEquations 18 through 2 1 will then become identical with the thin-walled open\nbeam equations if the following two substitutions are made\n\nI should be observed that the boundary conditions also will be identical\nt\nwith these substitutions.\nBecause of the mathematical identity between the fictitious and thinwalled open beams, a finite element model f o r the first will also be a model\nfor the latter. Figure 3 shows how the fictitious beam can be modeled and how\nthe different elements are constrained at the grid points a and bo. Four\n,\nelements will be used; a rod, without torsional rigidity, coinciding with the\ncentroid; a beam, without axial rigidity and mass, coinciding with the elastic\naxis; and two flanges (or beams), resisting only bending deformations, and\ndisplaced h parallel to the y-axis away from the elastic axis. The second\n\nmoment of inertia (NASTRAN notation) for the beam and the flanges is as\ndefined in E q s . 29 and 30, otherwise the notation given in Fig. 3 refers to\nthe original properties of the thin-walled beam. The distance h is arbitrarily\nchosen, but should be large enough such that Ig* is positive.\nAt each grid point, which is arbitrarily taken to be the centroid, the\nbeam is offset by a rigid link to its shear center location. This will insure\nthat the forces acting on the grid points will be transmitted correctly\nto the beam elements, and the grid point displacements will obey E q s . 13, 14,\nand 15 used in the development of the fictitious beam.\nSimilarly, the displacements of the two flanges must be made dependent\nupon those at the shear center as restricted by Eqs. 16 and 17. If warping\nis constrained at the grid point, i.e.,\n\n--dB\ndx\n\n0\n\nthen the connections between the flanges and the centroid can be made rigid.\nOtherwise, as in the case of interior points of a thin-walled open beam,\nwarping is admissible, and E q s . 16 and 1 7 imply that\ndwl\n\ndw dw2\n\ndw\n\ndx+Qdx+dx\nThis makes it necessary to create special grid points (al, a2, bl and b2\non Fig. 3) for the flanges where the transverse displacements are made dependent displacements, and the rotational displacements\ndWl\ndw2\n- and -\n\ndx .\n\ndx\n\nare unrestricted. The four other displacements must, in this case, be\nconstrained in order to avoid singular matrices.\nThe only difference between the composite model and the fictitious\nbeam is that while E q s . 16 and 17 are satisfied continuously for the mathematical beam, they are satisfied only at discrete intervals for the model.\nThis implies that the flanges between the grid points will deform according\nto the law of minimum energy, contributing less to the torsional rigidity\nthan theoretically assumed. Although usually small, this error can be made\nstill smaller by using more grid points along the length of the beam.\nNUMERICAL EXAMPLE\nA numerical example is presented next to illustrate the use of the composite element and to compare the numerical results with data obtained from\ntheory. The example chosen is the dynamic response of a channel beam whose\nproperties are given by\n\n186\n\nA = 0 8 4 in2\n.8\n11 = 7 6 in4\n.6\n12 = 0.294 in4\n\n= 0.733\n= 3,52 in6\n.\ncw = 0 0 in\ncy = 0.94 in\n\' = 120 in\nL\n\np\n\nlbs sec2 in-4\n\nC\n\n= 0.00168 in4\nE .-- 29 106 I ~ in-2\nS\nG = 11 lo6 lbs in"2\n\nJ\n\nIn the pure vibration of the channel beam, the differential equation in the\n8\naxial displacement u (Eq. 1 ) uncouples from the other equations. Since cy\nis zero in this example, Eq. 20 will uncouple also. The problem then reduces\nto a coupled vibrational problem in the v-.and 8- displacements, Eqs. 19 and\n21. For simply supported ends,\n\nand the theoretical solution, as given by the natural frequencies of vibration,\npi, can be written as (Ref. 3)\n\npi2 =\n\nw\n\nti2\n\n+ u\n\n+ 4Xczubi ti\n2,\n\nbi\n21\n(\n\n-\n\nACZ)\n\n(34)\n\nwhere\nA = -\n\nI\n\n0\n\nI = I + A (.2+cz2)\nY\nO\nP\nand Uti and Ubi are the ith uncoupled frequencies in twist and bending,\nrespectively;\n\nw\n\nGJn2L2i2 + ECwn4i4\n2 2\n\nti\n\n(37)\nPIoL\n\nWhen warping is not included in the analysis, Uti reduces to\n\nw\n\n2,\n\nti\n\nGJ.ir2L2\ni2\n\n(39)\n\nP10L4\n\nThe data obtained by using these equations are given in Table 1, cases\n1 through 4 . I can be observed that warping increases the twisting frequent\ncies more than 100% while an increase of about 5% is seen for the bending\nfrequencies by going from uncoupled to the coupled theory.\nThe channel is modeled by five equal elements 24 inches in length. Seven\ndifferent modeling techniques have been tried, and the result is given in\n.\nTable 1 Cases 5 through 8 show the channel modeled by the conventional\nTimoshenko beam element coinciding with the centroidal or elastic axis.\nIn the first case only the uncoupled frequencies are obtained, while case 8\nreflects the coupled frequencies without taking warping into effect. Also\nnoticeable are the bending frequencies obtained in case 7, which because of\nthe coupling between v and 0 , actually represents the twisting frequencies.\nWarping is included in the last three cases in Table 1 by using a composite element similar to the one given in Fig. 3, but the rod element is\nexcluded since no axial forces are present during the vibration considered.\nBecause of the boundary conditions, Eq. 33, the flanges must be free to\nrotate at the ends. This is accomplished by modeling the ends similar to\nall the interior points with a semi-rigid link where w and w2 are restricted,\nl\nbut the rotations about the y- axis are free. The bulk data cards used for\ncase 11 are given in the Appendix. Case 9, where the flanges are rigidly\nlinked to the shear center, is included to show how important it is to free\nthe rotational coordinates of the flanges, while cases 10 and 11 show the\ncomposite element properly used, including bending displacement and both\nbending ( ) and twisting ( 0 ) displacements, in the numerical analysis. It is\nv\nnoticed that good correlation is obtained between theoretical (case 4 ) and\nnumerical (case 1 ) data, the latter results being slightly below the first.\n1\nThis can be reasoned by the fact that few elements are used in the analysis,\nwhich implies 1) reduced torsional rigidity as explained above, and 2) concentrated inertia forces at the grid points instead of a continuous\ndistribution.\nAlthough the example did not use the rod element, this must be considered\na very special case. For other structures and other loading conditions,\nthe effect of excluding the rod can be significant. This will especially\nbe the case where thin-walled open beams are used as members in between closed\nbeams and where the axial load transfer is large. The example has shown,\nthough, that\n\n(1) warping effects are properly taken into account by the\ncomposite element\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n18\n8\n\ninclusion of rotational displacements are necessary\ngood results are obtained with few elements.\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe composite element presented in this paper has been shown both mathematically and numerically to properly represent the thin-walled open beam.\nSince it is derived upon the differential equations for such beams, the model\ncan be made as accurate as the theory is. In fact, in the limit as the length\nof the element gets smaller and smaller, the composite beam element is an exact\nmodel of the thin-walled open beam.\nIn conclusion, it is hoped that future editions of NASTRAN can present\na true thin-walled beam element since the need for proper modeling will\nincrease. Until that time, the present composite element is available, it\nis accurate, and easy to use.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThe author expresses his gratitude to Dr. Curtis F.

Marshall Space Flight Center\nMarshall Space Flight Center, Alabama\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nEven though the NASA Structural Analysis (NASTRAN) program\ni s designed to solve numerous structural dynamic problems through\nthe u s e of available rigid formats, an important class of problems,\nwhere the structures a r e spinning a t a constant angular velocity, has\nbeen omitted. Rotating shafts, blades of spinning turbines, rotating\nlinkages, and spin stabilized satellites a r e examples of problems\nfalling within this class. These problems differ from the nonspinning\nstructures in several significant ways. The accelerations of the masses\nin a nonrotating stationary frame a r e represented by the second derivatives with respect to time of the spatial variables. In the case of a\nstructure spinning a t a constant angular velocity, expressions for the\naccelerations of the discrete m a s s e s contain t e r m s arising f r o m the\nsecond derivatives of the spatial variables; in addition, they contain\nt e r m s caused by Coriolis accelerations, which a r e proport:onal to the\nvelocities of the m a s s e s in the rotating frame. Finally, these expressions reflect the variations in steady- state centripetal accelerations\ncaused by the small displacements of the m a s s e s in the rotating frame.\nThe steady-state centrifugal forces set up the steady s t r e s s e s that give\nr i s e to the geometric stiffness matrix.\nSince NASTRAN does not construct Coriolis and centripetal\nacceleration m a t r i c e s , and a centrifugal load vector due to spin about\na selected point or about the m a s s center of the structure, a F o r t r a n\nsubroutine to construct these matrices i s added in NASTRAN. The\nrigid translational degrees of freedom can be removed by using a\ntransformation m a t r i x T and its explicitly given inverse, T-\xe2\x80\x99. These\nm a t r i c e s a r e generated in the above F o r t r a n subroutine and their\nexplicit expressions a r e given in Appendix A.\n\nThe complex eigenvalue subroutine of NASTRAN does not\nm e a s u r e up to the excellence it has shown in assembling the matrices.\nIf the user d e s i r e s , a n option is available t o write out the m a t r i c e s\ngenerated by NASTRAN on a magnetic tape which, in turn, can be used\nas the input to another eigenvalue program. The probable advantages\nin using another eigenvalue program a r e that the u s e r may be able to\nsolve a l a r g e r problem within the available c o r e and he may u s e a\nm o r e efficient eigenvalue routine if one is available to him. If it is\nrequired, the u s e r can write out certain information generated by\nNASTRAN on a magnetic tape unit using the subroutines OUTPUT2\nand WRTAPE used in this program.\n\nTHEORETICAL DESCRIPTION\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x992\n\nThe equations of motion of a spinning structure a r e briefly\nderived h e r e to show how they differ f r o m those of a nonspinning structure. The direct u s e of the Newton-Euler equations gives\n\nf o r the sth rigid body of a flexible appendage; where ms is the m a s s ,\nAS i s the absolute translational acceleration vector. - and TS a r e\nFS\nthe s u m of the external and connection force and torque vectors,\nHS\nrespectively. - is the angular momentum vector and i denoted\ndifferentiation in the inertial f r a m e of reference.\n\nF o r a rigid body of an appendage spinning nominally in the\nsteady state with an angular velocity o (fig. l ) , the expression for\nacceleration is written as\n\nAS\n-\n\n-\n\n= bd2 ( c + u s ) t 2 - x -bd ( c + u S )- ~ x ( ~ x ( c + u S o x +- x -s )\n0\nt\n)\n-) ( o r\ndt - dt2 - -\n\n- -\n\nid2 R\n- + -dt2\n\nid\nt -ox(c+us\n- - t rS)\ndt -\n\nwhere c is a vector representing the location of the mass center at\ntime t with respect to its steady state position. - and -s a r e vectors\nus\np\nrepresenting the displacement and small rotation, respectively, of the\nsth rigid body f r o m its steady state configuration. r s i s a vector\nrepresenting the location of the sth rigid body of the-appendage in i t s\nsteady state configuration measured from the steady state mass center\nlocation. I s is the inertia dyadic of the sth rigid body. Superscript b\ndenotes difTerentiation in the reference frame - imbedded in the rigid\nb\nbody with the origin a t the steady state m a s s center location.\nF o r zero spin (a = 0), eq. (2) and (3) reduce to the familiar\nform\n\nAS\n-\n\nid2\n\n=\n\n- (R\ndt2\n\n-\n\nt 5t - trs us)\n\nIn matrix notation the second t e r m on the righ hand side of eq. (Z),\nwhich i s due to Coriolis acceleration, gives r i s e to a skew-symmetric\nmatrix; whereas, the third t e r m , which i s due to the centripetal acceleration, yields a symmetric matrix. The fourth t e r m in eq. ( 2 ) and ( 3 )\nrepresents a steady state centripetal acceleration which describes the\nsteady state configuration. Stretching forces, moments and rotations obtained therefrom, give r i s e to the second order geometric stiffness matrix.\nIn the absence of angular acceleration, the fifth t e r m of eq. (2) vanishes.\nIf rotational dynamics a r e the p r i m a r y concern, the effect of translation\nof the orbit is disregarded and the l a s t t e r m of eq. (2) also vanishes.\nThe last two t e r m s in eq. ( 3 ) w i l l cancel each other i f the inertia matrix\nis diagonal with all the t e r m s having the same magnitude. In the computer program no such restriction is imposed on the Is matrix.\n\nConservation of linear momentum provides the relation\n\nwhere M i s the cumulative m a s s of a l l appendages and the central rigid\nbody, and n is the total number of m a s s e s representing all of the\nappendages.\nConservation of angular momentum i s not imposed. As a result,\nthe central rigid body is restricted against variations in rotations.\nConservation of linear momentum permits the translation of the central\nrigid body, thus allowing the coupling of the vibrations of a l l the appendages attached to the central rigid body.\nThe s e t of equations representing the motion of all the rigid\nbodies in the appendage about the steady state configuration i s obtained\nby substituting eq. (4) into eq. (2) and writing the resulting eq. (2) and\n( 3 ) , for all rigid bodies in m a t r i x form:\n[MI]\n\n{} t\ni\n\n[GI]\n\n{k} t\n\n[ K \' l \' t Ke t Kg] {u} = [F]\n\n.\n\nThe steady state equation in m a t r i x form is:\n[Ke t K"\']\n\n{u}\n\n= {P}\'\n\n.\n\nThe u s e of eq. (4)eliminates the remaining translational rigid\nbody degrees-of-freedom. As a result, the m a s s m a t r i x M1 i s a\nsymmetric non-diagonal matrix. Matrix G \' i s in general, a fully\npopulated skew- symmetric matrix of Coriolis acceleration t e r m s .\nMatrix K" \' i s a fully populated non- symmetric matrix of centrifugal\nacceleration t e r m s . Ke and Kg a r e elastic and geometric (differential)\nstiffness matrices, respectively, (and a r e obtained f r o m the NASTRAN\nprogram) and {u} is the vector of generalized displacements about the\nsteady state configuration. In the absence of spin, m a t r i c e s G \' , K"\',\nand Kg w i l l all be identically zero, and the eigenvalue problem reduces\nto the standard eigenvalue problem of a f r e e - f r e e structure o r a cantilever. {u}\' i s the vector of the steady state generalized displacements\nf r o m the unstrained configuration {r} of the appendages. Since the\nsteady state deformations {u}\' a r e very small compared to the unstrained configuration {r}, it is assumed that the steady state configuration i s given by {r} instead of {r} t {u}\'.\nThe steady state force\nvector {P}s i s used to obtain the geometric stiffness matrix, Kg\n\n.\n\n200\n\nM a t r i c e s MI, G I , and K"\' have the following p r o p e r t i e s :\n\nRelations (7) afford a t r a n s f o r m a t i o n\n\nSubstitution of t r a n s f o r m a t i o n (8) into eq.

The first\nof the two cards never changes for this program. WW( l ) , WW(2),\nWW( 3) a r e the components of the spin vector in the body frame. T e r m s\nWW(4), WW(5) can take the values either 0.0 o r 1.0. If WW(4) = 1.0\nthe structure is spinning about the mass center of vehicle, and i f\nWW(4) = 0. 0 the structure i s spinning about a fixed point in the space.\nThe calculation of matrices T and T-\', which removes the rigid body\ntranslational degrees of freedom, is performed if WW(5) = 1.0. If\nWW(5) = 0.0, matrices T and T-\' a r e identity matrices which means\nthat the structure is supported and does not have the rigid body translational degrees of freedom.\nThe following options can be exercised through the use of WW(4)\nand WW( 5).\nCase I. WW(4) = WW(5) = 1.0, GRID 1 constrained in al.1 six\ndirections. The structure i s spinning about the vehicle m a s s center,\nand the rigid body translational degrees of freedom a r e removed.\nGFUDNo. 1 is connected by a rigid link to the m a s s center of the\nvehicle in the\' steady state configuration and one o r m o r e appendages\na r e cantilevered f r o m GRID No. 1. GRID No. 1 should be constrained\nin all six directions by use of SPC cards o r permanent SPC on G R I D\ncards.\nCase 11. WW(4) = WW(5) = 0. 0, GRID 1 constrained in a l l six\ndirections. The structure is assumed to be spinning about a point\n(GRID 1) fixed in inertial space, e.g., a spinning shaft with G R I D 1\na t bearing.\n1.\nCase 1 1 WW(4) = 1.0 WW(5) = 0.0, GRID 1 constrained in\nall six directions. Node No. 1 i s rigidly connected to the steady state\nm a s s center which is fixed in inertial space. The structure is spinning\nabout m a s s center.\n\nCase IV. WW(4) = 0 . 0 WW(5) = 1.0, GRID 1 constrained in all\nsix directions. The structure is spinning about GRID 1 with rigid body\ntranslational degrees of freedom removed.\n\n*\n202\n\nRefer to NASTRAN User\'s Manual for definitions of c a r d names\nused herein.\n\nThe DMAP sequence given in Appendix B solves eq. (9) and\neigenvectors yi (PHI in DMAP) thus obtained a r e transformed to ui\n(PHID i n DMAP) which a r e the eigenvectors of eq. (8).\n\nIt is essential that two subcases a r e used in the c a s e control\ndeck as shown below for successful completion of the NASTRAN run.\nCASE CONTROL DECK\nTITLE\n\nSUBCASE 1\nDISPLACEMENT = ALL\n\nSUBCASE 2\nDSCOEFFICIENT = DEFAULT\nBEGIN BULK\n\nNo provision for checkpoint is made since the time taken to\nassemble the matrices is just a fraction of the t i m e taken to find a\nfew eigenvalues.\n\nFUNCTIONAL MODULE PROGRAMING NOTES\n\nIn writing a functional module for NASTRAN, the concept of\nopen c o r e should be employed even if the corresponding logic for a n\nopen c o r e a r r a y is not used. This gives the generality and possibility\nof l a t e r expansions without having to a l t e r the program extensively.\nThis does not mean that the fixed dimensioned a r r a y s cannot be used\nin NASTRAN functional modules. The details of the open c o r e concept\na r e given in Section 1.5 of the P r o g r a m e r \' s Manual. Once the dimensions\na r e s e t either by open c o r e o r by fixed locations, the next steps a r e\neither t o retrieve the data (input blocks) to be used for further computations o r to s t o r e the computed data (output blocks) in a prescribed\nformat within NASTRAN. The data as described in Section 2.2 of the\nP r o g r a m e r \' s Manual may be in the f o r m of a matrix, a table o r bulk\ndata cards.\nA matrix data a r e stored in two separate parts. One part\nconstitutes the name of the matrix in alpha-numeric f o r m (Header\nInformation). The columns of the matrix a r e stored on random a c c e s s\nperipheral equipments.\n\nThe second p a r t is called the T r a i l e r Information and i s stored\nin FIAT which i s a n executive system table of NASTRAN. The f i r s t\np a r t is stored a s a set of logical records: the first record i s the\nHeader information, and the second and subsequent logical records\nuntil the end of file is reached a r e the columns of a matrix, The\nT r a i l e r informations, which i s the collection of the properties (size,\nreal, complex, symmetric, etc. ) of all the m a t r i c e s used in NASTRAN\na r e given in the P r o g r a m e r \' s Manual but if new matrices a r e created,\ntheir T r a i l e r information should be stored according to the instructions\non page 2.2-2 of the P r o g r a m e r \' s Manual. Either of the above two\np a r t s describing a matrix can be called, a s shown l a t e r , without\ndisturbing the other.\nE a c h of the m a t r i c e s , whether constructed by NASTRAN or\ncomputed in a functional module and designated a s a n input o r output\nblock in a particular DMAP statement should be r e f e r r e d to by a file\nnumber. The numbering system of a file is standardized by NASTRAN\na s consisting of three digits. The f i r s t digit takes value 1 if it i s a n\ninput block and 2 if it i s a n output block; the second and third digits\nr e f e r to m a t r i x location in the string of input o r output data blocks.\nF o r example, file number 102 in DMAP statement DUMMOD1 given in\nAppendix B r e f e r s to the second input block which i s a n unreduced m a s s\nm a t r i x Mgg whereas 2 0 3 r e f e r s to the third output block which i s the\nCoriolis acceleration m a t r i x G.\nIn o r d e r to read the desired matrix, the following set of calls\nto subroutines listed below w i l l unpack and read the m a t r i x data. In\neach of the subroutines the file number for the appropriate m a t r i x\ndata block must be included in appropriate argument.\nCALL\nCALL\nCALL\nCALL\n\nRDTRL\nOPEN\nFWDREC\nUNPACK\n\nCALL UNPACK\nCALL CLOSE\nThe subroutine RDTRL calls on the file number appearing in i t s argument for the T r a i l e r information. A call on RDTRL can also be made\nafter calling OPEN, i f desired. Subroutine OPEN opens the file to be\nread. FWDREC positions the requested file forward one logical record\nthereby skipping the f i r s t r e c o r d in this particular example. If for\n\n204\n\nsome reason two logical records need to be skipped, FWDREC i s called\ntwice. Each call to UNPACK allows the reading of one column (a logical\nrecord) of a m a t r i x a t a time. The call to UNPACK can be put within a\nDO-loop once the information on the number of columns of the matrix i s\nobtained f r o m T r a i l e r information. After the reading of columns i s\ncompleted the subroutine CLOSE is called to close the file a s soon as\npracticable.\n\nIf the data a r e in tabular form, instead of calling UNPACK, call\nREAD to read the data. Each call to READ reads one logical record\nof the data. The p r o g r a m e r \' s manual should be consulted f o r structure\nof the record read. The call to READ can be put either within a DO-loop\nonce the information on the number of records i s obtained f r o m T r a i l e r\ninformation o r within a n unending DO-loop in which case, when the end\nof file i s reached, the transfer w i l l be made to a statement number\nappearing in the argument of READ. The set of calls is shown a s\nCALL\nCALL\nCALL\nCALL\n\nRDTRL\nOPEN\nFWDREC\nREAD\n\nCALL READ\nCALL CLOSE\nI f the data on Bulk Data Cards a r e desired to be retrieved the\nfollowing s e t of calls to subroutines should be employed.\n\nCALL PRELOC\nCALL LOCATE\nCALL READ\n\nCALL READ\nCALL CLOSE\nSubroutine PRELOC locates the file on which the bulk data card\nimages a r e stored and LOCATE locates the desired number of cards\nin the file.\nIn DMAP statement DUMMOD1 file number 101 which is GEOM1,\n.contains the geometric i n f o r m t i o n f r o m Bulk Data Cards. This file\nnumber is called in PRELOC subroutine, For each bulk data card\nto be read, subroutine READ should be called.\n\nT o pack the m a t r i c e s calculated i n a subroutine a n d appearing\nas output data block the following set of calls t o subroutines is r e q u i r e d .\nCALL OPEN\nC A L L FNAME (finds H e a d e r information)\nP r e p a r e T r a i l e r information (e. g.

If M(2) = 1, t h e information on the n u m b e r of\ncolumns s t o r e d i n T r a i l e r information will show one m o r e than the\nvalue d e s i r e d .

In the development of this\nprogram, four functional modules a r e written. In addition s e v e r a l\nother functional modules for other NASA projects at MSFC have a l s o\nbeen written. All these functional modules a r e given dummy names as\ngiven in U s e r \' s Manual. Because the procedure given in NASTRAN\'s\nprogram manual a r e either incomplete or in e r r o r , attempts to add\nnew functional modules with unique name and unique MPL (Module\nProperties List) have not been met any degree of success.\nIt i s acknowledged that most of the information presented in this\nsection may be found throughout the P r o g r a m e r \' s Manual. However,\nit w i l l take a considerable time to assemble and use. H e r e w e have\npresented the information we collected through t r i a l and e r r o r and\nmonths of diligent work by two expert programers. We present it\nwith the hopes that someone wishing to write their new functional\nmodules w i l l not have to encounter the same difficulties.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n\nThe help of Mr. Archie Jordan and Mr. Tommy Franklin of\nComputer Science Corporation of Huntsville, Alabama in successfully\ncompleting the programing of this altered version of NASTRAN to solve\nthe Complex Eigenvalue Analysis of Rotating Structures i s appreciated.\nThis effort w a s made possible by Bettye L.

The deformed shape of the sidewall presents an outward bulging. The analysis of a homogeneous isotropic toroidal shell shows that the\nproblem is common to all solids of this type. The study suggests that the\ngeometric stiffness due to the inflation pressure has to be taken into account. Also, the resulting large displacements make it necessary for the\ngeometry to be up-dated at each load step.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe tire is a mass-produced industrial product, and therefore those\nwho are not specialists tend to believe that its mechanical behavior is\nwell known and precisely analyzed. However, the tire engineer knows that\nthis is not the case because of the rather unique characteristics of rubber.\nA survey of available literature shows that most often empirical methods are used to determine the behavior of existing tires (References 1 ,\n2 and 3). In the design field a few analytical methods are available to determine the dimensional and inflated geometry of the tire (References 4 , 5\nand 6. In addition, results of wider applicability have been obtained by\n)\nZorowski using finite element shell theory type modelization which included\nnonlinear relations of the mid-surface strain (Reference 7.\n)\n\n263\n\nThe reasons for the lack of theoretical work are that stress analysis\nof tires is a rather formidable task. It involves large displacement analysis, nearly incompressible materials, viscoelasticity and thermal conduction and radiation. At the same time one must account for the heat generated\nunder dynamic loading conditions. Heretofore it has not been possible to\nsolve even part of the problem by the most powerful analytical methods. Recently, however, large-size finite element methods became available and were\napplied successfully to a number of \'complex problems. Because of the generality of these programs, it was thought that the method might be applicable\nto stress analysis of tires.\nThe ASKA program was selected because it has a very wide variety of\nfinite elements which includes tridimensional elements. Some other programs,\nsuch as TITUS, developed in France by CITRA, have also been tested. However,\nthe most significant results were obtained by means of ASKA. A singular point\nis encountered on the sidewall of the tire. Different solutions are proposed\nand their economical feasability are discussed.\n\nSYMBOLS\nU\n\ndisplacement\n\n0-\n\nstress\n\n,m\n\n, m/m2\n\nSubscript:\nR, Z and T\n\nradial, axial, and hoop components\n\nANALYSIS OF THE TIRE\nThe calculations were carried out on a radial type KLEBER V I 0 RS experimental Rallye-Racing tire. A cross-sectional view of the initial shape\ntaken as the mold shape of the tire is shown in Figure 1 . The bead wires\nare made of steel and the flipper is a nylon fabric with the fibers lying\nat 2 T / 4 rad relative to the radius. The carcass is a made of textile with\nfibers having a radial orientation. The belt has four layers of glass-fiber\ncords supplied by OWENS CORNING FIBERGLASS forming an angle of + 0.35 rad\nwith the equatorial plan. The tube-type tire is fitted on a 7 5-13 rim. In\nthe course of determining the material properties, several problems had to\nbe solved.\nI - Rubber - Experimentally it has been established that for deformations\nnot exceeding 10-15 X mm/m,the usual HOOKE law applies to vuleanizates.\nThe HOOKE\'s coefficients are determined making allowance for the instanteneous geometry of the specimen (Reference 8). For all rubber elements, the\nassumed POISSON\'S ratio is 0.49. Tests were carried out on normalized flat\nuniaxial tensile test pieces cut out of the vulcanized tire.\n\n264\n\n2 - Composite Materials - The strains in composite specimens were determined by taking photographs: one before and one after deformation. A network\nof orthogonal lines drawn on the surface of the specimen was used as a benchmark. The aim was to investigate the material properties at low strains in\nthe range which obeys the HOOKE\'s law (Reference 9).\nFinite element idealization\nThe ASKA program, 4.2 Level, was selected to calculate the static\nstresses in the tire. The inflated tire was analyzed with the help of\nTRIAX 6 and TRIAXC 6 linearly varying strain ring elements. The index C is\nrelative to a curved-edge element. Both elements can be anisotropic, have\nsix nodes,and support only axisymmetric loads. Each node has two displacement degrees of freedom.\nThe idealization shown Figure 2 encompasses about 577 elements and\n1300 nodes. A l l elements have a ratio of the smaller edge to the larger one\nthat is at least equal to 1/7. However, in some places, such as the bead\nwires, the angle of two edges was much smaller than T / 3 rad.\na - Tread - Half the thickness of the tire\'s tread was removed. In this\ncase, the tread grooves can be assumed to be axisymmetric, and a more realistic tread groove cracking analysis can be carried out. The material is\nassumed to be isotropic.\nb - Belt - It is idealized by means of an orthotropic equivalent material.\nThe generalized HOOKE\'s coefficients are determined using coefficients obtained by single-layer tests and the equations in Reference IO.\n\nc\n\n-\n\nd\n\n- The carcass is orthotropic. No provisions were made for making\n\nRubber reinforcement at the edge of the belt\n\nance for shaping the carcass before vulcanization.\n\n-\n\ngum tip\n\n-\n\nisotropic.\nallow-\n\nHOOKE\'s coefficients\n\nare determined as for the belt.\ne\n\n-\n\nf\n\n- Rim load transfer rubber - rim cushion - isotropic.\n\ng\n\n- Bead filler\n\nSidewall\n\n-\n\nisotropic\n\n-\n\nisotropic\n\nh - Flipper - Idealized by means of an equivalent orthotropic material\nusing the corrected equations in Reference 10 (page 77).\ni - Bead wires are analyzed like the flipper. The equivalent material\nis orthotropic.\n\n1-\n\nj\n\nInner liner\n\n- isotropic.\n\n-\n\nBoundary conditiclns In the equatorial plane all uz have been assumed\nto equal zero. The influence of the rim has been taken into account by\n\n265\n\nassuming that the rim is rigid and that the tire takes the form of the rim\nalong the contact area.\nOne possibility is that the exact contact area may be determined by\nobserving the sign of the normal contact stresses and modifying by trial and\nerror the assumed boundary displacements.\n2 - Loading cases - In the first case it was assumed that there was a\npressure of 0.1 MN/m2 and zero displacement within the initial rim contact\narea. The second case was the study at zero inflation pressure of the effect of mounting the tire on the rim. In the third case the two preceding\ncases are combined assuming an inflation pressure of 0.25 MN/m2.\n\nRESULTS\nA verification of the input data was carried out by in-house plotting\npackages. A program, for instance, involves plotting the contour of each\nparticular material. I is also possible to plot the mesh showing either\nt\nthe contour of each element or the location of the nodes. Any element that\nis missing appears as an inlet in the contour line of the material.\n\nTo obtain an image of the stress, ASKA gives only the elemental stresses of anisotropic materials. Thus, it was necessary to set up a program to\ndetermine the arithmetic mean for each material separately. Standard deviation was also determined. Stress contours were plotted for the b ~ ,\nT\nd z z , ~ T and dm. Because the stress distribution is linear across an\nelement, the contours cross the elements in straight-line segments. Thus,\nthe adequacy of the mesh can be assessed. The results obtained are shown in\nFigures 4 and 5.\nThere are two ways to use the information given by the stress contours.\nIn the part of the tire where the behavior is linear, the results can be\nused to analyze the tire quantitatively and to predict its fatigue behavior.\nIn the range where the behavior is nonlinear, the results can be used for a\nqualitative assessement of the fatigue performance of the particular detail.\nIn this case, the magnitude of the stress concentration rather than the\ngross stresses are obtained. The stress concentrations are located in ranges\nwhere fatigue problems have been actually encountered.\n\nI may be of interest to the designer to know that inflated tire ret\nsults can already indicate where fatigue problems occur during the service\nlife of the tire. For example, cracks tend to grow along the length of the\ngroove which is next to the shoulder. However, since the abrasion of a\nracing tire is very rapid, there is not enough time for any cracks to grow.\nFigure 4 shows that at the tread groove location the highest positive stress\nis @zz. Cracks are generally produced normal to the largest tension stress.\nFurthermore, none of the other grooves have a large stress concentration.\nThus, both the orientation of the crack and its location can be predicted by\n266\n\na finite element stress analysis. Because of the low modulus of the rubber,\nit is to be noted that the strains at the shoulder groove are about 20 %\nmm/mm.\nAnother interesting result concerns the inner liner. The analysis shows\nthat the inner liner has no effect on the deformation of the tire. Thus, to\nreduce the computation time the inner liner and, more generally, all nonload-carrying parts can be analyzed separately by applying to their boundary\nthe displacements obtained in a preliminary calculation of the load-carrying elements of the tire.\n\nCORRELATION OF TEST AND ASKA RESULTS\nFigure 3 shows a plot of the deformed and initial geometry of the tire.\nOn the sidewall, due to small bending stiffness and the large displacements\noccurring in this part, the tire bulges outward. Further, the deformed tire\nhas a point of inflection that has never been observed on a tire.\nAn experimental check was carried out by measuring the tire\'s circumference and its maximum section width. The solid-line curve shows the theoretical results and the triangles show the test points. (See Figures 6-9).\nAt a pressure as high as the service pressure of 0.25 MN/m2, agreement between theory and tests is satisfactory on the center line of the tread and\n)\nthe adjacent area (Figures 6 and 7. However, as shown by Figures 8 and 9,\noutside this range the computed displacements do not agree with the measured\nones. Notice that the tire width change is a noplinear function of the pressure starting from pressures as low as 0.03 MN/m2.\n\nTOROIDAL SIDEWALL SINGULARITY\nThe problem of the sidewall singularity in the tire is a part of the\nvery complex tire problem.\n\nI was therefore decided to study a similar but much simpler solid such\nt\nas a toroidal isotropic shell. The cross-section of the toroidal shell was\ncircular, its thickness was\nm, its YOUNG\'S modulus was 2.5 MN/m2 and\nits POISSON\'S ratio was 0 . 4 9 . I was inflated to .0074 MN/m2. Figure 10\nt\nshows the initial and deformed geometry obtained by means of TRIAX 6 elements. The same type of behavior as previously observed in the tire occurs\nagain.\nExperiments are described in Reference 11 showing the deformed shape of the\nsolid described above. A nearly perfect circular cross section was found.\nThus, the bulging of the sidewall is a purely mathematical problem. At the\nsingularity point, one radius of curvature becomes infinite. The problem is\nsimilar to that of a transversely loaded clamped membrane plate. The equili-\n\nbrim of the forces can only be obtained by taking into account the deformed\nsurface of the membrane. In finite element analysis, however, due to the\nfact that curves are approximated by straight lines, the chance of obtaining\nan infinite radius of curvature is very slight.\nThe explanation for the singularity that is nevertheless observed was\ngiven in Reference 12. I was established in the above reference paper that\nt\nthe sidewall singularity of the membrane toroid is not removed by introducing the bending stiffness. The pressurized shell has a pressure stiffness in\naddition to its bending stiffness. Additional computations are carried out\npresently using small load step increments and up-dating the geometry following a load step. In this case, the singularity is attenuated. But the computation time increases linearly with the number of load steps chosen. The\ncomputation of one load step on CDC 6600/single precision, 3 substructures,\n3 load cqses, with 2 tapes takes 374 s CP, 1721 s PP and a field length of\n47 K CM, for the TRIAX 6 modelization of the tire.\nIn the preceding discussion only linear finite element programs have\nbeen considered. However, programs with nonlinear capability are available.\nIn fact, several examples given at the NASTRAN Users\' Colloquium show\nthat NASTRAN\'s differential stiffness capability might offer more adequate\nmeans for solving the problem. Because of the lack of three-dimensional elements such a calculation could not be carried out until recently.\n\nCONCLUSION\nLinear finite element codes are not applicable to the analysis of toroidal solids because of the toroidal singularity. The geometric stiffness due\nto the inflation pressure must be taken into account. This can be done, for\ninstance, by increasing the load step by step and up-dating the geometry.\nResearch is being carried out at the present time by KLEBER with the aim\nof developing or identifying finite element methods incorporating the\nabove-described modifications to the classical equations.\nIn conclusion, the straight-forward stress analysis by means of available linear finite element programs is uneconomical, in any event, as long\nas the computation time cannot be reduced.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors wish to express their appreciation to the Civil Engineering\nSection of the Soci6tg Informatique Appliquge, Metra International, and\nespecially to their chief engineer, Mr. G.

A t t h e same time, a n a l y t i c a l r e s u l t s\nshould be obtained with minimum computer c o s t s . However, one should n o t look\nat e f f i c i e n c y alone, but must a l s o consider program c a p a b i l i t i e s and i n t e r f a c e\nproblems associated with i n t e g r a t i n g t h e f i n i t e element program i n t o t h e design\nalgorithm. These general requirements lead t o s p e c i f i c requirements f o r a\ns t r u c t u r a l a n a l y s i s program i n t h e following areas:\n1.\n\nEfficiency\na. Core requirements\nb.

Three programs were considered i n t h i s study ranging from moderate\nt o broad i n c a p a b i l i t y . The programs a r e ELAS, reference 2, a r e l a t i v e l y small\nf i n i t e element program limited t o s t a t i c s t r u c t u r a l analysis and p r e s e n t l y used\ni n t h e FADES program; SNAP, reference 3, a p r o p r i e t a r y s t a t i c analysis f i n i t e\nelement program e f f i c i e n t f o r l a r g e s t r u c t u r e s ; and NASTRAN, reference 4 ,\nNASA\'s general purpose s t r u c t u r a l analysis program.\n(Some of t h e more important\nc a p a b i l i t i e s are l i s t e d i n Table I ) .\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nA s t r u c t u r a l configuration r e p r e s e n t a t i v e of an aircraft fuselage s e c t i o n\nwas used i n t h e s t u d i e s t o compare t h e three programs. A model of t h e configur a t i o n i s set up s o t h a t t h e number of r i n g s , s t r i n g e r s , and f l o o r members\nwas e a s i l y changed through a model generating program which prepared input t o\na l l t h r e e programs (see f i g u r e 2 f o r two sample configurations). This procedure f a c i l i t a t e d running i d e n t i c a l problems with t h e t h r e e programs with a\nminimum of intermediate e f f o r t . Ring elements and t r a n s v e r s e f l o o r elements\nwere modeled using a t y p i c a l beam formulation (combined bending and extension).\nS t r i n g e r elements and longitudinal f l o o r elements were modeled by a rod\nformulation (extensional p r o p e r t i e s only). Skin s e c t i o n s were modeled using\nt h e constant s t r a i n membrane p l a t e element i n N S R N and ELAS, and t h e Pian\nAT A\nhybrid membrane i n SNAP. A comparison of t h e membrane formulations may be\nfound i n references 5 and 6. The loading i n a l l cases was a s e l f - e q u i l i b r a t i n g compressive f o r c e applied t o each o f t h e g r i d p o i n t s of t h e end r i n g s .\nProblem s i z e ranged from 90 g r i d p o i n t s , 360 D .

ELAS was run using version 75, SNAP using version\nJ , and N S R N using l e v e l 15.1.1, a p r e - r e l e a s e form of l e v e l 15.

The s t e e p slope of the ELAS curve i s due t o t h e fact\nt h a t ELAS requires t h e complete s t i f f n e s s matrix in-core during execution.\nBoth SNAP and N S R N are not l i m i t e d by t h i s requirement and, therefore,\nAT A\ncan handle f a i r l y l a r g e problems i n a minimum of core; the SNAP core requirement i s t h e lesser of t h e two.\nTotal execution times f o r a number of configuration sizes a r e shown i n\nf i g u r e 4 f o r S A and NASTRAN. ELAS times are not included because of\nNP\nAT A\nproblem s i z e ; however, f o r smaller problems, ELAS and N S R N execution\ntimes are similar. The top t h r e e curves i n d i c a t e N S R N execution times\nAT A\nincrease with increasing problem s i z e . These a l s o show t h a t t i m e increases\nwith increasing number o f g r i d p o i n t s per r i n g .

Thus,\nprogram g e n e r a l i t y may be as important as e f f i c i e n c y c o n s i d e r a t i o n s . For such\na case, N S R N i s t h e only program of t h e t h r e e t h a t has a broad range of\nAT A\na n a l y s i s c a p a b i l i t y . The SNAP program has a free v i b r a t i o n counterpart, but\na t p r e s e n t , it i s a s e p a r a t e program and r e q u i r e s regeneration o f i n p u t .\n\nUser conveniences are a l s o important i f t h e a n a l y s i s program i s t o be\ne a s i l y i n t e r f a c e d with a design algorithm. A l l of t h e programs have well\ndocumented, standardized input f o r which an input generating program may be\ndeveloped t o h e l p reduce e r r o r s i n input. A l l t h r e e programs a l s o have some\nform of i n t e r n a l d a t a checking with d i a g n o s t i c e r r o r p r i n t o u t . However, only\none of t h e programs, SNAP, allows t h e u s e r t o d e f i n e d e s i r e d output and on\nwhich f i l e s i t should be placed. This i s very d e s i r a b l e from t h e standpoint\nof automated design i f d i f f e r e n t elements are designed a t d i f f e r e n t times.\nAT A\nCurrent t h e o r e t i c a l documentation i s adequate f o r N S R N only.

Due t o problem s i z e\nl i m i t a t i o n s , ELAS does not appear t o be s u i t a b l e f o r t h i s purpose. The p r e s e n t\nspeed of SNAP makes i t d e s i r a b l e i n a design environment where many r e p e t i t i v e\nanalyses are required. However, t h e g e n e r a l i t y of NASTRAN may overshadow t h e\nfact it i s less e f f i c i e n t than SNAP.

For\nt h i s purpose s e v e r a l s p e c i a l DMAP modules were developed and introduced i n t o\nthe CALAC version of t h e NASTRAN system.\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe decision t o use N S R N as a major a n a l y s i s t o o l , i m p l i c i t l y l e a d s , i n\nAT A\nour opinion, t o the need f o r t h e user-company t o a c t i v e l y pursue t o a degree i t s\nown development of the lsrogram system. Regardless of t h e q u a l i t y of t h e a v a i l able system, t h e time w i l l soon a r r i v e when s p e c i f i c company p r i o r i t i e s do not\ncoincide with t h e more general p r i o r i t i e s of t h e NASTRAN Systems Management\nOffice. A t t h i s time t h e company w i l l be forced t o respond with e i t h e r a d d i t i o n s\nand/or modifications t o NASTRAN, or development 6f i t s own system. I n t h e l a t t e r\ncase, i t s use of NASTRAN would tend t o diminish. If used a c t i v e l y , it thus appears\nunavoidable t h a t a company version w i l l emerge, which d e v i a t e s , i n a v a r i e t y of\naspects, from the o f f i c i a l l y released NASTRAN l e v e l .\nThe introduction of NASTRAN as t h e major program t o analyze t h e e l a s t i c\nbehavior of t h e s t r u c t u r e required i t s adaptation and connection i n t o t h e\ncomplete s t r u c t u r a l system a n a l y s i s process f o r determining t h e response of\nthe a i r c r a f t . The purpose of t h e complete system is the a n a l y s i s of t h e environment which has a b e a r i n g on t h e s t r u c t u r a l i n t e g r i t y of t h e a i r c r a f t .\nAnalyses t o be performed include f l u t t e r , steady and t r a n s i e n t maneuver loads,\ngust and ground response, and t h e i r e f f e c t s on i n t e r n a l loads, s t r e s s e s and\ndeflections.\nThis adaptation r e q u i r e s t h e i n t e g r a t i o n of NASTRAN w i t h t h e e x i s t i n g set\nof computer codes which provide t h e s e analyses and which a r e complementary t o\nthe N S R N s t r u c t u r a l a n a l y s i s program.

It i s l i k e l y t o be an e n t i r e l y d i f f e r e n t affair f o r NASA\nthan it is f o r any one of t h e i n d u s t r i a l users. The readiness of any company\nt o f u l l y accept NASTRAN as a standard system depends on i t s own in-house programs and t h e ease with which t h e former can be modified and adapted without\nloss i n efficiency.\nThe present paper i s t h e r e f o r e an example only of what t h e LockheedC a l i f o r n i a Company has done, and i s planning t o do i n t h e immediate f u t u r e , t o\nj o i n NASTRAN as a major (but not t h e only) f i n i t e element a n a l y s i s program t o\ni t s s t r u c t u r a l a n a l y s i s system.\n\nA discussion of t h i s nature may serve t o s t i m u l a t e ideas and contribute t o\nt h e formation of system s p e c i f i c a t i o n s from t h e p r a c t i c a l operation a s p e c t s of\nl a r g e a i r c r a f t design.

(See R e f . 1.)\n1. AN INTEGFATED STRUCTURAL DESIGN ANALYSIS SYSTEM\nTo d i s c u s s an i n t e g r a t e d s t r u c t u r a l design a n a l y s i s system we must d e f i n e\ni t s scope and then determine t h e r o l e of i t s p a r t s and programs which a r e t o\nperform i t s various functions.\n1.1 The T o t a l System\n\nThe system which w i l l be described here b r i e f l y has i n s i m i l a r form been\nconsidered throughout t h e industry. The t o t a l a n a l y s i s system may be s a i d t o\nc o n s i s t of t h e complete environment which a f f e c t s the s t r u c t u r a l i n t e g r i t y of\nt h e a i r c r a f t . A s such it must incorporate t h e following major design a n a l y s i s\nfacets :\n1. S t r u c t u r a l deformation and s t r e s s a n a l y s i s by f i n i t e element methods\n2. Weight accounting and mass matrix\n3. Aerodynamic f o r c e s\n4. S t a t i c and dynamic l o a d s and design conditions\n5. F l u t t e r a n a l y s i s\n6. D e t a i l stress a n a l y s i s\n7. Design s t r e n g t h allowables and margins of s a f e t y .\n1.2\n\nThe CALAC Analysis System\n\nTo discuss t h e a c t i v i t i e s and t h e plans of t h e Lockheed-California\nCompany (CALAC) f o r development of t h e NASTRAN system, we should review t h e\ns t r u c t u r e of the in-house a n a l y s i s process as it p r e s e n t l y e x i s t s . This\nincludes NASTRAN as a major f i n i t e element a n a l y s i s t o o l , which i s f u l l y operat i o n a l and has been used f o r s e v e r a l important a n a l y s i s jobs. The concept of\nt h e completed system i s shown on Table 1.\nThe Lockheed-California Company\'s s t r u c t u r a l a n a l y s i s operations a r e based\non i t s extensive system of matrix algebra and f u n c t i o n a l modules, c a l l e d FAMAS.\nThe F M S system, o r i g i n a l l y an acronym f o r F l u t t e r and Matrix Algebra System,\nA A\n\nhas been developed a t GALAC and has been expanded i n scope far beyond t h e s e\nnarrow l i m i t s . This system includes t h e CALAC f i n i t e element programs of t h e\nforce method and s e v e r a l displacement method programs of l e s s e r scope than\nNASTRAN. These a r e now gradually being replaced by NASTRAN.\nA A\nThe F M S system has completely compatible matrix input/output within a l l\ni t s programs , contains a very extensive matrix algebra and manipulation system,\nand a l a r g e family of f u n c t i o n a l modules f o r aerodynamic loads, s t r u c t u r a l\nresponse and f l u t t e r a n a l y s i s , which a r e of prime importance i n t h e present\ncontext. The system was extensively used during t h e SST design study, L-1011\nand S-3A programs. It is operated by a simple program c a l l i n g system, and has\na l s o a compiler f o r programming s t r i n g s of matrix equations much l i k e\nFORTRAN algebraic expressions. The g e n e r a l c a p a b i l i t i e s of t h i s system a r e\nsummarized on Table 2. I n some a l g e b r a i c a l and f u n c t i o n a l modules t h e NASTRAN\nand F M S systems contain d u p l i c a t e c a p a b i l i t i e s . I n general, however, t h e y\nA A\nsupplement each o t h e r e x t ens i v e l y\n\n.\n\nA v a r i e t y of t h e o r i e s a r e used i n FAMAS t o c a l c u l a t e aerodynamic force\ninfluence c o e f f i c i e n t matrices , including important procedures t o update\nt h e o r e t i c a l values with experimental f l i g h t and wind t u n n e l data. A paper\ngiven by John Lewolt of CALAC a t t h e August 1972 meeting of t h e AIAA, Reference\n2, discusses t h i s c a p a b i l i t y i n considerable d e t a i l .\n\nThe FAMAS input/output compatibility permits any matrix, s p e c i f i c a l l y\ns t i f f n e s s - , f l e x i b i l i t y - , aero- and mass- matrices, r e s u l t i n g d i r e c t l y from a\npreviously executed program module, o r f r o m d a t a s t o r a g e , t o be used, a s i n\nNASTRAN, as input t o subsequent v i b r a t i o n , load and f l u t t e r a n a l y s i s . Any\ndesign load matrix thus generated can be f e d i n t o an a i r p l a n e f i n i t e element\ns t r u c t u r a l analysis program f o r determining i n t e r n a l l o a d s , s t r e s s e s and\ndeflections. Any matrix, for example, s t r e s s matrices, can be scanned row\nby TOW, t h a t i s , element by element, f o r t h e most c r i t i c a l columns \'(design\nconditions), o r can f u r t h e r be processed.

A s many analyses s t e p s as d e s i r e d and\np r a c t i c a l can be performed i n a s i n g l e job submittal t o t h e computer.

Table 3 shows a summary of t h e\nc a p a b i l i t i e s of t h e combined system, which communicates through t a p e and d i s c\nstorage without human d a t a handling.\n\n1.3 NASTRAN\'s P a r t i n t h e System\nThe p a r t which NASTRAN i s playing i n t h e combined system includes, of\ncourse, a l l i t s f i n i t e element a n a l y s i s c a p a b i l i t i e s i n s t a t i c , dynamic, and\ns t r u c t u r a l s t a b i l i t y , e x c e p t i n g s p e c i a l problems where separate programs may\nbe preferable. There are however, some problem a r e a s within NASTRAN i t s e l f\nwhich w f e e l must e v e n t u a l l y be resolved t o make i t s use as a t o o l f o r\ne\n\n291\n\nf i n i t e element a n a l y s i s of a i r c r a f t s t r u c t u r e s b e t t e r adapted t o p r o j e c t needs.\nThese concern, i n our view, the following major areas:\n\no Extended a n a l y s i s checking c a p a b i l i t i e s f o r f o r c e equilibrium and\nimprovement of checking and l o c a t i o n of matrix s i n g u l a r i t i e s .\no\n\nImproved s t r e s s a n a l y s i s c a p a b i l i t y p r i m a r i l y through t h e a d d i t i o n\nof f i n i t e elements with b e t t e r s t r e s s d e f i n i t i o n within t h e standard\ndegrees of freedoms.\n\no\n\nSubstructure coupling i s of g r e a t importance f o r l a r g e airframe analysis;\nmethods t o streamline t h e present c a p a b i l i t y of NASTRAN i n t h i s f i e l d\na r e being pursued a t CAZAC.\n2.\n\nNASTRAN MODIE\'ICATIONS AND ADDITIONS\n\nSeveral new D A modules were added i n t o NASTRAN, those which serve t h e\nMP\ns p e c i f i c purpo\'se of connecting NASTRAN with FAMAS, and those which were needed\nt o amplify i t s o p e r a t i o n a l c a p a b i l i t y and f l e x i b i l i t y within the CALAC a n a l y s i s\nsystem. The Job Control Language (JCL) i n t h e IBM-360 system permits a s i n g l e ,\nuninterrupted job run from e i t h e r NASTRAN i n t o FAMAS, o r v i c e versa. This\nprovides adequate operational f l e x i b i l i t y , s i n c e i n t e r r u p t i o n s f o r t h e purpose\nof intermediate d a t a checking a r e required anyway.\n2.1\n\nThe Process of Adaptation of NASTRAN\n\nThe new f a c i l i t i e s designed t o complement t h e i n t e g r a t e d system were added\na s D A modules i n t o t h e NASTRAN system.

I n s t e a d a new D A\nMP\nmodule under a new c a l l i n g code was formed, cons.isting, i f necessary,\nof o r i g i n a l subroutines a s well as new subroutines. This prevents t h e\nd i s r u p t i o n of b a s i c NASTRAN c a p a b i l i t i e s i n the r i g i d formats even i f\nN S makes changes i n t h e b a s i c modules a t a l a t e r d a t e .\nAA\no\n\nSimilarly, v a r i a t i o n s o r additions t o e x i s t i n g t a b l e s were given new\ni d e n t i t i e s , with a format i d e n t i c a l o r similar t o t h e e x i s t i n g one i f\nfeasible.\n\no\n\nTo avoid ( f o r the t i m e being) t h e need t o define many new bulk d a t a\ncards, and t h e ensuing complications, p i t f a l l s and delays, it was\ndecided t o input s p e c i a l d a t a types by means of the d i r e c t input t a b l e s\nDTI. These can f a i r l y w e l l be accommodated t o a card format similar\nt o bulk d a t a type cards. This method a l s o avoids a c c i d e n t a l c o l l i s i o n\nwith new bulk cards introduced by NASA. However, s i n c e bulk d a t a cards\nare preferable, an agreement of N M , reserving some s p e c i a l code l e t t e r\nS O\nf o r u s e r card types might be advantageous.\n\no\n\nSince t h e s p e c i a l NASTRAN modules added w i l l not be used f r e q u e n t l y i n\nt h e many standard a p p l i c a t i o n s , t h e y have not at t h i s time been i n t r o duced i n any r i g i d formats, but a r e , when needed, i n s e r t e d i n s t e a d o f ,\no r i n a d d i t i o n t o , r e g u l a r DMAP sequences by ALTER s e t s .\n\n2.2\n\nNew CALAC-NASTRAN Modules\n\nTo accomplish t h e connection between t h e NASTRAN and F M S systems, and\nA A\nprovide t h e a d d i t i o n a l o p e r a t i o n a l f l e x i b i l i t y necessary, a s e r i e s of s p e c i a l\nCALAC-NASTRAN D A modules have been added o r are i n preparation f o r t h e\nMP\nfollowing functions.\n1 User designated data blocks f o r i n p u t o r output onto tapes (INPUTT, @l\xe2\x80\x9dUT)\n.\n\n2.\n\nNASTRAN-FAMAS n t e r f a c e matrix t r a n s c r i p t ion (FAMASI~)\ni\n\n3.

Honeycutt, Frank J. On,\nand Stuart L. Hanlein\nNASA\n\nGoddard Space Flight Center\nSUMMARY\n\nA static and buckling analysis of the ATS-F&G spacecraft\nreflector support truss (RST) and bridge truss assembly using\nNASTRAN has been conducted. The RST is fabricated from a new\nmaterial, graphite fiber reinforced plastic. A comparison is\nmade with the NASTRAN results and the results of a similar\nanalysis conducted using the STARDYNE program. The results of\nan actual static load test are also compared.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe ATS-F&G are a new generation of communication spacecraft. The predominate feature of these spacecraft is a 30 foot\nparabolic dish high gain antenna as can be seen in Figure 1. The\nreflector dish must be accurately aligned with the feed system\nand this alignment must be held throughout the spacecraft life.\nBecause of this rigid alignment requirement, a new material,\ngraphite fiber reinforced plastic (GFRP),was selected for the\nreflector support truss (RST) between the feed system and the\nparabolic reflector. The GFRP was chosen because of its extremely\nlow coefficient of thermal expansion and its high stiffness to\nweight ratio. Because of the newness of the material,\nparticularly in an application as primary structure, there was\nconcern about its capability to carry the launch loads. The\npresent NASTRAN analysis was conducted to evaluate deflections,\ninternal loads, and verify the adequacy of the RST design.\nDuring launch the reflector dish is wound around a hub and\nthe solar arrays are folded down as shown in Figure 2. In this\nconfiguration, the RST structure must support approximately 180\nkilograms at the top. Static acceleration loads were applied to\nthe RST structure as enveloping the dynamic loads during launch.\nThe load cases were applied 9.Og thrust plus 3.9g lateral and\n-3.9g thrust plus 3.9g lateral. The desired results of the\nanalysis were the buckling strength, internal member loads, and\ndeflections.\n303\n\nThe prime contractor for the ATS-F&G is Fairchild Industries\n(FI). They have used the STARDYNE program to conduct a similar\nanalysis (Ref. 1) which allowed a comparison of results. Hercules\nIncorporated is the subcontractor for the RST. The results of a\nqualification static loads test conducted by Hercules (Ref. 2 )\nalso provided test information for comparison.\nNASTRAN STATIC ANALYSIS\nThe results of the static analysis were obtained using Rigid\nFormat One in the NASTRAN program. Figures 3 and 4 depict the\nfinite elements used in synthesizing the NASTRAN model of the RST\nand bridge truss assembly. The overall model had 107 grid points,\n2 0 0 elements and 6 1 8 degrees of freedom. Note that the dots\n(grid points) represent the selected points at which discrete\nmasses are assumed to be concentrated, and the lines connecting\nthese points represent bar elements.\nIn the analyses, the RST structure was assumed to be fixed\nto ground via the support fittings at the Earth Viewing Module\n(EVM). The material in the hub, bridge truss, reflector support\nring and RST stabilizer is 6061-T6 aluminum. The material for\nthe RST is graphite fiber reinforced plastic ( G F R P ) . Element\nforces, bending moments, stresses, margins of safety and grid\npoint deflections were obtained for two cases (Table 1) of\napplied loading. The two cases of loading corresponded to force\nand moment inputs at specific grid points and were derived from\nthe acceleration loadings shown.\nSignificant results from the NASTRAN static analysis are\npresented in Figures 5 and 6, and Tables 2,3, and 4. Figures 5 anq\n6 show the deformed structure for the specified load cases. In\nTables 2 and 3, the results are tabulated for the maximum\ncompression and tension load members. Table 4 presents a summary\nof grid point deflections \xe2\x82\xacor Case 2.\nCOMPARISON OF NASTRAN AND STARDYNE STATIC ANALYSIS\nA similar analysis for the same two static load cases as\nwere investigated in the NASTRAN analysis was conducted by FI\nusing the STARDYNE program. The STARDYNE results for the maximum\ncompression and tension member loads and grid points deflections\nare also summarized in Tables 2, 3, and 4 for comparison with\nNASTRAN results.\n\nIn general, the NASTRAN and STARDYNE results show good\nagreement. Noted discrepancies in bending moment results may be\nattributed to differences in modeling details of the structure\n(e.9. in the STARDYNE analysis, the reflector hub ring was not\nincluded).\nNASTRAN BUCKLING ANALYSIS\nBuckling analysis for two maximum compression load conditions\nwas investigated using Rigid Format Five of the NASTRAN program.\nThese two load conditions corresponded to Cases 3 and 4 of\nTable 1\n.\nFrom the buckling analysis results, the fundamental mode of\nbuckling was well defined as can be seen in Figures 7 and 8.\nFigure 7 represents the fundamental buckling mode shape which\ncorresponds to the eigenvalue of 4.22 for lateral load in the\nx direction (Case 3). For lateral load in the y direction\n(Case 4) the fundamental buckling mode which corresponds to\nthe eigenvalue of 4.34 is shown in Figure 8. Since the eigenvalues are multipliers of the applied loads which will cause\nbuckling in the fundamental mode, the results show that, in both\nload cases investigated, the actual applied load must be\nexceeded by a factor of four before buckling will occur.\nSTATIC LOAD TEST\nThe prototype RST was tested to qualification load levels\nby Hercules Incorporated (Ref. 2). The test setup is shown in\nFigure 9. The truss was rigidly fast-ened at the base and a\nsimulated bridge truss was mounted on the top. Thq compression\nand/or tension loads were produced by the two hydraulic rams.\nThe lower hydraulic ram produced a load in the axial direction\nand the upper ram produced a moment or shearing load. Dial\nindicators and linear potentiometers were located at the top of\nthe RST and at the stabilizer ring to record displacements.\nThirty-six strain gages were attached to the GFRP tubes and\nfittings at critical locations. The loading of the structure\nwas in steps of 25%, 50%, 80%, 90% and 100% of full load. The\naxial and lateral loadings were applied simultaneously. The\ntruss was tested both in axial compression and tension with\ntransverse loading in the +x and -x directions. Then the entire\ntruss assembly was rotated 9 0 \xc2\xb0 and the truss was tested again\nin axial compression and tension with transverse loading in the\n+y and -y directions. Thus a total of eight combined loading\ntests were conducted.\n\nCOMPARISON OF TEST RESULTS WITH ANALYSIS\nFigure 10 compares the deflection test data and the NASTRAN\npredictions for Case 1 (see Figure 5). The test data were\n"normalized" since the actual test was conducted at qualification\nlevels. The variations from the predicted values at the higher\nload levels are due primarily to difficulties in reading the\ninstrumentation. The durations of the higher load levels were\nnot long enough to allow the dial indicator gages to stabilize.\nThe maximum internal tube load determined from the strain\ngage data was 24,768 newtons which compares well with 25,760\nnewtons from the STARDYNE program and 24,470 newtons from the\nNASTRAN program. It is felt that a more detailed model of the\ncomposite material would give better values for the loads along\nthe tubes.\nCONCLUSION\nThe comparison of the results between NASTRAN and STARDYNE\nwas good. The differences in the results were due to slight\ndifferences in the modeling techniques. It must be pointed\nout that the model was fairly simple with bar elements only\nused throughout. With more complex structures and different\nelements, the comparison of results might not be as good.\nThe comparison with test results was also good. It is\nbelieved that a more detailed finite element model of the\ncomposite material would yield more accurate comparison with\nstrain gage test data.\nREFERENCES\n1\n.

It has been reported t h a t the CQDMEM element does not accurately represent\n\nproblems involving high stress gradients, suggesting t h a t t h e current element\n\nneeds improvement. The reason for this difficulty is generally attributed to\nthe constant strain field provided by this element (ref. 2 ) .\n\nSeveral improved\n\nquadrilateral membrane elements have been developed which have linear strain\nfields (e,g. refs. 3 and 4 ) and these elements should provide improved results\nin membrane element applications. The implementation of an improved quadrilateral membrane element in NASTRAN was undertaken as an in-house project to\nimprove the element library by attempting to overcome the noted shortcomings.\nThe element chosen for implementation is the linear strain isoparametric\nquadrilateral membrane element described in references 3 and 4.\n\nThe reasons\n\nfor this choice are:\n(1)The element is conforming, 5.e. the displacements of adjoining\n\nelements are matched along their entire interface.

A stand-alone program has been written for the purpose of testing the\nelement in a NASTRAN-like environment, The first available test case for this\nelement is a cantilever beam modeled by 16 equal elements as shown in figure 3 .\nDisplacements and stresses were computed using the existing CQ,DMEM element and\nthe new isoparametric element based on the same finite element idealization.\nThe finite element results are then compared to an analytical solution based\non elementary beam theory. In figure 3 the analytical solution for displacements is indicated by the solid line and the finite element results by dashed\nlines. The new element is seen to be a significant improvement over the CQDMEM\nelement. When comparison is made with the analytical solution, the largest\nerror exhibited by CQDMEM is 50% whereas the corresponding error f o r the new\nelement is 9%. The comparison of stresses is presented in figure 4 where\nthe results have been normalized to the maximum stress predicted by elementary\nbeam theory. Although the finite element stresses were computed at a single\npoint in each element, these stresses are presented as continuous curves.\nAgain the exact solution is shown by the solid line and the finite element\nresults by dashed lines, The results indicate a significant improvement in\naccuracy by using the new element. The maximum error in stress using the\nC Q D W element is about 49% whereas that for the improved element is 14%.\nCONCLUDING RFWKS\n\nAn isopararoetric quadrilateral membrane element which is being\nimplemented in NASTRAN by the NASTRAN Systems Management Office is described.\nIncluded are descriptions of the basic geometry and deformation characteristics\nof the elenent, as w e l l as an outlime of the derivation of each of the required\nmatrices and vectors for the element. Derivations of the stiffness matrix,\nthermal load vector, stress recovery matrices, and differential stiffness\nmatrices are given. A discussion of the need for some method of accounting\nf o r deviations from plmeness is included along with a description of the\n\nmethod used for this purpose in the new element. Finally, a sample\n\ncalculation is carried out in which the displacements and stresses in a\ncantilever beam are computed by the new element and by the existing quadrilateral membrane (C&DMEM) and compared with an analytical solution from beam\ntheory, The significant increase in accuracy obtainable with the new element\nis demonstrated by the calculation.\n\n329\n\nAPPENDIX\nSENSITIVITY OF MEMBRANE RESULTS TO\nELEMENT GRID POINT NUMBERING SEQUENCE\nA numerical experiment suggested by Dr. Raphael Haftka, currently a\n\nNational Research Council postdoctoral Fellow at the Langley Research Center,\nis performed on the structure sketched at the top of table I. The top\nmember is non-planar and the vertical member is planar. Both members were\nrepresented by the new quadrilateral membrane element assumed to be planar\nwith the plane of each element being defined by three of its grid points.\nDisplacements under two loading conditions were computed by means of a\nstand-alone program. In the calculations, the grid point sequence f o r the\ntop member was varied as shown in table I, and the effects of these variations are shown in table 11. Examination of table I1 (a) shows that for a\nload applied in the X-direction, the displacements both in the X-Y plane and\nnormal to it are sensitive to the grid point numbering. For example, there\nis a 12% difference among the displacements in the Y-direction as well as\namong the displacements in the Z-direction at grid point 3. For the case of\nloads in the Z-direction there is a difference among the displacements in\nthe Y-direction of 46%. The consequences of these percentage errors are\ntempered by the observation that the large errors noted always occurred in\ndisplacement components which were not in the direction of the applied load.\nBy contrast the maximum difference was 1.5% for a displacement in the\nX-direction at grid point 2 in the first loading condition, Although the\ndifference for displacements in the direction of the load is small, it is\nfelt that the existence of a situation where different answers can be\nobtained with the same finite element model by merely changing the grid\npoint numbering sequence for individual elements should be avoided.\n\n330\n\nREFERENCES\n1 MacNeal, Richard H., editor: The NASTRAN Theoretical Manual, NASA SP-221,\n.\nSept. 1970.\n2 Bergmann, H, W,; Robinson, J.

In particular, the convenience o f the output for use in original design work is critically\nappraised and compared with the output from Astral. * It is shown that considerable hand calculation\nis necessary in order to extract useful load distribution data from the available Nastran output. For\nthis reason, some effort has been directed towards providing additional force output for the Nastran\nshear panel element.\n\nIntroduction\nThe output from any finite element structural analysis program must be in a form which is\nimmediately useful to the stress or design engineer. The most sophisticated program is not being used\nefficiently if lengthy hand calculations are necessary before useful loads data can be extracted from\nthe computer output. It is for this reason that Astral has been refined in a design environment over\nseveral years to provide a \xe2\x80\x9cForce\xe2\x80\x9d type output. This is the output that Grumman Engineers have\nfound preferable to a stress output in most design situations where the structural model only\napproximates to the real structure. The output from Nastran is definitely not in a convenient form and\nthis paper describes some of its shortcomings and the modifications made to the program in order to\nprovide a force type output for the shear panel element. Similar modifications should also be made to\nthe membrane and plate elements.\n\nSYMBOLS\nb\nd\n\nF\nn\nNx\nP\n\n4\nr\nf\xe2\x80\x99\n\nx, Y\n\nShear panel width\nShear panel depth\nShear panel corner forces\nNumber of loading conditions\nWing chordwise load distribution\nShear panel diagonal forces\nShear flow\nNumber of members in idealization\nShear panel thickness\nLocal coordinates\n\nin.\nin.\n\n#\n#/in.\n\n#\n#/in.\nin.\nin.\n\nAngles defining geometry of shear panel (See Figure 13)\n02\n\nNASTRAN OUTPUT: COMPARISON WITH ASTRAL\nIn this section of the paper, Nastran Output is compared with Astral \xe2\x80\x9cM Print\xe2\x80\x9d for output format\nand form.\n*\n\nAutomated Structural Analysis Program developed by Grumman\n\n337\n\nOutput Format. Nastran output is grouped by loading conditions whereas Astral groups output by\nmember or grid point number. Grouping by loading condition is far less convenient when many\nloading conditions may be present as is often the case in a fuselage analysis. Also, grouping by member\nnumber enables a maximum minimum search to be made by the program with a minimum of\nadditional programming. This maximum minimum output for loads and deflections is an indispensable\nfeature o f Astral \xe2\x80\x9cM Print\xe2\x80\x9d output.\nAs an example o f the different grouping strategies, consider a hypothetical structure with r\nmembers and n loading conditions. Figure I compares the output formats for this structure.\nOutput Form. Figure 2 indicates the mdin differences in output between Nastran and Astral for some\nof the most commonly used finite elements. In general, Nastran provides average stresses and scant\nloads data, whilst Astral provides a comprehensive force output on a \xe2\x80\x9cnode force\xe2\x80\x9d basis. Nastran also\nprovides a Margin of Safety output for some elements if an allowable stress is specified by the user.\nThis margin is based upon average stresses in idealized members and assumes a uniaxial stress field. As\nsuch it is a \xe2\x80\x9cmisleading\xe2\x80\x9d output and should be disregarded in all but the most elementary truss type\nstructure. Of more use, would be a stress ratio of the form:\n\nStress Ratio =\n\nStress\nAllowable Stress\n\nAny stress output should be treated with caution, especially in final design work, since stresses\noutput by Nastran are only correct if the idealized structure is identical to the real structure - rarely\nthe case. In most cases, the Structural Analyst prefers to work with load distributions.\nAxial Force Output. Nastran outputs average forces in rod elements, diagonal forces in shear panels\nand no forces for the membrane element. Hence, the element node forces can not be calculated when\nusing membranes, but can be calculated from rod and shear panel output at the expense of tedious\nhand calculations. The following procedure shows how node forces arc obtained from rectangular\nshear panels and rods. Note that for the more general case of non rectangular panels, the required\ncalculations are more tedious and an approximate graphical approach would be used in most cases.\nAssume a situation were a rod is bounded by two rectangular shear panels as shown in F$ure 3:\nNastran Output:\n\nPanel I Diagonal forces PI and P2\nRod Average Force P3\nPanel 2 Diagonal Forces Pd and Ps\n\n338\n\nNode Forces at Rod Ends FI and F2\n\nRequired:\n\nShear Flows Adjacent to Rod q 7 and q2\nResolving diagonal forces along panel edges, adding and dividing by length o f rod:\n\nP4\n= - P5) #/IN\n4,\n+\n\n92\n\nb2 + d22\n\nSumming corner forces and rod average force at each end of rod:\n\np2\n\np4\n\nF 2 = p 3 - 4 7 - 7 + w\nThese equations would be modified appropriately if more than two shear panels were adjacent to\nthe rod. Typically, for a wing rib and beam intersection, four panels would be involved.\n\nH3-T Orbiter Wing Analysis\nThis analysis has been chosen to illustrate how loads are extracted from both Nastran and Astral\nfor use in design work.\nBriefly, the idealization consists of quadrilateral and triangular membranes for the upper and\nlower covers, and rods and shear panels for the ribs, beams (spars) and vertical studs (posts). A drawing\naf the idealization is shown in Figure 4.\nMain features of the idealization are as follows:\n130\n80\n\n14\n707\n\n71\n364\n\nGrid Points\nQuadrilateral Membranes\nTriangular Membranes\nShear Panels\nRods\nDegrees of Freedom\n\n339\n\nThe Nastran Bulk Data Deck used for the analysis was generated automatically from the Astral\nInput Deck using an in house conversion program. Only the Control Decks were produced by hand. A\ncomparison o f computer running times for the two analyses is shown in Figure 5.\nLoad distributions useful t o the Structural Analyst and Designer are shown at sample wing\nsections, and the method o f deriving them from the raw program output is detailed, The general\nagreement between the two analyses, as indicated by overall wing flexibility, is good as expected, since\nboth use the stiffness method of finite element analysis and both have approximately equivalent\nelements. The difference in wing tip deflection for one typical loading condition amounted to less\nthan .02M\n\nWing Cover Axial Loads\nCover axial loads are most often presented at Grumman as a series of chordwise running load\ndistributions(#/in.) along each rib line. As an example, the distribution for the upper cover at rib I is\nO\ndetermined in Figures 6 and 7 and shown plotted in Figure 8. The Astral node or cap loads are divided\nby the effective panel width. The Nastran average stresses in panels on the inboard and outboard sides\nof the rib must be converted to running load and then averaged.\nNote that both analyses require a finer grid in the area adjacent to the rear beam due to the\ndiscontinuity at grid points 91 and 92. Additional stringers between the beams which carry through to\nthe airplane center line are also needed, in order to predict the shear lag effect caused by the cover\ndiscontinuity across rib 7 7.\n\nRib and Beam Shear Flows\nAll shear flows are output directly by Astral \xe2\x80\x9cM Print\xe2\x80\x9d. Nastran output consists of maximum and\naverage shear stresses which may be converted to shear flows by multiplying by the panel thickness. If,\nhowever, all four shear flows are required, then the procedure outlined previously for rectangular\npanels or the procedure below for extracting stud loads must be used. Figure 9 shows the extraction of\nmaximum shear flows only, for rib 70.\n\nStud Cap Forces\n\nStud forces or cap forces are the most difficult to extract frcm Nastran output. In this example\nthe cap forces for stud 85 at the intersection of rib 70 and beam 5 will be determined. None o f the\nadjacent four shear panels are rectangular; therefore, the simplified equations o f the Appendix\nmay not be used. Instead, an approximate graphical approach is taken. First the four shear panels\nare drawn t o scale on Figure 7 0 with the diagonal forces and rod average forces as shown. Next, the\ncomponents of the diagonal forces acting alona the stud are scaled and added:\n\nAt the upper cover: Force = 3055 + 16292 x\n\n1.67\n--\n\n1 43\n2514 x -+\n2.49\n3.17\n\n4393 x\n\n1.39\n-1.87\n\n10911 x\n\n1.78\n2.06\n\n= 6660 #\nAt the lower cover: Force = 3055 + 2626 x\n\n1.71\n-3.30\n\n1.45\n15416 X-+\n2.35\n\n12199 X--\n\n1.55\n1.67\n3960~1.84\n2.09\n\n= 1990#\nThese stud forces are not in good agreement with the corresponding forces output directly by\nAstral which are 76/0# at the upper cover and 710# at the lower cover. This is probably due partly to\nthe graphical approach used, and partly to the relative insensitivity o f wing flexibility and deflection\nto stud loading. A Nastran wing solution with rigid studs, imposed by multipoint constraints, showed\nonly a 4.6% reduction in wing deflections.\n\nProgram Modifications to Improve the Shear Panel Output\nThis section of the paper describes in detail the changes made in Nastran Module SDR2 as a first\nstep in providing an improved \xe2\x80\x9cforce\xe2\x80\x9d type output. Perhaps the most inconvenient aspect of the\npresent output is the use o f shear panel diagonal forces, and it was decided to improve this output as\nquickly as possible. This has been accomplished by modifying the appropriate routines and\nsubroutines in Module SDR2 and outputting the additional data directly from this module, without\nrecourse to User Modules or changes in the Output File Processor, The additional output includes\ncorner forces (#), shear flows(#Jin), panel edge lengths and internal node numbers. This output in no\nway affects the regular Nastran printout which follows it. (See Appendix. )\nI n order to make these changes, the necessary equations were derived for resolving diagonal\nforces into corner forces and combining corner forces into shear flows. Next, a working knowledge of\nhow Nastran interfaces \xe2\x80\x9chorizontally\xe2\x80\x9d between routines and \xe2\x80\x9cvertically\xe2\x80\x9d between modules was\nobtained, mostly on a trial and error basis, since this information is not specifically given in the\nProgrammers Manual, The layout chart for Module SDR2 shown in Figure 11 was then drawn and\nproved invaluable when modifying routines and deciding on the best data paths between routines. A t\nfirst it was hoped to accomplish all data transfer by means of common blocks; however, it was soon\nrealized that due to the looping that takes place within the module this was not possible. Instead, use\nwas made of the data file ESTA when necessary. The necessary changes to module SDR2 are described\nin some detail below and summarized in Figure 12. (See Appendix.)\nThe basic problem consists o f bringing together the diagonal forces and local mean plane\ncoordinates, performing the necessary calculations and printing the results. The diagonal forces are\ncalculated in subroutine SPA NL2 and the local coordinates in subroutine SPA NL 7. A convenient place\nto calculate the forces and shear flows and print them is in routine SDR2E. The following list of\nmodifications to the routines have been made.\n\nThe local coordinates of the four corners of each panel are loaded into common block SDR2X5\nas SPOUT (8) in subroutine SPANLl for transfer to SDR2B. These coordinates are X and Y\nvalues for corners 1 to 4 (Figure 13).\nI n routine SDR2B, the local coordinates from common block SDR2X5 are transferred to Data\nFile ESTA for the \xe2\x80\x9cvertical\xe2\x80\x9d transfer to SDR2E (Figure 11). ESTA assembles a block o f data for\neach shear panel element processed, whereas the common blocks are rewritten for each pass\nthrough a loop.\nThe block data subroutine SDR2BD must be updated to redimension the enlarged ESTA file. The\nblock size is increased from 25 to 33 words to include the coordinates.\nThe shear panel diagonal forces P13 and P24 are loaded into common block SDR2Xl in SPANL2\nand transferred to SDR2E where they are available as BUFB(2) and BUFB(3) respectively. This\ndoes not require any additional coding.\nData file ESTA is moved into common as ELESTA in routine SDR2E and element numbers and\ninternal grid point numbers are already available as BUFB(I) and EL ESTA (2-5) respectively.\nHence, all the necessary data is assembled in SDR2E.\nLocal Coordinates\nNode Number\nDiagonal Forces\nMember Number\nSubcase Number\n\nEL ES TA (25-32)\nEL ESTA (2-5)\nBUFB (2-3)\nBUFB (I)\n(ICC -t I)\n\nz\n\nIn routine SDR2E the corner forces, shear flows and panel edge lengths are calculated.\nThe calculated data is output with appropriate headings.\nAppendix A summarizes the equations used, shows a listing of the major SDR2E module coding\nchanges and provides an example of the additional program output.\nRecommended Changes in Nastran Output\n\nThe following changes in the form and format of Nastran Output wouldgreatly ease the task of\nthe Structural Analyst in design work. They would reduce the amount o f hand calculation necessary,\neliminate the likelihood of not designing to the most critical loading condition and increase the\naccuracy of most load distributions,\nOutput Format\n\ne\ne\n0\n\n342\n\nThe output should be grouped by member or grid point number, not by loading condition.\nThe maximum and minimum loads for each member should be output if more than two loading\nconditions are present.\nLoads should be output in decimal form, not in exponential form, when o f a suitable size. For\nexample, a load o f 5650# should be output as 5650.0 or 5650, not as 5.650000E 03 which is far\nmore difficult to read correctly.\n\nOutput Form\ne\ne\n\ne\n0\n0\n0\n\nThe shear panel should have a shear flow (#/in.) output for all four sides, and the resolved corner\nforces should be used in a \xe2\x80\x9cForce \xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 type output including \xe2\x80\x9ckick\xe2\x80\x9d loads due to warping.\nRod and bar elements should have cap or grid point forces output, not average forces. These are\ndetermined using the above panel corner forces.\nThe membrane element should have a \xe2\x80\x9cforce\xe2\x80\x9d type output consisting o f shear flows (#/in.) along\nall four sides and cap forces along imaginary rod elements.\nThe Margin of Safety output should be deleted.\nThe length of all sides o f all panels should be output, together with their direction cosines in the\nglobal coordinate system.\nA check on the free body equilibrium o f the structure is essential output for any finite element\nanalysis. This should be a summation o f all forces and moments about the origin.\n\nRecommended Additions to Documentation\ne\n0\n\nInclusion o f Module Layouts in the Programmers Manual (see Figure 11).\nInclusion of full instructions for implementation of user modules in the programmers manual.\n\nConcluding Remarks\nThe output from these two finite element analyses, Nastran and Comap Astral, differ in concept.\nNastran in general outputs average stresses in elements and some forces which are not in an\nimmediately usable form. Comap Astral pro vides no stress output (unless specifically requested) but\ngives a comprehensive force type output. Generally in all but the most elementary of structures, the\nforce type output is preferred by structural analysts at Grumman. The Nastran Shear panel output is\nparticularly difficult to use and the necessary modifications to the program to quickly provide a more\nsuitable output have been described. A t this time work is under way to provide a better output form\nand format for all the commonly used Nastran Elements.\n\nReference\nA FFDL-TR-70-118 An Automated Procedure for the Optimization of Pratical Aerospace Structures.\nSection 4.3 \xe2\x80\x9cNodal Stress Method.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n343\n\nAPPENDIX\nSummary of Equations:\nTrigonometric Functions:\n\ny4\ncos\n\n=\ny3\n\ncos q2 =\n\ncos G2 =\n\ncos e2 =\n\ny4\n4 x 2 - X4l2 + Y42\n(Y3 - Y4)\n\n(x3 - x4)\n\nsin O 2 =\n\n4 x 3 - X4l2 + (Y3 - Y4I2\n\n4 x 3 - X4l2 + (Y3 - Y4)2\n\nsin q2 cos q1 - cos q2 sin q1\n\nF12=p13.\n\ncos\n\n- cos G2 sin $1\n\nsin $2 cos\n\nF21 = \'24\nsin q2 cos\n\nF32= \'13\n\n+ cos q2 sin\n\n. sin e2 cos\n\n+ cos e2 sin\n\nsin\n\n91 =\n\nF21 - F12 - F21 - F12\nR12\nx2\n\nF31 = \'13\n\n44 =\n\nF41 - F32\nF41 F32 R34\n4 Y 3 - Y4I2 + (x3 - X4l2\nF42-Fll-\n\n-\n\n41\n\n344\n\nF42-Fll\n4Y42 + x42\n\n-\n\n91\n\nCOS q2 COS O2\n\ncos\n\nsin q2\n\n+ cos o2 sin\n\nsin q1 cos $2 + cos ql sin $2\n\nF41 = \'24. sin e2 cos ql - cos o2 sin q1\n\n#/IN\n\n#/IN\n\n43 =\n\nCOS\n\nsin O2\n\nG2 cos O2 + cos 92 sin O2\n\nF42= \'24. sin e2 cos q1 - cos e2 sin q1\n\n*\n\n#/IN\n\n#/IN\n\nAPPENDIX\nS H E A R\n\n+HEbR\nPANEL\nNUk)SFR\n\n40\n\nP A W E L\n\nI\n\nCnRNeR\n\nNOCE\n\nNfJ.\n\n11\n\nli\n\nFORCF\nFOPCE\n\nFnRCE\n\n1\n2P4.522\n\n27\n?\nI\n-\xe2\x82\xacl.ECS\n- 2 C 4 . 523\n\n7\n\n41\n\n204.5?.<\n\ntf:\n\n81.9\n\n-El.\n\n-42.7=F\n\n-3iaES1\n\n4\xe2\x80\x983\n-42174P\n-32.

This\nmapping, called a patch, is approximated locally by interpolation functions.\nThese functions must be input to NASTRAN i n o r d e r to generate element\nm a t r i c e s {stiffness, etc. ).\n\nIt is, of course, feasible to input the patch for\n\neach element directly as p a r t of the property data for the element.\n\nThis has\n\nthe obvious disadvantage of requiring a g r e a t deal of input data; up to 48 items\nfor a bicubic patch.\n\nTo reduce input data requirements, the MDAC p a r a -\n\nm e t r i c plate element p r o g r a m u s e s the boundary curve for the entire plate to\ngenerate patches for each d i s c r e t e element once a topological m e s h has been\nspecified (Reference 1). The present paper considers new geometric input\ndata for NASTRAN to facilitate the introduction of p a r a m e t r i c d i s c r e t e elements.\n\nADMISSIBLE DISPLACEMENT FIELDS\nAdmissibility conditions for d i s c r e t e element displacement functions a r e\nan especially important topic for higher-order d i s c r e t e elements.\n\nIn c l a s s -\n\nical variational mechanics the m a t e r i a l properties a r e usually assumed either\nconstant or continuously differentiable functions of the spatial coordinates.\nThis leads to simple smoothness requirements bTsed on the order of the differential operator in the equilibrium equations (Reference 2).\n\nThe displace-\n\nment u3 in a homogeneous plate bending problem, for example, must be C4\nin the interior and C 3 on a f r e e edge.\n\nThe latter condition is a consequence\n\nof the natural boundary condition for shear.\n\nThese are of course conditions\n\non the continuum displacement solution that the d i s c r e t e element model must\nconverge to in the limit.\n\nConvergence is measured by a n energy n o r m and\n\nit is the existence of this n o r m that s e t s the admissibility conditions for the\npiecewise polynominal displacement function formed by assembling individual\nd i s c r e t e elements.\n\nReturning to the plate example, the energy n o r m is\n\nderived f r o m the s t r a i n energy density which involves at most second derivatives of u3.\n\nAs long as the d i s c r e t e element displacement field is at least\n\nC 1 between elements the energy n o r m is well defined.\n\nPhysically this con-\n\ndition corresponds t o the absence of a hinge between plate elements and it is\nimposed at the grid points to a s s e m b l e o r build a d i s c r e t e element model of\na plate structure.\n\nHow closely the assumed displacement functions approach\n\n363\n\nthis condition between nodes is a problem in approximation theory that is\nintimately related to the question of completeness.\n\nThis is another i s s u e\n\nentirely and for the present discussion completeness will be assumed. Again\nreturning to the plate example if t h e r e a r e no line moments between elements\nand the m a t e r i a l i s continuous, then the s t r a i n s a r e continuous,\n\nAdditional\n\nconstraints can then be used to impose inter-element s t r a i n continuity but\nthese conditions a r e not required for admissibility.\n\nThe solutions obtained\n\nwith and without these additional constraints will often have the s a m e mean\ne r r o r (Reference 3 ) but the solution with s t r a i n continuity will r e q u i r e solving\nfewer equations.\n\nWhen dealing with higher-order elements the constrained\n\nstiffness m a t r i x may be l e s s than one-half the dimension of the original.\nWhen higher-order d i s c r e t e elements with distinctly different straindisplacement equations must be assembled, a clear understanding of the\nadmissibility conditions i s essential.\n\nPerhaps the best way to describe the\n\npossible pitfalls i s with an illustrative example.\n\nConsider adjacent flat plate\n\nand cylindrical panel elements f r o m the d i s c r e t e element model of the pearshaped cylinder shown in Figure l.\n\nUsing the Bogner, Fox, Schmit (BFS)\n\nplate and cylindrical panel elements (Reference 4), there a r e 12 degrees of\nfreedom per grid point per element, the t h r e e displacement components\nrelative to a local curvilinear coordinate f r a m e u",\n\nu3 and the nine gradients\n\nof these displacement components ua, 1, u*, 2, ua, 12, u3, 1, u3, 2, u3, 12.\nT h e r e i s a tendency to erroneously a s s u m e the plate displacement gradient\ncomponents a r e equal the panel displacement gradient components at a common node, in particular (u2, 2)Fp = (u2, 2)cp. A substantial e r r o r in the\n.normal displacement component u3 i s caused by this assumption a s shown in\nFigure 2 for the pear-shaped cylinder under a uniform axial load.\n\nThe\n\nadmissibility conditions m e r e l y r e q u i r e ( u * ) = ( u a ) c p and ( u ~ , ~ ) F P\n~ ~\n= (u3, a)cp where the curvilinear coordinates have been parameterized such\n\nthat d a = dS in each element.\n\nThis allows discontinuities in u2, 2 which of\n\nc o u r s e must exist i f we a r e to have continuous midsurface strains,\n\np2)Fp\n\n3\n= (Y2*2)cp+TC\nU\n\n364\n\nIt should be noted that it i s\n\nnot\n\nn e c e s s a r y t o use Equation (1) a s a constraint.\n\nThe minimum potential energy t h e o r e m e n s u r e s that the Ritz procedure for\n2\n2\nadmissible. displacement fields will find (u , 2)FP and (u , 2)cp such that\nequilibrium is satisfied in the limit.\n\nIn this problem equilibrium implies\n\ns t r a i n continuity and Equation (1) can be used a s in Reference 5 as a n additional\nconstraint which reduces the number of equations t o be solved.\n\nIf we modify\n\nthe pear-shaped cylinder such that the flat panel m a t e r i a l is different f r o m the\ncylindrical panel m a t e r i a l then Equation (1) cannot be used since equilibrium\nnow r e q u i r e s a s t r a i n discontinuity.\nThere a r e a t l e a s t two other situations in the assembly of higher-order\nd i s c r e t e elements that deserve attention.\n\nConsider the stiffened cylindrical\n\npanel shown in Figure 3 again modeled using the BFS d i s c r e t e elements.\n\nIn\n\nt h i s case, even though adjacent cylindrical panel elements have the s a m e s t r a i n\ndisplacement equations and a r e made of the s a m e material, t h e r e can be discontinuities in u1\n\n\' 2\n\ncylindrical panel.\n\ncaused by load t r a n s f e r between the stiffener and the\nConsider next an e r r o r that can occur when constraining\n\nthe t h r e e rotations to be equal between adjacent higher-order plate elements.\nLet x 1 = constant be the common edge between two BFS plate elements and\nr e c a l l that the e l a s t i c rotations a r e one-half the c u r l of the displacement. vector:\nUsing a Cartesian coordinate system, the rotations a r e\n\ne3 =\n\n1 (. 2\n\'1\n2\n\nUl,\n\n2)\n\nT o e n s u r e the same displacement along the common edge r e q u i r e s ucy\nand u3\n\nt o be continuous.\n\n\'2\nthis will imply u 2\n\n\'2\nIf, in additioh, we now require \xe2\x82\xac13 t o be continuous\n\ni s continuous.

those directly involved in admissibility\nconditions,\n\nUA, and all others, UH.\n\nAll grid point degrees of freedom (in\n\nelement coordinates) f o r a l l general elements now in NASTRAN fall in the\nf i r s t category.\n\nThe new grid point d e g r e e s of freedom, UH, a r e somewhat\n\nlike s c a l a r point variables except they are elastically coupled t o a l l the other\ngrid point degrees of freedom for an element.\n\nAs a default value, the number\n\nof UH a t a grid point is equal the s u m of the UH associated with that grid point\nf r o m each element connected t o that grid point.\nbased simply on admissibility.\n\nThis corresponds t o assembly\n\nNext, it is n e c e s s a r y to provide for grid point\n\nconstraints that a r e linear equations, usually identities, among the UH and UA\na t a grid point.\n\nThis is analogous to multipoint constraint equations with a l l\n\nthe degrees of freedom occurring at the s a m e grid point.\n\nAs a practical m a t t e r\n\na unique identification scheme f o r the UH will be needed.\n\nThe UA of course\n\na l r e a d y a r e identified uniquely by component numbers 1 t o 6.\n\nAlso, a s a\n\npractical matter, a n automated grid point constraint generator is needed;

Jordan, Jr., and William G . Ward\nCompute\xe2\x80\x99r Sciences Corporation\n\nSUMMARY\nModifications made to NASTRAN at Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville,\nAlabama, can be grouped into two general classes:\n1.\n\nThose modifications to NASTRAN code which result from the\nlocation, identification, and correction of errors or operational\nproblem areas.\n\n2.\n\nAddition of new capability which is structural, executive system\noriented, or utility in nature.\n\nIn addition to these modifications to NASTRAN, several important studies have\nbeen conducted at MSFC relative to NASTRAN efficiencies and inefficiencies.\nINTRODUCTION\nA brief description on some of the major modifications to NASTRAN will be\ndiscussed. These are modifications which have been made to various levels of\nNASTRAN and which are currently incorporated into MSFC\xe2\x80\x99s version of Level 12.\nBecause of the significance of two studies conducted relative to NASTRAN efficiencies\nand inefficiencies, more time will be allotted to discussion of these studies and their\n\nresults.\nModifications and Additions\n(1)\n\nA post-processor was written to stack SC-4020 plot commands generated by\nNASTRAN onto drum, preceded by the MSFC standard identification frame and\nfollowed by the MSFC standard end job frame. This was written in the form\nof a utility subroutine, but performs as a post-processor in that it is executed\nafter all other NASTRAN activities have been completed. This modification\n\n375\n\nwas made at the request of MSFC Computation Laboratory management in order\nto solve SC-4020 tape labeling problems on NASTRAN runs coming in from remote terminals.\nThe method of obtaining accumulated CPU time for triangular decomposition\n"time-to-go" checks and other time checks in NASTRAN was changed due to\na change in the 1108 Executive System\'s PCT (Program Control Table).\nAccumulated C P U time is now found by interrogating a locally maintained\nsystem routine since the format of the PCT appears to be highly evolutionary.\nAdditions and modifications to the NASTRAN Executive System were made to\nallow the capability of inputting NASTRAN Executive, Case Control, and Bulk\nData decks from magnetic tape instead of cards. The user may also require\nthe flexibility of inputting the Executive and Case Control decks from cards\nand the Bulk Data decks from a non-UMF formatted tape. This case often\noccurs when a user has generated a large amount of bulk data in a small\nFORTRAN data conversion program and the number of punched cards is prohibitively large, Both of these options were made available.\n\nA NASTRAN DMAP functional module, OUTPUT 2 , was developed to write on\nmagnetic tape the non-zero terms of the lower triangular portion of a\nNASTRAN symmetric matrix. Options have been recently included in this\nmodule which allow for writing on tape or punching on cards non-zero terms\no f a general matrix in a user specified FORTRAN format.\nA NASTRAN DMAP functional module was developed to punch out NASTRAN\nmatrices in the NASTRAN Bulk Data DMI card format. A module similar to\nthis will be delivered in Level 15 by NSMO. However, the module developed\nhere will punch out single and double precision values instead of just single\nprecision values and will also punch complex matrices, such as complex\neigenvectors\nModifications to appropriate subroutines in NASTRAN\'s Executive System have\nbeen made which will generate a forced checkpoint if the run time on the run\ncard is greater than or equal to 30 minutes. The modified code will detect the\nrun time, assign a checkpoint tape, generate the card image "CHKPNT YES"\nin the Executive Control deck and allow for the punching of the restart dictionary. This modification was developed at the request of the MSFC\nNASTRAN Technical Monitor who felt some users were not using the checkpoint feature at all and, as a result, were needlessly using CPU time in subsequent runs. This inhibits all users from getting machine time. With the\nautomatic checkpoint feature, it is not necessary for the user to include the\nT H K P N T YES" option in his run. A close kin to this capability is the\ndevelopment of the NASTRAN Executive System capability of forcing "undeformed structural plots" for NASTRAN runs which qppear to be large (greater\n\n376\n\nthan 30 minutes). Again, it was felt that too many users were creating large\nmodels and making many long runs without ever checking their model by looking at the wideformed plots. This capability is now being developed.\n\nA modification was made to the real eigenvalue module to print out the eigenvalue iteration information as computed and to force exit from the algorithm\nas soon as the first root is obtained. This capability is often desirable in\nbuckling problems where only the first mode is desired and run times are long.\nSeveral functional modules have been developed and incorporated into MSFC I\ns\nNASTRAN version which allow for a complex eigenvalue solution for a spinning\nflexible body such as NASA\'s SKYLAB. The user DMAP sequence for this\ncapability is available, and a detailed user paper is being presented in this\ncolloquium by Dr. Jayant S. Pate1 of Teledyne-Brown Engineering.\nTwo DMAP functional modules have been developed which will allow for the\ncapability of substructuring in NASTRAN as defined by a segment of the\nMSFC structural analysis NASTRAN user community. Basically, one module\nunpacks and writes NASTRAN matrices on a magnetic tape; the other reads\nmatrices from magnetic tape, packs them in NASTRAN matrix format and\ngenerates corresponding NASTRAN output data blocks. These data blocks\n(matrices) a r e then utilized in a DMAP sequence o r rigid format to accomplish the substructuring task. This approach can be used to model a structure\nwith up to eight substructures.\nStudies on NASTRAN Efficiencies and Inefficiencies\nTwo significant studies will be presented relative to NASTRAN efficiencies\nand inefficiencies :\n1.\n\nNASTRAN CPU Time Versus Available Core for Triangular\nDe c ompos it ion.\n\n2.\n\nInvestigation of NTRAN 1/0 Usage in NASTRAN.\n\nThe first study was initiated in order to discover some quantitative relationship between "core" solutions and "spill logic" solutions for NASTRAN problems\nrequiring triangular decomposition on MSFC\'s UNIVAC 1108 EXEC VIII, For\nlarge NASTRAN problems, a substantial amount of the total computing time is\nassociated with triangular decompos ition, NASTRAN performs this decomposition\ntask utilizing all available core. It dynamically allocates its large arrays at execute\ntime by employing an "open core" concept. The use of fixed dimensions for large\narrays is avoided since this automatically restricts the size of the problems that\ncan be solved. Instead, FORTRAN routines are programmed to allocate space as\nrequired and to use all of core available to user programs. When all of core has\n\n377\n\nbeen allocated, NASTRAN then uses "spill logic" to transfer data to scratch files\nand back to core again. NASTRAN calculates the amount of available core ("open\ncore") for allocation purposes by determining the number of words available between the origin of "open core" and the end of core.\n\nTo demonstrate the relationship between CPU time and available core for\ntriangular decomposition, it was decided to develop a problem which would yield\nan !\'all core" decomposition for 65K on the UNIVAC 1108 and then decrease the\namount of available core to NASTRAN in subsequent runs. This decrease in the\namount of available core would cause the "all coreT1\nsolution to become a "spill logic"\nsolution. Comparisons of CPU run times would give some insight into the excessive\nrun times being experienced at this center for decomposition problems.\nUsing Version 12 of NASTRAN, the amount of "open core" can be reduced with\nrelative ease. By choosing appropriate options on the UNIVAC 1108 Executive Control XQT card, a user can limit the amount of core available for his own NASTRAN\nproblem, Four runs were submitted for various size models with available core\nfigures of:\n65K\n55K\n50K\n4 42K\n,\n1\n.\n2\n.\n3\n.\n\nThe structural problem developed to use as a test case for this study was a\nrectangular panel made up o quadrilateral plate elements with a bandwidth of 169\nf\nand 480 degrees of freedom. A buckling analysis was performed on the panel, and\nonly one eigenvalue was obtained. The CPU run times for the four test runs were\nevaluated by three different methods:\n1.\n\nTotal CPU run time versus available core.\n\n2\n,\n\nCPU time spent in the NASTRAN functional module, READ,\nversus available core. This module performs the matrix\ndecomposition and eigenvalue solution.\n\n3.\n\nCPU time spent only in the decomposition portion of READ\nversus available core. It is this portion of the READ module\nwhich contains the "spill logicf1.\n\nThese run times are given in Attachment A, and the results are plotted in\nFigures 1, 2, and 3 to graphically illustrate the increase in C P U time in all program areas as the amount of available core is steadily decreased. Since the aim\nof this study was to determine the increase in CPU time due to the use of %pill\nlogicI1in triangular decomposition, it is important to note that the CPU time for\n\n378\n\nthe entire program increased 2.4 times (240%) when core was decreased by 1/3\n(33 1/3%), The total decomposition CPU time increased 6.5 times (650%) due to\nthe same decrease in available core. It is also important to notice that the increase\nin CPU time in the three areas mentioned is n\nm i.e. , the ratio of the change\nin CPU time to the change in available core is not constant.\nInvestigation of NTRAN I/O Usage in NASTRAN\nThe second study was initiated in order to determine if NASTRAN\'s NTRAN\nI/O package was hurting NASTRAN performance at MSFC since it was known that\nthe NTRAN 1/0 was excessively inefficient. A series of test runs was made in which\n249 word records (FORTRAN buffer size) were written from core to drum by MSFC\'s\nNTRAN, NASTRAM\'s NTRAN, and FORTRAN binary 1/0 operations. I addition,\nn\ntwo approaches to using NTRAN were tested and were designated NTRAN 1and\nNTRAN 2 as follows:\nNTRAN 1\n\n-\n\nNTRAN 2\n\n-\n\nA method of NTRAN usage in which a wait in NTRAN occurs\nuntil all previous operations, for the specified logical unit,\nare complete before stacking any further operations or returning to the user\'s program. T i approach is the method\nhs\nemployed by NASTRAN.\nA method of NTRAN usage in which the transmission status\nword is tested in a FORTRAN loop until an error occurs or\nthe transmission is successfully completed.\n\nThe results from one such series of tests follow. In these tests, each 1/0\nmethod was allowed to write as many records as possible (up to 4000) in two\nminutes (CPTJ).\n249 WORD RECORDS (MSFC NTRAN)\n\nMETHOD\n\nDEVICE\n\nRECORDS TRANSMITTED\n\nCPU TIME\n\nNTRAN 1\n\nDRUM\n\n577\n\n2:oo Min.\n\nNTRAN 2\n\nDRUM\n\n284\n\n2:OO Min.\n\nFORTRAN\n\nDRUM\n\n4000\n\n.\n\n1 :17 (Min Sec )\n\n379\n\n249 WORD RECORDS (NASTRAN NTRAN)\nMETHOD\n\nDEVICE\n\nNTRAN 1\n\nDRUM\n\n4000\n\n25 Sec.\n\nNTRAN 2\n\nDRUM\n\n1523\n\n2 O Min.\n:O\n\nFORTRAN\n\nDRUM\n\n4000\n\n11 (Min,Sec.)\n:1\n\nRECORDS TRANSMITTED CPU TIME\n\nIt was determined that NTRAN 1 o r the wait and unstack approach is vastly\nsuperior to the NTRAN 2 programming approach and substantially better than\nFORTRAN binary I/O, It was also determined that NASTRAN\'s NTRAN is substantially more efficient than MSFC\'s NTRAN and does not inhibit NASTRAN\'s 1/0\nperformance\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nModifications and additions to the local MSFC standard version of NASTRAN\nare only one area of NASTRAN maintenance which occurs at MSFC; however, it is\nprobably the most significant since it hopefully plays a part in keeping NASTRAN\na meaningful, useful, and evolutionary tool for the structural analysts at MSFC\ninstead of the obsolete monster it could become if modification and addition could\nnot be performed on this remarkable system.\n\n380\n\nATTACHMENT A\n\nA.

Smoot Katow\nand B a r r y M. Cooper\nJ e t Propulsion La bo rato r y\nSUMMARY\nF o r effective u s e of NASTRAN, the input bulk data m u s t accurately model\nthe structure to be analyzed and result from a minimum of time and money\nexpended. A method of using a n interactive graphics device to generate a\nlarge portion of the input bulk data with visual checks of the structure and the\nc a r d images i s described. The generation s t a r t s f r o m GRID and PBAR cards.\nThe visual checks result from a three-dimensional display of the model in any\nrotated position. By detailing the steps, the time saving and cost effectiveness\nof this method may be judged, and i t s potential as a useful tool f o r the struct u r a l analyst may be established.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe generation of NASTRAN input bulk data to correctly simulate o r\nmodel a large structure to be analyzed usually consumes many man hours and\nmuch time. Sketches and/or drawings a r e necessary to define the G R I D numb e r s connected by structural elements identified with EID numbers and their\nproperty identification P I D numbers. After the constraints a r e organized, a\nlist f o r keypunching must be prepared. After the c a r d s a r e keypunched and\ninputted to the computer, m o r e time i s required to debug the input data for\ncompliance with the NASTRAN formats before an answer is outputted. Debugging procedures usually employ plotting capabilities available in NASTRAN\nto provide visual checks of the structural model. Normally, further checking\nfollows by noting values in the load vectors generated by gravity loadings, the\ncoordinates of the center of gravity, and symmetry o r equating of the singlepoint constraint values to the input load vectors.\nBesides the schedules time deadlines, the total c o s t of the analysis must\nbe considered, Procedures o r processes that can reduce the time of preparing input data invariably reduce c o s t s . If during these processes the c o r r e c t ness of the model can be raised to a high level before input to a computer, the\nNASTRAN computing c o s t s can be reduced.\nThis paper presents the results of one phase of r e s e a r c h c a r r i e d out a t the\nJ e t Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under\nContract No. NAS 7-100, sponsored by the National Aeronautics and\nSpace Admini st ration.\n\n399\n\nAt JPL, with the installation of the UNIVAC Advanced G r a p h i c s Display\nS y s t e m to the UNIVAC 1108 - EXEC 8 t i m e - s h a r i n g c o m p u t e r used f o r s c i e n tific computing p u r p o s e s , t h e development of the use of i n t e r a c t i v e g r a p h i c s to\ng e n e r a t e and check NASTRAN bulk data h a s proceeded,\nCONFIGURATION DESCRIPTION\nThe UNIVAC Advanced G r a p h i c s Display S y s t e m is composed of two m a j o r\nunits: t h e d i s p l a y c o n t r o l l e r minicomputer (Type 1557) and t h e display console (Type 1558).

E a c h s u b p r o g r a m c a n be u s e d i n a stand-alone m o d e\no r c a n b e subroutinized to o p e r a t e interchangeably.\nThe g r a p h i c s tube f a c e layout h a s been designed f r o m a human e n g i n e e r ing standpoint, with speed and efficiency coordinated at e a c h u s e r / h a r d w a r e\noperation. T h e tube face i s divided and overlayed by windows, e a c h r e p r e senting a s e g m e n t of t h e v i s u a l data s t r u c t u r e . One window contains a "menu\'\'\nwhich i n f o r m s the u s e r of his c u r r e n t s t a t u s i n the p r o g r a m . T h e s e window\nand m e n u concepts c a n be s e e n i n f i g u r e 1.\nIn the left window, the g r i d point identification n u m b e r s f r o m the catalog\nf i l e a r e l i s t e d i n columns. Above it a r e l i s t e d the PID n u m b e r s of the PBARs.\nTo t h e r i g h t s i d e of the g r i d ID, t h e r e is s p a c e f o r displaying the g e n e r a t e d\nCBAR data.\n\n401\n\nThe right window of the tube displays, a s point vectors, the grid point\nlocations initially a s they appear normal to the X Y plane. Then by pressing\neither X, Y, o r Z on the keyboard, the views in XY, XZ, o r Y Z planes,\nrespectively, can be displayed.\nThe light-sensitive pen i s then pointed to the first GA of the desired\nCBAR. The screen responds by displaying a f "local indicator" next to the\nlisted GA a s well as the point vector on the right window. When in succession,\nin\nthe GB, PID, and GO a r e selected via light pen interaction; then a I1Ct1 the\nkeyboard e n t e r s the CBAR, which i s shown by an entry in the CBAR connection list data in the left window and a directional vector between the point\nvectors of the GA and GB. The formats described a r e shown by a photograph\nof the s c r e e n after some CBARs have been developed (fig. 1).\nAt any time during this development of the structural model the rotation\nsubprogram may be called and the model can be visually checked f r o m any\noblique angle. Figure 2 shows the model of figure 1 viewed by rotations\naround the X and Z axes of 30 degrees each, Figure 3 shows the complete\ndevelopment at a -30 deg angle about the X axis.\nRotation Subprogram\nThis monitor (a 1557 software operating system) performs three-dimensional rotation on the two-dimensional screen, which gives the u s e r complete\ncontrol of visual: structure demographics: rotation about any axis, a t any\nincremental angle, a t any speed. This combination of control leads to "animated" movement in three dimensions f o r visual analysis and to hard copy\ngraphics of the structure.\nIf at this time the c a r d images of a GRID o r CBAR require changes, the\ngrid data may be edited by a call to the data edit subprogram. A typical display i s shown in figure 4. By use of the keyboard, specific changes can be\nmade in the c a r d image inputs.\n\nData Set Edit Subprogram\nThe data s e t edit routine can be utilized a s a stand-alone procedure to\nupdate a n existing NASTRAN data package o r a s a subroutine in a structure\ndevelopment production.\nThe data s e t edit routine presents the "card image" run s t r e a m by paging\ndata and control messages a c r o s s the s c r e e n a t the u s e r \' s discretion. On\neach page, the u s e r has control o r editing options and can direct the program\ndirection. The u s e r can change a c a r d image, delete a c a r d image, and add a\nc a r d image which represents a CBAR o r PBAR, while maintaining all structure credibilities connected to the member unless entirely deleted.\n\n402\n\nThe u s e r can switch the rotation monitor on and visually check his s t r u c t u r e , flag a m e m b e r , and automatically have the program page to the c a r d\nimage representing the member for further analysis and editing.\n\nTo prevent loss of completed connections a page of 25 CBARs is automatically stored in the u s e r \' s FASTRAND file. In turn, the next 2 5 CBARs may\nbe entered. This program has restart capabilities in c a s e of computer failure\no r \'\'current" analysis changes.\nWhen the visual checks of the interactive graphics output signal a good s e t\nof GRID, CBAR and PBAR c a r d s , the final exit can be made by requesting the\n1108 to punch out the edited c a r d s as presently programmed, or, in the 1108,\nit is possible to have data files read into a catqlog file so that a n immediate\nNASTRAN run can be made f r o m the remote terminal used for the 155?/1558\nunit.\nADVANTAGES O F INTERACTIVE GRAPHICS\nThe replacement of the normal listing of CBARs and subsequent keypunching with the u s e of interactive graphics w i l l save time. However, the greatest\nvalues should result f r o m the opportunity to make intermittent three-dimensional visual checks of the structural model. The analyst can insure the\naccuracy of t h e model as well a s provide an opportunity for study t o optimize\nthe geometric arrangement.\nAs the system i s now working, using many satellite ICT routines and selfcontained monitors with the minicomputer, minimum demand time i s required\nof the 1108.

Comparisons among t h e v a r i o u s algorithms f o r r e a l i s t i c l a r g e\ns t r u c t u r e s are rare. Equally rare (at NSRDC, a t l e a s t ) are s t r u c t u r e s\nwhich demonstrate a meaningful "before and a f t e r " comparison.

It w a s analyzed on a program o t h e r than NASTRAN.\nAlthough both manual and automatic renumbering a t t e m p t s w e r e made, t h e\nsmallest bandwidth obtained w a s 202. Subsequent use of t h e Cuthill-McKee\napproach f u r t h e r reduced t h e bandwidth t o 151.\nExamples such as t h i s tend t o g l o s s over t h e important r o l e played by t h e\nmodeler i n achieving a small m a t r i x bandwidth.

However, the cost of operating the l e v e l 12 version presently\nmakes the program d i f f i c u l t to j u s t i f y .\n\ni n undergraduate cowses has been found pedagogically sound.\n\nSEJ3CTION OF A FINITE EI.XMENT PROGRAM\nUndergraduate instruction i n the area of s t r u c t u r a l analysis must\nbegin by placing major emphasis on the fundamentals such as s t r e s s , s t r a i n ,\nMohr\'s c i r c l e , flexure formula, e t c . However, a l l too often the undergraduate\'s progress does not extend far beyond problems i n which a beam\ni s e i t h e r bent, sheared, twisted or buckled under a wide variety of end\nconditions.\n\nIt seems highly desirable that the undergraduate should a l s o be\nexposed to more r e a l i s t i c s t r u c t u r a l problems such as are encountered\ni n practice. These r e a l i s t i c problems generally present two major\nobstacles -- 1) they axe usually too large f o r hand calculations and\n2 ) they often cannot be analyzed using the simple formulas w i t h which\nthe studect i s familiar.\nIt i s , of course, c l e a r t h a t the addition of large s t r u c t u r a l\n-problems i n t o the undergraduate curriculum should not precede a study\nof the fundamentals. However, r e a l i s t i c problems not only give the\nsenior-level student a p r a c t i c a l f e e l f o r the r e s u l t s but a l s o provide\na s i g n i f i c a n t motivation f a c t o r . That i s , students generally f e e l a\ngreater sense of achievement when they successfully solve a s i g n i f i c a n t\nengineering problem.\nWith t h i s purpose i n mind, t h e general f i n i t e element programs\nhave s i g n i f i c a n t p o t e n t i a l as a teaching aid. In the selection of a\n\nf i n i t e element program, the i n s t r u c t o r must consider the following\nc h a r a c t e r i s t i c s of the programs:\n\nit easy to use?\n\n1)\n\nIS\n\n2)\n\nW i l l it handle a s u f f i c i e n t l y broad c l a s s of problems?\n\n3 ) Is it a program the student could be expected to\nencounter a f t e r graduation?\n\n4)\n\nIS\n\nit expensive to use?\n\nWith regard to the first question, it i s important t h a t a minimum\namount of classroom time i s spent "checking out" the student on the\nprogram. Consequently, the program must be user oriented w i t h easy input\nand extensive e r r o r checks. A corollary to t h i s question i s a requirement f o r a program which i s dependable\nnothing dampens student\nenthusiasm l i k e a program which f a i l s to work!\n\n--\n\nThe second question concerns the v e r s a t i l i t y of the program. This\nrequirement a r i s e s f o r s e v e r a l reasons. If the program i s used f o r\nsenior l e v e l design work, the v a r i e t y of problems w i l l almost c e r t a i n l y\nrequire a general program. Furthermore, many students remain f o r graduate\nschool and want to use the program as a research tool. Thus, while it\ni s n o t mandatory, it c e r t a i n l y i s desirable to acquaint the undergraduate\nstudent w i t h a program which can a l s o be used f o r graduate research.\nThe t h i r d question asks not only i s the program presently widely\nused by s t r u c t u r a l engineers, but a l s o i s it one of l a s t i n g quality?\nThis question i s very d i f f i c u l t to answer and tends to be more of an\nopinion than anything e l s e . All too frequently the answer i s biased\nw i t h how well the i n s t r u c t o r can use the program i n comparison to similar\nprograms w i t h which he i s familiar. Fortunately, it i s not imperative\nt h a t the student be l\'trained" on a univeral program, provided the program\nused has the same major c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s of the more commonly used ones.\nThe f i n a l question i s more pragmatic and i s one which cannot be\nignored i n view of the current f i n a n c i a l pressure on i n s t i t u t i o n s of\nhigher learning. The cost of operating t h e program depends s i g n i f i c a n t l y\non the txpe of computer i n s t a l l a t i o n and the method of charging f o r\ncomputer services. It i s important t h a t the i n s t r u c t o r monitor the\ncomputer expenses to ensure they do not g e t out of hand.\nWhile s e v e r a l excellent f i n i t e element programs are available\n(Ref. l , the N S R N program w a s selected f o r the present study f o r\n)\nAT A\nthe following reasons. F i r s t and foremost, the author f e l t N S R N\nAT A\n\n416\n\ns t r u c k a proper balance between easy usage and v e r s a t i l i t y (Ref. 2 ) . It\nw a s a l s o f e l t t h a t t h e government\'s commitment (Ref. 3) t o maintain and\nimprove t h e program w i l l assure an even wider acceptance of NASTRAN i n\nt h e f u t u r e . With regard t o t h e question of c o s t , it i s acknowledged\nt h a t N S R N i s an expensive system t o operate (Ref. 2 ) . However, with\nAT A\nt h e s i g n i f i c a n t time savings a v a i l a b l e between Levels 12 and 15, it\nappears t h e cost of operation can s t i l l be reduced.\n\nPROGRAM UTILIZATION\nThe presentation of computer methods of s t r u c t u r e s primarily\nc o n s i s t s of t h r e e t o p i c s with which t h e student i s unfamiliar:\n1) S t r u c t u r a l theory\n2)\n\nComputer code\n\n3) User experience\nThe i n s t r u c t o r i s faced with the problem of maintaining a proper balance\nbetween t h e t h r e e . If he devotes h i s time exclusively t o presenting\ns t r u c t u r a l theory, he c r e a t e s an "ivory tower" product who may make an\ne x c e l l e n t graduate student but a poor prospect f o r industry. O t h e other\nn\nhand, t o t a l emphasis on user experience produces a "technician" who knows\nhow to use a "black box" b u t who knows very l i t t l e about how t h e %lack\nbox" works.\nA balanced approach has been taken by t h e author i n two separate\ns e n i o r - l e v e l courses -- one i n a i r c r a f t s t r u c t u r e s and another i n machine\ndesign i n mechanical engineering. The two courses. d i f f e r i n t h a t t h e\na i r c r a f t s t r u c t u r e s course has a n assigned problem of a small a i r c r a f t\ncomponent whereas t h e machine design course allows t h e students t o s e l e c t\nindividual p r o j e c t s . Typical p r o j e c t s which have been s e l e c t e d by\nstudents are:\n\n1 Automobile brake drum\n)\n2)\n\nConcrete beam with s p l i c e d r e i n f o r c i n g s t e e l\n\n3 ) Automobile c a r roof\n\n4 ) Railroad tank car\n5 ) Motorcycle helmet\n6) Outboard motor propellear\n\nThe d i v e r s i t y of subjects points out the wide v a r i e t y of i n t e r e s t s and\nbackgrounds among engineering students\n\nIn each course it has been found possible to start w i t h a sequence\nof l e c t u r e s on how t o use MSTRAN f o r s t a t i c analysis. By relying upon\nthe physical concepts of the f i n i t e elements, it has been found t h a t\nthree periods are s u f f i c i e n t to check out students who have had no previous\ns t r u c t u r a l programming experience. This i n i t i a l check out enables t h e\nstudents to spend the remainder of the course working on t h e i r p a r t i c u l a r\ns t r u c t u r a l problem. Following t h e f i r s t three periods, the remaining\nl e c t u r e s are devoted to s t r u c t u r a l theory and computer coding.\nThe t o p i c of computer coding i s covered w i t h a presentation of a\nsimple f i n i t e element program w r i t t e n by the i n s t r u c t o r to i l l u s t r a t e\nthe major s t e p s i n program code development. Explanation of t h i s simple\nprogram i s intended to show the student the a r t of building a program.\nThus, the student i s spared the time consuming labors of writing h i s own\ncomputer code, debugging it, and f i n a l l y t r y i n g to obtain some p r a c t i c a l\nr e s u l t s before the course ends. The f a c t t h a t the student can understand\nhow to use NASTRAN before he has the s t r u c t u r a l theory and coding background s i g n i f i c a n t l y increases the amount of time he cam spend developing\nfirst-hand experience. Thus, i n a sense, he i s able to see the "big\npicture" before becoming entangled i n t h e d e t a i l s\n.Based upon student accomplishments, understanding, and endorsement,\nt h i s p a r t i c u l a r approach has apparently been successful. Its g r e a t e s t\nshortcoming i s t h a t MSTRAN i s expensive to operate. The program was run\non an IBM 3 0 1 5 computer w i t h 2 6 core. The charges f o r t h i s machine\n7/4\n5K\n\nare figured a t $400 per C U hour. The average student i n the aerospace\nP\ns t r u c t u r e s course used approximately one hour of C U time, whereas the\nP\nmachine design students required an average of two C U hours. Thus, the\nP\ncompter costs per student f e l l within the range of $400-$800. For\ncomparison, a similar study on course i n s t r u c t i o n i n b a s i c Fj6RTRAN was\nfound to cost l e s s than $40 per student.\nThe author\'s experience has a l s o shown t h a t use of NASTRAN\'s p l o t t i n g\nfeature dramatically improves student acceptance of the r e s u l t s . The\nimportance of t h e student seeing a scaled model of the s t r u c t u r e , as\nopposed to simply scanning pages of numbers, cannot be over-emphasized.\nAfter gaining a f e e l f o r h i s problem, he i s much more w i l l i n g to study\nthe tabulated r e s u l t s .\nPROPOSED WORK\nA t f i r s t glance, students tend to be overwhelmed by the magnitude\nand bulk of the NASTRAN User\'s Manual.

The displacements, member stresses, and\nfoundation loads due to wind load, live load, and dead load were obtained\nthrough a series of NASTRAN runs. These analyses and the input technique\nare described in this paper.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe demands of a prosperous economy, combined with advancements in\nmaterial technology, have created a high-rise building boom all over the\nworld. In most cases, these buildings have complicated structural configurations for the purpose of accommodating the multiple functions\nrequired. The traditional structural analysis of buildings has been\nlimited to simplified methods, such as plane frame or truss analysis.\nThese methods often lead to erroneous results. To improve solution\naccuracy, manual iteration has been used at the expense of higher computation and labor costs. Occasionally, model testing techniques have been\nemployed. However, the measured results did not necessarily yield better\naccuracy. They are more generally accepted as an indication to insure the\nconservatism of the designer.\nIn the last few years, the finite element method has gained wide\nrecognition in this field. Unfortunately, most of the finite element\nprograms available do not have the capabilities necessary to analyze a\ntheoretically desirable model of a large building. They are either\ninsufficient in capacity, or lacking essential finite elements. The\nemergence of the NASTRAN program has served to alleviate these shortcomings.\nThe Illinois Center Plaza Hotel is located near Lake Michigan in downtown Chicago. It is a 40-story reinforced concrete building which includes\n1,000 guest rooms, several restaurants, parking facilities, and large\nconference rooms and ballrooms. The structural system of the building is\nthe unique slab-column system, in which, the thin floor slabs are poured\nmonolithically with the columns. There are no drop panels or haunches at\nthe slab-column junctions. The savings in construction costs associated\nwith this simplification makes the slab-column system a very competitive\none in comparison to the conventional beam-column-slab system. However,\nmore analytical work is necessary to insure an adequate design of this type\n\n421\n\nof system. The stress concentrations a t t h e junctions, and t h e i n t e r a c t i o n\nbetween t h e s l a b and coiumn become a necessary p a r t of t h e a n a l y s i s .\nThe h o t e l b u i l d i n g i s symmetrical about i t s s h o r t a x i s (X-axis) as\nshown i n Figure 1. Therefore, only one-half of t h e s t r u c t u r e was analyzed.\nThe mathematical model r e p r e s e n t i n g t h i s h a l f b u i l d i n g consisted of 1718\nGRID p o i n t s ; 5000 CBAR elements, with maximum nodal d i f f e r e n c e of 81; and\n3600 concentrated f o r c e s and moments. N S R N w a s chosen f o r t h i s a p p l i AT A\nc a t i o n on t h e b a s i s of s o l u t i o n accuracy, problem c a p a c i t y , and m u l t i p l e\nc o n s t r a i n t and restart c a p a b i l i t i e s . The a n a l y s i s and r e s u l t s are\ndescribed herein.\nSLAB-COLUMN INTERACTION ANALYSIS\nS t r u c t u r a l l y , t h e s l a b s of a h i g h - r i s e b u i l d i n g have two functions.\nThey support t h e live and dead load and t r a n s f e r them t o t h e columns and\nfootings. On t h e o t h e r hand, t h e y a l s o r e s i s t shear f o r c e s due t o wind\npressure on t h e building.\nThe models used i n t h i s a n a l y s i s are shown i n Figures 2 and 3 . The\nmodel i n Figure 2 c o n s i s t s of 777 GRID p o i n t s , 124 C B A R f s , 618 CQUAD~IS,\nand one CTRIA2. CBAR elements w e r e used t o r e p r e s e n t columns, while\nCQUAD2 and CTRIA2 elements w e r e used t o represent f l o o r s l a b and shear\nw a l l s . Because t h e point of i n f l e c t i o n of a column i s approximately\nmidway between two f l o o r s l a b s , t h e length of t h e columns were taken t o\nbe half of t h e f l o o r height. The model shown i n Figure 3 i s s i m i l a r t o\nt h e f . i r s t one, with 152 GRID p o i n t s and 234 CBARls. The columns are t h e\nsame as i n t h e f i r s t model, whereas, t h e s l a b s are represented by a n\nequivalent beam system. The equivalent beams are f i c t i t i o u s beams with\nt h e s l a b thickness as t h e i r depth, and t h e reduced s l a b width as t h e i r\nwidth. The amount of width reduction i s determined by t h e means of t h e\ndisplacement a n a l y s i s which i s described i n t h e following paragraphs. I n\nt h e case of t h e shear w a l l s , t h e t o t a l c r o s s s e c t i o n was considered t o b e\ne f f e c t i v e i n formulating t h e replacement CBAR elements,\nSince t h e inplane r i g i d i t y of t h e s l a b i s r e l a t i v e l y s t i f f , t h e l a t e r a l\ndisplacements of t h e column ends which are not connected t o s l a b s are t i e d\ntogether with m u l t i p l e c o n s t r a i n t s . This constraining condition y i e l d s a\nmore r e a l i s t i c d i s t r i b u t i o n of shearing f o r c e among t h e columns.\nThe slab-column model was analyzed with t h r e e loading c o n d i t i o n s ; l i v e\nload, dead load, and wind load. The i n d i v i d i a l r e s u l t s were a l s o combined\ni n accordance with l o c a l b u i l d i n g codes. The live load and dead load\na n a l y s i s determined t h e r e l a t e d bending and shearing stresses, as w e l l as\ndisplacements of t h e slab. It a l s o provided t h e d i s t r i b u t i o n of column\nloads. I n t h e wind load a n a l y s i s , t h e t o t a l accumulation of wind load was\napplied a t t h e top of t h e model, and t h e wind load of t h e p a r t i c u l a r\ns t o r y was a p p l i e d a t t h e s l a b level. This r e s u l t e d i n t h e computation of\nshearing displacement of t h e p a r t i c u l a r s t o r y , and t h e shearing and bending\nstresses i n s l a b s and columns due t o wind load. By inspection of t h e stress\nv a r i a t i o n a c r o s s t h e width of t h e s l a b , a n i n i t i a l width was determined f o r\nt h e equivalent beams i n t h e beam-column model.\n422\n\nThen, t h e s a m e wind load was applied t o o b t a i n t h e shearing d i s p l a c e ment. The width of t h e beams was varied t o search f o r a configuration\nwhich provided t h e same displacement as t h e slab-column model. These two\nmodels are displacement compatible models. Obviously, t h e motivation f o r\nt h i s i s s t r i c t l y economical. In t h i s i n v e s t i g a t i o n , t h e s i z e of t h e\nproblem w a s reduced by 80%. Y e t , it s t i l l provided a reasonably r e l i a b l e\nwind stress a n a l y s i s .\nSPACE FRAME BUILDING STRUCTURE ANALYSIS\nOnce t h e simple equivalent model was obtained through t h e a n a l y s i s\ndescribed i n t h e previous paragraphs, t h e t a s k of assembling t h e model f o r\nt h e whole building was a s t r a i g h t forward one. It r e s u l t e d i n t h e space\nframe shown i n Figure 1. Because t h e b u i l d i n g has one plane of symmetry,\nonly h a l f of t h e b u i l d i n g w a s necessary f o r t h i s model.\nAT A\nThere were two N S R N runs i n t h i s a n a l y s i s . The f i r s t one w a s t o\nanalyze t h e displacements and stresses due t o live load, dead load, and\nwind load a c t i n g i n t h e d i r e c t i o n of t h e s h o r t a x i s of t h e b u i l d i n g , with\nsymmetrical boundary c o n d i t i o n s a t t h e g r i d p o i n t s along t h e s h o r t a x i s .\nThe second run w a s t o analyze t h e displacements and stresses due t o wind\nload a c t i n g along t h e d i r e c t i o n of t h e long a x i s (Z-axis) of t h e b u i l d i n g ,\nwith anti-symmetrical boundary conditions along t h e s h o r t a x i s ,\nThe r e s u l t s showed t h a t t h e b u i l d i n g shortens about 3.6 centimeters\nunder combined live and dead load. It a l s o d r i f t s 8.6 centimeters and\n17.8 centimeters under wind load i n t h e d i r e c t i o n of long and s h o r t a x i s ,\nr e s p e c t i v e l y . The p r o f i l e s of t h e d r i f t of t h e building a r e shown i n\n. They a l l conform t o Chicago b u i l d i n g code. The amount of d r i f t\nFigure 4\ni s considered t o be a n important c r i t e r i a f o r design. It determines t h e\nn a t u r a l frequencies of t h e b u i l d i n g and, hence, t h e response of t h e\nb u i l d i n g t o wind loads. The stress r e s u l t s were used f o r design purposes\nsuch a s determining r e i n f o r c i n g , s i z i n g concrete s e c t i o n s , and required\nmaterial s t r e n g t h s . The Single Point C o n s t r a i n t Forces a t t h e base of\nt h e b u i l d i n g were used f o r t h e design of t h e foundation system.\nPREPROCESSOR\nSince a l a r g e p o r t i o n of t h e building layout w a s uniform, t h e r e w a s\na g r e a t d e a l of r e p e t i t i o n of t h e bulk data.

E s s e n t i a l l y , t h e\npreprocessor was a c o l l e c t i o n of counters and bulk d a t a Formats. The\nf u n c t i o n of t h e counters was to r e p e a t and e x t r a p o l a t e t h e d a t a on key\ncards. The bulk data Formats were required t o g e n e r a t e card images.\nApproximately 11,000 input card images w e r e generated on magnetic t a p e\nfrom 1,500 cards input t o t h e preprocessor program.\n\nThe operation of l i n k i n g t h e preprocessor, s t o r i n g and t r a n s f e r r i n g\nd a t a , as w e l l as executing NASTlRAN, were done on a CDC 6600 computer under\nt h e SCOPE 3 . 3 operating system. A l l t o g e t h e r , seven SCOPE c o n t r o l cards\nwere required f o r t h i s e n t i r e operation. Therefore, t h e amount of d a t a\npreparation work was minimal. It represented an approximate reduction of\n86% when compared t o a l l manual work.\nCONCLUDING REYKUCS\n\nThe s l a b column i n t e r a c t i o n a n a l y s i s presented h e r e i n i s believed t o\nbe t h e f i r s t of i t s kind i n t h e f i e l d of h i g h - r i s e b u i l d i n g a n a l y s i s .

Mason\nNASA Goddard Space Flight Center\nSUMMARY\nA general purpose heat transfer analysis capability based on the finite-element\n\nmethod has been added to the NASTRAN system. The program not only can render temperature distributions in solids subjected to various thermal boundary conditions, includcompatible in capacity and in\ning effects of diffuse-gray thermal radiation, but is ful.1~\nthe finite-element model representation with that of its structural counterpart in the\nNASTRAN system. The development history of the finite-element approach for determining temperatures is summarized. The scope of analysis capability, program structure,\nfeatures, and limitations a r e given with the objective of providing NASTRAN users with\nan overall view of the NASTRAN Thermal Analyzer.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe NASTRAN Thermal Analyzer is a general purpose heat transfer computer program based on the finite-element approach. It is fully capable of rendering temperature\ndistributions and heat flows in solids subjected to various boundary conditions, including\nthe modes of convection and radiation, in both steady-state and transient problems. This\ncomputer program has been achieved by the addition of new capabilities to NASTRAN including new elements and solution algorithms. The resulting Thermal Analyzer is both\nself-contained and user-oriented but remains totally compatible in capacity and in the\nfinite-element model representation with that of its structural counterpart in the NASTRAN system. Therefore, thermal and structural analyses of large and complex structural configurations utilizing a unified finite-element representation have become a\nreality.\nThe purpose of this paper is to provide the NASTRAN users with an overall view of\nthe NASTRAN Thermal Analyzer describing its scope, program structure, features and\nlimitations. The practical needs which motivated the development of this thermal analysis capability are given. A brief survey of early works with regard to heat transfer\nanalysis by the finite-element method is included. Also described are studies conducted\nat GSFC which investigated element behaviors, obtainable accuracy and solution efficiency\nof various schemes used in conjunction with the finite-element method, the feasibility of\nadding thermal analysis capability to the NASTRAN system, and the various approaches\nfor treating problems with emphasis on radiative exchanges.\n\nBACKGROUND OF DEVELOPMENT\nThe main objective of a research and development program at GSFC, titled the\nStructural-Thermal-Optical Program (STOP) (ref. l),is the devlopment of analytical\nmethods and procedures which can yield reliable predictions of thermal deformation and\noptical degradation in an orbiting spacecraft (ref. 2), or in a simulated environment.\nThis multi-disciplinary project is intended to render analytical services to projects such\nas LST (Large Space Telescope), SAS (Small Astronomy Satellite), EOS (Earth Observatory Satellite), etc. To predict alignment or optical performance of a large spacecrafttelescope system, NASTRAN is relied upon for structural analysis to compute thermally\ninduced deformations and stresses. For a reliable structural solution, the thermoelastically uncoupled structural analysis requires accurate temperature data as an input to\nthe NASTRBN structural model. Prior to the existence of the NASTRAN Thermal Analyzers available general purpose thermal analysis computer programs were designed on the\nbasis of the lumped-node thermal balance method (e.g. ref. 3). They were not only.limited in capacity but seriously handicapped by incompatibilities arising from the model\nrepresentations inherent in the two distinct approaches. The intermodel transfer of\ntemperature data was found to necessitate extensive interpolation and extrapolation.\nThis extra work proved not only a tedious and time-consuming process but also resulted\nin compromised solution accuracy. To minimize such an interface obstacle, the STOP\nproject undertook the development of a general purpose finite-element heat transfer\ncomputer program.\nPreliminary studies were then conducted at GSFC to investigate the feasibility of\nachieving such a computer program as an integrated part of the NASTRAN system.\nWhen this task began, the theoretical foundation of the finite-element approach had been\nestablished for both steady-state and transient thermal field problems (ref. 4-6). Efforts\naimed at broadening its scope were found in literature such as an extension to axissymmetric problems (refs. 7 8), a consideration of inhomogeneous material using higher\n,\norder elements (ref. 9), a demonstration of procedure enabling the achievement of an\nefficient solution by reducing the order of the set of equations (ref. lo), and many special\napplications (ref. 11-13). All of these studies, however, were limited to thermal conduction with linear boundary conditions. Since radiation is a dominant mode of the heat\ntransfer process in space-oriented applications and introduces a fourth-power nonlinear\ntemperature term in the boundary conditions, the in-house studies were directed principally to include these nonlinear radiation effects. Other investigations into solution\nfeasibility, accuracy and efficiency, and element behaviors in combined modes of heat\ntransfer analysis were also undertaken. The in-house studies consisting of two parallel\nefforts were :\n(1) the structural version of NASTRAN was employed directly to solve heat trans-\n\nfer problems by utilizing mathematical analogies together with manipulations of\navailable elements and solution routines (refs. 14, 15). The concept of treating\nthe radiative fluxes as nonlinear loads was demonstrated successfully for simple\nradiative problems. The solution scheme, however, was restricted in that all\nnonlinear radiation problems had to be solved using the direct transient\nintegration algorithm available in the program.\n\n444\n\n(2) the derivation of heat elements including radiative effects from the governing\n\nequation and boundary conditions approached via a variational principle, and\nstudies centered on heat elements with associated different solution schemes\n(ref. 16). Two distinct approaches to nonlinear radiative problems were investigated and studies of radiative exchanges between element surfaces of known\nand unknown temperatures were included. A direct steady-state solution via the\nconsistent linearization method and using an iterative process proved to be able\nto yield a solution more efficient than using a transient route. The other approach, the direct energy distribution method, which had been illustrated independently in a simple problem (ref. l?), in fact, shares the same theoretical\nbasis as that employed by a direct use of the structural version of NASTRAN\n(ref. 14, 15). A prototype computer program based on the direct energy distribution method was coded (ref. 18), and studies of element behaviors and solution\naccuracy were also conducted.\nWhile the NASTRAN System Management Office at Langley Research Center planned\nthe extension of the NASTRAN system to include linear conductive heat transfer analysis\ncapability only, GSFC-STOP was seeking the implementation of a full-fledged finiteelement heat transfer computer program. The software capability was finally developed\nand implemented by the MacNeal-Schwandler Corporation under a subcontract from Bell\nAerospace Company. It must be stressed, however, that a cooperative financial and\ntechnical effort between these two NASA centers made possible the emergence of this\nvital new capability.\nSCOPE OF ANALYSIS CAPABILITY\nThe NASTRAN Thermal Analyzer is capable of solving both steady-state and transient heat transfer problems in large size systems. of arbitrary configuration. The governing heat equation together with the boundary conditions may be expressed, following\nthe finite-element technique, in matrix form as\n\nwhere\n{u) = vector of grid point temperatures\n\nhi1\n\n= rate change of temperature vector\n\n[r<l = thermal conductance matrix\n\n[B] = thermal capacitance matrix\n= vector\n\nof grid point heat fluxes\n\n445\n\nIru> = vector of temperature-dependent\n\nnonlinear heat fluxes\n\nWith appropriate interpretation of the matrices appearing in Eq. ( ) three basic types of\nl,\nproblem can be identified. They are distinguished by the numerical solution algorithms\nrequired for their solutions.\n(1) Linear Steady-State Problems\n\nand\nLetting {u>= {N) ={O)\nequation of the form\n\n[d\nI\n\nEq. (1)is reduced to a linear steady-state\n\nwhere k,] is a constant thermal conductance matrix. This equation is analogous to the\nbasic linear static analysis of the structural version and is treated by the solution\nalgorithm present in Rigid Format 1, (Ref. 19).\n(2) Nonlinear Steady-State Problems\n\nd\nand\nb t t i n g { = {O)\n\n[Id =[K21, Eq.\n\n(1)\nhas the form\n\nwhere [K,j may be temperature-dependent. The permitted nonlinearities may arise from\ntemperature-dependent conduction and convection properties as well as diffuse radiation.\nA new iterative solution algorithm, which includes test for convergence, has been added\nto the program for this type of problem.\n(3) Linear and Nonlinear Transient Problems\n\ndirectly represents the general transient heat transfer problem in\nEquation (1)\nwhich {PI is allowed to be a time-dependent heat flux vector. The permitted nonlinearities may arise from the effects of radiation or from user specified nonlinear elements.\nThe new solution algorithm accommodated for this type of problem is implicit and is a\ncombination of forward and backward differencing embracing a free parameter P that\nallows the user to select the amount of each. While a default value exists for the parameter which assures stability in linear problems, an override option is provided which allows the user to trade stability for efficiency. An option is also available which permits\nthe user to linearize the effects of radiation.\nPROGRAM STRUCTURE\nThe NASTRAN Thermal Analyzer has been designed to perform thermal analysis\nutilizing input and output formats compatible with those of the structural version. This\n\n446\n\ncapability has been achieved by making maximum use of existing elements and system\ncapabilities needed to satisfy the unique requirements posed by thermal problems. All\ninput quantities as well as output displays are physically meaningful to users in the\nthermal field.\n\nFeatures such as nonlinear and scalar elements, multipoint constraints, transfer\nfunctions, DMAP, etc. are automatically inherited from NASTRAN. The user, therefore,\nis provided with a powerful tool to include effects not normally modeled by other elements as long as those effects can be described by zero or first order system of equations\nThe essential points which characterize this thermal analyzer are summarized as\nfollows :\n(1) Geometry Description\n\nThe body to be analyzed is idealized as an assemblage of appropriate finite\nelements. NASTRAN grid, scalar, and extra points remain valid for use in this description. However, only one degree-of-freedom is associated with a grid point because of\nthe nature of the scalar temperature field problem.\n(2)\n\nTypes of Elements\nThe program contains elements in three general categories:\n\n-\n\nHeat conduction elements The constant gradient line, triangle and tetrahedra are the basic elements and utilize linear temperature gradients in\none, two and three dimensions, respectively. All elements share common\ndescriptions with their structural counterparts and are summarized in\nTable 1. Quadrilateral elements are composed of overlapping triangles,\nand wedges and hexahedra from sub-tetrahedra. Solid-of-revolution elements of triangular and trapezoiidal cross-section are available for analyzing axisymmetric problems. Lumped capacitance matrices a r e used with\nall conduction elements to account for the effect of heat storage.\n\n-\n\nBoundary elements XHBDY elements are used to define surface heat flux\ninput and to describe convective and radiative exchanges between boundary\nelements. More than one boundary element can be connected to any one\nheat conduction element to account for multiple boundary heat inputs, including convection and radiation. A special cylindrical element with an\narbitrary user specified elliptic cross-section is included for convenience\nin treating vector heat inputs. With this one dimensional element the effects of directional radiant heat inputs are automatically included in that\nperipheral energy inputs over the lateral surfaces are integrated internally.\n\n-\n\nSpecial elements Several element types are available for the indirect inclusion of effects which cannot be otherwise modeled if only heat conduction\n\n447\n\nelements together with boundary elements were used. These special elements may be employed to enhance the analysis capability of the program.\ni\nx\nScalar elements, nonlinear elements, trans\nfunctions, and direc\ninputs are included in this category. In heat transfer problems, scalar\nspring elements are analogous to thermal ccnductors and scalar dampers\nto thermal capacitance.\n(3) Material Properties\n\nIsotropic and anisotropic material behaviors are included. The treatment of\nnonlinearities arising from temperature-dependent thermal conductivity and convective\nfilm coefficient requires an iteqative solution algorithm and this has been automated for\nsteady-state problems only. The process involves the supply of temperature-dependent\ndata in the form of tabulated functions which are interrogated at the beginning of each\niterative step. In transient cases, however, the user must rely on the use of nonlinear\nelements to treat the nonlinear effects as additional thermal loads that are evaulated at\nthe previous integration time step,\n(4)\n\nConstraints and Partitions\n*\n\nConstraint and partitioning features of the structural version remain valid.\nSingle-point constraints are used for the specification of prescribed temperatures, and\nmultipoint constraints a r e used to describe known temperature dependency between temperature degrees of freedom. The omitted degree-of-freedom capability employs the\nwell-known .Guyan reduction technique to reduce the problem size of the solution set.\n(5) Boundary Conditions, Initial Conditions, and Thermal Loading\n\nConvective exchange along the boundary can be specified between a surface and\nan ambient zone of known temperature, or between two or more surfaces or zones of\nunknown temperakres. Constant temperatures are specified directly by using constraints\nwhile temperatures which are arbitrary functions of time a r e specified indirectly by\nusing simple modeling procedures which avoid unnecessary retriangularization when\nsolving transient problems. Arbitrary initial temperature distributions can be specified\nin transient analysis.\nSeveral options are available to users for the specification of thermal flux input. Steady or time varying scalar heat flux can be described at the element and/or grid\npoint level. Vector heat flux, such as that of radiant flux from a distant source, is\ndescribed by specifying the flux intensity and vector direction. Both the flux intensity\nand vector direction may be time dependent and tbis allows, for example, the automated\naccommodation of rotating bodies in a vector heat flux field. Volumetric heat generation\ncan be specified at the element level.\nRequired input data for diffuse-gray thermal radiation problems consists of the\nStefan- Boltz mann\'s constant, reference absolute temperature, ther mo-physical proper ties\n\n448\n\n.\n\nand an array of exchange coefficients together with a list which identifies the elements\nthat are radiatively interacting. The array of radiative exchange coefficients A F is a symmetric matrix according to the reciprocity rule. It is the product of the emitting surface\narea A and the geometric view factor F between the emitting and receiving surfaces.\nThe Thermal Analyzer accepts radiation data via card or tape.\n(6)\n\nGraphics Capability\n\nThe structural plotting feature for data checkout is available. Included options\nare orthotropic, perspective or stereoscopic projection capabilities. Time-history data\nof element heat f u , thermal loads, and temperatures at grid points can all be graphically\nlx\nshown in x-y plots.\n(7) Integrated Thermo-Structural Analysis\nThe thermo-elastically uncoupled thermal and structural analyses are performed\nin two passes through the NASTRAN System, but may be made to appear as a single continuous run by the use of computer system control language. In the case of transient\nanalysis, temperature distributions computed by the NASTRAN Thermal Analyzer are\nrecorded on magnetic tape or punched cards at predetermined time intervals and, subsequently, employed for static structural analysis. Back-to-back thermal and structural\nanalyses require that the grid point locations must be identical in both models on a\npoint-to-point basis.\nA VIEW FACTOR GENERATION COMPUTER PROGRAM\n\nIn computing temperatures involving radiative inter changes between surfaces, the\ngeometric view factors between any two radiatively active element surfaces are necessary to form the exchange coefficients as input to the Thermal Analyzer. In an in-house\nSTOP project effort, GSFC has developed an IBM-360 program named "VIEW" which\ncomputes the view factors and the required exchange coefficients between radiating\nboundary elements. VIEW has compatible input-output formats with the Thermal\nAnalyzer and possesses other programming features similar to those of NASTRAN. A\ndetailed description of this program is presented in an associated paper titled V I E W\nA Modification of the RAVFAC View Factor Program for U s e with NASTRAN Level 1 .\n5"\n\n-\n\nFURTHER STUDY IN EFFECT OF VIEW FACTOR COMPUTATIONS\nIn studying accuracy, one of the factors that might influence the result of solution\ninvolving radiative exchanges between elements is the method that computes the amount\nof net radiant energy on the element level which is then evenly distributed to its vertices.\nThis approximation involves the computation of view factors which are computed on the\nelement sur\xe2\x82\xacaceto element surface basis associated with the element temperature which\nis an average of those temperatures at the vertices. An alternate approach is to form an\nisothermal area of the temperature at the grid point by dividing the origin elements into\nsubelements and assembling the subelements from the adjoining elements to that grid\n\npoint while subelements are formed by connecting the centroid to each midpoint on the\nside of an element. The difference of the view factor results from these two approaches\nis evident in view of a demonstration of the view factor FA-B\nbetween two shaded areas\nas shown in Figure 1.\nA direct computation of FA-Bgives 0.23344, the result obtained from a summation\nof one-third of the view factors computed on the basis of element surface to element\nsurface is 0.12471, and the result obtained from summing up the view factors on the\nbasis of subelement to subelement following the rule of the view factor algebra is 0.233989.\nIt is to be noted, however, that these computations took into consideration the view\nfactor alone. A study combining the effects of temperatures and view factors which involves a modification of a prototype computer program to assess the quantitative influence\nto the solution accuracy is in progress and will be reported separately,\n\nILLUSTRATIVE PROBLEM\nSince the delivery of the IBM-360 NASTRAN Thermal Analyzer to GSFC in June of\n1972, the system check-out phase has proceeded. A problem was designed to demon-\n\nstrate program capabilities and features including: inter-element and inter-program\n(with regard to VIEW program) compatibilities, coordinate transformations, combined\nthermal modes of operation, vector heat flux input description, and the application of the\ndifferent solution algorithms. The problem is that of a fin-like bentplate, whose dimensions, thermophysical properties and finite-element model are shown in Figure 2 where\nthe input parameters with the subscript t refer to the tube and those without any refer to\nthe plate. \'The underside of the plate is insulated thermally, and the upper face is exposed\nto a directional heat flux of S. The flowing fluid has a temperature Tin = 1200 K at the\nentrance and a linear temperature drop of 60 K across the tube which has a wall\nthickness r = 1cm and an outer radius ro = 20 cm. Determine temperature distributhe plate for the following cases:\nThe upper face dissipates heat to the surroundings of T a i\nvective film coefficient h a i r = 1.135 W/cm -OK.\n\n= 300\n\nK with a con-\n\nA radiative enclosure of a temperature T replaces the convective environment\n,\nin the preceding case, and radiative interchanges between all surface elements\nare taken into consideration. The solution is approached by the direct nonlinear\nsteady-state solution algorithm.\n\nThe plate has a uniform temperature at To = 300 K initially. The temperature\nresponse of the plate is determined by the nonlinear transient solution algorithm.\nThe process starts with an activation of the flow into the tube which has identical tube-fluid conditions as previously described.\n\nIn view of the length that would be required to embed the complete meaningful computer print out of this problem, which consists of detailed card descriptions of the control and input data decks and the output results, solutions are not included in this report\n450\n\nbut have been prepared in a separately bound copy (ref. 20) which will be made available to the audience of this colloquium as well as to any interested reader who wl make\nil\na request to the authors.\nREFERENCES\n\n1 Lee, H.

Both\nof these two supporting systems were analyzed by using rigid format 9 of\nNASTRAN for dynamic loads and the thermal stresses were analyzed by AXISOL\nRef. 1. The six column configuration was modeled by a combination of plate and\nbar elements and the concrete cantilever ledge configuration was modeled by\nplate elements. Both configurations were found structurally satisfactory; however, nonstructural considerations favored the concrete cantilever ledge.\nEach of the NASTRAN models has about 600 dynamic degrees of freedom. Because of structural and loading symmetry, only 30 and 15 degree, circumferentially, models a s shown in Figures 3 and 4 were required. The bulk data was\nre-sequenced by BANDIT to minimize the run time. Time steps in the range of\n2 to 1 0 MS were used for different runs and the total response times were kept\na t about 130 MS. Various structural damping coefficients were applied in this\nanalysis. Many structural and X-Y plots were produced. Average run time\nwas about 20 minutes CPU and 40 minutes wall clock.\nThe basic computer hardware consists of a UNNAC 1108 central processor\nwith 131K core memory, 2-22, 020, 096 words FASTRAND, 5-FH432 drums,\n8-UNISERVO VIII magnetic tapes and two 30-inch CALCOMP drum plotters.\nSTRUCTURAL CONFIGURATIONS\n\n.\nThe 6-column configuration is shown in Figures 1, 2 and 4 These steel\ncolumns a r e built up sections with two horizontal supports at the third points.\nEach column is bolted to the Z-ring. The concrete cantilever ledge configu-\n\n465\n\nration is shown in Figure 3. The box ring girder shown in Figure 2 is supported\nby the concrete ledge.\nSTRUCTURAL MODELING\nIn a 30 degree column configuration model, the Z-ring is modeled by 7 plate\nelements per 2 degrees of azimuth for a total of 150 plate elements while the\nbox ring girder and column are modeled by 15 and 18 bar elements respectively. The concrete cantilever configuration was modeled by 18 plate elements\nper 3.75 degrees of azimuth o r total of 72 plate elements. All the connecting\nbolts a r e assumed rigid.\nDYNAMIC LOADING\nThe dynamic loads consist of an up load and a down load as shown in Figure 5 .\nThe load paths for the two proposed structural concepts are shown in Figures\n2 and 3. These dynamic loads are specified on TLOADl cards and combined\non DLOAD cards.\nDYNAMIC RESPONSE\nThe transient dynamic stresses, element forces, deflections, velocities and\naccelerations were printed and plotted for selected critical elements and grid\npoints.\nThe dynamic load factor, DLF, is the ratio of the peak dynamic displacement\nto the static displacement produced by a static load with magnitude equal to the\npeak dynamic load. The DLF for the 6-steel columns and the concrete cantilever ledge are calculated to he about 1.6 and 1.2 respectively. The results\nare summarized in Tables 1 and 2.\nTHERMAL STRESSES ANALYSIS\nAXISOL, which is a finite element computer program for stress o r strain\nstructural problems, was used for the thermal analysis. The structural model\nand resulting thermal stresses are shown in Figure 6. The thermal stresses\nin the concrete ledge a r e significant. These stresses were combined with the\ndynamic stresses and shown in Table 1.\n\n466\n\nSUMMARY\nThe analyses reported in this paper pertain to the preliminary structural\ndesign phase. The results obtained from NASTRAN and AXISOL are\nsatisfactory for this purpose. Due to the versatility of the NASTRAN input\nformat, design changes, additional analyses o r modeling refinement can\neasily be effected. Some simple lumped mass models with one to \xe2\x82\xacive degrees\nof freedom with nonlinear material properties were analyzed independent of\nNASTRAN. The hasic structural dynamic responses were within 10 - 20% of\nNASTRAN results. The satisfactory results of this analysis clearly indicate\nthe applicability and usefulness of NASTRAN to heavy civil engineering type\nof structural design and analysis.\n\nRe \xe2\x82\xacerence\n\n1.

(In NASTRAN, t h i s i s c a l l e d t h e Phase I operation.) From t h i s\nanalysis, t h e displacements of a l l i n t e r i o r p i n t s i n each substructure with\nt h e adjacent substructure boundaries fixed a r e evaluated. These boundaries\na r e then relaxed simultaneously and t h e boundary displacements a r e determined\nfrom t h e equations of equilibrium a t t h e ljoundary j o i n t s (the Phase I1 NASTRAN\noperation)\nEach scbstructure can now be analysed f o r boundary displacements\nAdding these t o t h e Phase I displacements, (displacenents of i n t e r i o r points\ni n each substructure with adjacent boundaries f i x e d ) we g e t t h e final displacements.

The 10 x 20 model, as shown i n Fig. I, uses one-half\n\n486\n\nof the structure and symmetric boundary constraints on the midline i n order t o\nreduce the order o f the problem and the band w i\nby one-half. Because only\nthe bending modes are desired, the inplane\nions and rotations normal\nt o the plane are constrained. This i s the same problem as that solved i n\nthe NASTRAB demonstration manual (ref. 3 ) .\n\nThe model i s divided into f i v e substructures. (This i s not the best\ndivision o f the problem; however, since the purpose herein i s t o demonstrate\nthe use of identical substructures and the second s t i f f n e s s reduction i n\nPhase 11, no attemp\'c i s made t o choose the best subdivision.)

Also, suggestions are made for a new Demonstration Problem\nManual that will better assist the user community in the selection of NASTRAN\noptions and preparation of input data as well as allow the user to isolate\nthe various options used in the set of demonstration problems.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe versatility and scope of N A S W are large and increasing with each\nnew release. For this reason a set of demonstration problems is used to\ncheckout the NASTRAN program as well as to demonstrate its capabilities, The\nuse of demonstration problems in this manner is a good practice and should\nbe continued in the future as new features are added on to NASTRAN. However,\ncare must be taken in the construction of this set of problems. Because of the\nmany options available in NASTRAN, the set of demonstration problems should\nit\nbe both complete and efficient, i r e r , should utilize all the options\nof N A S T W in a limited number of problems. It is the intention of this\npaper to supply criteria and procedures for the selection, evaluation and\nmaintenance of an optimum set of demonstration problems. In order to carry\nout our objective a catalogue is constructed which lists all the PJASTRAN\noptions which are to be explicity checked out. This catalogue is then used\nto evaluate the present set of demonstration problems and a procedure is outlined for the construction of an optimum set of demonstration problems.\nIt is a l s o suggested that a new Demonstration Problem Manud be supplied\nwhich w i l l assist the user community in the selection of NASTRAN options\nand preparation of input data, This will be a useful supplement to the User\'s\nManual (ref. 1 . To this end the present paper includes, as a by-product\n)\nof the aforementioned objective, a complete listing of the options available\nin NASTRAN in an organized format. Also a complete catalogue of the present\ndemonstration problems is constructed in a matrix form, This catalogue is\ndisplayed in the Appendix and can be used as a reference to locate the use\nof a particular option in the set of demonstration problems.\n\n"Gmunman-Langley Industry Associate, NASA Langley Research Center\n\n497\n\nI\n\nCONSTRUCTION O CATALOGUE\nF\nThe f i r s t s t e p i n constrbcting a catalogue i s t o organize t h e N S R N\nAT A\nf e a t u r e s i n t o general groups, These general groups, shown i n Figure 1, a r e\nbased on t h e flow through t h e N S R N d a t a deck and represent t h e main\nAT A\nf e a t u r e s t h a t t h e user i s concerned with i n order t o s e t up h i s problem corr e c t l y and completely. The present Demonstration Problem Manual ( r e f . 2 )\ncontains a similar l i s t i n g .\nNext, a n evaluation i s made t o determine which options must be e x p l i c i t l y\nchecked out. This w i l l helg insure completeness and avoid duplication and\nunnecessary bookeeping, This evaluation leads t o t h e following considerations:\n\n1. All t h e modules i n NASTRAEJ must be thoroughly evaluated. However,\nonly those modules not used i n t h e r i g i d formats w i l l be l i s t e d i n\nt h e catalogue (See A5.DMAP of Appendix). These modules can then\nMP\nbe a l t e r e d i n t o t h e r i g i d formats or included i n a separate D A\nprogram, I n t h i s way w will guarantee t h a t a l l t h e modules are\ne\nbeing used, I n addition, all parameter options should be checked\ni n a separate D W program.\n2.\n\nThe case c o n t r o l cards t h a t a r e used f o r s e l e c t i n g bulk d a t a input\na r e not e x p l i c i t l y included i n t h e l i s t of d a t a cards. These w i l l\nautomatically be checked when t h e corresponding bulk d a t a cards a r e\nused. The case control cards necessary f o r s e l e c t i n g bulk d a t a cards\na r e l i s t e d i n t h e Appendix under C. B u l k Data Deck Options. Also see\ns e c t i o n 2.3.1 of t h e User\'s Manual f o r t h i s purpose. The case\nc o n t r o l cards TITLE, SUBTITLE, and LABEL a r e used i n most problems\nand a r e t h e r e f o r e d e l e t e d from t h e l i s t t o be demonstrated.\n\n3. Those bulk d a t a cards t h a t a r e n e c e s s a r i l y r e f e r r e d t o by other\nbulk d a t a cards a r e not included i n t h e catalogue. Generally,\nt h e s e a r e property cards.

This\nt h e corresponding r i g i d\nEIGB (5), PLFACT ( 6 ) ,\n\nAll t h e NASTMN options a r e l i s t e d under t h e i r appropriate headings.\nThe f i n a l product, l i s t e d i n t h e Appendix, contains a complete and e f f i c i e n t\nAT A\nl i s t i n g of all t h e options i n N S R N which have t o be e x p l i c i t l y checked\nout.

This w i l l enable\nthe user t o analyze prototype problems before attempting t h e solution of\nlarge-scale problems. A number of large-scale problems w i l l a l s o be included\nt o checkout such things as s p i l l logic. An individual problem w i l l be\nkept r e a l i s t i c while u t i l i z i n g as many different options as feasible. This i s\ni n k e e p i n g with the desired objective, namely, t o u t i l i z e a l l t h e options\navailable i n N S R N i n an e f f i c i e n t manner.\nAT A\n\nThe i n i t i a l s e t of demonstration problems w i l l be comprised of those\npresently being used t o checkout NASTRAN. Figure 2 represents t h r e e\nt y p i c a l problems t h a t w i l l be considered a s additions t o o r replacements\nf o r the i n i t i a l s e t . In problem 1 subcase d e f i n i t i o n s are demonstrated\non a simple t r u s s . This problem uses all the static subcase options.\nIn problem 2 we a r e considering the buckling of a simply supported square\np l a t e under edge compression. Instead of using j u s t one element we\nincorporate all t h e p l a t e elements i n t o one problem, There are nine such\nelements. T h i s problem checks out the r e l i a b i l i t y of t h e s t a t i c s t i f f n e s s\nand d i f f e r e n t i a l s t i f f n e s s matrices of p l a t e elements, W note t h a t i n\ne\nboth these problems t h e r e are many options ( i n a given category) used i n a\nsingle problem, making it possible t o use a l l the options i n fewer problems,\nor, more appropriately, i n l e s s computer t i m e . In problem 3 we a r e analyzing\nthe nonlinear behavior of a r o t a t i n g beam under a x i a l compression. In\naddition t o demonstrating the d i f f e r e n t i a l s t i f f n e s s of the CBAR element, as\npresently demonstrated i n demonstration problem 4-1, t h e present problem also\nincludes the following; (1)t h e use of CELASl and CELAS2 elements, which have\nnot been demonstrated i n any current demonstration problem, (2) the use of\na negative spring t o simulate a r o t a t i n g mass, and (3) an ALTER which allows\nt h e load f a c t o r s , s p e c i f i e d on t h e DSFACT bulk d a t a card, t o be applied t o\nload P while not affecting load q (presently a l l loads a r e multiplied by\nthe load factors).\nEvaluation\nA table i s now s e t up i n matrix form and can be used t o evaluate a\nset of demonstration problems. A similar idea was suggested by Cuthill e t al.\ni n r e f . 3. The rows of t h e matrix are the NASTRAN options, l i s t e d i n t h e\ncatalogue, while the columns r e f e r t o the d i f f e r e n t demonstration problems.\nFor each problem we check off the options used, A f t e r a s e t of demonstration\nproblems i s catalogued, we can e a s i l y see from our matrix which options are\nused for a given problem, which problems u t i l i z e a given option, and i n\np a r t i c u l a r , which options have not been used. An evaluation of t h e demonstrat i o n problems used t o check out level. 15 has been made, and t h e complete\nevaluation matrix i s given i n the Appendix, The general observation i s\n\n499\n\nt h a t t h e present set of demonstration problems u t i l i z e s most of t h e main\nfeatures of NASTRAN, but t h a t t h e r e a r e many minor options which are not\n\nused.\nConstruction and Maintenance\nW can see a t the outset t h a t t h e r e i s no unique set of optimum problems\ne\nf e a s i b l e , In f a c t it would be very i n e f f i c i e n t t o t r y t o find t h e most\ne f f i c i e n t s e t of problems. The method outlined here i s an i t e r a t i v e procedure,\nas shown i n Figure 3. Starting with a given s e t of demonstration problems,\ncatalogue and evaluate them as outlined previously, then update them by\na l t e r i n g and deleting old problems and adding new problems. The updated s e t\nof problems can then be made more e f f i c i e n t by combining options i n d i f f e r e n t\nways, or possibly by combining problems, The cycle of evaluating and updating\ncan be repeated as often as necessary. W must a l s o make sure t h a t we can\ne\ne a s i l y maintain t h e s e t of demonstration problems. A s new features are added\nt o NASTRAN, t h e cataloguing t a b l e s are updated and t h e demonstration problems\na r e a l t e r e d or added t o and the cycle repeated. This w i l l lead t o an\ne f f i c i e n t s e t of demonstration problems which can be maintained w i t h a minimum\nof e f f o r t .\nOnce w have a set of problems we can demonstrate them on NASTRAN. With\ne\nour cataloguing procedure w w i l l know exactly which options a r e being checked\ne\ne\nout and which options remain t o be checked out, Ultimately, w w i l l have a\ncomplete set of problems, t h a t i s t o s a y , a s e t of problems t h a t u t i l i z e s a l l\nt h e features of NASTRAN.\nD M N T A I N PROBLEM MANUAL\nE O S R TO\nThe proposed Demonstration Problem Manual w i l l consist of a description\nof the demonstration problems, as appears presently ( r e f . 2 ) . A useful\naddition w i l l be t h e catalogue of NASTRAN options, T h i s w i l l enable the\nreader t o follow and understand t h e selection of options used f o r a given\nproblem. Also included, for easy reference, should be t h e evaluation matrix\nof t h e present s e t of demonstration problems, This w i l l allow t h e user t o\ni s o l a t e the use of a given option i n the s e t of problems. It i s suggested\nt h a t t h e data decks f o r t h e demonstration problems a l s o be included i n t h i s\nmanual for easy reference and completeness. This has also been suggested by\nC u t h i l l , e t al. i n reference 3 . Whether the data decks are included\ni n the manual, since they a r e supplied t o the user from COSMIC, they\nshould include comments t o help explain any misunderstandings t h a t m i g h t\na r i s e i n the preparation of data.\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nThe present t e x t outlines procedures for constructing an optimum s e t\nof demonstration problems (one which u t i l i z e s a l l the options i n an\ne f f i c i e n t manner) and a format f o r a new Demonstration Problem Manual (one\nwhich r e a d i l y lends i t s e l f t o i s o l a t i n g t h e use of individual options).\nAT A\nThis w i l l allow both t h e management and user community of N S R N t o take\nb e t t e r advantage of t h e use of denionstration problems.\nREFERENCES\n1.
