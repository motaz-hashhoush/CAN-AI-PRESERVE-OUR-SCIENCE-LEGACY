b'Simulation Packages Expand Aircraft Design Options\nNASA Technology\n\nW\n\nhen engineers explore designs for safer, more\nfuel efficient, or faster aircraft, they encounter\na common problem: they never know exactly\nwhat will happen until the vehicle gets off the ground.\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will never get the complete answer until you\nbuild the airplane and fly it,\xe2\x80\x9d says Colin Johnson of\nDesktop Aeronautics. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are multiple levels of\nsimulation you can do to approximate the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s performance, however.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWhen designing a new air vehicle, computational fluid\ndynamics, or CFD, comes in very handy for engineers.\nCFD can predict the flow of fluids and gasses around an\nobject\xe2\x80\x94such as over an aircraft\xe2\x80\x99s wing\xe2\x80\x94by running complex calculations of the fluid physics. This information\nis helpful in assessing the aircraft\xe2\x80\x99s aerodynamic performance and handling characteristics.\n\nIn 2001, after several years of development, NASA\nreleased a new approach to CFD called Cart3D. The tool\nprovides designers with an automated, highly accurate\ncomputer simulation suite to streamline the conceptual\nanalysis of aerospace vehicles. Specifically, it allows users\nto perform automated CFD analysis on complex vehicle\ndesigns. In 2002, the innovation won NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Software\nof the Year award.\nMichael Aftosmis, one of the developers of Cart3D\nand a fluid mechanics engineer at Ames Research Center,\nsays the main purpose of the program was to remove the\nmesh generation bottleneck from CFD. A major benefit\nof Cart3D is that the mesh, or the grid for analyzing\ndesigns, is produced automatically. Traditionally, the\nmesh has been generated by hand, and requires months\nor years to produce for complex vehicle configurations.\nCart3D\xe2\x80\x99s automated volume mesh generation enables\neven the most complex geometries to be modeled hundreds of times faster, usually within seconds. \xe2\x80\x9cIt allows a\n\nHere, NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Cart3D models the computational fluid dynamics of a supersonic jet design. Cart3D saves time by automatically\nproducing the mesh, or grid, for analyzing vehicle designs.\n\nnovice user to get the same quality results as an expert,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsays Aftosmis.\nNow, a decade later, NASA continues to enhance\nCart3D to meet users\xe2\x80\x99 needs for speed, power, and flexibility. Cart3D provides the best of both worlds\xe2\x80\x94the\npayoff of using a complex, high-fidelity simulation with\nthe ease of use and speed of a much simpler, lower-fidelity\nsimulation method. Aftosmis explains how instead of\nsimulating just one case, Cart3D\xe2\x80\x99s ease of use and automation allows a user to efficiently simulate many cases to\nunderstand how a vehicle behaves for a range of conditions. \xe2\x80\x9cCart3D is the first tool that was able to do that\nsuccessfully,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.\nAt NASA, Aftosmis estimates that 300\xe2\x80\x93400 engineers\nuse the package. \xe2\x80\x9cWe use it for space vehicle design,\nsupersonic aircraft design, and subsonic aircraft design.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTechnology Transfer\nTo enable more use of Cart3D for private and commercial aviation entities, the Small Business Innovation\nResearch (SBIR) program at Langley Research Center\nprovided funds to Desktop Aeronautics, based in Palo\nAlto, California, to build a plug-in to Cart3D that\nincreases the code\xe2\x80\x99s accuracy under particular flow conditions. Aftosmis says Desktop Aeronautics delivered\nvaluable results and made Cart3D more applicable\nfor general use. \xe2\x80\x9cNow they are bringing the product to\nmarket. This is something we never would have had the\ntime to do at NASA. That\xe2\x80\x99s the way the SBIR process is\nsupposed to work.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn 2010, Desktop Aeronautics acquired a license from\nAmes to sell Cart3D. The company further enhanced\nthe software by making it cross-platform, incorporated\na graphical user interface, and added specialized features\nto enable extra computation for the analysis of airplanes\nwith engines and exhaust.\n\n114\t Information Technology\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nSpinoff 2012\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be game-changing for CFD,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsays Aftosmis. \xe2\x80\x9cCart3D is the only commercial simulation\ntool that can guarantee the accuracy of every solution the\nuser does.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBenefits\nToday, Desktop Aeronautics employs Cart3D in\nits consulting services and licenses the spinoff product\nto clients for in-house use. The company provides\ncommercial licenses and academic licenses for research\nand development projects.\nThe software package allows users to perform automated CFD analysis on complex designs and, according\n\nto the company, enables geometry acquisition and mesh\ngeneration to be performed within a few minutes on most\ndesktop computers.\nSimulations generated by Cart3D are assisting organizations in the design of subsonic aircraft, space planes,\nspacecraft, and high speed commercial jets. Customers are\nable to simulate the efficiency of designs through performance metrics such as lift-to-drag ratio.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will assemble a spectrum of solutions for many\ndifferent cases, and from that spectrum, the cases that\nperform best give insight into how to improve one\xe2\x80\x99s\ndesign,\xe2\x80\x9d says Johnson. \xe2\x80\x9cCart3D\xe2\x80\x99s preeminent benefit is\nthat it\xe2\x80\x99s automated and can handle complex geometry. It\xe2\x80\x99s\n\nblazing fast. You push a button, and it takes care of the\nvolume meshing and flow measurement.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWithout building an aircraft, engineers can never be\ncompletely certain which design concept will perform\nbest in flight. However, they now have a tool to make the\nmost informed prediction possible. v\n\nCart3D streamlines the conceptual\nanalysis of complex aerospace\nvehicles like the Orion multipurpose\ncrew vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s launch abort system\nshown here.
