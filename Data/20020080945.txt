b'Light Visor\n\nS\n\nSPACE TECHNOLOGY\nCONTRIBUTES TO\nA NEW LIGHT\nTHERAPY DEVICE\n\neasonal Affective Disorder,\nor SAD, is a form of\ndepression recognized by\nthe American Psychiatric Association. Brought on by the\nreduced light and heightened\ngloom of winter, it is evidenced\nby such symptoms as depression, a nagging need for rest\neven after 10-12 hours sleep,\nweight gain, a craving for\ncarbohydrates, decreased sex\ndrive, and an inclination towara\nsocial withdrawal.\nSome 25 million Americans\nsuffer from a mild form of SAD\ncommonly dismissed as "winter\nblues." But for 10 million\nothers, it is more serious; clinical depression and other manifestations of SAD become so\nsevere that these people cannot\nfunction normally in winter.\nIn recent years, medical\nresearchers have found that this\naffliction can be successfully\ntreated with light therapy use of properly timed exposure\nto light to change the flow of\nvarious chemicals in the body\nand thus improve mood and\nperformance. NASA has\nconducted research in light\ntherapy and now employs it\nregularly as a means of helping\nastronauts adjust their internal\nrhythms during orbital flight.\nLight therapy also has potential\nfor alleviating jet lag among\nairline crews and passengers,\nfor keeping military aviators\nalert on long missions, and\nfor resolving health and performance problems associated\nwith shiftwork.\n\nHealth a n d Medlclne\n\nI\n\nDr. George C. Ulalnard,\nassociate professor of neurology at Jefferson Medical\nCollege, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, has been engaged in\nlight therapy research as a\nNASA consultant and independently as head of a Jefferson\nteam engaged in development\nand evaluation of a portable\nlight therapy device that bathes\nthe eyes with bright light\nto combat SAD. Above,\nDr. Brainard is adjusting a Light\nVisorTM, sort of topless hat\na\nfitted with small incandescent\nlights manufactured by BioBrite, Inc., Bethesda, Maryland.\nThe Light Visor allows continuous light therapy without the\ninconvenience of spending\nhours at a time before a stationary light box. The light is\nnormally battery powered, but\nthere is a plug-in option for\nhome use.\nDr. Brainard is a co-inventor\nof the head-mounted device,\n\nalong with Dr. Norman L.\nRosenthal and Dr. Thomas\nWehr, both research psychiatrists with the National Institute\nof Mental Health (NIMH). The\nf\ncommercial version o the Light\nVisor pictured is a refined, third\ngeneration device, developed in\na collaboration among BioBrite, NIMH and Jefferson\nMedical College that included\nthree years of clinical testing at\nthese and other medical institutions. Dr. Brainard continues to\nconduct research on various\naspects of light therapy, including its applicability to jet lag,\nshiftwork-related disorders and\nlighting design for spacecraft\ninteriors. a\nLight Visor is a tradetnark of BioBrite, Inc.\nTM\n\n'
