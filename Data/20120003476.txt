Within the last 15 years, self\nassembled monolayers have been investigated as a way to protect from corrosion[1,2] or\nbiofouling.[3] In this study, self assembled monolayers of decitriethoxysilane\n(C i oH2i Si(0C2H5)3) and octadecyltriethoxysilane (C 18H37 S1(0C2H5)3) were formed on aluminum\n2024-T3. The modified surfaces and bare Al 2024 were characterized by dynamic water contact\nangle measurements, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XIPS) and infrared spectroscopy.\nElectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in 0.5 M NaCl was used to characterize the\nmonolayers and evaluate their corrosion protection properties.\nThe advancing water contact angle and infrared measurements show that the mono layers form a\nsurface where the hydrocarbon chains are packed and oriented away from the surface, consistent\nwith what is found in similar systems. The contact angle hysteresis measured in these systems is\nrelatively large, perhaps indicating that the hydrocarbon chains are not as well packed as\nmonolayers formed on other substrates. The results of the EIS measurements were modeled\nusing a Randle's circuit modified by changing the capacitor to a constant phase element. The\nimpedance of a constant phase element is given by\n\n=\t\nZCPE\n\n1\t\nC(jw)\n\nWhen\n\nn = 1, the\n\nimpedance is that of an ideal capacitor. The constant phase element values were found to\ncharacterize the monolayer. The capacitance of the monolayer modified surface starts lower than\nthe bare Al 2024, but approaches values similar to the bare Al 2024 within 24 hours as the\nmonolayer is degraded. The n values found for bare Al 2024 quickly approach the value of a\ntrue capacitor and are greater than 0.9 within hours after the start of exposure. For the\nmonolayer modified structure, n can stay lower than 0.9 for a longer period of time. In fact, n for\nthe monolayer modified surfaces is different from the bare surface even after the capacitance\nvalues have converged. This indicates that the deviation from ideal capacitance is the most\nsensitive indicator of the presence of the monolayer.\n\nReferences\n1. K. Nozawa,H. Nishihara; K. Aramaki.
