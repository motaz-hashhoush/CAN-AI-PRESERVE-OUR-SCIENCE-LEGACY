Spacelab 1 is scheduled to carry equipment for upper atmosphere research and for experiments in plasma and solar physics, medicine, and thermodynamics. Spacelab 2 will provide equipment for research in astronomy, high-energy physics, astrophysics, and solar physics. Spacelab 3 will be equipped to study materials processing in space, biological tests, and cloud physics. Spacelab is modular and reusable, with the planned life equal to 50 missions. The Space Shuttle will carry a Spacelab with scientific equipment of up to 8800 kg into orbits ranging in altitude from 160 to 1100 km and transmitting data at up to 50 Mb/s. The cost of launching a Shuttle/Spacelab mission is estimated at $28 million.", "title": "Europe gets aboard the Shuttle", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-10T11:26:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19800050491, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Moye, J.
