Unfortunately, commercially available air volume control scoops are not designed for such\nselection.\nThe solution:\nA device was designed which automatically selects air\nflow coming from either of the two directions and which\ncan be adjusted to the desired air volume on either\nside.\nHow it's done:\nThe device, as shown in the figure, uses one movable\nand two fixed scoops. When the normal air flow is on,\n\nthe movable scoop directs the air to the branch duct or\nregister take-off. In the event of breakdown in the primary unit, the emergency-flow inlet will open to provide\nuninterrupted air flow. Air volume from each direction\nis controlled by fixed scoops which are adjusted by their\nadjustment rods. Once the scoops are balanced with\nadjustment rods, they do not have to be adjusted again.\nNotes:\n1. The described configuration may be used on any\nbranch duct connection and also in the supply of\nregister take-off.\n2.
