This could affect postflight visual acuity during head and body motion. The goal of this study was to characterize changes in dynamic visual acuity after long-duration spaceflight. METHODS: Dynamic Visual Acuity (DVA) data from 14 astro/cosmonauts were collected after long-duration (~6 months) spaceflight. The difference in acuity between seated and walking conditions provided a metric of change in the subjects ability to maintain gaze fixation during self-motion. In each condition, a psychophysical threshold detection algorithm was used to display Landolt ring optotypes at a size that was near each subject s acuity threshold. Verbal responses regarding the orientation of the gap were recorded as the optotypes appeared sequentially on a computer display 4 meters away. During the walking trials, subjects walked at 6.4 km/h on a motorized treadmill. RESULTS: A decrement in mean postflight DVA was found, with mean values returning to baseline within 1 week. The population mean showed a consistent improvement in DVA performance, but it was accompanied by high variability. A closer examination of the individual subject s recovery curves revealed that many did not follow a pattern of continuous improvement with each passing day. When adjusted on the basis of previous long-duration flight experience, the population mean shows a \"bounce\" in the re-adaptation curve. CONCLUSION: Gaze control during self-motion is altered following long-duration spaceflight and changes in postflight DVA performance indicate that vestibular re-adaptation may be more complex than a gradual return to normal.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20100040600, "endDate": "2011-04-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "NASA Headquarters", "location": "Washington, DC, United States"}}, "meetingId": "7d9ce50a3928466d8d18c88e2ff2b3b1", "id": "a9dcd2eab03847a6b686e25782abbeba"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "National Space Biomedical Research Inst.", "location": "Houston, TX, United States"}}, "meetingId": "7d9ce50a3928466d8d18c88e2ff2b3b1", "id": "2be6a5257ad54adc8a2a4db2b0ff7111"}], "name": "8th Symposium on the Role of the Vestibular Organs in Space Exploration", "location": "Houston, TX", "id": "7d9ce50a3928466d8d18c88e2ff2b3b1", "startDate": "2011-04-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20100040600, "id": "0f80c463075a4405bd4ecff1ffc52981", "publicationDate": "2010-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20100040600.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20100040600/downloads/20100040600.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20100040600/downloads/20100040600.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20100040600/downloads/20100040600.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
