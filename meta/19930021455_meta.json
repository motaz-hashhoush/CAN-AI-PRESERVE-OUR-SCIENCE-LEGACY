NASA personnel are determined to foster the development of small business capabilities in technical areas that will support future projects and establish a small business base for the development and production of flight hardware for future missions. The solicitation process for Federal contracts has grown quite complex over the years. Where possible, we continue to try to simplify and streamline procedures for obtaining and performing these contracts. This booklet is designed to help understand NASA solicitations, find the information needed in deciding whether to respond, and improve chances for success. The first section of this booklet will answer general questions concerning the various types of NASA solicitations. Your specific questions on how to prepare bids will be answered in the second section, which is followed by a third section on the unique features of construction contracting. A fourth section describes how to submit technical and cost proposals for the negotiated procurement process. Some tips or suggestions, called DO's and DONT's, are placed at the end of the second, third, and fourth sections. Then, in the fifth section, ways to seek business as a subcontractor are identified.", "title": "How to compete for NASA contracts", "stiType": "TECHNICAL_MEMORANDUM", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T18:13:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Technical Memorandum (TM)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19930021455, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19930021455, "id": "9dcb393a1b574d35868cfd8993a69108", "publicationDate": "1989-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19930021455.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19930021455/downloads/19930021455.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19930021455/downloads/19930021455.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19930021455/downloads/19930021455.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
