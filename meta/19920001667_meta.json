Several examples of cratering events are known including family numbers 150, 162, 169, and 189. These are recognizable as many small fragments adjacent to and to one side (in three dimensions) of a much larger cratered body. Family numbers 138 and 140 are adjacent in proper element space. In population they are an intermediate step between the long recognizable families and the more frequent less populated families. Family number 164 is the fifth most populous family in the belt. All members are faint and nothing is known of the physical properties.", "title": "Asteroid families", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T17:18:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19920001667, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Williams, James G."}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Pasadena, CA, United States"}}, "id": "84ab871c66644ddab41176ad5fb25591"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19920001667, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19920001667, "id": "efa26df92a6d478a8526e4be113f70f2", "publicationName": "NASA, Washington, Reports of Planetary Geology and Geophysics Program, 1990", "publicationDate": "1991-06-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19920001667.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19920001667/downloads/19920001667.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19920001667/downloads/19920001667.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19920001667/downloads/19920001667.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
