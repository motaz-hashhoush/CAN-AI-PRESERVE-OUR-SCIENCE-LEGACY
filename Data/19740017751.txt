THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN\n\n104600-12-L\n\nSkylab Support\nProgress Report, March 1974\n\nThe following report serves to report progress for March 1974 on\nSubcontract #1 of contract NAS9-13332. The financial reports for\nthis contract are being submitted under separate cover.\nThe objective of this subcontract is to support the Skylab\nEREP effort of Michigan State University by: 1) performing standard\nrecognition processing and producing recognition maps and area counts,\n2) assisting in the analysis and interpretation of the recognition\nmaps and other extracted information, 3) further developing and\nadapting, for use on Skylab EREP dat.a, methods for estimating proportions\nof unresolved objects, and 4) applying proportion estimation techniques\nto one frame of EREP data to determine to what extent the accuracy\nof crop acreage estimates is improved.\nDuring this report period no technical progress has been made due to\nunexpected and unforeseen delays in the availability of EREP/S-192 digital\ndata. There has been an indication that the NASA personnel may have some\ndifficulty in responding to the S-192 CCT specifications that we provided\nduring the last month and still producing a quality product. We\nrecommend that you contact your technical monitor and have him modify the\nspecifications for SDO\'s to read "1 thru 14 and 17 thru 22". We are told\nthat a better quality product will result with this specification.\nDue to the expected lengthy delay in the receipt of S-192 CCT\'s, there\nis a need to conserve project funds. As a result project activity is now\nat a low level and is expected to continue at a low level for the next\nseveral months;\nPrepared by:\n\n~\n\n,\n\n4\n\nRichard F.
