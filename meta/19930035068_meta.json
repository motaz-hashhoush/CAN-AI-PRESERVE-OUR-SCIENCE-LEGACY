The offices and networks of the communication system include the Office of Space Science and Applications (OSSA), which manages all NASA missions, and the Office of Space Operations, which furnishes communication support through the NASCOM, the mission critical communications support network, and the Program Support Communications network. The NASA Science Internet was established by OSSA to centrally manage, develop, and operate an integrated computer network service dedicated to NASA's space science and application research. Planned for the future is the National Research and Education Network, which will provide communications infrastructure to enhance science resources at a national level.", "title": "Overview of NASA communications infrastructure", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-15T23:50:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19930035068, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Arnold, Ray J."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Headquarters", "location": "Washington, DC United States"}}, "id": "ba386f5c602a4548850b8bbe5fbfca7d"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19930035068, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Fuechsel, Charles"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Headquarters", "location": "Washington, DC United States"}}, "id": "d22ae934f56945dfa9c75fb136babb38"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19930035068, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19930035068, "publisher": "American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "id": "4026aa2efe1c4644bc4961b4fcbbc421", "publicationName": "In: AIAA(NASA International Symposium on Space Information Systems, 2nd, Pasadena, CA, Sept. 17-19, 1990, Proceedings.
