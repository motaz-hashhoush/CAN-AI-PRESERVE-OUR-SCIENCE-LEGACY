Several notable features can be seen in the binned distribution as a function of time. An apparent decrease in the number of meteorite reports in the 18th century is observed. An excess of observed meteorite falls in the period from 1840 to 1880 seems to correspond to a similar excess in European data. A chi sq probability test suggest that the association between the two data sets are real. Records of human casualities and structural damage resulting from meteorite falls are also given. A calculation based on the number of casualty events in the Chinese meteorite records suggests that the probability of a meteroite striking a human is far greater than previous estimates. However, it is difficult to verify the accuracy of the reported casualty events.", "title": "Meteorite falls in China and some related human casualty events", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-16T22:05:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19950035640, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Yau, Kevin"}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA", "location": "United States"}}, "id": "a1227b35dad94f0082b2e638d0eb0737"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19950035640, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Weissman, Paul"}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA", "location": "United States"}}, "id": "df5d7d2eeea346ecb21ebdae52928ac5"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19950035640, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Yeomans, Donald"}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA", "location": "United States"}}, "id": "cfc681cd4b624fd5b76a94dabc9771e4"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19950035640, "publications": [{"volume": "29", "submissionId": 19950035640, "issue": "6", "issn": "0026-1114", "id": "a7237af0d80e46139929581a8ad8e8aa", "publicationName": "Meteoritics", "publicationDate": "1994-11-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
