Stanford Research Institute\n(SRI) for initial use at NASA\'s Ames Research.Center. \t The objective of\nthe study has been to ascertain the commercialization potential- of a\nsimplified,: less expensive 3-D eyetracker. !\tPrimary focus on present and\n\n#\n\npotential users of eyetrackers, as well as present and potential manufacturers has provided an effective means of analyzing the prospects\nfor commercialization.\n\n1.2\t\n\nBackground\n\nThe steady growth of scientific interest in the relationship of\neye;;movements to various aspects of human performance, has led to an\nincreased need for instrumentation capable of documenting\' \xe2\x80\xa2 these relationships.\t\n\nSeveral organizations have competitive eye movement monitoring\n\ninstruments on the market which vary with respect to technical specifications, subject involvement, operator training, form of output, and\ncost,\n\nProviding an alternative for eye movement researchers over the\npast\t few\t years\t has been an eyetracker developed at SRI, which is\nregarded as being the most accurate yet available., \t\n\nThe most recent\n\nversion of the SRI eyetrackeris a 3-D eyetracker which not only\nmeasures the movement of both eyes simultaneously, but also provides\nfor concurrent measurement of the state of accomodation (focus), of\nboth eyes using an optometer previously developed at SRI. \t\n\nAnother\n\nimportant distinction is that their instrument does not require contact with the eyes in orde r to achieve the specified accuracy.\t\n\nL\n\nMany.\n\nprofessionals in the field recognize that this particular; combination\nof features provides an important tool for the future continued study\nof eye movements in a variety of applications.\n\n11T\nIIT\t\n\nRESEARCH\t\n\nINSTITUTF\n\n-^\n\nA proposal\t has been submitted to NASA by SRI which defines development of simplified, cost-reduced version of the 3-D-eyetracker. \t\n\nThe\n4\n\nY\n\nobjective would be to thereby offer an eyetracker with optometer which\nwould still\t have many competitive technical advantages\', but which also\nwould be more cost competitive.\' \t\n\na,\n\nIt is perceived that such a unit would\n\nbe accepted over a broader base of applications, including various\n\n1\n\'J\n\nclinical\t areas, where simplified, efficient techniques at\'a reasonable\ncost are prime considerations.\t\n\nThe scope of this study is to consider\n\nthe potential of this proposed version of the SRI 3-D eyetracker in\nlight of its capabilities and the nature of the market place which it\nwould serve.\n\n1.3\t\n\n\'\n\n= \'Patent\t Status:..,.\n\nThe development efforts encompassing the eyetracker at Stanford\nled to several\t items which have been patented, or are being reviewed\nfor\t p\t atents.\t\n\nSome of these patents\np\t\n\n\t been assigned. to NASA, while\n\'g\n\nothers whose status is currently pending may be jointly assigned to\nNASA and Stanford.\t\n\nThe 3-D eyetracker has been described in the liter\n\nattire and several publications document its capabilities.\n\n.i\n\ni\nr\n\n1\n\nh\n\ni\n\n9\n\n$\t\n\n1\nIIT\t\n\nRESEARCH\t\n\nINSTITUTE\n\n2\n\ni\n\ni\n\n2.\t\n\nAPPLICATION AREAS\nThe study of eye movements is found to be applicable to a broad\n\n_ spectrum of areas where the levels of-human performance in response to\nvisual input is important. The following is a listing of general cate\n\n-\n\ngories where eye movement studies would be facilitated by a simplified\n\n3-D eyetracker.\n\nr\n\nBasic Medical Research\nrj Applied (Diagnostic) Medical\' Research\n\n9^ Reading\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Aviation\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Highway.Safety/Driving\n\nEach area has distinct requirements in terms of the accuracy of the\n(\t\n\nmeasurements of eye motion, the freedom permitted the subject, and the\nform of the output which best serves the purposes of the research\n\n`activity. As a result various eye movement measuring devices have been\ndeveloped and most are commercially available to serve the needs of each \t\n\n)\n\niparticular market area.\n\nThe Stanford 3-D eyetracker also has features which orient its\napplicability to certain types of eye movement study. Recognized as\n`\t\n\none of the most accurate non-contact devices in use, the SRI unit provides an attractive alternative to commercially available instruments.\n\nThis isparticularly true_in the medical area where fine movements\nY\n\nin the eye require high resolution and accuracy in order to obtain \t\nsi g nificant data. Some distinction should be made between medical\nresearch and applied clinical diagnosis, The former must preceed the\nlatter in order for substantia_1_data to be accumulated so that diagnostic\nprinciples and procedures can be defined for use by neurologists, ophthalmologists and related professional disciplines in clinical applications.\n\nThe other application areas listed above are considered to hold\nopportunities for an eye movement instrument such as that proposed by\nIIT RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n3\t\n\n-\t\n\n_\n\n.\n\nk\n\ni\n\nr\n\nStanford.\t\n\nPresent competitive units have greater penetration in these\n\n^#\n\nareas than in the medical, but if accuracy and cost are competitive,\nthe simplified SRI 3-D eyetracker can be effectively positioned to\nattract users of\t competitive equipment as well as*first-time pur^hasers.\nThe accomodation feature is an important attribute which may be a de^\n\nciding factor in purchase considerations in some select areas.\ni\n\ni;\n\nI\n\n(t\n\nl\n\ni\n\nJj\n\ns\n\nIIT\t RESEARCH\t\n\nINS?ITUTF\n\n4,\n\n3.\t\n\nTECHNO /ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT\nThe present SRI 3\'D eyetracker has offered unique capabilities to the\n\nresearch community because of accuracy- and resolutionas well as simultaneous accomodation measurement..\t\n\nThis has - been accomplished through the\n\ntechnique of monitoring two images reflected from the eye. \t\n\nThe first\n\nPurKinje image is reflected at the front surface of the cornea, while the\nfourth PurKinje image is simultaneously reflected from the rear surface\nof the eye lens.\t\n\nI\n\nEach image is -monitored by discrete tracking mechanisms.\nb\n\n-\n\nThe monitoring of focus\n\n1\n\nor depth of field accomodation (by using an\n\ninfrared optometer) provides an indication, when coupled with the two\nPurKinje image trackers, of the location of the point in space at which\nthe eyes are; fixating. \t\n\nThe-complexity. of the optics. and the electronics\n\n\'\t\nused to monitor the fourth PurKinje image contributes substantially to\n9\nthe cost of the 3-D eyetracker, priced in the range of $40,000. \t\n\nThough\n;\n\nthe accuracy and flexibilitY of the SRI eyetracker are attractive and\nserve a need in research, the expense is often difficult to justify.\n(Present purchases are at the rate of approximately one per month).\n\nIt is for this reason that\t the\t concept has\t been\t proposed fora\n3-D eyetracker which has a reduced cost of $15-20,000, achieved by\n\'\n\neliminating the fourth PurKinje image \t ,monitoring mechanism.\t\noff which results is.on.the basis of cost versus accuracy.\t\n\nThe trade-\n\nr\n\nReduction\n\nof the double PurKinje image device to one which relys on the single\ncornea) reflected image has the effect of reducing the,accuracy to a\nlevel obtainable by a few other competitive.instruments.\t\n\nThe combina-\n\nton of`-competitive technical specifications \t (plus the added feature\'\n\n\'\n\nof accomodation measurement) and a\'competitive price would provide a\nbasis for significant market acceptance both in present research\noriented programs as well as possible future clinical applications.\nThe added feature of accomodation measurement is a differentiating\nproduct feature which can uniquely address the needs of segments of the\nresearch community at the present time and the clinical community in\nthe future.\n\n11T\t RESEARCH\t\n\nt\t\n\n\'\n\n-\t\n\n5\n\nINSTITUTE\n\n#\n\n\t\nr\n\n^-\t\n\n4.\t\n\nNATURE OF THE MARKET\t\n\n{\xc2\xb0:\n\nAs the market exists today, the primary users are in the field of\nresearch, and have advanced degrees in disciplines such as neurology,\nophthalmology, psychology, physiology various combinations of these,\nas well as various specialties in engineering (e. g., biomedica 1 , electri ^\t\n\n1\n\ncal). Each individual researcher or groups of researchers establishes\nhis eyetracker needs in conjunction with the project(s) budget(s). -Both\nindependent projects as well as those tied to government grants (e.g., NIH)\nI\nare undertaken, and consequently cost constraints may vary widely from\none project to another depending on the _resources of the research groups\n\nas well as that of any sponsoring institutions. This has implications\n\n;.\t\n\nfor the rate of advancement of the study of eye movements when demand\nfor instrumentation is limited to some extent by the funding available\nfor research.\n\nAside from cost, selection of a particular device is determined on\nthe basis of the technique used to determine movement, the accuracy\ndesired, the mobility of the instrument and/or the patient required,\nthe form of output obtainable. Refer to the Appendix, Exhibit 1 for\n\nF\n\na comparative presentation of the various eye movement measuring instruments.\n\n1\t\n\nRegulations governing instrumentation related to eye movement\nmeasurement are of significance where intimate _contact is required\nwith the eye or the head. Contact lens techniques or Electro-Oculographic\n(EOG) methods using electrodes are of a nature which would require satis-\n\nfactory compliance with federal safety regulations. The remaining eye\nmovement instruments are of a nature which does not require similar\ncontact other than to provide means for supporting the head during testing\n(e.g., \'a headrest or bite board)\'. The SRI 3-D-eyetracker"would fall in\n1\n\nthe latter category. Medical device regulations as established by FDA\n\nwould never-the-less be a concern to any manufacturer ofsuch instrumentation,\nwhether of a-contacting or non-contacting type.\n\n4 l\t\n\nriT RESEARCH INS T\n\nITUTG\n\nf\t\n\n6\t\n\nti\n\nr.\n,:\n\nr\n\n_\t\n\nThe niture of the research market is such that there is tolerance,\nby those involved in the work of\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nthe considerable length of time devoted to setup and\ncalibration\n\nI\n9 ;the large amount of subject influence\n\nt\t l\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nthe large amount of operator expertise required\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t the form of output which may require additional time\nI `\tand effort to evaluate.\n\nThe fact remains however that researchers would welcome any versions of\ninstruments which would permit a greater number of tests to be administered\nin the course of their work,-and would permit a-more easily managed form\nof\'out p\tut.\t\n\nThe primary tradeoff which \t\np\t\ny\'\t\n\nusually mu s t be made is whether\ny\t\nt\n\nefficiency and ease of use justify a degradation in accuracy. \t Some\nstudies may permit such ?\xc2\xad\ntradeoff others may not.\t\n\nWhat is certain is\n\nthat.any attempt to use the same procedures and instruments (having\ncharacteristics ,listed above) under greater constraints of time, less\ncontrolled environments, wiith less knowledgeable patients and operators,\nas occurs in a clinical situation, would not be successful. \t\n\nIf these\n\nconstraints can be satisfied, and provision made for options \t (e.g.,, a\n\nF.\n;C,\n\nr\n\naccomodation and possibly pupil diameter measurement : ) at a total price\ncompetitive with other units, then a very effective tool can be marketed\n\n-\n\nto meet research needs today and clinical needs\'in the future.\n\nE^\n\nDistribution and .\'promotion occurs thru the channels established\n\nfor medical research equipment.\t\n\nThe promotional activities could be\n\nfurther expanded to include the clinical medical community and all\n\n4\n\n1\nJ\n\nassociated publications and professional seminars and conferences, partitularly in the area of neurology, ophthalmology and psychology. \t\n\nThis\n\ni s a normal \'process as data is accumulated and specific findings are\nreported.\t\n\nIt is also important to maintain contact with the colleges\n\nand universities so tha,^.future specialists can be made aware at an\n\nearly stage as to the practical_ utility of the eyetracking instrumentation..;\n\n!IT\t\n\nr,,.^_, _,..+-\xe2\x80\x9ex!+,^\n\nESEAPCH\t iNSTITUTi\n\n,^\xe2\x80\xa2rY.\xe2\x80\x94_:_\n\n3\n\nFunding of eye movement research currently comes from a wide variety\nof sources, depending on\t the specific nature and application potential\nof the research.\t\n\nThe majority of these sources or sponsors are from\n\nvarious government agencies whose charter encompasses the financial support and encouragement of eye movement studies.\t\n\nThe following list is\n\nrepresentative of the majority of funding sources.\n\n_National\t Institutes of Health (DREW)\no;\t\n\nNational\t Institute of Mental\t Health\nNational\t Institute for Occupational Safety and Health\nNational\t Institute for Drug Abuse and Alcoholism\n\na\n\nU.S. Air Force (Air Force Office of Scientific Research)\n\no\t\n\nU.S. Army\n\no\t\n\nU.S. Navy\n\ny\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 NASA\n\na\n\nI^\ni\n\no_\n\nkJ\nIIT\t\n\nRESEARCH \t\n\nINSTITUTE\n\n8\ns\n\nt\n\n5.\t\n\nCOMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT\n\nThe measurement of eye movements can be accomplished thru several\nmethods, each of which concentrates on the different characteristics of\nthe eye which serve as indicators of motion. The methods presented in\nExhibit l of the Appendix have each warranted development and commercial\nintroduction by various organizations. The product characteristics\nrepresenting each method serve the needs of particular segments or groups\nof segments in the market place;. At the present time the SRI 3-D eyetracker represents the only instrument which utilizes the\'double PurKinje\nimages of the eye for measurement of eye movement, and also provides for\nmeasurement of-accomodation.\n\nThe proposed simplified version of the SRI-unit would be capable of\ncompe tin g\n\nmore effectivel y with other i\n\nnstruments already on the market,\n\nincluding other SRI versions, because it may have price advantages while\n\noffering, added measurement capability.

monitoring instruments can be applied to various segments in\nthe research market or to certain segments in industry or -the medical\ncommunity.\t\n\nThe relative importance of these market segments both today\n\nand in the future is presented in light of the proposed Stanford 3-D\neyetracker.\n\nThe present market for eye movement measuring instruments is almost\nentirely composed of users in various programs of eye movement research\nV\n\neither public, private, or no\'t-for-profit.\t\n\nThe nature of these markets\n\nwas described briefly in Section 2 of this report.\t\n`\n\nThe size of the entire\n\nresearch market for eyetracking instruments is greater than has as yet\nbeen penetrated.\t\n\nA primary reason is the expense of the instrumentation.\n\nAlso the field of eye movement research is still growing which increases\n\n\'\n\nthe demand for advancements in pertinent research tools.\n\nThe interest in eye movement research is based on the perception by\n\nr\n\nspecialists in a variety of fields that the study of the eyes, and in\nparticular eye movements, will permit the understanding, diagnosis, and\ntreatment of several human functions and dysfunctions which have hereto=..\n\n;\n4\n\nfore.been either undefinable or unquantifiable. \t\n\nBased on the specific\n\nprojections \'in certain areas of the medical field such as neurology,\npsychology or ophthalmology, there are indications thatcertain disorders\nand anomalies may be diagnosed by observation of eye movements. \t\n\nAs the\n\ndata accumulates to substantiate these projections, the clinical use of\neye movement instrumentation will become a more quantifiable entity.-\n\nAt the present time it can only be suggested that the potential exists\nfor a`significant- future clinical utilization of this type of instrumen-\n\n`\n\ntation in the specialized areas mentioned above.\n\nThe area of basic eye movement research encompasses studies of\nthe following representative conditions:\nf)\t\n\npursuit and saccadic eye movements.\'\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nhystagmus\n\nr\'\n\nIIT\t RES[ARCH\t INSTITUTE\n\ns\n\n.J\n\n12\n\n\'\n\n~\n^\t\n\n|\n\n`\n\na\t\n\nsize and form

or\noptometry are typical users of eye monitoring instrumentation for this\npurpose.\t There are those in various other disciplines who also conduct\neye movement research in these areas.\nRelated to these efforts in a more applied sense are studies of\nhuman\t performance as\t determined by environment:\n\ne\t\n\n0\t\n\n*\t\n\nstress vs. workload\nnight vision\nman-machine interface\nindustrial\t inspection\nfatigue\'\nanxiety\nradiographic techniques\n\nhas\' drawn researchers from a\nbroad range of disciplines.\t These would include psychologists, physiologists; human performance experts,\t industrial engineers, aerospace\nengineers in addition to neurologists and ophthalmol: ogists.\t There are\nuniversity, government and commercial programs that\'engage in the studies.\nEach may lead to advancements in theway we develop technology toward\nimproving human performance and productivity.\t A simplified 3 -D eyetracker\nwould, aid in accelerating progress in these areas.\nThe nature of these particular activities\n\nThe area of medical diagnosis is related to that-mentioned above.\n\nL\t\n\nHowever, there is a distinction in that diagnostic research in neurology,\nt\t\n_J\t\n\nphysiology, ophthalmology, and psychology is aimed at utilizing,eye\nmovements as indicators of other bodily disorders. \t\n\nAn example is -pre-\n\nsented in the Appendix, Exhibit 3 from the field of neurology where\nspecific disorders are indicated as being linked to and diagonsable by\nmovements of the eyes.\t\n\nThere are also active programs involved in diag-\n\nnosing the effects of alcohol and drugs by means of eye movement measurements.\t\n\n4\t\n\nAgain\n\nas in\n\nthe case of general eye research the medical centers\n\nand universities are primary users of eyetracking instruments for this\n\n`\t\n\n--\t\n\npurpose.\t\n\nThe potential exists for the simplified eyetracker to find\n\nfuture demand\' linked to practicing neurologists and possibly ophthalmologists\ne,\t\n\nin either medical center referral locations or in individual private practice.\n\nI\t\n\n!\t\n\nThe above areas related to medical research and diagnosis constitute\n\nthe primary market segment for a simplified 3-D eyetracker.\t\n\nAn indica-\n\ntion is that there are over 150 individuals conducting research in eye\nmovements from the perspective described in preceding paragraphs. \t\n\n^\n\no\t\n\na 9\t\n\nP\n\n\t\n\nthese individuals are interested in the advant ges of a simplified 3-D\n\neyetracker and would be potential purchasers. \t\n\na\n\nMany\n\nStill others not involved\n\nma\ty\t be attracted b\tY\t the .cost/performance of the e ye tracker.\t\nY\t\n\nIn the. lon g\ng\n\nrun practicing neurologists and ophthalmologists in medical centers\n\ns rvi_ng as referral locations can be considered potential users of eyetracking instrumentation.\t\n\nThis can be estimated at about 163 based on\n\nthe number of residency programs in ophthalmology, and 112 based on\nthe number of residency programs in neurology. \t\n\nBeyond this some penetra-\n\ntion of individual practitioners can occur but the major demand in this\nallea would not be realized until \t graduates begin purchasing instruments.\n\n(.\t\n\nAt.the present time there are approximately 8,000 ophthalmologists and\n2;000 neurologists practicing in the United States._\t\n_\t\n\nr\t\n\nThe market demand\n\nin this latter area would not be significant for 5-10 years or until\nsubstantial data dnd clinical procedures have been established.\n\nr\t\n\n.\n-

POTENTIAL\n\nThe commercialization of a simplified 3-D eyetracker is most critically\ndependent on the advancements and commensurate needs of the,eye movement\nresearch community, whether in the public, private, or not-for-profit\nsectors,\t on a contract basis or in independent studies. \t\n\nAs interest and\n\nactivity increases in this field the need for efficient, accurate, reaIn many areas of research\n\nsonably prised instrumentation will \t increase.\t\n\nE\n\n^{\n\nthe ability. to measure accomodation in-conjunction with vertical and\nhorizontal\t eye position will be a serious purchase consideration. \t\n\nThe\n\nSRI unit would offer significant opportunity by researchers to purchase\nan accurate, flexible instrument at a price comparable to other available\ninstruments.\t\n\nThus the simplified 3-D eyetracker would be an important\n\ncomplementary product to the more complex double PurKinje image 3-D\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nt\t\n\nn\n\neyetracker presently being used.\n\nThe transition to clinical diagnostic applications requires the\nfirm establishment of a reliable data base which will establish the\nutility of the 3-D eyetracker to practitioners. \t\n\nWhat is generally\n\nbelieved is that initial clinical usage would be found at referral\ndi c\ncenters at mayor hospitalsa\t and clinics or mayor meal centers affiliated with universities. \t\n\nOnly after this stage, where the instrument\n\nhas established its worth in a diagnostic environment, can individual\npractitioners be expected to express interest to the point of willingness to purchase.\t\n\nWhat must initially be established is that the\n\ndiagnostic process can be aided by an eyetracking instrument in various\n\nfields.\t\neasy\t to\n\nThen it must also be shown to be efficient and sufficiently\nperate\noP\n\nand interact with to be of practical value in a profes-\'\'\n\nsional medical practice environment. - Cost is measured not only in terms\n\nof dollars, but also in terms of time, -operator training, patient involvement, instrument calibration and maintenance.\t\n\n\xe2\x96\xba\':\n\nThe objective of any\n\nl\n\ncommercial venture in thisfield should be to minimize all of the above.\n\n1\'1T\t\n\nRESEARCH \t\n\nINSTiVU1\'r,\n\nf\n\nF .. I\n\n17\n\t\nk\n\nAt each stage of the introduction process, promotional considerations\nwould be oriented toward literature and pertinent copference vehicles.\nThis would generate interest and constructive criticism in addition to\neducating practitioners and increasing their awareness of the utility\nof monitoring eye movements thru instrumentation such as the 3-D eyetracker.\t\n\nEducation and information programs should also be conducted\n\nand encouraged in the various neurology and ophthalmology residency\nri_\n\nprograms as well as the major_ psychology and physiology education centers.\nThis is where future researchers and practitioners will be emerging from\n\nI\n\nand thus forms an important means of creating familiarity with the practical aspects of monitoring eye movements.\nI\nThe commercialization process described here is confirmed by opthal-\n\n\'\n\nmic goods manufacturers.\t\n\nThere is concern based on limited potential\n\nmarket sizes in the research area coupled with the uncertainty of clincial\n\ndiagnostic acceptance without a substantial data base. There is recognition, however, that the capabilities of the SRI 3-D eyetracker warrant\nserious consideration as a new product prospect.\t\n\nReduction of costs thru\n\nuse of advanced electronics (e.g., microprocessors) and production design\nevaluation would do much to increase the commercial viability of the 3-D\n\',\n\n1\n\neyetracker.\n\n.,a\n\nF\n\ni\nI\n\nIn an effort to ,assure proper positioning of the 3-D eyetracker^\n\nin the market in terms of product characteristics and price, it is\nrecommended that a formal survey be conducted of scientists engaged in\neye movement studies.\t\n\ni\n\nTheir comments and perceptions would be\n\nbeneficial in commercialization of the instrument by creating awareness\nand stimulating interest among those professionals most influential \t in\n,\'a king a purchase decision.\t\n\nThe "Interdisciplinary Directory of Sci-\n\nentists Engaged in the Study of Eye Movements" compiled by Dr. Richard\nMorty_and B.\t Diane Eberly at U.S. Army Human Engineering Laboratory,\n_\n\nAberdeen Proving\'\' Ground, Maryland provides an excellent basis for a\nproduct survey in eye movement research and application.\n\n111 -RESEARCH \t\n\nINSTITUTE\n18\n\n8.\t\n\nI\n\nINTERESTED PARTIES\n\nThe following people have specifically requested to be informed on\n\nr\n\nfuture developments of the 3-D eyetracker:\n1\n\nDr. Robert Henderson\nDe p artme nt\n\nTrans portation\nP\n\n4Jashington,oD,C\n202/75.5-8753\n\nY\n\nDr. Robert Hennessy\n932 N.

A television camera views one eye of the subject , which is i\' luminated by a near\ninfrared completely invisible illuminator. The resulting picture of the\neye is displayed on a 5" TV monitor. A second camera views the scene presented to the subject.\nThe system uses a sensitive silicon matrix tube television camera,\nwhich functions at very low illumination, to view the eve. The Illuminator\ndoes not annoy or distract the subject. In the Remote System; the illumination is coaxial with the camera and produces an image of a backlighted\nbright rather than dark pupil.\nJ\nt\n\nScreen,Video Monitor or\nother presentation\n\n1\t\n\n_\t\n}\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nVideo Tape\nRecorder\n(Optional)\n\nTV Camera viewing scene\t\nbeing observed- by subject\t\n\nTV Camera\t\nviewing eye\t\n\nCrosshairs or Spot\nMarker indicating\neye position\n\xe2\x80\x94\t\n\nf\t\n\nSubject\n\ni\n\nTV Monitor\nshowing scene\n\nControl a: Computation\nUnit\nTV Monitor\nshowing eye\nPupil\t\nHor Vert\t\nDiameters\t\nEye Position\n\nf\n\n1\n\nAnalog and Digital Form\nI\nsi\n\nTo Recorders or Computers\nI\n\nEye View Monitor System Configuration\n\n-A-_10\n\n1\n\n1,ke;\ni\n\n7\n\n1\n\nJ\n\n7\n\nPRINCIPLE OF OPERATION\nThe subject\'s eye rotation (as opposed to translation resulting from\nhead motion) and consequently his point of fixation is doterlincd by the\nmeasurement of the center of the pupil with respect to the center of the\ncorneal reflection. The two features of the eye move together with head\nmotion, but move differentially with eye rotation, hence the difference in\ntheir positions is indicative of the eye\'s point of fixation. In this way,\neye position is independent of head position as long as the pupil image is\ncontained within the field of vie ,.,: of the camera. This allows the system\nto tolerate small head motion, talking, etc, and continue the measurement\nwithout the necessity of recalibration. Without such a capability, an\neyeball translation of the 0.1 rmi, resulting from head motion or eyeball\nmotion within the socket, would falsely indicate eye rotation of about 1\xc2\xb0.\nThe position information is presented to the operator as a spot\nsuperimposed on a 9" television monitor image of the scene being viewed by\nthe subject. The operator can control the position of the spot on the\nmonitor. By asking the subject to move his eye horizontally and vertically,\nthe operator can also adjust the gain by viewing the motion of the spot on\nthe Scene Monitor. Once this is done the computed eye position is calibrated\nand may be recorded.\n\nSPECIAL RECOGNITION CIRCUIT\nA Special Recognition Circuit detects the pupil and the corneal reflection\nfrom the video signal. The horizontal scan lines which intersect them are\nselected to the exclusion of scan lines which intersect the eyelids, eyelashes,\nor other noise. This Recognition Circuit allows operation for a broad range\nof subiects and under varying conditions with minimum operator adjustments.\nIt superimposes Delimiters and other indicators on the eye TV image to show\nthe operator that the measurement is correct without any possible doubt.\n\n7\nt\n\n,\n\nq\n\ni\nl\n\nAdoptable\n\n\t\n\nAcceptable\n\nUnacceptable\n\nOperator indicators superimposed on TV image of eye as a\nfunction of threshold setting showing status of measurement.\n:lcasurement is good when pupil is properly delimited.\n\nt\nA\n\nP\n\nILL\t\n\n\' .\n\n.. .:..\n\n..\n\n..\n\n.......\n\n..\n\n.\n\nv_-^e!\n. \xe2\x80\xa2\n\n_\n\nr.. rv: ^ ,^\n\nI\n}\na\t\n\n;^\nOUTPUTS\n\nJ\n\nThe output is available in\ndigital, analog, and visual forms\nfor recording on strip chart recorders, X-Y recorders, storage\noscilloscopes, digital tape or directly into a digital computer.\nThis data can be processed at the\ntime of the experiment or recorded\nfor later analysis by computer.\nAlso provided, is a monitor showing the scene being viewed by the\nsubject, and superimposed on this,\nis a spot or crosshairs indicating\nthe point of gaze of the subject\nin real time; see monitor photographs.

(For Z axis tracking see below.)\nThe mirror is controlled by a head motion detector and tracking system which is integrated with and receives its control signals\nfrom the Eye View .Monitor and Processor. The position of the head\nis determined, and when it approaches the edge of the visual field\nof the eye camera, the tracking mirror is commanded to reposition it\nto the center of the field in one or both axes as necessary.\nIf the head should jerk quickly and cause the eye to escape out\nof the field of view, special circuits will cause the mirror to reacquire the eye in most cases.\nThe operator observes the subject\'s eye in the pupil monitor\nand in a wide angle view locating monitor. Ile uses this second\nmonitor display, which shows a portion of the subject\'s face, to\nassist in setup positioning and in reacquisition, if the eye becomes\nlost. He accomplishes this positioning with remote pushbuttons or\na joystick.\n}\t\n\nAcquisition of the eye is automatic as soon as . a sufficient\nportion of it is visible to the Eye Camera.\n\n1\t\nJ\t\n\nThe Manual !lead Tracking Mirror gives the operator the joystick\ntracking capability without the automatic acquisition. This is often\nquite acceptable in most applications.\n\nJ\t\n\nThe tracking range of the system is dependent on the distance\nbetween the camera and the eye. System accuracy is unaffected by\nmirror tracking in the range of 4 square inches at a subject distance of 20 inches; and 6 square inches at a subject distance of 30\ninches.

For example, try reading a portion of this\ntext without moving your eyes. That is, keep your eye fixed on one letter and\nthen try to read adjacent letters and words. You will notice two things. First,\nthe area of best vision (foveal vision) is very small - you will probably feel\nthe need to move your eye, just to see the letter irinediately adjacent to the\nparticular letter onto which you are trying to keep your eye fixed. Second, the\nimpulse to move your eye, to see adjacent letters, is almost irresistible.\n\n-\t\n\nthe largely subconscious angular movement of our eyes reveals what it is that we\nare attending to - how we are absorbing visual information fro^ our environment.\nIt is, after all, a matter of common experience that our eyes not only let us\nsee out, but allow others to "see" into us.\nThe Remote Oculometer\n\nI]\nJ1\n\nBy looking at another person\'s eyes, you can tell where he is looking. An electro-\xe2\x80\xa2\noptical device, called an Oculometer, can now do this automatically - generating a\ncontinuous measure of the x-y coordinates of a subject\'s instantanequs point of\n:ixation, together with a continuous measure of his pupil diameter.\n\nJ^\nJ^\n\nNASA scien;ists have installed a Remote Oculometer in the cockpit of an aircraft\nThe output signals from the Oculometer define the coordinates, on\nsimulator.\t\nthe instrument panel, of the pilot\'s point of fixation at any instant. From the\n\nThe Oculometer, developed by Honeywell Radiation Center for the USAF Aerospace\nMedical Research Laboratory, is remote from the subject (several feet away, or\nmore). Eye direction is measured whenever the eye is within a designated cubic\nT oot volume of space. This cubic foot of "eye space" coverage of the Remote\nOculometer is sufficient so that, in many applications, the subject is free to\nmove in a completely normal fashion. The subject may not, necessarily, even be\naware that his eye direction is being measured. The fact that the Remote Oculometer does not interfere with the normal activities of the subject rakes it particularly useful for human factors research - for example, the flight research\nnow being performed by NASA at their Langley Research Center.\n\n1 "Remote Measurement of Eye Direction Allowing Subject ;Motion Over one Cubic-Foot\nof Space," John Merchant, Richard Morrissette, James L.

Pilot fixation data is useful\nbecause it indicates, as no other data can, how the pilot is absorbing information from his flight instruments. Flying can be thcught of as a multi-degreeof-freedoT manual control task. The pilot must control the angular attitude\n(elevation, roll, and yaw), the velocity (horizontal speed and heading, and vertical velocity) and, of course, the altitude of his aircraft.\nDuring an approach and landing most, if not all, of these flight parameters are\nchanging and each one must be promptly and accurately corrected. In bad weather\nthe pilot must rely, completely, on his flight instruments for information on the\ncurrent value of these flight parameters. This requires a constant, rapid, and\nsystematic fixation scan by the pilot over his primary flight instruments.\nBy recording and analyzing pilot eye fixation data, NASA hopes to be able to\nanswer questions such as:\no How should the primary instruments be arranged on the panel\nin front of the pilot? Are there better ways (then conventional dials) of displaying the flight data?\no flow should the pilot divide his attention between the various\ninstruments? Is there a preferred fixation scan pattern over\nthe flight instruments?\no\t\n\nCan the stress on the pilot be estimated from measurements of\nhis fixation behavior and/or pupil diameter changes?\n\nIn the rear future, NASA plans to install an Oculometer in an aircraft to record\nthe pilot\'s through-the-window fixations in actual flight. In this case, the\nOculometer data will show what elements of real-world detail the pilot uses\nunder VFR conditions. This will help NASA optimize the design of the visual\nout-of-the-vindcw display for their flight simulator.\nHow The Oculometer Works\nIf you shine a flashlight at someone\'s eye, and ask them to rotate their eye\n(that is, to change their point of fixation) you will see a movement in the eye.\nBecause the eyeball is quite small (about one inch in diameter) the amount of\nsuch eye movement, per degree of eye rotation, is very small. Even more of a\nproblem is the fact that a similar movement of the eye occurs whenever the head\nis translated. How is an electro-optical eye tracker to sense the small movements of the eye due to eye rotation, and then distinguish them from the generally much larger, but similar, movements of the eye caused by head displacement?\nA- 31\n\n\t\n\n\'\n\nIn\n\nj\t\n\nJ\t\nj\t\n\nsore eye - tracking devices this problem is (often only partially) solved by\nclamping the tracker to the subject\'s head. In the Oculometer the problem is\novercome by tracking two elements of eye detail - the pupil / iris boundary and\nthe reflection in the eye of the source used to illuminate the eye.\nTo demonstrate this principle, ask a subject to look directly at your flashlight.\nYou will notice that the highlight (corneal) reflection of the light appears to\nbe at the center of his pupil. When the subject looks away from the light, you\nwill see that the reflection moves, correspondingly, away from the center of the\npupil. It is easily verified that this is independent of head position. In other\nwords, eye direction can be determined, independently of head position, simply by\nmeasuring the displacement of the corneal reflection ( of the radiation used to\nilluminate the eye) relative to the center of the pupil.\nTo avoid dazzling the subject, the Oculometer uses near infrared ( 0.8 m) radiation to illuminate the eye. This is almost invisible - the subject sees only a\ndull red light in front of him.\n\nA standard TV camera is used to sense the eye detail, and by a special optical\narrangement, the pupil of the eye is seen as "bright" - not black, as in a normal\nt\nview of the eye (Figure 1). (In this technique,. the pupil is effectively backlighted by the retinal image of the infrared source.) With suitable black-level\nadjustment of the camera video output, the TV picture of the eye generated by the\n=\t\nOculometer reduces to just two circular areas against a black background. One\ncircle-the pupil yields a video level of about 300 mV. The other - the much\nsmaller corneal (high-light) reflection - is at a video level of about 1 volt.\niAs we have seen, eye direction is proportional ti the displacement of the corneal\nreflection from the center of the pupil. The Oculometer electronics unit analyzes\n_.^\t\nthis relatively simple TV picture of the eye to deduce eye direction according to\nthis principle.\n\xe2\x80\xa2d\t\n\ns\n\n\'\t\nt\t\nI\t\n\nThe Oculometer electronics unit is, basically, a standard general purpose minicomputer. A special interface card, which plugs into a spare slot in the minicomputer, converts the video signal from the Oculometer TV sensor into digital\nformat, and enters the resultant eye data directly into an area of the m\xe2\x80\xa2nicomputer\nmemory. The specialized processing of the video eye data is then performed (in\nreal time) entirely by software in the general purpose minicomputer.\n\n1\t\nlThe advantages of minicomputer processing are low cost, reliability, easy main^\t\ntenance, flexibility for incorporating improvements, and Processingo wer. The\np\n^ \'\t\nprocessor not only estimates the relative positions of the centers of the pupil\n_\t\nand of the corneal reflection, it also handles special, "difficult" cases - as\nwhen the corneal reflection falls on (and thereby distorts) the pupil/iris bounfi\t\ndary, or when the too and/or bottom of the pupil is partially obscured by the\neyelids. It solves the complex geometrical equations relating "raw" eye direction and the coordinates of the intercept of the fixation vector on some specified plane. The processor also provides the means for quick, three - point, calibration for each new subject as well as compensation for the nonlinearities in\nthe relationship between eye direction and relative corneal reflection position\nwithin the pupil.\nA-32\n!\t\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the motion of the eye, due to eye rotation, is small. In\nthe effect used by the Oculometer, the scale factor is approximately three thousandths of an inch of relative corneal reflection displacement per degree of eye\nrotation. The resolution of the n\' sensor is limited by the approximately 500-600\nscan lines in the picture. It is clear that if the TV sensor is to have sufficient resolution to be able to sense eye movements to an accuracy of l o , its\nfield of view at the eye must be quite small - of the order of one square inch.\nIt turns out that the depth of focus of the Oculometer is also about one inch.\nThus, the instantaneous field of view at the eye (eye space) is inherently limited\nto the order of one cubic inch.\n\nl^\n\nJ^\n\nl^\nJ^\n\nJ^\n^l\n\n1\'\n\nIn order to provide an effective eye space coverage of one cubic foot, a two-axis\nmoving mirror system and a servo-controlled focusing lens are added to the basic\nOculometer system. These opto-mechanical elements are controlled, automatically,\nby the minicomputer to keep the eye always centered within the instantaneous\n(cubic inch) eye space of the sensor, as the eye moves over the cubic foot of\neffective eye space. An auxiliary TV camera, with a wide-angle lens, is also\nlocated in front of the subject to provide the minicomputer with additional\ninforn.ation for ra?id acquisition of the eye and for automatic focusing of the\nOculometer.\nInstallation\nThe angular range of the Oculometer is + 30 0 (x) and 0 0 to +300 (y) relative to\na line joining the eye to the Oculometer. This means that, for maximum angular\ncoverage, the Oculometer should be placed at the bottom center of the fixation\nfield. It may not always be convenient to locate the Oculometer sensor (with\nits TV camera, IR Source, moving lens and mirrors, etc) at this point - particularly when the fixation field is the crowded instrument panel of an aircraft\nsimulator. For this reason the Indirect Remote Oculometer (Figure 2) has recently\nbeen developed. The path length from the eye to the sensor has been increased\nto 90 inches. With this system, it is necessary to locate only the moving mirror\nin front of the subject. The Oculometer sensor itself can be located behind or\nto the side of the subject, "seeing" the eye by reflection in the mirror. There\nis generally more room for the Oculometer sensor away from the fixation field\nand, of course, the sensor will not then obstruct the subject\'s view of the fixation field.\nIn future developments, the conventional (vidicon) TV camera in the Ociilometer\nSensor may be replaced by the much smaller CCD (solid-state) TV cameras that have\nrecently become available. This will make it easier to install the Oculometer in\nconfined areas, such as the cockpit of an aircraft. The CCD camera will also\nrake it possible to integrate an Oculometer into a pilot\'s flight helmet, using\nthe parabolic visor to reflect rays from the miniaturized Oculometer sensor onto\nthe pilot\'s eye. A helmet mounted Oculometer would permit the eye direction of\nthe pilot to be measured with unlimited angular and linear motion of the head.\n\ni\n1\n\nk\n\ni^\n\n^I\n\nA-33\n\nt\n\nJ\nJ -i\n\n\'T\n\nA\n\nJ\n\nOther Applications\nThe Remote Oculometer has been used to record driver eye fixations in an automobile.\t The output signals from the Oculometer were used to annotate a TV picture of the road, generated by a camera mounted just behind the driver. \t A video\ntape recording of this annotated driver\'s-eye-view of the road ahead allowed\nresearchers to study how their test subjects performed the visual tasks involved\nin driving.\n\n-t\n^\n\nl\'\n! -^\n\ntt\n\nThe Oculometer has also been used to study how people look at TV commercials.\nAn Oculometer was set up near a TV set in a shopping mall and shoppers were\ninvited to watch a series of 10 33-second commercials \t (Figure 3).\t The Oculometer determined which section of the TV screen the test subject was looking at,\nat each instant.\t In the course of a week the TV fixation data from 200 subjects\nwas recorded for subsequent statistical analysis.\t As the data was being recorded,\nthe advertising researchers were able to see an annotated version of the commercial being viewed by the test subject at that time (Figure 4). \t The annotation\nmark showed the subject\'s instantaneous point of fixation. \t In this way they were\nable to see, immediately, what features in the commercial people tended to concentrate on, and what features people tended to ignore - potentially \' important information for those trying to capture the viewer\'s fleeting attention and concentrate\nit on the product being advertised.\nEye-Control\n\n1\nThe ability of the Oculometer to measure a subject\'s eye direction, without interfering with the subject, offers the interesting possibility of using the eye for\ncontrol, in place of the hands.\n^i\n\n-^\n\'A\n\' -3\n\nThe angular direction of the eyeball is controlled by a sophisticated neuroIn addition to freeing the hands (for other tasks) eye-contro_\'\nmuscular system.\t\nmight offer faster reaction than conventional manual control - particularly for\naiming; tasks in which the eye must be aired, anyway, as part of the normal act of\nis ion.\n\nConclusion\nThere are two basic aspects of human performance in any manbrachine system - what\n\n-^\n-^\n*t\n^J J\n\nsensory information is tie receiving, what motor action is he generating?\t The\nmotor (output) from the man is relatively easy to rec-rd. \t The Remote Oculometer by unobtrusive measurement of eye direction - now provides a practical method for\nrecording the visual interaction of the subject with his visual environment,\nthereby indicating the nature of the visual information that is he absorbing.\t\nIn\nthis way the Oculometer is contributing to research aimed at understanding, and\nimproving, human performance.\n\n"^\t\n\nA-34\n\nTH E P, 0 I EY V!

This is typically the case when the fixation\ntask is of short duration and involves continuous fixation of one\narea, for example, a TV screen.\nThe Automatic version (Item 2) is intended for applications where the subject may be moving daring the fixation experiment, for example, continuous, long duration monitoring of an\nautomobile driver or aircraft pilot.\n2.1.1\t\n\nii\n\nI7\nl^\nJ^\n\na,]\n\nTHE INDIRECT REMOTE OCULOMETER (Items 1 and 2)\n\nEase of Operation\n\nThe optical ;lead i q located 90 inches f 6 inches from\nthe subject and views the subject via a small relay mirror\n(Figure 2).\nThe relay mirror, and the optical head, can be adjusted\nso as to detect the eye anywhere over a cubic foot of space centered at the nominal eye position. In the Standard version of the\nOculometer, this adjustment is manual and is performed prior to\ncalibration. It allows the system to be adapted easily to subjects\nof various heights a-id eye positions. In the Automatic version,\nthis Edjustment is p:rform(!d automatically by the signal processor (Figure 3). In the Automatic version, eye direction (or\nfixation point coordinates) can be continuously measured as the\nsubject moves over the full cubic foot of eve space. A head\ntracker (an auxiliary TV camera) provides fast acquisition and\nautomatic focus.\n2. 1.2\t\n\nFase of Installation\n\nOnly the small relay mirror need be placed in front of\nthe subject.

The TV picture thereby\ngenerated is analyzed by the signal processor, in real time, to\ndetermine the position of the eye within the eye space so that the\nOculometer can be pointed directly at the eye.\nThe head-tracker video information also enables range to\nbe determined (by triangulation) so that the Oculometer can be\ncontinuously focused onto the eye.\n\n7\ni\n1\nj\n\n7\n\n=J\n\n1\n\nThere are two modes of operation of the head-tracker\nsystem. In one, the subject wears a headband on which is mounted\na small gallium arsenide diode. In the other mode, the subject\ndoes not wear the headband, (The use of the GaAs head marker provides for faster acquisition,)\nIn the Automatic version, the relay mirror must be\nelectronicall y slewable to enable the signal processor to automa:ically track the eye over the cubic foot of eye space.\nThe moving (relay) mirror system provided consists of\ntwo mirrors, each attached to a rotary actuator. These two mirror\nunits are supplied mounted to a baseplate, to provide a rightangled bend in the path from the eye to the optical head (Figure 4).\nHowever, in most applications, the mirrors should he removed from\nthe baseplate and custom-mounted on the fixation scene so as to\no interfere as little as possible with the fixation\nscene\n\n0\n\n3rovide the appropriate bend in the optical path\nFrom the eye ti the optical head. as required for\n^he selected l , )cation of the opt-cal head.\n\nOther moving mirror systems can be developed on special\norder. For example, a single, gimbaled mirror which can be\nrotated in two dimensi,lns. If desired, the mirror can be specially coated so as to he transparent in the visible, thereby\nfurther minimizing any obstruction of the fixation field,\n\nA-42\n\n\t\n\ni\t\ne\n\nj\t ..\n\n2.1.6\t\n\nEquipment Options (see Table I)\n\nThe Oculometer, itself, is available in a Standard version and an Automatic version, the components cif which are illustrated in Figures 5 and 6.

Other suitable devices\ninclude - the LINC tape drive, paper tape reader, cassette, floppy\ndisc. The Oculometer program is supplied on paper tape or, on\nrequest, on LINC tape.\nCertain symbols in the Oculometer program, such as outp!it scale factors, can be accessed via the NOVA front panel. This\nis inconvenient and a keyboard device [such as the ASR 33 or the\nCRT terminal with NOVA interface (Item 5)] is recommended.\n\n1\nThe telet y pe has the advantage that it can be used to\nload the program and access symbols. The LINC tape has the\nadvantage of much faster program loading and is also useful for\nprogram development, data recording, etc. The CRT terminal has\n\nthe advantage of quiet, fast operation.\n\t2.3\t\n\n8-INCH TV MONITOR: (Item 6)\n\nUse of a sI-andard TV monitor (e.g., Item 3) (to show\nthe Oculometer sensed image of the eye) is recommended for subject\nalignment, system checkout.\n2.4\t\n\nI^\n\nFIXATION POINT OPTIONS (Items, 7,8,9,10)\n\nItem 7 is an annotation device.

It allows the\nNOVA to annotate a standard video signal.\nThe advantages of this unit are:\n\nJ\n\nw\t\n\n;\n\no\t\no\t\n\nShows a single (current) fi}.ation point or\nthe previous 120 fixation points (for example,\nthe fixation pattern over the last 30 s at 4\npoints/second)\n\na\t\n\nCan also show f-_xed reference points\n\no\t\n\na^\n\nSelf-contained in the 140VA\n\nAnnotation mark can be black or white\n\ni\n\n\t\n6.2\n\nZ\nHIGH SUN SI: I1"ITY AT. ACHMENT\n\nIn its normal mode cf operation, the Oculometer compensates for head motion, pro p,iding an accurac,- of 1 degree with\na noise level of 0.5 degree.\nWith the High Sensitivity Attachment the Oeulometer\ncan also be operated to provide a noise Level of less than 0.1\ndegree, but with no compensation for heat motion. This mode,\nin which the eye-Oculometer distance is approximatel y 20" (instead of 90"), is intended for studies of eye movement itself,\nin which the head is held still and absolute accuracy is not\nrequired.\n\nz\t\n\ni^\n\n6.3\t\n\nEXTENDED RANG\' STANDARD OCULOMFTER\n\na\n\nIn this versi . )n, a remotely tor\xe2\x80\xa2trolled moving (panel)\nmirror is used to extend the 1 cubic inct eye-space coverage of\nthe original Standard System (item 1, pa\xe2\x82\xace 5).

The Automatic System is recommended for\napplications where full accuracy is required for subject mo-\t\ntions of up to one foot.\n6.4\t\n\nSELF-CONTAINED ELECTRONICS\n\nAs explained on page 11, a teletype or CRT terminal\nis normally needed to operate the Oculometer.\nIn the Self-Contained Version all functions (including\nreloading of the program) are controlled by front panel switches\non the signal processor. Neither a teletype nor a CRT terminal\nis required. (The signal p rocessor consists of a standard minicomputer and a LILAC tape crive.) The advantages of the SelfContained Version are lower cost and less associated equipment\nto be interconnected.\nThe Self-Contained Version is suitable for applications\nir. which the system will be used only as an Oculometer. For applications in which it may be desired to use the minicomputer\nfor non-Oculometer purposes (i.e., as a general-purpose computer) some kind of terminal will be required.\n\n^i\n\n6.5\t\n\nDICHROIC MIRROR OPTION\n\nIn the Automatic Version cf the Indirect Remote Oculometer, the one-inch beam of rays (between the eye and Oculcmeter)\nmust be moved automatically as the Eye is moved over the cubic\nfoot of eye-space.\nIn the arrangement illustrated in Figures 3 and 4,\nthis is accomplished by a moving mirror assembly located on the\nfixation plane (e.g., instrument panel)\nA\t\n\nr _^\t\n\nIn an alternative arrangement, Figure 14, a moving\nmirror system is located at (or close-to) the optical head and\na relatively large fixed dichroic mirror is located on the fixation\n\nA-52\n\ni\n\n.W\n\nplane to reflect the moving Oculometer IR beam onto the eye.\nThe dichroic mirror is transparent to visible radiation - it\ndoes not obscure the subject\'s view of the fixation plane.\n\n,.l\n\nv\t\n\nI\n\nThe fixed dichroic mirror can be tilted to adjust the\ndynamic eye-space region to suit each new subject. The size of\nthe dynamic eye-space region is governed by the size of the\ndichroic mirror and its distanct from the moving mirror assembly\n\nand from the eye.\n\n\xc2\xad11\n\nThe advantage of the Dichroic Mirror technique for\nthe Automatic Version of the Indirect Remote Oculometer is that\nno equipment of any kind, other than an (apparently) transparent\nsheet of glass, need to be located at the fixation plane. This\nsimplifies installation and minimizes subject interferences.\n\nt^\n\nl -1]"\n\nIt T\'"]\n\nJ\n\nl^\n-T\n\n.-I\n\nA-53\n\n\'7\n\nREPRODUCIBILITY OF THE\nORIGINAL PAGE IS POOR\nr,c\n,.\n\n0\nI X00 1"1 c Z,t e i - c; L-i \t\n\ne M: o\n\nv\n\no\n\nolient\n\nI\nv\n\nIr\n\n6\nr\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\nr\n\nAl\n\n.24\n\no\t\n\n^\t\n\nv\nNARCO BIO-SYSTEMS, Inc.\nA-5 f\n\n,)\t\n\n3^^ ^J \xe2\x80\x94^ ^JlC MODEL 200 RES[ARCH EYE MOVEMENT MONITOR\n\nl\n1\n. 3\t\n\nheasures Horizontal or Vertical Eye Movements\xe2\x80\x94simultaneously monitors both eyes.\nHigh Sensitivity.
