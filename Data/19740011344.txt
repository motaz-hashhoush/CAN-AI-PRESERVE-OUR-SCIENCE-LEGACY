b'Dust Storms in Space?\nROBERT ROOSEN OTTO BERG\nG.\nAND\nE.\nGoddard Space Flight Center, N A S A\nGreenbelt, Maryland\nAND\n\nNEIL H. FARLOW\nAmes Research Center, N A S A\nMoffett Field, California\n\nSilverberg (1970) has explained the "dust storms" observed by the early satelliteborne microphone detectors by postulating that the orbital planes of short-period, lowinclination comets are filled with micrometeoroids. W e report here on three separate\napproaches to test the validity of this hypothesis.\n(1) Optical scans of the Gegenschein brightness can yield no useful information on\nthe nearly isotropic sheets of dust predicted by Silverberg.\n(2) An attempt to directly collect dust particles during a predicted highjlux period\nby means of a sounding rocket yielded negative results.\n(3) Over three years of particle impact data from extremely sensitive detectors $own\naboard Pioneers 8 and 9 show no observable dust storms.\n\nHence Silverberg\'s hypothesis appears untenable.\nHowever, we should not rule out the possibility that observable showers of very small\nparticles can be blown directly off the nuclei of some comets passing between the Earth\nand the Sun.\n\nv\n\nparently enhanced micrometeoritic flux reported\nby various investigators using satellite-borne\nmicrophone detectors can be explained by postulating that small, low density particles are produced in sufficient quantities from debris in the\norbits of short period, low-inclination comets to\nproduce dust storms when the satellites pass\nthrough the comets\' orbital planes. Silverberg\n(1970) further points out: "In general, there\nappears to be no dust event seen by the satellites\n[carrying microphone detectors] wvhich was not\nnear the plane of a periodic comet. Furthermore,\nno satellite passed through the plane of a lowinclination comet without registering a flux\nincrease."\n\nARIOUS INVESTIGATORS (e.g., Silverberg, 1970;\nPoultney, 1972; McCracken, Alexander, and\nDubin, 1967) have suggested that there are dust\nstreams in interplanetary space in which the\nflux of micrometeoritic (i.e., mass <lo-8 gm)\nparticles is enhanced by factors of up to 100 or\nmore over the sporadic background. We discuss\nhere several recent investigations of this\npossibility.\n\nI N SITU MEASUREMENTS\n\nI t has been suggested (Silverberg and Poultney,\n1969; Silverberg, 1970) that the periods of ap223\n\n224\n\nEVOLUTIONARY AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF METEOROIDS\n\nSeveral years of observational results now\navailable from the Pioneer 8 and 9 interplanetary\ndust detectors (Berg and Gerloff, 1970, 1972)\nmake it possible to test the validity of this\nsuggestion.\nTable 1 summarizes the characteristics of the\nfive largest dust showers discussed by Silverberg\nand Poultney (1969). The last column of Table 1\nlists the number of counts that would be expected\nto be observed by the Pioneer 8 and 9 detectors in\nthe same sho~vers(The effective cross section of\nthe Pioneer 8 and 9 detectors for a unidirectional\nflux near the ecliptic plane is about 0.005 m2).\nFigure 1shows all counts registered on the front\nfilm as a function of time for the Pioneer 8 and 9\ndetectors during the periods when complete telemetry was available. The count rates are shown\nseparately depending on whether or not the Sun\nwas within the 120\' field of view of the detectors.\nThe times at which cometary enhancements are\npredicted are also shown, and it is apparent that\nno dust showers are seen then-indeed no detectable showers appear anywhere in the data. Hence\nthe Pioneer observations are completely at odds\nwith the early microphone observations. In particular we can make the following points:\n(1) No comet-associated dust storms were detected to a limit at least a factor of 100 more\nsensitive than the previously reported highest\nrates.\n(2) The previously reported events were for\nparticles in the mass range\nto\ngm,\nwhereas the events shown in figure 1 are due to\nparticles smaller than 10-l1 gm. Indeed, the\nTABLE\n1.-Five\n\nSatellite\n\nlargest particle observed by the Pioneer detectors\nin more than three years of operation is 10-lo gm\n(Berg and Gerloff, 1971). Hence the particles\npresumed to cause these dust storms are much too\nrare to even have been observed with a total cross\nsection (so far) of 3 X lo5 m s, much less cause\ndust storms involving hundreds of impacts per day.\n(3) It is no good to suppose that these storms\noccur only occasionally, since Silverberg\'s claim is\nthat they were invariably observed whenever a\nsatellite-borne detector passed through the orbital\nplane of any short period, low inclination comet\nwhose perihelion distance was less than 1 AU.\nFigure 1 also shows the positions of ten of the\nmost active meteor streams (Porter, 1952). I n\nview of the perturbing effects of solar wind and\nradiation pressure on the orbits of picogram-sized\ndust particles it is not surprising that no dust\nstorms are observed connected with meteor\nstreams (1CIIillman, 1970; Mazets, 1971).\nFigure 2 shows the corrected monthly sums for\nthe three years of available data.\nAs an example of the limits that can be set on\nthe flux of any possible stream (with low orbital\ninclination) let us assume a typical duration of\n10 hr (3.6X104 s), and further assume that three\nhits id that peridd define a stream. Then any\nstream must have a flux of less than 0.02 particle\nm-2 sec-I\nCOMET ENCKE\n\nIn addition to the Pioneer results, a number of\nother investigations were carried out during the\n\nLargest Dust Showers Discussed by Silverberg (1970) and Silverberg and Poultney (1969)8\n\nDate(s) of "storm"\n\nVanguard 3\n\nNov. 16-18, 1959\n\nExplorer 1\nElectron 2\nSputnik 3\nElectron 2\n\nFeb. 3, 1958\nJan. 30-31,1964\nMay 15, 1958\nFeb. 23-25, 1964\n\nAssociated comet\n\nHonda-MrkosPajdusakova\nBrorsen-Metcalf\nBrorsen-Metcalf\nHalley\nEncke\n\nCount rate\n(m- s-1)\n\nDuration of\nstorm (hours)\n\nPredicted no. of\ncounts for a\nPioneer-type\ndetector\n\n0.2\n\n70\n\n250\n\n0.2\n0.11\n\n15\n15\n5\n44.4\n\n55\n30\n630\n5\n\n7\n0.0058\n\nCount rates shown are those expected for a Pioneer-type detector exposed to similar storms.

I t was\nfor a time believed that this observation might\nsupport Silverberg\'s hypothesis. An attempt was\nmade to reproduce the observation in February\n1971. Although observations were planned from\nfour separate observing sites in the continental\nU.S., clouds prevented observations on February\n23 and February 24, but observations on the other\nnights showed no evidence for a shadow. I n\nparticular, observations on February 21, 1971, did\nnot reproduce the event observed February 21,\n1969.\nIndeed, optical scans of the Gegenschein brightness ~vould be expected to be very efficient in\nnot\ntesting the Silverberg hypothesis. Silverberg predicts an almost isotropic sheet of dust stretching\nsome several astronomical units past the Earth.\nAs pointed out by Roosen, the shadow expected\nfor such a collection of dust is only slightly greater\nthan 1 ~ e r c e n d e e ~Hence the dust could not be\nt\n.\ndetected by the shadow technique unless enough\nwas present to increase the Gegenschein brightness\nby a factor of three or more. Further, the shadow\nreported by Roosen was much wider than that\n\n0\n\nSUN NOT IN FIELD OF VlEW\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nl\n\ni\n\nl\n\nl\n\nl\n\nl\n\nl\n\nl\n\nJ\n\nF\n\nM\n\nA\n\nM\n\nJ\n\nJ\n\nA\n\nS\n\nO\n\nN\n\nD\n\nl\n\nFIGURE\n2.-Monthly sums of the 3 years of available dat\ncorrected for periods when telemetry was\nThe error bars represent probable errors\nber of observed events, assuming Poisson statistics.\n\npredicted for Silverberg\'s isotropic sheet, and can\nonly be interpreted as due to a relatively small\ncloud whose center was only about 60 Earth radii\nfrom the Earth. Also, since the estimated time of\npassage of the Earth through the dust sheet is only\n5 hours (Poultney, 1970), observations of the\nantisolar region on days other than February 24\ncould not include the dust predicted by Silverberg.\nDust in the Upper Atmosphere\n\nOne of us (NHF) launched a Luster rocket at\n1440 GMT on February 24, 1971, from White\nSands \'R.lissile Range. The techniques used have\nbeen described by Farlow and Ferry (1972) and\n\n226\n\nEVOLUTIONARY AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF METEOROIDS\n\nFerry and Farlow (1972). In the range of 80 to\n118 km altitude, no increase was observed over the\nnormal contamination background. A very slight\nenhancement found in the 70 to 80 km interval was\nalso observed on 2 Luster flights from Churchill,\nCanada in April and May 1970. Hence no increase\nin mesospheric dust was detected.\nLidar observations by G. S. Kent (1971) in\nJamaica also indicate no major enhancement in\natmospheric dust on February 24 or on following\ndays, although an enhancement was observed at\nthe time of the Earth\'s passage through the orbital\nplane of Comet Bennett in May 1970 (Kent et al.,\n1971). [It is not surprising that no increase in\nevent rates connected with this comet was observed by the Pioneer detectors, since its orbital\nthat any dust\ninclination mas so high (-90")\nwould be out of their field of view.]\n\nHence any dust blown directly off the nucleus of\nComet Encke at the favorable 1971 apparition\nseems to have been indetectable.\nCONCLUSIONS\nPrimarily from the Pioneer 8 and 9 results we\ncan conclude that the f u of picogram sized dust\nlx\nparticles near the Earth\'s orbit has been constant\nto within the observational limits over three years\nof observation. I n particular, since dust streams\nare not observed, they cannot explain the microphone-detected events discussed by Silverberg\n(1970) and Silverberg and Poultney (1969).\nHowever, the possibility of rare events due to dust\nblown directly off a cometary nucleus (such as\nthat reported for Comet Bennett by Kent et al.,\n1971, and discussed by Silverberg, 1970, and\nPoult,ney, 1971) cannot be completely ruled out.\n\nREFERENCES\nBERG,0.
