The operating characteristics of\na pipe with a given geometry may vary from excellent to nonfunctional; axial temperature drops of several\nhundred degrees have occurred in some cases.\nThe performance of a heat pipe depends on the\ntype of wick, working fluid, and the external conditions\nimposed on it. The dynamics of the fluid flow are very\ncomplicated. Under certain operational conditions the\nvapor flow may be molecular or continuum, compressible or incompressible; vapor velocities may be\nsonic or supersonic; countercurrent flow of vapor and\nliquid, with communication between flow paths, may\nresult. In designing heat pipes for high heat transfer\nrates these factors must be taken into account.\nA series of tests has been conducted to determine the effects of sonic vapor velocities on the operational and startup characteristics of heat pipes. It was\nfound that the introduction of small amounts of inert,\nnoncombustible gas aids startup in certain types of heat\npipes. Also, when the heat pipe is closely coupled to the\nheat sink, the startup system must be designed to bring\nthe heat sink on-line slowly.\nNotes:\n1.
