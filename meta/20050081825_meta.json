This was part of a study evaluating the methodology for including the rollout dynamic loads in the Space Shuttle fatigue life predictions. The rollout test was conducted with a partial stack consisting of the Crawler Transporter, Mobile Launch Platform, and the Solid Rocket Boosters with an interconnecting crossbeam. Instrumentation included over 100 accelerometers. Data was recorded for steady state speeds, start-ups and stops, and ambient wind excitations with the vehicle at idle. This paper will describe the operating deflection shape analysis performed using the measured acceleration response data. The response data for the steady state speed runs were dominated by harmonics of the forcing frequencies, which were proportional to the vehicle speed. Assuming a broadband excitation for the wind, analyses of the data sets with the vehicle at idle were used to estimate the natural frequencies and corresponding mode shapes. Comparisons of the measured modal properties with numerical predictions are presented.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20050081825, "endDate": "2005-02-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "IMAC XXIII: Conference and Exposition on Structural Dynamics", "location": "Orlando, FL", "id": "93a279eb225348e4b1852c4db76d3dc2", "startDate": "2005-01-31T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20050081825, "id": "2e478f890dd949f7929641a8b48d5e63", "publicationDate": "2005-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20050081825.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20050081825/downloads/20050081825.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20050081825/downloads/20050081825.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20050081825/downloads/20050081825.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
