b'What We are Learning from (and About) the 10+ Year\nMISR Aerosol Data Record\nR Kahn and the MISR Team (NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt\nMD 20771; 301-614-6193; e-mail: ralph.kahnfii),nasa.gov ),\nHaving a 10+ year data record from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer\n(MISR) significantly improves our opportunities to validate the retrieved aerosol\noptical depth (AOD) and especially particle microphysical property products. It\nalso begins to raise the possibility of using the data to look for changes or even\ntrends, at least on a regional basis. Further, we have had the opportunity to\nexpand the database of wildfire smoke plume heights derived from the multiangle observations.\nThis presentation will review the latest aerosol validation results and algorithm\nupgrades under consideration by the MISR team, and will summarize the current\nstatus of MISR global aerosol air mass type, and regional dust transport and\nsmoke injection height products. The strengths and limitations of these data for\nconstraining aerosol transport model simulations will receive special emphasis.\n\n'
