The scientific payload was selected to perform studies in upper atmospheric physics and\ninfrared astronomy with principal investigators from France, the Netherlands, England, and several groups from the United States. Two experiment\noperators from Europe and two from the U.S. were selected to live aboard\nthe aircraft along with a mission manager for a six-day period and operate\nthe experiments in bha1f of the principal scientists. Communication links\nbetween the \'Space1ab" and a ground-based mission operations center were\nlimited consistent with Spacelab plans. The mission was successful and\nprovided extensive data relevant to Spacelab objectives on overall management of a complex international payload; experiment preparation, testing,\nand integration; training for proxy operation in space; data handling;\nmultiexperimenter use of common experimenter facilities (telescopes);\nmultiexperiment operation by experiment operators; selection criteria for\nSpacelab experiment operators; and schedule requirements to prepare for\nsuch a Spacelab mission.\n\n17.\n\n18.

This\nsystem will consist of a laboratory (Spa...eIab) carried into orbit by the\nreusable Space Shuttle. Spacelab is being developed and constructed in\nEurope under the direction of the European Space Agency (ESA). The Space\nShuttle Orbiter is being built by the United States under management of the\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).\nSpacelab is being designed to be a versatile laboratory capable of\naccommodating a variety of experiments. The pressurized Spacelab module provides a shirtsleeve environment in which up to four payload specialists can\noperate experiments using the basic resources provided by the laboratory.\nSimilarities between the method of experiment accommodation and operations\nplanned for Si\'ce1ab and the methods used in conducting experimentation\naboard aircraft by the NASA-Ames Airborne Science Office (ASO) led to the\nNASA-ESA Joint Mission, the sixth mission in the ASSESS (Airborne Science/\nSpacelab Experiments System Siniulation) program. The vehicle chosen was the\nNASA CV-990 aircraft, which offers a laboratory environment of about the same\nsize as Spacelab (fig. 1).\nPrevious ASSESS missions for the study of applications of ASO techniques\nto Spacelab operations are reported in references 1-11. The Joint Mission was\nthe second in the se-ries to utilize experiment operators (EOs); the first\ninvolved only a single experiment and two operators (refs. 9 and 10). This\nmission was the first large-scale simulation using the CV-990 with EOs and\ninternational participation, and it provided by far the most realistic Spacelab\nsimulation to date.\nInitial plans for the mission were discussed in February 1974. An\nexchange of letters between NASA and ESA in August 1974 formalized the Joint\nMission. Six experiments were selected: three from Europe and three from\nthe United States. The simulation mission took place at the NASA-Ames\nResearch Center, Moffett Field, California, USA, between April 30 and Juiie 24,\n1975.\nSpacelab payload manpower is limited to a maximum of four, which means\nthat payload specialists often will be acting as proxy operators for principal\ninvestigators\' (PIs) experiments. To test the concept of proxy operation,\nfour experiment operators were selected and trained on the six experiments.\nDuring the simulation period, the flOs performed all experiment operations,\nincluding data taking, normal servicing, and minor repairs. For the entire\n1\n\nsimulation period, the four LOs and the Mission Manager were confined to the\naircraft and an adjacent sleeping area. The decision to confine the Mission\n\nManager was in keeping with the mission plan to adhere closely to Airborne\nScience management techniques for this ficst full-scale iimulation using the\nCV-990 aircraft. All communications with the outside world during the simulation period were handled by communications links (audio and video) simulating\nthose planned for Spacelab. Scientific data were taken on all EO and P1\nflights.\nEnglish was the official language of the mission. Participants in the\nmission were British, American, French, Dutch, and German. With the exception\nfrom\nof some members of the team from the Observatory of Moudon, all participants\nwere fluent in English or sufficiently fluent to be understood as intended.\nNo serious misunderstandings were noted at any time because of any language\nproblem.\nA concise statement of the major findings of the NASA-ESA Joint Mission\nis given in the Executive Summary (ref. 12). The present report develops and\nevaluates the main base of mission information, giving special emphasis to\nmanagement techniques, payload development, operator training, and the overall\nperformance of the mission organization during thc simulation period. Results\nare summarized to highlight areas of particular relevance to Spacelab planning.\nThe considerable body of detailed information available from the Joint Mission\nis incorporated into appendixes to this report that are published under\nseparate cover, as listed in the Table of Contents herein.\nInformation for this report and separate appendixes has been gathered from\nseveral sources: the records of a team of observers who flew on all flights\nand observed mission activities in detail, mission operatma1 records, mission\nplanning documentation, information prepared by the PIs and EOs, an extensive\ndebriefing following the simulation period, and individual interviews with mission participants. This report 15 a joint NASA/ESA effort, with inputs from a\nlarge number of persons from both agencies who were concerned with the mission.\nA roster of participants is provided at the end of this text.\n\nMISSION OBJECTIVES AND GUIDELINES\n\nThe overall objective of the Joint ASSESS Mission was to evaluate a\nsimplified management and implementation concept for conducting Spacolab-like\nexperiment operations. The following were subordinate mission objectives:\n1.\n\nTo experience involvement in international cooperative payload activities\n\n2.\n\nTo evaluate experiment design approaches for Spacelab experiments\n\n3.\n\nTo determine the impact of operational requirements and procedures\non Spacelab design\n\n4.\n\nTo evaluate payload and mission operations\n\n5.\n\nTo assess 1;echniclues for smooth integration oiT experiments and equipment\n\n6.\n\nTo analyze factors affecting selection and training of payload\nspecialists, particularly in proxy experiment operation.\n3\n\nThe .Joint ASSESS Mission also served to encourage the development of a cadre\nof potential Spacelab experimenters, The mission did not address physiological\nor psychological factors.\nThe mission guidelines were designed to ensure a high degree of realistic\nsimulation. The guidelines were consrained to the capabilities of the CV-990\naircraft, ASO practices, and the requirements for Spacelab as stated about one\nyear before the ASSESS mission. The completa guidelines are provided in the\nMission Operating Plan (appendix 1!) and are summarized below:\n1.\n\nAuthentic science to be performed\n\n2.\n\nSix basic experiments to be operated (three European, threeU.S.)\n\n3.\n\nAmes ASO practices to be used as sarting point for mission planning\nand execution\n\n4.\n\nParticipation of PIs in overall mission to be maximized\n\n5.\n\nPour EOs (two European, to U.S.) to operate experiments in proxy\nrole (i.e.. on behalf of the PIs)\n\n6.\n\nSimulation period to cover 5 days with a data flight each 24-hr\nperiod (experiments operated by UOs), with EOs and the Mission\nManager confined to vehicle and living quarters\n\n7.\n\nUnconstrained flights to be conducted for 2 weeks following the\nsimulation period (experiments operated by Pis)\n\n8.\n\nAll supporting equipment, tools, and spare parts to be carried on\nboard\n\n9.\n\nSpacelab subsystems to be simulated where possible\n\n10. Use of experiment support equipment to be shared\n11.\n\nCommunication to be limited to one video downlink, two 2-way voice\nlinks.\n\nMISSION MANAGEMENT\nPolicy Management\n\nMission Planning Group\nBasic guidance for the mission was provided by the seven-member Mission\nPlanning Group (MPG) which comprised representatives from both NASA and ESA\nHeadquarters organizations and from the Marshall, Johnson, and Ames NASA centers. Seven planning sessions were held between May 1974 and June 1975 at\n4\n\nwhicli the MPG set the schedule, ratified the selection of experiments and EOs,\ndeveloped the mission guidelines, and checked the status of the mission at all\ncritical points. The detailed schedule developed by the MPG for the entire\nmission is shown in table 1.\nExperiment Selection\n\nExperiment selection started in late February 1974 in Europe as ESA\nsolicited proposals from interested sponsors. Three were selected by early\nApril on the grounds of developmental status, scientific desirability, and\nSpacelab compatibility. These ixperinients were approved by the MPG at their\nMay 1 mooting and ESA monitored the experimenter grants. Selection of the\nthree U.S. experiments followed in September 1974 with experiments chosen by\nNASA Headquarters to complement the European group. MPG approval was obtained\nprior to October 1, and the Mission Manager was assigned as technical monitor\nof experimenter grants.\nExperiment Operator Selection\nFour BOs wert , selected for this mission, two by ESA and two by NASA\nHeadquarters. Selection was approved at the MPG September mooting. The flOs\nrepresented a broad spectrum of experience, ranging from that of a graduate\nscience student to a scientist/astronaut ) so as to provide insight on training\nrequirements for subjects with different amounts of scientific background.\nGrants for the European and U.S. EOs were monitored by ESA and the NASA Mission\nManager s respectivcly,\n\nImplementation Management\nMission preparations and operations were implemented by the organizations\nshown in figures 2 and 3. During the simulation period, two ineinbers of the\nMPG, one from NASA and one from BSA Headquarters, were the overall mission\nauthority (NASA/ESA panel) to ensure that the dirc.tivcs of the MPG were carried out and, if necessary, to make top-level policy decisions involving\nagency interests. The interaction between management and operations is\ndiscussed further under Mission Operations,\nMission Manager\nThe Mission Manager, from the ASO, was the single point of contact for\nall negotiations, decisions, and assistance in carrying Out the mission from\ninception to completion. With the aid of one full-time assistant, he implemented the directives of the MPG; communicated with the Pis relative to their\nmission responsibilities; and handled all detailed planning of expeimont\nintegration, flight operations f and support activities. Ile was responsible,\nfor example, for developing the Mission Operating Plan, the layout of experiments in the aircraft, the distribution of aircraft electrical power, the\nprocurement of supplies and experiment-support equipment, arrangements for the\nuse of the airborne digital data acquisition system (AJJI)AS), and development\nof preliminary flight plans to meet the PIs\' scientific objectives.\n5\n\n\t\n\nTABLE 1.- SCHEDULE FOR NASA/ESA JOINT ASSESS MISSION\n11174\n\nILESTL1JE\t\n\nJ.4uAT1Y FEBRUARY\t\n\nPflL1r.1Ir%R y C000EPTS\n.1ELTI\'G - A9C\t\n\nMARCH\t\n\nAPR IL\t\n\nMAY\t\n\nJLJNE\t\n\nJULY\t\n\nr\n\nAUGUST SPT11ER OCTOBER \'- 0vEr,1Uc-1 DCEr,i1R\n\nAL\n\nA\nESA EkP7flIET.S SEJ.CTED\nj1ETIG :1\t FA71. 1-10\nL11\' EPTS .U\'I\'ROIJFD\nJVETATCRAILlRI?A\nTICIN MEETING - ARC\n\nIA\nNASA ESA MISS1UNI ,1;flE7\nSCHEOUL AD ,1IS5I0 PLAIN\nISSUED\n\nA\n\n01 EX p EF1I.1ErTs SELECTELI\t\nISSI0L4I\\G GR0J1\' y,IE\xe2\x82\xacT\nI07 -3 r.osA 110 ExPCnIr.ErT \t\n10PEF1TC1RS SELECTED\nEUR E.!5 lr[STIG\'lroFls .1EE.\t\n- r00fl11,.IJK\t\nIESTEC\n\nA\nA\n\nEXPEP.EFT i!lSSHIPPEL1 70\nvTU07TQ10;\nli S IOVESTIGATOS1\nFA\'.1ILI.fllZATI0 JEETII04\t\nNASIA EtJ\'oI\'. 10 U\nX.0VEST\n\n.RC\n\n5\n\nE0 THAIrX.1 0 STARTS\t\nT P1 LJJ10FlT0l11E1\n\nA\n\n.ISSI0\' PLIG GROUP\nEETIF\'.0 --4 -fA1fl6\n11 EELJR3PEA\t\n1EETI04 PARIS\t\n\nES1IGAT0E11\n\nTF14I\'00 1-L1S P\t\nEVILUATIO. 1:IIITL l :)uF\nF\'11EL17,\'l15PV FLIGHT TEST (17\nTELESCOPE CAVITV\n\nA\nA\n\nTABLE 1.- SCHEDULE FOR NASA/EA JOINT ASSESS MISSION - Concluded\nILESTO.\'S\n\nAPJIIL\t\n\nJAF.LJRV FEBRUARY MARCH \t\n\nIrVE5T1TOiSSUBMT ADDAS \t\nSOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS\n\nMAY\t\n\nJUNE\t\n\nJULY\n\n\t\n\nAUGUST SEPmJBERI OGT5ER rovEr:EF4 DECEM!PJ\n\nA\n\nMISSION PLANNING GROUP\nMEETING 5 - ARC\t\n\nA\n\nE)cPT.

During this\ntime, they also worked with the PIs in setting up final details of desired\nflight plans for data flights.\nOn the four flights before the simulation week, the Mission Manager and\nhis assistant were responsible for all flight details that pertained to the\nexperimenters. Only the Mission Manager f1e on the five flights during the\nweek of the Spacelab simulation. Ile acted as the Spacolab Mission Specialist\nand was confined with the four EOs. For this period, the Mission Manager was\nassisted by the Mission Scientist, who was located at the Mission Operations\nCenter. The P1 data flights following the simulation period were directed by\nas in the first four flights.\nthe Mission Manager and his assist\t\nTho Mission Manager was not involved in detailed plan\t\nfor the\ne1ectrom.gnetic interference (EMI) measurements, which were :de under the\ndiieetion of ESTEC engineers before and after the simulation period. Ile did,\nhowever, arrange for space for one rack of instrumentation and schedule the\nEMI tests so that they did not interfere with other mission functions.\nMission Scientist\nThe Mission Scientist was selected froin the ASO to WOTk with the PIs\nduring the simulation period. He was the "on-ground\' coordinator and arbiter\nof science planning for the simulation flights; final approval of tho unified\nflight requirements remained with the Mission Manager. This delegation of\nresponsibility relieved him of much planning detail, reduced the number of\nactive interfaces demanding his attention, and allowed flight operations\nplanning to begin early in tfle day when the confined crew was still asleep.\nEO and P1 Roles\nDuring the preparatory period of the mission, the PIs\' primary\nresponsibility was the development and fabrication of their experimental\neqLpment. A special responsibility of the PIs for the Joint Mission was the\ndevelopment and implementation of training plans for the EOs. During the\nexperiment integration period, the individual Pis again had primary responsibility for each experiment. The EOs assisted them in various ways as needed\nand used this period to further their familiarization with the equipment.\nAfter the experiments were installed on the aircraft, te flOs assisted the\nPis in the checlout process, which was followed by a period of experiment\n\noperation on the ground. The latter was intended primarily for P1 instruction\nof the EOs in experiment operation, but the time was largely usurped by the\nPIs for final experiment alignment and checkout.\nThe PIs whose experiments involved more than one organization had the\nadditional responsibility of coordinating the separate portions of their\nexperiment. For the Meuclon/Groningen portions of a three-way cooperative\neffort, this task generally was performed satisfactorily, except that the\nthird participant (ficm Ames) was not informed about an interference with the\ndewar mounting tha wss discovered by the European coexperimenters. The Ames\nexperimenter, who also had to attach a dewar to the Meudon telescope, rediscovered the difficulty much later. The JPL/Alaska/Colorado experiment,\ninvolving three widely separated organizations, suffered from a lack of communication aiong the participants. Mechanical mounting problems were not\nsettled until after the start of the experiment integration period, despite\nextreme effort by the Mission Manager.\nExperiment operation during the simulation period was the responsibility\nof the LOs. The PIs on the ground planned the observations for each flight\nand analyzed the data from each in a preliminary manner as a guide to planning\nfor the following flight. During the data flights following the simulation\nperiod, the PIs . perated their experiments in the usual manner. On a few of\nthese flights, one or more of the 130s flew aa member of a P1 team and\nassisted in experiment operation.\nMission Operations Manager\nThe Mission Operations Manager directed a ground-based mission operations\ncenter (MOC), which was set up only for the simulation period and staffed 24\nhr per day. The MOC housed the Mission Operations Manager, the PIs, the Mission Scientist, and the NASA/ESA panel (fig. 4). The operations manager also\nwas responsible for the maintenance and operation of the communications with\nthe aircraft, and the provision of necessary supplies such as cryogenics and\nmeals for the confined personnel. He led the daily debriefings before and\nafter each flight and was responsible for the transfer of data between the\naircraft and the ground.\n\nMission Documentation and Reviews\n\nDocumentation\nThe program was operated with a minimum of documentation. Solicitation\nof ESA experiments was by formal Announcement of Flight Opportunity (AFO) in\nlate February 1974. NASA Headquarters solicitation was conducted informally\namong interested members of the scientific community. Experimenters submitted\nproposals describing their experiments and objectives for consideration.\nSuccessful proposers were notified by letter from ESA or NASA.\nThe two control documents were the CV-990 Experimenters\' Handbook (ref.\n13) which is similar to the Spacelab Payload Accommodation Handbook (ref. 14),\n11\n\nand the Mission Operating Plan (MOP), prepared by the Mission Manager. The\nCV- 0 90 Experimenters\' Handbook, which was given to all experimenters soon after\n-ir selection, describes the aircraft and its facilities, specifies special\nrequirements to be met by the P1 on the mounting of the equipment in the aircraft, and gives a general description of the aircraft as a laboratory environment. This document provided sufficient information on matters of general\ninterest but lacked certain specific information on interface control. In\nparticular, safety requirements were not covered in sufficient detail to enable\nthe first-time experimenter to proceed with confidence, and it was necessary to\nseek clarification from the Mission Manager. The MOP detailed the experiments\nto be flown, and described the mission management and organization, following\nthe directives of the MPG. The MOP was issued in November 1974 for distribution at the November MPG and Experimenters\' meeting in Paris. A revised plan\nwas issued in January 1975. Significant mission documentation is reviewed in\nappendix E.\nImplementation documents were initiated by the Wssion Manager, and by\nthe PIs at his request. Two Experimenters\' Bulletins were issued in March\nand April 1975 to update mission plans and progress; to outline the information that would be needed for the experiment readiness review; to request\nfinal status on experiment support required from the airborne central data\nsystem, flight data systems, and aircraft electrical power systems; and to\nreview special ASSESS-related information requests. Other management documents were aircraft flight plans, approvals by the Airworthiness and Flight\nSafety Review Board, an experiment integration schedule, and various Ames\norders and records.\nImplementing documents requested of the PIs dealt with experiment\naccommodations and E0 training. Preliminar y sketches of the assembled experiment and component descriptions were due in July, with detailed drawings (or\nsketches) and stress analyses of mounting hardware in early December. Documentation of software requirements for the onboard data system and ASO-.\nsupplied support equipment were to be completed by February. 130 training\nplans, evaluation criteria, and training milestone charts were requested by\nmid-December.\nASSESS-specific documentation that had no direct bearing on the conduct\nof the mission was deferred until arrival at Ames. The 130s, with the aid of\nthe Pis, preparei extensive detailed information on the experiments during the\ninstallation and checkout period. This information included experiment development descriptions, changes made for this missici, lists of individual components with their dimensions and electrical parameters, and special tool and\nsupply lists for each experiment. The 10s, with P1 assistance, also prepared\ndetailed procedures for the operation of the experiments.\nReviews\nPour management reviews of mission preparations were conductJ covering\nall aspects of the operation, from the individual experiment to the conduct\nof the overall mission. Their subjects and timing were as follows:\n\n13\n\n1.\n\nExperiment readiness reviews (ERR), late March to early April\n\n2.\n\nPlight safety briefing (PSB), April 20\n\n3.\n\nAirworthiness and Flight Safety Review Board (AFSRB), May 16\n\n4.\n\nMission readiness review (MRR), M.y 29.\n\nExperiment Readiness Review. Early ASSESS program experience demonstrated\nthe nod for a program milestone, scheduled about one month prior to experiment\nshipment, to assure timely completion of experiment preparation. Accordingly,\nthe ERR concept (a Mission Manager function) was applied in two Spacelah simulation missions prior to the Joint Mission (refs. 8 .-. 10), By the end of March\neach experiment for the Joint Mission was to be assembled, tested, and integrated into the standard experiment racks. The Hs were also to provide final\ndefinition of GFB support requirements, experimenter-provided supplies and\ntest equipment, and procedures to counteract equipment malfunctions during the\nmission. The ERR included a review of UO training status and final program\ncontent to assure adequate preparation, particularly with respect to integrated\nmission simulation. Experiment readiness reviews are considered in more\ndetail in the next section.\nPlight Safety Briefing. The FSB is a normal safety procedure for all\nairborne science missions. This briefing was required for all \xe2\x80\xa2loint. Mission\npersonncl who would fly in any phase of the mission, and served to acquaint\nthem with normal safety practice in the aircraft environment, to define procedures developed to assure the safe operation of specific experiments, and\nto explain and demonstrate the use of emergency equipment. The FSB was\nchaired by the Mission Manager and scheduled for the later stages of experiment\nintegration when safety equipment had been positioned in the cabin.\nAirworthiness and Flight Safety Review Board. The AFSRB is the final\nauthority on safety for all airborne science missions and must give written\napproval before fli ghts begin. The board consists of experts in several\npertinent disciplines appointed by Ames management, and has broad overall\nresponsibility for all aspects of flight safety. Safety preparations for the\nJoint Mission followed normal ASO procedures. Day-to-day decisions were made\nby the Mission Manager with the support of the Airworthiness Assurance Office\n(AAO) of the Ames Aircraft Operations Division. Unique experiment requirements, special procedures, and long lead-time designs were reviewed by the\nboard well ahead of the formal premission review on May 16. At the May 16\nmeeting, the Mission Manager reviewed the details of each experiment installation, the flight schedule and associated plans, and any special arrangements\n(e.g., living accommodations) peculiar to the mission. His presentation was\nsupported by design specialists, flight planners, operations personnel, and\nthe command pilot for in-depth response to board inquiries.. PIs and EOs were\nnot present at the review. As a result of excellent coordination innong the\nMission Manager, AAO engineers, and the AI 7SRB during earlier stages of mission\npreparations, the overall plan was accepted by the hoard with only minor\nchanges related to the safety of the confined simulation crew.\nFollowing the third flight of the presimulation checkout period, the\nboard met again to consider procedural changes requested bv the Mcudon P1 to\n14\n\nfacilitate operation of the Meudon/Groningen experiment. Approval was given\nto operate with a rnylar cover over the telescope port and for limited overwater\nflights.\nMission Readiness Review. The MRR was held by the Mission Manager on\nMay 29 to assess the status of experiments and EUs at the completion of the\nscheduled chec1out and training flights. With few exceptions, rioither Pis nor\nEOs had completed their preparations. By urgent request, an additional equipment checkout flight was scheduled for the PIs, while arrangements were made\nfor intensive on- . ground training of EOs on each of the three days remaining\nbefore the simulation period. Thls review is discussed in more detail under\nMISSION GROUND OPERATIONS.\nPAYLOAD I)EVELOPMENT\nA nucleus of three European experiments was chosen on the grounds of\ndevelopmental status, scientific desirability, and Spacelab compatibility.\nThis payload nucleus was complemented by the choice of three compatible U.S.\nexperiments, one of which comprised three individual experiments that were\ndeveloped independently but intended for operation as a single integrated\nexperiment. The sharing of basic experiment hardware created complex requirements for programmed interchange of sensors on a priority basis by the EOs\nduring the flight period, just as may be expected on Spacelab.\nThe six experiments are summarized in table 2. Two Involved more than\none research organization. The first was a spontaneous alliance of coinvostigators, while the second resulted from NASA\'s combining two separate proposals.\nThis section provides a brief discussion of objectives, pla.nning criteria,\nand procedures for experiment design and development; a description of each\nexperiment, its preparation for the mission, and its readiness review status\nprior to shipment to Ames; and a brief evaluation of management effectiveness\nin the planning and development of the overall mission scientific payload.\n\nObjectives, Guidelines, and Procedures\nOne of the objectives of the Joint ASSESS Mission was to "evaluate\ndesign approaches for Spaceab experiments\' 111 terms of the overall method\napplied and the instrumentation design. The experiment development period\nextended from the selection date until the experiment readiness review (ERR),\nat which time all equipment changes, component verification, assembly, and\nbench testiiig of the complete experiment were scheduled for completion. Integration into standard racks would be completed, or nearly so, with only such\ntasks as final adjustment and calibration remaining to be done. In Spacelab\nterminology, this is the Level IV integration task as defined in the section\non MISSION GROUND OPERATIONS in this report.\nPlanning Criteria\nP1 planning was guided by several principles and requirements, summarized\nbelow:\n15\n\nTABLE 2. - EXPERIMENTS FOR CV-990 NASA/ESA ASSESS MISSION\nCode\number\n\nOrganization\t Instrumentation\nE\n\nEl\nCNRS-Verrires\t\nUniversity of Groningen \t\n\nMeasurement\n\nT00-cm Cassegrain\ntelescope with\nfilter wheel IR\nphotometer\nCooled (? bolometer\n\nHigh-resolution mapping of dark clouds\nand 1111 regions\n\nE2\n\nQueen Mary College\t\n\nlPolarizing inter1 fcrometr\nCooled Go holometer\n\nIR emission spectrum\nof upper atmosphere\n\nE3\t\n\nUniversity of\t\nSouthampton\t\n\njImaging Isocon TV\ncamera\nIR photometer\nAll-sky camera\n\nObservation of OH\nairglow clouds\n\nUSI\t\n\nNASA-Ames Research\t\nCenter\t\n\n30-cm Cassegrain\t\ntelescope (Moudon)\t\nwith variable\t\nfilter-wedge\nspect rometer\nI Coolod InSb detector\n\nNear IR spectra of\nVenus and Late type\nstars\n\nU32\t\n\nNASA-Jet Propulsion \t\nLahoratory\t\n\nTunable acoustooptical filter\nspectrometers (2)\nwith telescopes\n\nUniversity of Alaska\t\n\n1-m Ehert-Fastie\nspectrometer,\ntelescope and stabilized mirror\n\nUV visible, and near\nIR measurements of\natmospheric transparency, solar flux\nplanetary atmospheres, and interstellar molecules\n\nUniversity of Colorado\t\n\n12.5-cm Ebert-Fastie\nspectrometer\n\nUS3\t\n\nUniversity of New Mexico 35-mm camera with IR\nimage intensifier\n16-mm camera with\nimage intensifier\nfor time-lapse\nphotography\nFilter-wheel IR\nPhotometer\n\n16\n\nIR photography of OH\nairglow clouds\n\n1.\n\nModifications necessary to meet aircraft and/or Spacelab simulation\nconstraints must not invalidate the scientific significance of the\nexperiment.\n\n2.\n\nManpower required to operate and maintain the experiment should be\ncompatible with IO assignments and time-sharing agreements.\n\n3.\n\nControls, status indiators, and monitor devices should be centrally\nlocated for ease of operation. It is expected that experiment groups\nunder the purview of one EO will be controlled from one location. It\nis suggested that elements of control and status for the entire\npayload be coordinated for display on one central panel.\n\n4.\n\nExperiments should utilize the central airborne computer for recording\nand processing data, insofar as this facility will benefit the overall\nscience effort.\n\n5.\n\nExperiments should he configured to protect against electromagnetic\ninterference (EMI) from aircraft support and communication systems,\nand from other experiments in the payload. [)efini ive measurements\nof the EMI environment should be made for the integrated payload.\n\nDevelopment Requirements\nTable 3 summarizes the initial status and subsequent development of the\nexperiments; for clarity, the three parts of experiment 13S2 are listed separately for a total of eight table entries (individual experiments). The\ninitial status of the selected experiments varied widely from design studies\nto equipment with several years\' history of operation. Three of the eight\nindividual experiments in the payload were proposed by experimenters who had\nbeen involved in previous airborne research, with this or a similar experiment.\nSeven normally required more than one operator.\nThe scheduled period of development, from selection to the ERR, was 11\nmonths for ESA and 7 for NASA experiments and experimenter teams ranged from 1\nto 13 persons. Only one group finished on time, although four others were\nreasonably close to completion of their development tisks. The two U.S.\ngroups that developed flight experiments from"scratch" required more than 7\nmonths development time. As the on-site integration and checkout period drew\nto a close, some two months after the ERR, so,-on of the eight individual\nexperiments were in full operation, although two had not yet achieved the\ndesired quality of scientific measurements. The eighth experiment was partly\noperational, but continued to have problems to the very end of the postsimulation period.\nTable 3 also indicates the categories of experiment development effort\nthat were of greatest concern to the Pis: improving experiment science potential, meeting flight environment constraints, and providing data-handling\nmethods for P1 and HO evaluation. Most of the PIs introduced some automation\nto reduce EO workload. The Meudon/(roningen group was outstanding in this\neffort and succeeded in reducing the manpower required for experiment operation from three to one. However, relatively little was done to ease 130 tasks\nby centralized controls and simplified servicing/maintenance operations. Much\nneeded planning for E0 and equipment time sha-\'ing was virtually ignored by the\nPIs until the last few days before the simulation period began.\n17\n\n\t\n\nTABLE 3. - OVERVIEW OF EXPERIMENT DEVELOPMENT\n\nFpt\n\n1\n\niD\t\n\n11\t\n\n1\t\n\n1 r!_1\t\n\nk\n\n1\t\n1:\t\n\n..........-\n\n.\n\n1\t\n\n-\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\n1\t\n\nj\n\n1\n\n1\t\n\n1\t\n\nr\t\n\n1\t\n\n1\t\n\n1\t\n\n.c,\n\n-\t\n\n2\t\n\n1\t\n\n1\t\n\n11\t\n\n:1\t\n\n-\n\n1\t\n\n1\n\n-\t\n1\t\n\n1\t\n\n-\n\n1\t\n\n-\t\n\n1.\t\n\n1\t\n\nJI\n\niiimV1.71-\t\n\t\n\n1\t\n\n1\t\n\n- 1\t\n\n1\t\n\nT\n+\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\t\n\xe2\x80\x94 \xc2\xb1\t\n\n1\xe2\x80\x94i\n\ncc\n\n\t\n\n- c;.\'r.rt tt.c-p1r1.1\t\n\n.1\t L1i\t\n\n.:71.:11,\t\n.1\t\n\n1\xe2\x80\x94 -\n\ncf\nc\n\n.irt .1\n\ntet\t\n\n, :., t&\t\n\nr.ti,.::\t\n\n-\t\n.1,1\t 1.\t I,telItD1I\t\n\n.V:i\t\n\n1\t\n\n1\n\n\t\n\nG2\t\n\nt,1r1L-i.\t\n\n1\t\n\nlj:1:.In.l\t\n\n1\t\n\ntt.1\t\n\n1\t\n\n1ti:\n\n1\n\n5.\t 1:11 :r,li,:::.tnrt.i.\n.11 11\t\n\nII.5 tI 1\t\n\n.111,1,\t c-\t\n\n1\t\n\n1.\t 15111\t\n\n1\',\n\nExperiment Readiness Reviews\nAs in earlier Lear Jet simulation missions (refs. 8, 9, 10), aformal\nprocedure of reviewing experiment readiness was followed. One such review\nfor each experiment took place prior to shipment to A\'es. The main objectives\nwere:\n1.\n\nTo establish readiness status of the experimenter in terms of\navailable hardware, layout and mounting within aircraft racks,\nmounting provisions for sensors and equipment outside standard\nmounting racks, system checkout, and safety\n\n2.\n\nTo determine\nASO\n\n3.\n\nTo define final interface requirements for power and data\n\n4.\n\nTo determine flight route requirements\n\n5.\n\nTo review EO training status.\n\nsupport equipment to he provides by the P1 and by the\n\nThese topics were set down in a detailed outline and circulated to the PIs in\nadvance of the meeting to make them aware of the type and level of detail of\nthe information to be requested of them.\nIn the United States, the ERRs took the form of conference telephone calls\nto the experimenter at his home laboratory, and included the Mission Manager,\nhis assistant, and the responsible Ames engineering and safety personnel. In\nEurope, the reviews were conducted at the various laboratories by the chief of\nthe ESA ASSESS planning group. No engineering or safety consultants from\nAnes could be included in the ESA reviews, however, because of NASA travel budget restrictions, and basic structural design errors were still present in some\nexperiments when shipped. As a result, some mounting fixtures and experiment\nhardware required modification after receipt at Ames. These last minute modifications were performed successfully, showing that if similar situations\nshould arise during Spacelab preparations, effective measures could be taken if\nadequate support personnel were available.\nEven though the reviews were held in late March and early April, only\nthree or four weeks before shipment to Ames, the focus o c the reviews was not\na positive statement of present experiment readiness (as it should have been),\nbut rather was an assurance that remaining tasks could be completed in time to\nmeet the integration schedule at Ames. P1 responses to this inquiry were\naffirmative; nevertheless, most experimenters continued with modifications and\nadjustments up to the beginning of the simulation period. At the time of the\nERR only the Meudon/Groningen and Queen Mary College experiments had been\nfully mounted in the ASO standard equipment racks.\n\n19\n\nThe Experiments\nMeudon/Groziingen (Jil)\nScientific discipline:\n\nIR astronomy\n\nScientific objectives:\n\nHigh-rcsolutiori mappinj of dark clouds and liTi regions\n\nParticipating\norganizations:\n\nObservatoire de Meudon (Prance)\nCNRS-Verrires (Prance)\nUniversity of Groningen (The Nether1ans)\n\nprimary instrumentation: 4-channel 111 photometer mounted on 30-cm Cassegrain\ntelescope\nObservational bandwidths: 17-20 im, 30-38 pm, 70-95 pm, and 114-106 im\nDescription. This basic scientific experiment was designed to further\nunderstanding of early star formation from dark clouds of material that are\nstrong iR emitters. The cloud near the star p Ophiuchi is an excellent subject\nfor study because of its relative closeness and low temperature.\n\nthe\n\nThe experiment utilized the Meudon telescope and\nGroningen photometer\n(fig. 5), both controlled by the experimenter\'s computer. The photometer was\nset to detect radiation in one of the wavebands\nabove, and the region\nof sky near the telescope pointing direction was mapped by raster scanning\nthe telescope. Then the photometer was automatically reset to another waveband and the process repeated. The detector was a germanium holorneter maintained at 2.4 K by a dewar of liquid helium. Incoming radiation was chopped\nby an oscillating secondary mirror. The detected signal was amplified and\nsynchronously measured by conventional electronic circuitry. Data were\nrecorded in digital format on magnetic tape. The \'pen-port telescope pointed\nat 330 \xc2\xb1 40 and was gyrostabilized to an accuracy of 15 arcsec with 5 arcsec\nattainable by complex data processing. A TV camera and monitor were used fo\nfinding and tracking, and could be locked to a target for automatic tracking.\nThe TV signal was also recorded on magnetic tape. A more detailed description\nof experiment components, the arrangement in the standard racks, the power\nrequired, etc., will be found in appendix B to this report, published under\nseparate cover.\n\nnoted\n\nDevelopment. The system consisted of a telescope mou1ited in a special\ncavity, four standard racks, and one low-boy rack. The telescope, its basic\ncontrols, and TV pointing and tracking system were originally developed in\n1971. This experiment configuration was operated on more than 20 flights of\na French Caravelle research aircraft in 1973 and 1974. Since normal crew\ncomplement on these flights was three experimenters, substantial additional\nautomation was required for the Joint ASSESS Mission to permit operation by\nu single iO. Servo performance in the tracking loop was improved to require\nless attention to long-term drift; selection of tracking modes was automated\nwith a single switch control; displays of experiment operational modes were\nimproved; and a PDP-. 11 computer was added to operate on the data and to give\na visual display of scanning inforrnation. Electronic components and panels\nwere mounted with insulators to meet flSTEC EMT specifications; single-point\n20\n\ngrounding was implemented. A new telescope mount was constructed to fit the\novcrwing hatch of the CV-990 (fig. 6), and new support brackets for tle telescope were fabricated to carry the weight of the device on the seat rails\n(fig. 7).\nThe Croningen detector system was originally used on a balloon-supported\ntelescope. The only modification needed for this application was to make a\nnew bracket to attach the detector/dewar to the French telescope.\nThe installation of this equipment in the Caravelle utilized conventional\ntall electronic equipment racks, permitting a centralized grouping of most controls. Use of the standard CV-990 racks for the Joint Mission, however, made it\nimpossible to group all of the controls in a zing1e location for efficient operation by a single EO. Thus, primary operating controls were centered in one\nlocation (fig. 8), with peripheral control groups for major subsystems. Telescope controls were grouped in a rack adjacent to the telescope (fig. 9) and\ndetector controls were in a second rack (behind the operator). Other data system components were positioned in two other racks (figs, 10 and 11).\nNo problem from aerodynamic turbulence in the telescope cavity was anticipated on the CV-990 installation. Figure 12 is a photograph of the telescope\nport with the Meudon fence. As it turned out, there was a serious gtiidane\nproblem caused by aerodynamic effects, that was resolved with a mylar cover on\nthe port opening during the simulation period (fig. 13), and by the installation of an Ames designed aerodynamic fence (fig. 14) late in the postsimul.ation\nflight series.\nExpiment Readiness Review, April 1, This experiment was well developed\nfor airborne science at the time of selection and was completely assembled and\noperational in time for the ERR. No further development of electronic or\nother equipment was required during the integration period at Ames.\n111 subsystems had been tested in the laboratory and the dewar/photometer\ntested in flight for mechanical and electrical interference. Level IV itegration with EMI isolation was nearly finished, and the only remaining work\nwas the mounting of an analog and a video recorder on the low-boy rack. A\nmaintenance plan was developed and implemented with spares and support equipment. (\'IPE support requirements were clearly defined. P1 concern with temperature and vibration in the aircraft environment could not be resolved until\nthe checkout flights. Data logging was all self-contained, except that units\nperipheral to the aircraft central computer (ADDAS) were to be used to record\none analog signal and to make hard copies of the CRT graphic display.\nBoth the primary and secondary European EOs had received considerable\ntraining prior to the ERR, and future sessions had been scheduled for their\noperation of the entir g system. The two U.S. EOs were not available for\ninstruction. The primary European LO requested that the P1 prepare a datalogging sheet and establish a suitable format for star-recognition patterns.\nIle felt capable of repairing the electronic equipment to the electronic card\nlevel and requested that the P1 prepare that level of reference material for\nmaintenance. Preliminary timelines were on hand, along with directions for\nevaluating data quality.\n22\n\nQueen Mary College (E2)\nScientific discipline:\n\nAtmospheric physics\n\nScientific objectives:\n\nEmission spectra of the upper atmosphere\n\nParticipating organization:\n\nQueen Mary College, University of London\n(England)\n\nPrimary instrumentation:\n\nPolarizing interferometer (including internal\ntemperature references)\n\nObservational bandwidth:\n\n40 iim to 2 mm\n\nDescription. This experiment provided absolute measurements of\nconcentrations and temperatures of various molecular components of the atmosphere. The instrument was a two-beam interferometer based on polarizing\noptics. The two signals compared were the atmospheric emission and the calibration sources (alternately liquid nitrogen and water ice temperatures). A\nrotating polarizer, used as a chopper, produced an alternating signal proportional to the difference between incident and reference radiation. The signal\nwas demodulated by standard methods to produce an interferogram; the desired\nspectrum is the Fourier transform of this interfero r ram. The detector was a\nliquid-helium-cooled (2 K) germanium boloineter.\nThe amplified and detected data signals were digitized and recorded on\nthe aircraft ADDAS equipment, which performed real-time Fourier transforms in\nflight. Detailed postflight data processing was performed by the Ames IBM-360.\nOptical path stabilization was achieved by first reflecting the incident\nradiation from a roll-stabilized mirror. Roll compensation signals came from\nthe aircraft inertial navigation system (INS).\nDevelopment. The polarizing interferometer (fig. 15) has heen used for\nground-based measurements since 1970, and improvements have continued as part\nof a normal development process. Although the equipment had never been flown\nbefore the Joint Mission it had been used at a h h-altitude Alpine location\nin 1974. Improvements made for the Joint Mission included the addition of a\nhigher resolution mirror drive, a better temperature control for the detector\ncryostat (dewar), better regulated power supplies, and faster sampling in the\ndata system. An IR-transmitting window port (fig. 16) with surface thermocouples was designed and fabricated at Ames as requested by the P1.\nThe experiment was designed for normal operation with continuous\nattention from one experimenter. In normal operation, a mirror travels the\nlength of a long lead screw, the drive for which must be stopped before it\njams. The lack of limit switches for this function presented scheduling difficulties for a single E0 who had to operate two other experiments at the same\ntine.\nFigure 17 shows the experiment electronics mounted in a standard rack in\nthe aircraft. ESTflC EMI requirements were followed in Level 1V integration.\nHowever, the experimenters\' unfamiliarity with the aircraft environment (in\n31\n\nan EMI sense) led to problems in flight with radiated interference from\naircraft radio traT1 .ittors.\nFrom the standpoint of ground-based science, this experiment was in a\nwell-developed state at the time of selection. Modifications to meet flight\nand simulation constraints were completed before shipment to Ames. The two\nproblems noted above were identified by the EO during the simulation period.\nExperiment Readiness Review, March 25. At the time of the ERR, a\nsufficient selection of hardware items was on hand to assemble and complete\nthe experiment package and Level TV integration was completed, with EMI isolation from the structure. However, several replacement components had not\nyet been delivered, including an improved black body and dewar. The P1 planned\nto substitute these for existing units, which then would serve as backup\nequipment in the event of a failure. Similarly, i cw drive system "as t\', be\ninstalled at which time the complete experiment would be tested in the flight\nconfiguration. Earlier tests on a prototype experiment had shown 13M1 from\ncommercial TV stations, but the problem was not expected to carry over into\nthe flight experiment.\nData recording and analysis were not so well worked out. AUDAS would be\nthe primary data logger, but arrangements had not been finalized for real-time\nor near-real-time, quick-look data reduction on ADDAS or comprehensive data\nreduction between flights. Software to prepare spectral plots on an IBM-360\nhad been contracted but not yet delivered. Components and some data subsystems\nhad been tested.\nTraining of the European primary and backup EOs was in progress and would\ncontinue during operations at Ames, when the second backup ED from the U.S.\nwould do all of his training. The EOs were in the process of making chocklists and timelines. Procedures for maintenance and repair were well along,\nincluding tool selection and identification of support equipment.\nUniversity of Southampton (133)\nScientific discipline:\t\n\nAtmospheric physics\n\nScientific objective:\t\n\nObservation of 011 airglow clouds to determine wind\nvelocities at a1tituths between 85 and 110 Jcm.\n\nParticipating organization: University of Southampton (England)\nPrimary instrumentation: \t\n\n\t\nQbservationa 1. bandwidth:\n\nImage Isocon TV camera system (65 0 window), 1800\nFOV camera (zenith window), photometer (650\nwindow)\n650-950 mn (near Ifl)\n\n1)escr2tion. This experiment was planned to measure motion of 0U airglow\nclouds for a far greater period of time than can he achieved with sounding\nrocket cheIa1 tril. Such inirrnation will aid in filling a large gap in\npresent moLls of global winds.\t\n\n35\n\nThe primary instrumentation consisted of an image Isocon TV camera, its\ncontrol circuitry, and a recorder (fig. 18). The photrcathode of the camera\ncuts off at about 950 nm, and a filter wa used to cul off encrcy shorter than\n650 nin. Integration times were generally on the order of 10 see, although up\nto 2 min could be used. The integrated pictures were read out during -a\nTV scan and recorded on a video recorder. A crrtal-controlled 011z power\nsupply was provided to maintain European TV standards of 1/50 sec scan time and\n625 lines. The TV camera data a\'e being coordinated with the record front\na11-sky camera, which utilizes IR film and exposuro; of 5 to ID min.\nDevelopment. Initial ground use of this basic systcffl was made in 1973\nand 1974 on field trips to Norway. For the Joint Mission, substantial additions\nto existing equipment werc\' necessary to implement mission guidelines, and to\nobtain reference measurements for field intensity and spatial distribution.\nThe primary TV system was upgraded as follows. The canra control unit was\nmodified to permit integration of the picture over eVeiti frames, and thc\nvideo tape recorder was modified to handle data at the reduced fr\'me rate. A\nsmall TV monitor allowed real-time evaluaflLn of observation \t\nA disc storage\nunit was added to the data-recording system to permit continuous viewing of\nthe intermittent, slow- frame-rate irnages. A time-co r.ie generator was devclopcd\nand added to the system to place time markers on the TV picturo.\nTo permit viewing of the data with normal European TV standards, a 50.-11z\npower supply was provided. A special support was built to position the TV\ncamera at a 650 elevation optical window in the aircraft. Auxiliary instruments, an all-sky camera and a photometer (fig. 1fl, were added to the expr\nment for spatial coordination and intensity calibration, respectively.\nThe prime E0 for this experiment worked closely with he experimenters as\na de facto member of their team, both at the home laboratory and at Ain, and\nthus contributed diroctiv to the development and integration of the equipment.\nThis experiment was not fully completed before shipment. Iuring the integration period at Ames the TV camera support was streiigthned to meet aircraft\nload factors, electronic circuitry was finished and detail of Level TV integration were corrected to meet both safety regulations and EMI requirements.\nThese sorts of activities during final integration are not uncommon in ASO\nprograms, particularly when the experimenter has had no prior flight\nexperience.\nBecause this teain was unfamiliar with the design and operatinc constraints\nof the flight environment, extensive written communications were required with\nthe Mission Manager and his staff during the laboratory devoiopnient period.\nEven so, the problems encountered in adapting a ground-based experiment for\nairborne use (with added LMI requirement5) were not completel y reo1ved.\nClearly, however, these problems could have been avoided or reoIvec1 oarly in\nthe development period had an kmes des ign/airworthinoss engineer visited the\nPi\'s laboratory.\nExperiment Readiness Review, March 27, All hardware for tho 011t1ianipt on\nexperiment was oil\n\t at the 1RR. The electronic.,; were inminted in a standard\nCV-990 instrument rack with provisions for EMI isolation (fig. \t\n. The ISO-11)\ncamcra was to he mounted on top of a rack using a two-position 1 inkago (which\n\n36\n\nexisted as a drawing only) that would permit the unit to be lowered for\nconvenient servicing. System tests had been performed on the TV system, but\nsome of the electronics were being upgraded. The photometer was operating in\na breadboard state, and the Nikon camera needed a simple mounting bracket.\nExperiment maintenance plans were outlined and support equipment identified.\nAll data logging was to be done with experimenter\'s r rders. A request\nwas made for a special signal transmission line from the arcraft to the Mission Operations Center to be used after each simulation flight for copying the\nmagnetic data tape. Other GFE support requirements were defined.\nThe prime lO had been involved in assembly of the experiment, which\ncontributed to his understanding of the system. Training would continue with\nthe P1 and two EOs reviewing data obtained on earlier programs. The secondary\nHO from the United States would be trained at Ames. Final training was to be\nheld on the aircraft. Reference material was being assembled.

As a part of a general study,\ncertain Late-type stars available during the mission were also observed.\nThe experiment comprised a detector and a filter-wedge spectrometer\nmounted integral with a dewar, along with associated electronic circuitry.\nSeveral variations of this experiment have been flown many times on the Ames\nLear Jet with a similar IR telescope, and more recently on the Ames C-141 airborne observatory, to obtain similar measurements. The spectrum is swept by\npositioning different portions of a filter of varyL thickness at the telescope focus. An indium antimonide detector was used, cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature. The experiment was mounted on the Meudon telescope in-place\nof the Groningen photometer (fig. 21), but was not computer controlled. It\nwas necessary to rebaiance the telescope for operation of the Ames experiment.\n(See experiment El for telescope details.) Standard ac signal-processing\nequipment was supplied by the Ames group. Data were recordcd on the ADDAS\nmagnetic tape in digital format and on the GFE magnetic tape recorder in analog\nformat. This experiment presented an interesting shared use of a major piece\nof equipment.\n40\n\nDevelopment. From the science viewpoint, the experiment was well proven\nat the time of selection. The dewar was modified as necessary for mounting at\nthe focal point of theMoudon telescope, in a time-share arrangement with the\nGroningen dewar. Both experiments used the same telescope controls, while\nsignal electronics were entirely separate (fig. 22). New detector circuitry\nwas constructed for the Joint Mission to permit a similar, previously scheduled\nexperiment to fly in the C-141 in the same time period. Largely because of\nthis schedule conflict, the new electronic equipment was not completed until\nwell into the final integration. ESTEC EMI requests were implemented, however. The prime flO worked with the experimenter as an effective member of\nhis team in the final development testing.\nA mechanical interference between Ames dowar and the Heudon telescope\nmounting plate was found during final integration. The two research groups\nhad addressed dewar interchange problems in earlier communication, but their\nsolution was not properly expressed on the drawings furnished to the Ames P1,\nand additional machining was -required on the Ames dewar during integration.\nEporime: Readiness Review, April 18. The dewar/photomoter was assembled\nand operating, An adapter plate had been fabricated and was to be fitted to\nthe Meudon telescope on its arrival. All standard electronics subassemblies\nwere available, but the interconnecting control panel had not been fabricated.\nA backup dewar/photometer and some backup electronics were to be available\nunless required for research on the Ames C-141 airborne observatory during the\nsimulation period of the ASSESSmission. The analog output of the system was\nthe basic data stream and would be recorded on the central GFE unit peripheral\nto the ADDAS :)rstem.\nIn March, the primary and secondary EOs 11,-1 one day of training with\nsimilar electronics and the primary detector, using a reference body in the\nlaboratory. Plans for subsequent training included familiarization with the\nMeudon telescope systems, refresher training on the experiment, and preparation of operating and troubleshooting checklists.\nThe ERR for this experiment did not serve the intended purpose: equipment\nwas still being assembled, testing and calibration remained to be done, and\nLevel IV integration had not begun, although the experimenter\'s plans for\nintegration had been tentatively approved. It was apparent that scheduling\nhad been keyed to the first flight date rather than to the ERR. In the resulting rush to complete the system, there was insufficient time to isolate and\nrepair a microphonic condition within the dewar/detector unit. This problem\nwas still being investigated by the prime 130 during the simulation mission,\nand although some improvement was made, the malfunction was never eliminated.\n\n42\n\nJet Propulsion Laboratory,\nUniversity of Alaska, and\nUniversity of Colorado (US2)\nScientific disciplines:\n\nAtmospheric physics and astronomy\n\nScientific objectives\n\nUV, visible, and near IR measurements of\natmospheric transparency, solar flux, planetary\natmospheres, and interstellar molecules\n\nParticipating organizations: California Institute of Technology/JPL\nGeophysical Institute, University of Alaska\nUniversity of Colorado\nPrimary instrumentation:\n\n\t\n\nObservational bandwidths:\n\n\t\n\nTunable acousto-optical filter spectrometers (2)\n1-m Ebert-Pastie spectrometer\n12.5-cm Ebert-Fastie spectrometer\n290-900 nm\n\nDescription.

The incident radlatior is polarized, and then enters a crystal in which\na standing acoustic wave exists. Interaction between the acoustic wave and\nthe radiation signal produces a wavelength-dependent rotation of the plane of\npolarization.

The data record was on the\nADDAS magnetic tape.\nTo TAOFs were used, one in the near-UV range and one !il the \'visible\nrange, each located at the focus of a 20-cm Schmidt telescope. The UV TAOP\nwas used for observation of planetary atmospheres looking out of a 14\xc2\xb0 clevation window (fig. 23) and the visible TAOF was used to look upward through a\n650 elevation window for sky measurements (fig. 24).\nUniversity of Alaska.

Two devices were used simultaneously to position the\noptical path: a gyrostabilized mirror corrected fox motions about the center\nof gravity of the aircraft, and a star tracker adjusted the telescope secondary\nto keep the image centered on the spectrometer\'s slit.\nThe experiment was designed to obtain spectra of specific objects such as\nthe planet Venus, as well as spectra of skyglow. in viewing an astronomical\nobject, the spectrometer looked at the target out of a 14\xc2\xb0 window through the\ntelescope and gyrostabilized mirror (fig. 26). In the skyglow mode, the\ntelescope and mirror were not used, and the spectrometer looked out of a 65\xc2\xb0\nwindow using a plane mirror.\nUniversity of Colorado. The 12.5-"m Ebert-Fas t \'\t\nLctrometer is the\nprototype of a Pioneer Venus Orbiter instrument. Ith p.ration was similar\nto that of the l-m instrument except that data in the visible and UV channels\nwere taken simultaneously. Also, because of its initial purpose, the spectrometer was designed for remote control by a minicomputer having sum and display capabilities similar to those of the Alaska computer. Data were recorded\nin digital form with a dual-cassette tape recorder.\nInitially, this spectrometer was installed to time share the 35-cm Alaska\ntelescope and stabilized mirror (fig. 27). This arrangement proved unsatisfactory, however, because of the low optical quality of the telescope and the\ndifferent imaging requirements of the two instruments. Therefore, after the\nsimulation period, the Colorado instrument was moved so that it could time\nshare the UV TAOF Schmidt telescope and stabilized mirror (fig. 28).\nDevelopment. The three experiments described above wore to be combined\ninto a single integrated experiment with the investigator from JPL as the P1.\nEach portion was developed separately, howevor, and coordination among the\ninvestigators proved inadequate. Few attempts were made to coordinate controls\nor to simplify operation for the EO handling this equipment.\n.Jet Propulsion Laboratory. At the time of selection for the mission, the\n.JPL TAOF experiment existed only on paper, but it had sufficient potential in\ncombination with the other two elements of this group to justify its inclusion.\nThe proposed instruments were advanced state-of-the-art devices whose measurements, in part, could be compared with results from the more conventional\nspectrometers. The P1 had participated in one previous ASO flight, and the\nprimary HO had an extensive record in airborne astronomy. However, EO participation was delayed 4 months while a replacement was found for the originally\nselected EO.\nEarly development was severely handicapped by late delivery of one TAOP\nunit by the manufacturer. The TAN first entered the market in late 1974, and\nthe visible-light unit was delivered to JPL in January 1975. The corresponding\nUV unit was not delivered until May, after final integration had started.\n11e visible-light TAOF was tested in the JPL laboratories and at the JPL\nobservatory at Table Mountain, California, during January-March 1975.\n48\n\n1\n\nfl\n\n717 TWIN\n\n1\n\n4\n\n1j\n\n11\n\n4.k4I\n\njI\n\nJew\n\n-\t\n\n1\nr\n\nConventional analog circuitry, largely commercial laboratory equipment, was\nused during this portion of the development testing. Development and construction of the associated optical equipment proceeded at the same time, but satisfactory operation was not achieved during the initial test period. In April,\nthe electronic equipment was redesigned to digital circuitry, and the equipment\nwas tested again at the McDonald Observatory in Texas. It was this second\nconfiguration that was installed on the aircraft. The UV TAOF was delivered\nto the P1 too late to do any but the most elementary checkout and testing,\nalthough the electronic circuitry was ready and waiting. Plans for ADDAS\ncontrol of one TAOF were dropped as program delays mounted.\nbe\nattached to a 20-cm\nThe experiment concept called for each TAOF to\nSchmidt telescope. Neither had been tested as a complete unit prior to integration at Ames, however. Originally, the telescope holding the UV unit was\nto he manually tracked on astronomical objects such as the planet Venus. The\nmanual tracking procedure was immediately found to be impractical on the aircraft, and a gyrostabilized mirror was added following the simulation period.\nESTEC EMI requests were not implemented for this experiment, although the P1\nagreed with their purpose and value, particularly when EMI became a serious\nproblem for his experiment. Level TV integration, scheduled to take place\nbefore shipment, was largely implemented at Ames (fig. 29). At the request of\nthe P1, ASO provided all special equipment supports for the experiment.\nUniversity of Alaska. When selected, the Alaska experiment was a proven\nscientific concept. For the Joint Mission, it was to be implemented with more\nsensitive instrnents and equipped with an automated data-processing system to\npermit operation by a single EO. The basic instrument was a new 1-m spectrometer scheduled fr delivery in the fall of 1974. The telescope necessary for\nlight collectic and imaging was a borrowed unit, promised early in 1975 but not\navailable for setup in the laboratory until just before shipment to Ames.\nThe required stabilized mirror was furnished by the ASO. The experimenters\nwere basically familiar with this class of instrumentation, havir.g operated\nsimilar but smaller instruments for several years. Their experience also\nincluded flights on the CV-990.\nThe new data-handling system, which included a minicomputer, was developed\nfor the experiment in the early spring of 1975. Because of the delay with the\ntelescope and the complexity of software development for the data system, final\noptical alignment and checkout of the entire system was deferred until assembly\non the aircraft mounting structure at Ames during the integration period. The\nequipment was sent to Ames a week early to permit fabric on of special\nmounting brackets and to allow extra time for final ali gnnient, By mutual\nagreement, ASO provided all special supports for the experiment.\nThe prime (replacement) IO for this experi2"e;It was quite familiar with the\nspectrometer, having participated earlier in its devel. \t\n\' a consultant\nfor the manufacturer.

The final installation of Alaska\'s electronic systems is illustrated\nin figures 30 and 31. For whatever reason - perhaps previous ASO experience\nwas an influence - the PIs scheduled their full system verification tests during the integration period at Ames. This decision was not the best s in view\nof the delay in coordination among the three experiments in this group. Time\nwas short, and certain problems with optics and the data system were not\ncompletely solved before the simulation began. In fact, data system problems\npersisted throughout the simulation period.\nUniversity of Colorado. The 12.5-cm spectrometer was initially developed\nfor the Pioneer Venus Orbiter. Work on the prototype instrument began in\nJuly 1973, before the scheduled starting date for Pioneer, to permit observations on the newly discovered Comet Kohoutek. However, even with an acce1raLd\nschedule, construction and testing were not completed until June 1974, well\nafter the comet perihelion. As part of the development program of the Pioneer\ninstrument, the prototype spectrometer was subjected to operational, vibrational,\nand environmental testing. Tests involving operation of the entire experiment\nwere carried out (starting in March 1974) with the data-handling system\nemployed during the present mission, Between June and the start of active\npreparation for this mission in late 1974, the experiment was used successfully\nseveral times on mountain-based telescopes.\nPreparation for the present mission consisted only of some additional\noperational testing and the construction of supports required for mating the\nspectrometer to JPL or Alaska optical systems. As noted, no effort was made\nto coordinate controls with the other two experiments in this group, or to\nprovide specific EMI compatibility with other experiments or aircraft systems.\nLevel IV integration was planned in advance but not implemented until arrival\nat Ames (fig. 32).\nPlans for functional integration of the Alaska/Colorado experiments were\nfar from complete at the beginning of the final integration period. Arrangements for beam interception to permit time-sharing the 35-cm telescope with\nAlaska were completed before the checkout flight began (fig. 27), but the\narrangement was not satisfactory. The 35-cm telescope was of rather poor\noptical quality, and it was optically matched to the Alaska spectrometer, not\nthe 12.5-cm Colorado spectrometer. This unfortunate mismatch could not be\nremedied in time for the simulation period and detracted from the EO\'s\nperformance of his research assignment.\nDuring the simulation period, operation of the Colorado experiment was\nsimplified to the extent of using only the simplest computer programs - that\nis, those which summed spectra and recorded the results on magnetic tape.\nMany variations were available that also performed various aspects of spectral\nanalysis. The EOs were not requested to use the latter. As noted, the\nColorado experiment was reconfigured following the simulation period to time\nshare one of the JPJ, 20-cm telescopes with the 11V TAOF. Much improved data\nwere oEtained with this arrangement\n54\n\n\xe2\x80\xa21\n\nHO()d M 4fVd \'\n(11L 4i()\n\n1\n1\n\nExperiment Readiness Review, April 8. The JPL/Alaska/Colorado group of\nexperiments showed many loose ends at the ERR. Most of the custom mounting\nhardware was bing designed and built at Ames, and was in various stages of\ncompletion. Hating, assembly, and alignment of optical instruments was\ndeferred until final integration. Level TV integration was in progress at\nJPL, using standard CV-990 racks. Alaska and Colorado had ASO approval of\nLevel IV plans but would do the work at Ames.\nJPL had completed laboratory tests of one spectrometer, and the first of\na two-part test series at ground-. based observatories using prototype electronics. Final tests of the completed flight system were scheduled for mid-April.\nThe second spectrometer had been damaged in fabrication and delivery was\npromised in late April. The associated electronics were tested and ready. No\nspare components were available; some small parts would be furnished, but\nreliance on the primary equipment was mandatory.\nAlaska had completed testing on nearly all components and subsystems,\nand had been operating the spectrometer/computer complex in a real-time mode\nfor several months. Software development was in the final checkout stage.\nPreparations to control the GFE stabilized mirror with signals from a startracker unit were only beginning. No problems were anticipated during\nmechanical/optical assembly at Ames. Critical parts and components were\nhacked by spares.\nThe Colorado experiment was thoroughly tested, and except for final\nintegration with the Alaskan optical system, it was ready for flight. As part\nof another development program, the spectrometer had been tested for environmental effects including EMI. No backup equipment was available, except for\nsmall standard parts.\nGovernment-furnished equipment (GFE) in support of the three experiments\nwas finalized during dw ERR. For data handling, Colorado was self-contained;\nAlaska was to use the ADDAS for backup recording only; and JPL regarded ADE)AS\nas the primary recorder and planned for inflight processing, printout, and\nhard-copy graphic display. The latter functions had not been finalized or\nprogrammed by the ERR date.\nBoth the primary EC, and his European backup, had a week or so of training\nat both JPL and Alaska but no exposure to the Colorado experiment. The second\nbackup EO did not plan to train before arrival at Ames.\nPreparation of operational procedures and checkiists was started during\n130 training, but could not be finalized since neither experiment was fully\nasscibled and operating. Operating timelines were not even attempted. Beyond\nthis the lack of coordination between the P1 and his co-investigators at\nseparate geographical locations meant that training was entirely at the\nindividual level, with no consideration for interactions in time or workload\nwith the companion systems assigned to the 130.\n\n58\n1J\n\nUniversity of New Mexico (US3)\n\nScientific\n\nAtmospheric physics\n\ndiscipline:\t\n\nPhotography of infrared airglow\n\nScientific objective:\t\n\nParticipating organization: University of Now Mexico\nPrimary instrumentation:\n\n\t\n\nObservational bandwidths:\n\n\t\n\n35-mm camera with I1& image intensifier, 16-mm\ncamera with IR image intensifier for time-lapse\nphotography, IR photometer for calibration\n650-900 nni\n\nDescription.

A 3\'eneva drive continuously\nchanged the filters with a 20-sec dwell time on each.\nThe experiment was initially operated from the left side of the aircraft\nalthough arrangements had been made to use windows on either side. After the\nsimulation period, the 35-mm camera and photometer (on tFc riFht side of fig.\n33) were operated from the left or right side of the aircraft as dictated by\ndata-collecting possibilities. All data were recorded on fil ya and a strip\nchart recorder, and the AUDAS system was not used except to obtain a time\nrecord of the aircraft track.\nDevelopment. The New Mexico experimenters had extensive ground\nexperience in photographic recording of atmospheric 011 clouds. However, to\ntake best advantage of the platform provided by the CV-990, new and more\nextensive equipment was assembled for this mission. ESTHC requests for EMI\ncompatibility were implemented during assembly. By mutual agreement, some\nspecial instrument supports were built by the P1 and some by ASO. Level IV\nintegration was completed after arrival at Amos.\nDuring the fall of 1974, numerous items wore ordered the flight\ninstruments were designed, and preliminary experiments were performed with a\ntwo-stage electrostatically focused 11. Earlier it had been found that a\nthree-stage IT would permit the airglow to be recorded with a 1/15-sec\nexposure using a broadband filter (700-900 nm). However, this tube had very\nlarge pincushion distortioa and a nonuniform photocathode. With the two-stage\nIT, it was hoped that photos of the individual bands could be obtained through\n10-nnl interference filters, in exposures of about 1 sec. However, a compromise\n59\n\nwas necessary, and a broadband filter to permit a 1-sec exposure was used to\nminimize the effects of smearing due to aircraft roll. Earlier experiments\nwith a selected one-stage IT showed it did not significantly reduce the 5-min\nexposure time required by regular high-speed infrared film and a fast camera,\nand it was therefore not satisfactory.\nSeveral tests of various transfer lens systems, to image the IT output\nscreen onto the recording camera film, revealed that (1) no closeup lens system, or single lens with extension tubes, will operate well at 1:1 imaging;\n(2) two 35-mm camera lenses face-to-face make a good transfer lens, but the\nfield of \'view is too restricted; and (3) oci11oscope recording lenses designed\nfor 1:1 imaging offer the best results for this work.\nModifications were made to the original equipment to facilitate operation\nby an 130 who could give only part-time attention to the equipment. A tinier\nwas added to control camera exposure, and the photometer filter wheel was\nmotorized. Following these modifications, the 130 had only to load film, start\nup the equipment, and then monitor it periodically.\nAlthough much of the equipment for this experiment was new for the\nmission, the scientific meftDd was proven, and since the basic instrumentation\nwas relatively straightforward, the experiment was considered well developed\nat the time of selection. The experimenters had never flown their equipment\nbefore, but this lack of experience did not cause any problems.\nExperiment Readiness Review, March 21. The P1 stated that nearly all\nexperiment hardware items were on hand at the time of the ERR. Some spares\nhad not come in. Full system tests were in progress, but poor observing conditions in the field had delayed their completion. Level IV integration of\nthe experiment was defin1 (for implementation at Ames) and was acceptable to\nASO, but there were detailed arrangements yet to he resolved such as black\ncloth light shields and procedures for shifting the photometer and still camera\nfrom port to starboard. Little attention was paid to data systems; the\nexperiment was self-contained and components were operational.\nRegarding E0 training there were no outstanding problems except that one\nsecondary operator (from Europe) had not received any instruction. Procedural\ndocuments were being prepared. The indicated level of effort appeared\ncompatible with time-shared operation, in the opinion of the primary 130.\n\nManagement Effectiveness\nIn retrospect, it appears that the Mission Manager\'s role and his\nauthority to require conformance with the guidelines and schedules of experiment development were not clearly defined or broadly enough applied. For the\nmost part, his management approach followed normal ASO practice for conglomerate payloads, where interaction between Pis is minimal at the hardware\nstate - that is, each P1 develops a separate experiment and does any required\noperator training. For the Joint Mission, however, equipment changes to\nimprove E0 performance were left largely to decisions of the individual P1,\n61\n\ndespite their probable wider influence, and since EO responsibilities crossed\nexperiment lines, coordination among Hs was necessary to implement centralized\ncontrols. In this important area, management control was virtually nonexistent.\nIn practice, the ERR milestone was a reasonably effective control of\nexperiment development. Its significance was lessened, howevor, by delegation\nof this Mission Manager rcsporisibility to others (in Iurop(,\') and use of a\ntelephone rather than an on-site review (in the United States). Thus, most of\nthe experiments were not fully completed during the development phase, and\nchanges were still being made during the final integration period at Ames.\nFinally, failure to meet the set completion date influenced EO training\nplans, again across experiment lines. In none of these areas was the management influence adequate. EO timelines were designed to fit individual experiments, control functions were not centralized except 011 some individual\nexperiments, and delayed completion of most experimcnts made adequate training\nduring the integration period at Ames more difficult.\n\nEXPERIMENT OPERATOR SELECTION AND TRAINING\n\nSelection Parameters\nAs a result of time limitations and the fact that the Spacelab Payload\nSpecialist selection procedures had not been developed, the MPG decided not\nto exorcise a formal EO selection process such as is anticipated for Spacelah.\nInstead, the EOs were selected directly by the MPC3 in accordance with the\nfollowing general parameters:\n1.\n\nTwo U.S. and two European EOs would be selected\n\n2.\n\nSelection of European EOs would be an ESA responsibility, performed\nunder the direction of the European member of the MP1\n\n5. Selection of U.S. UOs would he made directly by a designated subpanel\nof the \'1PC\n4, YO candidates must be individuals capable ot conducting normal\nresearch programs planned b y the PIs - that is, no signicant\nreductions itt experiment complexity or s;ope should be required\nto accommodate EO capabilities.\nThe spectrum of background experience of the four selected flOs was th1theratey\nchosen to permit study of the amount of training and background exjiercnce\nrequired to become a satisfactory FO. The European EQs had been selected by\nSeptember 1974. U.S. F0s were selected at the same time, but encountered\nschedule conflicts with ongoing workloads that prevented active participation.\nOne withdrew from the program 111 November and was replaced in February 1975.\nThc other (a scientist/astronaut got approval to share responsibility, 111 the\nearly stages of training, with an associate who later replaced him as EO for\n\nthe entire mission. In both cases the replacement EOs id roughly the same\namount of background eerience as those originally selected.\nExperiment Operator Backgrounds\nExperiment operator A\' BSA 0, was an astrophysicist specializing in\ninfrared astronomy, with valuable prior experience in airborne research as an\nexperimenter on the French-sponsored Concorde Eclipse flight in 1973. His\nexperience in ground-based astronomy included two assignments in the United\nStates. At the time of selection, he was a visiting scientist at ESTEC, on\nleave from his position as Lecturer in his home univer3ity,\nOperator B, ESA 1O, was a graduate student in plasma physics. His academic\nwork was related to the atmospheric physics experiments on this mission, and he\nwas associated with the University of Southampton through a cooperative\narrangement between that organization and his home universit;.\nOperator C, NASA EO, also a physicist, had been associated with the Kitt\nPeak Observatory. Ile had also participated in two auroral expeditions on the\nAmes CV-990, and was associated with the original development of the type of 1-m\nspectrometer used in the JPL/Alaska experiment. At the time of selection, he\nwas associated with The Johns Hopkins liniversity and the University of Maryland\nas rearch scientist and associate professor, respectively.\nOperator 1), NASA EO, was a scientist/astronaut from the NASA Johnson Space\nCenter. He was the only E0 on the Joint Mission with extensive general training\nin the operation of scientific instruments for experiments sponsored by others.\nHe had previous experience in airborne research, including flights aboard the Ames\nLear Jet. He also served as Science Advisor for a major NASA space program.\nRole of the Principal Investigator\nPrevious experience with E0 traininp in the ASSESS program indicated that\nan acceptable level of proficiency in experiment operation can he accomplished\nby direct P/EO interaction with little outside supervision (refs. 9, 10).\nAccordingly, the same approach was followed for this mission. The PIs were\nrequested by the MPG to devise training plans and schedules jointly with the\nIOs, and to define the criteria they would use to evaluate progress in training and overall 1O performance. This information was to be sent to the Mission\nManager by mid-December for his use in monitoring the training progrzm. Formal\nmanagement control over the training program was limited to two status reviews\nby the Mission Manager, one planned for late March about one month prior to\nshipment and the second at the end of the training period late in May.\nThis approach to operator training was a logical extension of the basic\nASO management philosophy, wherein the responsibility for implementing an\nexperiment rests with the P1, and was deliberately chosen to evaluate its\neffectiveness in the context of time-shared operation of multiple experiments.\n1 Names have been omitted to conform with pLuvisionE of the tJ.S. Privacy\nAct of 1974.\n\n63\n\nAt the very least, this was tho direct way to ensure that trall-ling experience\nwould be individua.ly tailored to match hO capability with oprat ioIlJl requirements. However, in somo cases, P1 planning of a coordinated flO training\nprogram, including provision for flO participation early in the mission and\nfor sufficient hands-on training, was not adequate tc ensure smooth operation\nof experiments with effective interaction among the IiO.\nExperiment Operator Respons i h i 1 iti e;\nThese assignments constitutod the basic framework and dictated the main\nrequirements for P1 planning of LO training programs - both in content and in\nprocedures. The Spacelali life support system is designed to support a maximum\nof three people continuously. Therefore, the Joint Mission was designed for\nequipment operation by only three FOs on any given fligl: . The fouh E() was\noff cluty, flach experiment operator was assigned prime rosponsib:.1ity for an\nexperiment, or group of experiments, and secondary (backup) responsibility for\nadditional experiments (table 4). The primary and secondary experiment responsibilities were chosen to ensure sufficient cross training cliat any thrcr? IOs\ncould operate the payload on a given flight. This arrangement was designed to\nprovide an effective one-man backup for a threc?-man crew. To allow maximum\npossible study of trainin g adequacy, JO assignments were rotated during the\nmission to include primary and secondary experiment operation.\nTAF3LE 4.- 1XI\'ER1MENT OPERATOR ASS1CThINTS\nRospousihie kO\n\n1ixperinnt group\t\nPrimary-\t\nT\t - Secondary\nI Queen Mary Col 1 cc\nerator\nUniversity of Southampton\nOperator F\nl.Jniversi.ty of\' Nev; Mexico\np9rator A\nL_\n\t\nMoudon Observatory and\nOperator \\\nOperator B\ni\'ersitv of 1roniri1Ten\norator 1)\t\nOperator C\nL_ResearchCentcr\t\nJot Propulsion Lahorator\nOcrator 11\n(IperItDr\t\nUniversity of Alaska\n1\t\nIJIiiverit\\\' of Colorado\ni Operator BJ\n\'Primary rcspunsihility includ\nc capahi 1 ity to maintain rind repair\nequipmcnt if nccessary.\n2 Secondary responsibility was 1 rnjtcd, in principle, to normal operaticri\nand data :interpretation.\n1Assignment made, limited traini n cffctc.d , biit n\'vcr opc\'rated in this\n1\n\n-\t\n\ncapacity.\n\nThe EUs wore reuircd tc operate experinionts that were 1 si cal ly laboratery\nequipment.

For\nthe European experimenters, however, this meant a full six months of development with no direct EO participation. As it turned out, there was a wide\nraining schedules. One EO started in September, a second in\nvariation\t\nlate Novembe, and the other two in nid-March 1975 (fig. 34). Thus, the early\nformative stages of all exprimcnt development went on from 4 to 7 months\nwithout direct E0 participation, although there was some prior communication\nin all cases\nGround-Based Trai - ng\nDays of acD"e training during the experiment development period var.\nfror 1 to 66; nct all days were fully utilized, but the EO was on location,\nMost of the time war spent assimilating background information through the\nstudy of equ.ent manuals, discussion with the P1 and his team, and demonstrations of equipment operation. Much training was related to components\nand subassemblies because the experiment was not yet complete. Later in the\nperiod there werj limited opportunities to operate primary or prototype equipment. In general, the EOs were not satisfied with their experience in the\nlaboratory, and expressed two opinions: first, training was too infcrmal and\nnot well enough organized to he really effective; and second, there was not\nenough hands-on training to develop any real operational confidence. With some\nexceptions, the overall experience was not of the expected quality and depth.\n65\n\nSCHEDULED\nSTART OF\t\nTRAINING\t\n11111\t\n\nEOs\t\nSELECTED\t\n9/12\t\n\nP1 TRAINING PLANS\nTO MISS10N MANAGER\n12/13\n\nSIMULATION\nSTARTS\n6/2\n\nERR\t\nPERIOD\t\n\nTRAINING DAYS\nP1 LAB.\t\nSEPT\n\nOCT\t\n\nNOV\t\n\nDEC\t\n\nJAN\t\n\n\\\\\nE2 El E3 El E3\t\n\nE1 E3\t\n\nOPERATOR\nc\n\n1\n\nMAR I APR\t\n\nMAY\t\n\nAT\n\nAMES\n\nPRIMARY\t\n\nAFAMES\n\nOPERATOR\nA\n\nOPERATOR\t\n\nFEB\n\nH\n\n8\t\n\n16\t\n\n26\n\n35\t\n\n31\t\n\n28\n\n14\n\n7\t\n\n1 27\n\n0\t\n\n1 25\n\nE3 E2 El\nATAPAES\t\n\nE3\t\n\nJ\'\\E2E1\nE2 E3\nFORMER FO\nDROPS OUT N\n\nE3\nUS3 E2\nNEWEO\nSELECTED N\n\nOPERATOR\nD\n\nAMES\n1/US2\t\nUS3 US1\t\n\nJLJ\t\n\nJS1\n*ADDITIONAL 40 DAYS SPENT AS DE-FACTO CO-INVESTIGATOP\nIN THE DEVELOPMENT OF E3.\n\nFigure 34.- EO training cJendar.\n\n\t\n\nUS2\n1ATAMES1\n\nOn the other hand, it should be recognized that formal training at the system\nlevel before the Ames period was not possible because of the lack of ground\nsupport equipment (GSI3). For cost reasons GSE was omitted fr"m the programs\nand it was considered that ground and flight checkout with the aircraft would\nbe an effective substitute.\nThe integration and checkout period at Ames (25 to 28 days) was the most\ncritical part of the entire training process, and for Operators A, C, and\nespecially D it was the principal tdning period. This was the time for the\nEOs to become familiar with the integrated experiment, to develop operational\nprocedures for combined experiments, and to become proficient in all aspects\nof operation and servicing.\nDuring experiment integration and checkout, the EOs assisted the PIs in\nactual equipment assembly and testing, and in the preparation of instructions\nfor FO operation of the experiments. The instructions listed the various\nprocedures necessary for the proper operation of each experiment and also\nincluded some fallback procedures in case of problems or unavailability of some\ndesired observational objects.\nThe first opportunity for the EOs to operate individual experiments in\nthe flight configuration was during the final two weeks prior to the Spac&ab\ns.mu1ation week. Daytime activities were supplemented by observational sessions at night with the aircraft oil\n\t ground in a dark locati\'rnduring which\nrepresentative targets were tracked and data were recorded. Suchn,issions\nwere conducted on five separate nights for about four hours each night.\nInflight Training\nThe final phase of training was analogous to integrated mission simulation\nin manned spaceflight programs. One training flight was scheduled for each EO,\nwho would operate his prime experiment (or group of experiments) for four to\nfive hours; no inflight training was scheduled on secondary experiments. The\nguidelines for EO training were as follows: during the first half of the\nflight, the operator would be responsible to start up and operate the experiment without direct assistance from the P1. The P1 would be iri the back of\nthe airplane, available only via the intercom. For the remainder of the\nflight, the P1 would be available for direct"hands-on" assistance if requested\nby the 130, but the 130 would still be the primary operator.\nThe first checkout flight was for PIs to verify experiment operation. 130\nflight training was scheduled so that the primary Ames BO was trained on flight\ntwo and the others on their primary experiments on flight three.. It should be\nnoted that several experiments were still not in good o;ierating condition by\nthe tne of those flights. In particular, the Meudon/Groningen and University\nof Alaska experiments had significant troubles. Aerodynamic buffeting of the\ntelescope in Its open cavity still plagued the first, while the latter lacked\na good boresight and had problems with its integrated computer system.\nBecause of these problems and the overall small amount of prior hands-or\nexperience, the 130 training guidelines were nit closely followed during cither\nflight. On flight t:o, the Ames E0 was not involved at all during equipment\nturn-on and the first data leg. When he did become invo l ved, he had the\n67\n\nassistance of both the Moudon and Ames PIs throughout his period of rctivity.\nDuring flight three, there were several calls for direct P1 assistance during\nthe first half of the flight, and after due consideration, these were allowed.\nIn oidition, a P1 was called forward to visually assess a situation he would\nhave to attend to later, and the Meudon/Groningen ED received the assistance\nof a Meudon electronics teJinician throughout the whole flight to manually augment the stabilization system against cavity disturbances that prevented proper\nguiding. Finally, the latter half of the third flight became primarily a training session in which the PIs operated their experiments and taught by example.\nThe FOs were unanimously of the opinion that their flight experience was\nthe most effective part of their training, despite the wide departures from\nthe planned modes of operation specified in the guidelines, and the less than\nadequate performance of some experiment equipment. In fact, they petitioned\nmanagement for another training flight opportunity, but were denied on the basis\nthat such was beyond the scope of the mission plan.\nEvaluation of ED Training\nManagement\nOverall direction of ED training fu, the Joint ASSESS Mission was provided\nby the MPG, which defined general guidelines, extent of training, and schedules\nto coordinate the various experiments and t. correspond with each EO\'s hackground and experince. The MPG in turn requested each P1 to plan and implement\nthe detailed training of the EOs assigned to his experiment. Plans and evaluation criteria were to he submitted to the Mission Manager, who would monitor\nprogress at intervals and adjust schedules as necessary. It also w planned\nthat the training program would consist of visits by the EOs to the various\ninvestigators\' laboratories and a final, interated-payload training period\nafter installation of experiment equipment.\nThe original plans for ED training were never fully implemented. Management was provided with only three training plans and so had limited direct\ninfluence over program content and timing. Early training was not organized\nand effective, and later efforts, although more directed, were informal and\nemphasized the ndividual experiment, rather than an integrated payload.\nCross-. training on secondary assignments was incomplete, while coordination\nwithin experiment groups and between primary and secondary experiments was\nalmost entirely missing. The Meudon and New Mexico Pis prepared operational\nprocedures for the ros. The remaining PIs were too busy with their experiments\nto prepare procedures in final form, and the principal burden of this work was\nleft to the 130s. In retrospect, it was helpful for the flOs to participate in\nthe preparation of the procedures lists.\nLaboratory Training\nAll four EOs made visits to the laboratories of their prime experilints,\nbut secondary experiments were not so favored. A comparison of FO assinrnents\n(table 4) with the training calendar (fig. 34) shows that none of the LO.; had\nreceived training on all his experiments prior to arrival at Ames. Of the\nfour flos, Operator B had by far the most experience both in Europe and the\nUnited States, and missed training only an the Colorado experiment, which was\none of his secondary assignments. Operator A, with less than hall\' as much\ntraining, covered all his experiments except New Mexico. Operator C started\n68\n\nlate as an EO but managed good coverage of his U.S. assignment (except for\nColorado), and training on his two European experiments was accomplished at\nAmes. Operator D had spent the least training time prior to his arrival at\nArnes - only one day on his primary experiment - and all his secondary training\ncas deferred until the integration period at Ames.\nTraining in the home laboratory was supposed to include both a theoretical\nand practical base of knowledge. Th all cases, theory instruction consisted\nof exposure to scientific and expiirnent-related literature, as well as comments by the P1. However, practical training was incomplete, largely as a\nresult of delays in hardware development. &lthough subsystems and prototypes\nwere available, in no case was it possible to operate the full experiment at\na home laboratory in the same configuration that was installed in the aircraft.\nThe Meudon and New Mexico experiments were operational during such visits, but\nnot in their fin1 configurations; the rest were in varying stages of development and checkout, seriously limiting opportunities for the EOs to obtain\npractical training. Because of this lack of opportunity, all four 130s stressed\nparticipation in experiment installation and checkout as the best way to understand possible problems and their troubleshooting. Firmer management control\nof the ERR function also would enhance training effectiveness by advancing the\nhardware completion date.\nHands-On Training\nBecause of deficiencies of the training program, the integration period\nat Ames loomed more importantly than had been planned. Even during this\nperiod, however, the EOs were not able to get all the time they hoped for in\nactual hands-. on operation of the experiments. Several evening observation\nsessions were set aside, ostor.sibly for training, but they actually were used\nmore by the PIs in final checkout. Three of the four EOs specifically mentioned this point as a \'eficieny in training. The fourth 130, 0peratr 1), was\nactively engaged during most of this time in helping the Ames P1 get his\nequipment ready.\nTheBOs concerned with multiple experiment groupings were not able to\nwork with the groups of experiments until after their installation in the aircraft, and none of the EOs had an opportunity to operate their experiment\ngroupings under time constraints until their one 130 training flight. All felt\nthis to he a deficiency in training, but one that could be overcome by use of\na properly designed simulator.\nSummary of Training Experience\nTable 6 provides thc total training experience of tho four EOs. Time\nspent on primary and secondary assignments is identified as "classroom" training (i.e,, lecture, study, observation) and "hands-on training, and each of\nthcse is again subdivided into theory, operations, etc. Note that records of\nlaboratory training were n\'ioro complete than those taken during the integration\nperiod, and corollary information has been used where necessary to estimate\ntraining data. The emphasis on primary and secondary experiments varied widely\nin the laboratory but was ccntered on the former during final integration and\nflight training; classroom training was predominant in early training, and\n69\n\n\t\n\nTABLE 6.- OVERVIEW OF fl0 TRAINING EXPERIENCE\nAmount of traini\n\t\nP1 laboratories\nFEff\nDays Hours\t\n\t Primary Secondary\n\n130\n\n135\t\n385\t\n130\t\n5\t\n\nOperator A 24\t\n66*\t\nOperator 13\t\n21\t\nOperator C\t\n1\t\nOperator D\t\n\n25\t\n50\t\n70\t\n100\t\n\nDays Hours\n\n75\t\n50\t\n30\t\n0\t\n\n1\t\n\nIntegration site\n\n26\t\n28\t\n27\t\n25\n\n1\n\n240\t\n255\t\n250\t\n235\n\n\t Primary Secondary\n\n1\t\n\n60\t\n55\t\n70\t\n70\t\n\n40\n45\n30\n30\n\n1\t\n\n*plus 40 days as de-facto co-. investigator on primary experiment.\n(a) Amount of training.\nType of training - \' of offrt\t\nP1 laboratories\t\n\nIntegration site\nPrimary*\t\n\nSecondary\t\n\nPrimary\t\n\nSecondary\n\nClass-\t\nClassClass-\t\nClass-\t\nHands-on\nHands-on\t\nroom\t\nroom\t\nroom\t\n\nE0\t\nOperator A\nOperator 13\nOperator C\nOp erator 0\n\n65\t\n70\t\n55\t\n90\t\n\n1\t\n\n70\t\n80\t\n75\t\nILI\tNone\t\n\n-\n\n30\t\n20\t\n25\t\nNone\t\n\n35\t\n35\t\n55\t\n35\t\n\n\t\n65\t\n65\t\n45\t\n65\t\n\nClass-T\nHands-on\nroom\n55\n45\n30\n45\n\n45\t\n55\t\n70\t\n55\t\n\n*A11 thflight training on primary experiments,\n(b l Type of\' training.\nClassroom training,\n130\t\n\n1\n\nLocatior\n\nTheory\n\nOperator A\nOperator 13\t\nP1\nOperator C laboratories\nOperator 1)\nE0\t\nOperator\nOperator\nOperator\nOperator\n\nLocation\t\nA\t\n13 Integration\t\nsite\t\nC\t\nD\t\n\n40\t\n60\t\n50\t\n35\t\n\nOpera- Maintentions\t\nance\n15\n10\n\n45\t\n30\t\n35\n35\t\n\n10\n\nHands-on training, ;\nOperationsl Maintenance\n85\t\n30\t\n60\t\n100\t\n\n15\n70\n10\n0\n\nIntegra- Opera- Mainten- Integra- Opera- 9aintention\t\nanco\ntions\t\ntions\t\nanco\t\ntion\t\n45\t\n10\t\n10\t\n15\t\n\n30\t\n60\t\n70\t\n65\t\n\n25\t\n30\t\n20\t\n20\t\n\n10\t\n25\t\n20\t\n25\t\n\n80\t\n60\t\n75\t\n50\t\n\n10\n15\n5\n25\n\n(c) Subject material of training\nNOTE: Laboratory training data from 130 records; on-site data from various\nsources, thus less accurate.\n\n70\n1)UCm1L1TY 01 Ti11\n:.iNAL PAGI IS PQQ\n\nhands-on training later; and operations training, generally, outweighed\nmaintenance by a factor of\nThese variations are reasonable, expected trends that reflect the EOs\'\ndevelopment from introductory theory to operation in flight.

Experiment checkout and final\nU0 training followed. Then came the week of the simulation itself, followed\nby two additional weeks of P1 data flights. E0 participation is indicated, as\nappropriate, often in the context of activities that furthered their training.\nManagement functions specifically oriented to the simulation week are covered\nin this section. Significant mission events are summarized in table 7.\n\nTABLE 7. - SUMMARY OF MISSION EVENTS\nDate\nUp to April 20, 1975\nApril 20-30\nApril 21-May 15\nMay 20-30\n\nMay 29\n,Tune 2-7\nJune 8\nJune 9-20\nJuno 23-24\nJune 25-30\n\nActivity\nExperiment development and integration at experimenters laboratories\nShipment to Ames\nPayload integration and checkout\nI0 ground training\nFinal experiment checkout\nThree P1 checkout/data flights, one 130 training flight\nMission readiness review\nFive-flight simulation period - EOs operated equipment\nDebriefing for simulation period\nSeven P1 data flights - Pis operated equipment\nRemoval of experiments\nShipment to experimenters\' laboratories\n\n71\n\nPayload Integration\nOne of the key operational features of Spacelab is the concept and\napproach for experiment-related ground operations, covering the activities from\nthe start of integration to final checkout in the Shuttle Orbiter. Four\ndiscrete levels of Spacelah experiment integration J\'.ave been defined in\nreference 14:\n\nLevel P/:\n\nIntegration and checkout of experiment equipment with\nindividual experiment mounting elements (e.g., racks and pailet\nsegments*).\nLevel III: Combination, integration, and checkout of all experiment\nmounting elements (e.g. ) racks, rack sets, and pallet segments*) with\nexperiment equipment already installed, and of experiment and Spacelab\nsoftware.\nLevel 11: Integration and checkout of the combined experiment equipment\nand experiment mounting elements (e.g., racks, rack sets, and pallet\nsegments*) with the flight subsystem support elements (i.e., basic module,\nigloo, and extension modules when applicable*).\n\nLevel 1: Integration and checkout\nthe Shuttle Orbiter, including the\n\nof the Spacelab and its payload with\nnecessary preinstallation testing\n\nwith simulated interfaces.\nThese integration activities are as independent of each other as possible:\nthey involve different hardware items (flight hardware and GFE) and will take\nplace at different times and different locations (ref. 14). To some extent,\nthe integration of airborne experiments has analogous features, although not\nas distinctly separable as those listed. The Joint Mission payload integration schedule and activ ties are briefly described below. Spacelab equivalents\nare noted where aptropri te. The final presimulation milestone was the mission\nreadiness review (MRR), iik which payload status and FO readiness were\nevaluated.\nIntegration\n\nSchedule\n\nA schedule was prepared to coordinate the flow of on-Site integration\nactivities so that all experiments would be in a flight-read) , status aboard\nthe aircraft by May 15. This was a mandatory deadline to allow adequate time\nfor inflight verification of payload mechanical integrity, pilot proficiency\nflights, and the subsequent P1 and EO checkout flights. The schedule covered\nthe following activity classes: laboratory assembl y and checkout (L), installation on the aircraft (1), electrical hookup in the aircraft to power and\nsignal leads (13), test and alignment in the aircraft (T), and ADDAS\ninterfacing (A).\nTable 8 shows the scheduled and actual sequence of payload integration\nactivities. A comparison of planned and actual events shows that most experimonts started out on schedule with work in the ASO laboratory.

The New\nMexico experiment was delayed a week by absQnce of per;onne1 (prearranged and\napproveu by the Mission Manager), and not all installation activities were\ncompleted until after the planned cutoff date.\nWith We one exception noted, the May 15 deadlbie was rnec with respect\nto interfaces with aircraft and experiment support systems; airworthiness and\nsafety requirements were satisfied. For all experiments, however, much of the\nnext two weeks was spent in further checkout as the principal activity instead\nof LO training. For this reason, test and alignment is shwn s tho principal\nactivity in that period.\nEquivalent Level TV Integration\nAt this integration level, a good analogy exists botwern aircraft and\nSpacelab. Varying amounts of Level TV type integration were carried out by\nall Joint Mission PIs in their home laboratories. Most PIs whose experiment\noccupied rack volume obtained standard racks from ASO for homw laboratory\nintegration of electronic components. These racks accept standard 4-cm\n(19 in.) electronic panels and are mounted as a unit on the aircraft scat\nrails. Thus, the P1 can ensure optimum arrangement and proper cabling of\nelectronic components in the rack before shipping his experiment to Ames. The\nMeudon/Groningen experimenters built a si. e mock-up to assist in their home\nlab integration. They found this procedure desirable to determine tho interrelationships of the five racks of equipment and the telescope, and to allow\nprecise precutting of the many connecting cables.\nSome mechanical integration of instruments with spcia1 support strictures\nalso took place at home laboratories, but the majority of this work was done\nat Ames, whore most integration involving interfaces WIt1L aircraft structure\nwas planned. Ames design engineers made a vital contribution to this effort,\nboth by consulting with PIs and by designing the many mounting strtictures that\nwere fabricated in Ames shops. The most active shop, Metals Fabrication\nBranch, provided nearly 2700 man-hours of effort to the Joint Mission, including the final integration of standard racks and special supports in the\naircraft.\nllome laboratory integration was insufficient in four cases, The Alaska\nexperiment cncounterod problems in optical alignment at Ames, some of which\nwere never adequately resolved. The Amcs dewar did not fit to the Moudon\ntelescope. A primary in s trument for JPL was not delivered from the manufacturer until the beginning of the flight porod. And the TV camera support\nfor Southampton had to be reinforced to moot aircraft load requirements.\nIncoming Inspoction, Assembly, and Level IV Approval\nEach experimenter was responsible for examining his equiprnont at Ames for\ndamage in shipping. The only serious shipping damage involved the Southampton\nTV camera tube. The focusing coils were not suitably secured for shipping\nshocks and had slipped an inch or mu\' resulting in breakage of fine wires.\n\nAfter preliminary inspection, components and eventually the completely\nassembled experiments were given operational checks. Components that were not\nshipped in the standard racks, and those requiring special supports built at\nAntes ) were mounted in the flight configuration. Single-phase induction motors\nused to drive vacuum pumps were modified for spark elimination; the currentcarrying function of the starting switch was replaced by a solid-state circuit.\nPrior to transfer to the aircraft, each assembly underwent a final\ninspection for compliance with mechanical specifications, whicii included the\nuse of aircraft-acceptable hardware, the use of restraints to prevent damage\nin the event of untoward accelerations, and the proper placement of equipment\nso that the overturning and rail-fitting loads and moments were below the\nallowable maximum.\nDuring the lab inspection/check period, the University of Alaska team\nmade the first assembly of their complete optical system in conjunction with\nAmes personnel. This system comprised a stabi1.zed mirror, 35-cm t1escope,\nand 1-rn Ebert-Fastie spectrometer. In addition, provision had to be made for\nreflecting the beam into the University of Colorado 12.5-cm Ebert spectrometer\nwhen desired. This optical sy.tem was not in reasonable operating condition\nuntil the second checkout flignt.\nIn effect, the activities outlined above amounted to a review and\napproval of Level TV integration by those responsible for safety. For Spacelab, such functions may well be done before the experiment is shipped from\nthe home laboratory.\nIntegration and Checkout (Level ITT, 11, and 1 Equivalents)\nFollowing the inspection and Level IV approval, equipment was loaded\naboard the CV-990 for the remainder of the integration process. Because the\naircraft is a simpler system than the Spacelab/Orbiter, the remaining levels\nof integration were not as distinct as those planned for Spacelab and may be\nconsidered as a single level combining the features of Spacelab Levels 111,\nII and I.\nThe integration processes aboard the aircraft include the following, not\nall of which were necessary for every experiment:\nPlacement and tiedown of equipment racks.\nPlacement of special mounting fixtures.\nInstallation of special optical windows.\nInstallation of other special facilities such as pumps, cryogen\nsupply, purge gas supply, etc.\nConnection of racks to electrical power.\nConnections to and from data system.\nConnections to aircraft instrumentation.\nMeasurement of electrical loads.\n75\n\nCheckout of equipment.\nFinal inspection - mechanical, e1ectri, safety (add padding if needed\nto prevent prsona1 injury).\nInstallation of black shrouding curtains.\nThe mechanical and c7l,ztrical htegration took a total of two weeks. The\nAirworthiness and Y. i.ht Safety Roview Board then met .o determine that the\naircraft and its Tiavioad were physically ready to f1y. No major problems wore\nfound during this review.\nFigure 55 shows a floor plan of the aircraft cabin with the location of\nthe various experiments. Figure 3\' i a photograph of the intogrted payload,\ntaken from the front of the cabin. For this mission, the general 1oation of\nthe experiments was dictated by the requirements of LO operation. ilie three\natmospheric physics experiments - Queen Mary College, University of Southampton,\nand Universit y of New Mexico - were adjacent in the front of the cabin. The\nlocation of the Meudon telescope was dictated by the use of the overwing escape\nhatch for the telescope mounting. Primary telescope controls and controls for\nboth the Groningen and Ames photometers were mounted 111 two standard racks\ndirectly opposite the telescope. The remaining astronomical equiprnent, the\nJPL/Alaska/Colorado experiment, was installed aft of the Moudon telescope.\nThe ADDAS cquipment was installed in its normal location in the aircraft.\nSpecial light shields were used for Southampton, Now Mexico, and .JPL/\nAlaska/Colorado equipment to keep extraneous light from othorwisc open optical\npaths or to protect particularly sensitive clet3ctors.\nA desk and a special worI area simulating the bonch space planned for\nSpacclah was installed on the right side of the aircraft just aft of the ADI)AS\narea (figs. 37 and 38, respectively.. A standard supply of basic tools and\ntest equipment, developed in part by MSFC from Skylab experience, w:is provided.\nT xperimenters augmented the standard supply with experiment-specific tools as\nbe\nnocessary. Specific information on tools and test equipment 111\nfound in\nappendix B to this report.\n\nh1ien payload integration was complete, each experiment and the entire\ninstallation was carefully checked out on the ground.

For skyglow experiments, it was possible to check seasitivi ties, although not ill the exact wavehands dosirod at alt , \'udo. Full checks were made of cryogenic cooling. 1\ntotal of 20 hr was devoted to this activity.\n\n76\n\nM EUDON/GRONINGEN/AMES\nNEW MEXICO (ALTERNATE) /\t\nGFE RECORDERS\nSOUTHAMPTON \\ \t\n/ ALASKA\n/\t\nMISSION DIRECTOR\'S CONSOLE\n\t DESK\nADDAS\t\n\nH 1\t\n\nFWD\n\nH/\n\nWORKBENCH OR ESTEC EMI\n/ HOUSEKEEPING RACK\n\nL\n\nAFT\n\n0\n\nEE\n\n\tTELESCOPE\t JPL/ALASKA/ IADDAS\n\t\nCOLORADO\nMEUDON/GRONINGEN/AMES\nQUEEN MARY COLLEGE\nSOUTHAMPTON\t\nNEW MEXICO\n\nS STANDARD CV-990 RACK\nL LOW-BOY RACK\nFigure 35..- Arrangement of experiments in aircrafc cabin.\n\nMission Readiness Review\nThe status of both experiments and I0 training was assessed during an\ninformal iiRR on Ma y 29, following the last schdu1ed flight of the presimulation period. The review was chaired by the Mission Manager, and attended by\nthe PIs, 130s, ASO participants, and MPG representatives. It was soon apparent\nthat payload preparations for the simulation mission had not been completed.\nOnly one or t\' experiments were in a ready status. In each case, however,\nthe outsta"iding problems had been identified and were on the way to solution.\nSeveral changes in the handling of ground support equipment were requested to\nfacilitate 130 activities during the confined period. Because of the emphasis\non Lardware problems E0 training had not progressed to realy status.\nIt was agreed that final preparations could be completed in time for the\nscheduled start of the simulation period. To this end, requests were made for\na fourth premission flight for experiment checkout, and for ground support\npersonnel as necessary to operate experiments for 130 training through the\nweekend. Both requests, which subsequently were implemented, were changes to\nthe mission plan, justified by the immediate circumstances. A second operator\ntraining flight was also requested. It was nut approved, however, as the MPG\nrepresentatives judged it to be a serious breach of mission guidelines. In a\nsense, the MRR experience was a capsule summary of mission preparations for\nthe previous year, and brought to focus a number of important points:\n1.\n\nExperiment developiner\xc2\xb1, delayed beyond the ERR date will adversely\nimpact E0 training and final integration activities.\n\n2.\n\nMission planning should allow a contingency period for unexpected\nProblems during integration and simulator testing.\n\n3.\n\nIndividual experiments that make up a composite payload, if allowed\nto develop separately, may not achieve the desired result when\nintegrated, and some compromise of research objectives may result.\n\n4.\n\nWhen experiment operatcrs are to perform ime-shared, multiple\nexperiment functions, the prerogatives of the Mission Manager should\nbe adequate to assure compliance with milestone schedules for\nexperiment development and operator training.\n\n5.\n\nExperiment developmeni must be monitored effectively so that delays\ncan be recognized promptly and early responses facilitated where\nscheduling is flexible, and to minimize impacts 011 other experiments\nand support functions.\n\n6.\n\nEarly transition fiom passive to acive hands-on training is\nimportant. Only by this moans can an operator develop the skills\nthat allow concentration on results rather than procedures.\n\n81\n\nAircraft Ground Operations\nBetween flights, the CV-990 was parked outside the main NASA hangar\nx\'ept during fueling operations), and air-conditioning equipment was attached\nin a manner similar to standard airline practice. Electric power was provided\nto the air raft by an MG set giving 100-Uz power. Figure 39 indicato; the\nlocation of the aircraft on the ground and the disposition of support faei1\nitie required for the SpacelaF simulation portion of t1ic mission.\nOn a Spac1ab mission, sleeping quarters will he provided in the Orbiter\nportion of th Space Shuttle. During che one-week simulation period o\' the\n,Joint Mission s Orbiter living quarters were simulated by a lift-van truck\n(fig. 10), which provided sleeping accommodations, and space for sanitary\nfacilities and for preparation and eating of light meals. When the aircraft\nwas not flying, the truck bed was lifted to mate with the roar passenger door\nof the aircraft and became an integral part of the aircraft interior, similar\nto Spacelab/Orbiter living quarters.\nThe Mission Operations Center (MOC) was located in trailers adjacent to\nthe hangar (fig. 39). The operations trailer had a separate room for the\nMission Scientist, the Operations Manager, and MPG representatives from NASA\nand ESA (fig. 41). The larger room had a conferonce/coinmunications area, an\narea for official observers from NASA and ESA and one for visitors. A connccted but separate space was provided for the PI r to work on flight pLinning\nand data evaluation, In general, the PIs spent about 16 hr a day in the MflC\nfrom 0300 to 1900, and slept while the aircraft was flying. The MOC was not\nused during the nonsimulation portions of the mission,\nWhile on the ground, the aircraft was connected to the MOC by two\nchannels of two-way voice link and one channel of TV downlink - a systom\nequivalent to that planned for Spacelab (fig. 41), Two TV cameras wcro.aviilable aboard the aircraft, one fixed with the operators desk in its field of\n\t of\nview and the other a portable sot that could be focused oil\ninterest.\n\nMISSION FLIGHT OPERATIONS\n\nThis section covers the flight-relatod activities of the .Joint Mission,\nbeginning with the first payload checkout flight 011 May 21.

In consultation with the experimenters,\nhe developed the flight plan requirements, which then were translated into a\ndetailed plan for each flight by the navigators. During the simulation period,\nthe Mission Manager could not he available on a 24-hr basis. He therefore\ndelegated planning coordin:ition with the PIs to the Mission Scientist, and\nther support activities to the Operations Manager during that time. During\n.he simulation pe v iod, the Operations Manager was also responsible for special\nfacilities such as the MOC, the sleeping van, and the special cnmunications\nequipment, as well as conduct of the briefing sessions before a1L after flight.\nIn flight, the Mission Manager controlled distribution of electrical\npower to experiments and controlled intercom channels (two). Acting as Mission\nSpecialist, he was the contact between experimenters and flight crew, although\nthe Flight crew could switch into the experimenters\' intercom circuit if necessary. The Mission Manager, with pilot approval, also cruld communicate with\nlocal ground stations via regular aircraft radio systems, but there waF no\noccasion to do so during the mission.\n1 nertial navigation system (INS) and time-code readouts at the Mission\nManager\'s station allowed the precise announcement of start and stop of the\ndata legs of the flight, vilich the Mission Manager usually noted, along with\nother per inent flight-path data, for his own reference. During the nonsimula-.\ntion flights the Mission Manager\'s planning assistant became his in-flight\nassistant as well. Ile aided in manning the Mission Manager\'s station, thus\nfreeing the manager for more frequent "at station" contact with the flight\ncrew and experimenters.\nSvera1 specialists f1w aboard the CV-990 to assist the experimen rs\nand Mission Mnager as required. An electronics tcchnician checked optical\nwindows after takeoff, maintained housekeeping electronics, and occasionally\naided an experimenter (on nonsimulation flights). A stabilized-mirror specialist\nmaintained these systems (one on flight 1 to 9, and two on the remaining\nflights), nd participated directly in their operation as riquestcd by experimenters. A computer-sotware technician kept the ADDAS system in operation,\nand took Polaroid pictures of the QMC Fourier transformed interferograns for\n\n87\n\nthe EOs during the simu\'ation week (tLese were transmitted down to the P1 for\nevaluation). This specialist did not assist in problems with experimenterprovided minicomputers.\n\nPresimulation Flights\nTwo checkout/data flights were planned. Three were flown (May 21, 23, and\n30), the last being a short flight intended primary to check the solution to\nMeudon telescope stability problems, but also to operate the JPL IJV TAOF for\nthe first time.\nThe Queen Mary, Moudon, JPL, and Alaska experiments encountered seric\noperational problems during the checkflights. QMr and JPL had EMI problems.\nThe JPL difficulty was fairly obvious and was easiy dianosid, but the QMC\nproblem was not even diagnosed as EMI until the fourth simulation flight (by\nan P0). Neither experimenter was wholly successful in eliminating the interference. JPL also found that their proposed hand guiding of an 8-1n. telescope on an astronomical object was an impos;i1e task. This task was deleted\nfrom HO activities, and a stabilized mirror was introduced into the system\nafter the simulation period.\nThe Moudon telescope suffered from aerodynamic buffeting within the open\ncavity, which made consistent tracking very difficult. Before the last checkout flight, a thin mylar window was placed over the tlescope port, which\nsolved the buffeting problem but reduced the signal level and introduced icing\nproblems that were not resolved during the Fimulation period. The Alaska\nproblem was internal to the experiment: A faulty tape recorder repeatedly\nknocked out the experiment\'s computer. The rroblm was diagnosed after the EO\ntraining flight, and the tape recorder was removed .rom the experiment and\nrepaired during the simulation week. It was reinstalled for P1 flights.\nOne other less serious problem was encountered. New Mexico\'s image\nintensified pictures were distorted by unknown magnetic fields, This EMI was\nreduced considerably after the first flight, but was never completely\neliminated.\n\nSimulation Period\nThe schedule and specific flight plans for the simulation period were\nmodified considerably because of aircraft engine troubh\', although all five\nflights took pl q ce. The trouble developed about half way throngh the first\nflight, and data legs for two (or four) astionomia1 objects were aborted.\nThe same problem occurred again on the second flight, Out later in the flight.\nThe aircraft was able to stay on planned course, but at a lower altitude (for\ngreater engine efficiency of the three operating engines). Data on one\nastronomical object were severely degraded due to atmospheric absorption at\nlesome engine had to be changed,\nthe lower observational altitude. The ti\t\ndelaying the mission one day. The last three flights were then flown as\nschedulec1.\n\nP8\n\nSchedule of I)aily Activities\n& master schedule of daily events (table 10) was developed to coordinate\nmission operations during the simulation weck. Time blocks for major events\nwere keyed to aircraft takeoff (1\') and landing (L) to accommodate changos in\nflight plan required by priority experiments and/or target selection. This\ngeneral schedule was supplemented eally by an hourly-events schedule as soon\nas the flight time was established, to enable PIs to arrange their experiment\nsupport activities.\nThe tSpacr.lahlf workday began 7-1/2 hr before takeoff when the crew was\nawakened for breakfast. An unstructured period of 2 to 3 hr followed, for\npersonal hygiene, experiment servicing, and FO/PI consultation. At T - 5-1/2\nhr there was a 30-min preflight meetiig of all participants to review mission\nstatus to date, to discuss the Final f1itht plan for the day, and to respond\nto specific requests in support of the mission. From then until T - 1 hr, the\nprimary activity was experiment preparation, with 1O/PI consultation as\nrequired. In tho late afternoon the 1"05 had their main meal of the day.\nExperiments were shut down (at T - 1 hr) and the final countdown before takeoff\nbegan.\nThe workday ended about 2 hr after landing. In the firt hour, the\naircraft was refueled and towed to the ground site, where connunications and\nliving quarters wore attached. Data downlink activities and cryogenic servicing were completed before the flight debriefing at L + 1-112 hr. This 30-min\nsession was used to communicate informat n necessary for P1 planning for the\nnext flight, while the EOs slept. After a light meal (if desired), the EUs\nretired for the night. Figure 42 summarizes FO activity for a typical day.\nFlight Activities\nThe Ws were allowed to go to their experiment stations a few minutes\nafter takcoff, following the safety check of optical windows by the electronics\ntechnician. At station, the FO immediately began an oxpefiment turn-on routine.\nThis was a very bus)\' time, with the turn-on generall y continuing at various\nlevels until t 1 ie beginning of the first data leg, usually about 50 min after\ntakeoff. The actual initiation of data operations varied with experiment type\nand atmospheric conditions reiJred.\nDuring the data coi1.ction priod LO responsibilities varied with the\nexperiments. Some roquired only periodic checks of proper operation, and\nothers required stopping and resetting of start conditions. The cycle of\nchecking, setting controls, and occasionally resolving an operational problem\nTurn-off began about 20 min before\noccupied essentially all of the E0s time \t\nlanding, generally with the beginning of the descent from altitude. The assembly if Juta for downlink transfer to Pis did not begin witil after landing.\n}O assignments during the five flights are shown in tah1c 11.\n\n89\n\nTABLE 10. - SIMULATION WEEK [JAIL\' SCHEDULE\nTime (hrs)\nL\t\nL + 1\t\n\n\t\n\n\xe2\x80\x94_Events\t\n\nLocation\nA/C\n\nA/C\nA/C\nA/C\nA/C, MOC\n\nRefuel aircraft\t\nLift tran attached \t\nCommunication hookup\t\nCryogenics servicing\t\nData clown link\t\nIland carry\n\xe2\x80\xa2 ADDAS tapes to IBM 360\nLog 1i\n\xe2\x80\xa2 ADDAS hard copy to P1\t\nthrough\nA[M)AS printout to P1 ( Operations\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Film to Photolab\t\n1 Manager\nDump Southampton video record\n\nParticipants\nMM\nMM\nMM 1 OM\nE0\n1:0, MM, P1,\nOM\n\nA/C, MOC\n\nE0 P1\n\n1\n\nL + 1-1/2\n\nFlight debriefing\n\nA/C, MOC\n\nOM, 1:0, P1,\nM, MS\n\nL+2\n\nSilence A/C\n1:0 meal (optional)\nSleep\nPI-MS consultation\nPreflight pianning\nPI-MS consultation\nPreflight meeting preparations\n1:0 wakoup, shower, breakfast\nlO-PI consultation\nFree time\n\nA/C\nA/C\nA/C\nMOC\n\nE:), MM\n1:0, MM\n10, MM\nP1, MS\n\nMOC\t\n\nP1, MS\n\nT - 7-1/2\n\nT - 6-1/2\n\nT - 5-1/2\nPreflight meeting\nApproximate\nFormalize final experiment operations\ntime 2PM\t\nFinal flight plan\nPassenger manifest\nT - 4-1/2\t\n\nT - 1\t\n\nT - 112\t\nT - 0\t\n\nStart experiment preparations\nFilm and tape loading\t\nCryogenic loading\t\nFO-PI consultation\t\nMeal/free time\nLoose item stowage\t\nP:ssenger boarding\t\nLift. ;nn removed\t\nSt.op N. purge of cavity \t\n(\'orn:;Lition disconnect\t\nDoor closure\t\nTakeoff\t\nBox lunch available in flight\n\n1:0, MM\nA/C\t\nA/C, MOC 1:0, P1\nA/C, MOC 1:0, P1, MM,\nMS, OM\n\n1:0\n1:0\nA/C, MOC 1:0, P1\n\nA/C\t\nA/C\t\n\nA/C\t\nA/C\t\nA/C\t\nA/C\t\nA/C\t\nA/C\t\nA/C\t\n\n1:0,\n1:0,\nOM\n1:0,\n1:0,\n1:0,\n1:0,\n\nMM\nMM\nMM\nMM, OM\nMM\nMM\n\nNOTE: L + 1-112 and T - 5-112 meetings were mandatory for all indicated participants - at least one P1 per experiment.

Ills work was cornplicatcd\nsornewhat by the fact that there was no coordinated control panel for the three\nexperiments, and he had to move about the cabin to the location of each experiment (fig. 43). The EQ operating the Meudon telescope, whether with the\nGroningen detector or the Ames detector, did not have to move around as mach,\nbut was vc\'ry busy with th telescope controls and, in the Groningen case, with\nthe telescope computer terminal as well. His location was physically uncomfortablo: No seat was available, and the controls were placed low in a rack,\nrequiring that he sit on the floor to operate them. The flC) operating the J11L/\nAlaska/Colorado group also had Foveral locations of activity, three control\nracks and the two te1ecopes.\nsome specific comrnents about the operation of each exporiment follow.

This\nwas an easy task with a bright target such as Venus, but It was more difficult\ndth some of the other fainter and sometimes distributed targets. The tracking operation was often disrupted in actual flight by excessive roll of the\naircraft, which caused the telescope to hit its limit stops and lose target\nlock. If the operator\'s attention was diverted for the moment, as by a filter\nadjustment, located on the rack behind his normal tracking position, the loss\nof target lock might go unnoticed for a minute or more. The operator then had\nto reacquire the target, lock it in and reinitiate the computer program.\nWhen computer-controlled, the telescope mapped an area of the sky. The\nmaps were displayed at the computer terminal a; a sot of numbers (proportional\nto JR i\'ltehsities), The TO rnacle a hard copy of each display (using the A)AS\nhard copy unit) for later P1 perusal.\nThere usually was a transit leg between data legs during which the EO was\nnot necessarily occupied. These legs varied in length, depending on target\nschedule, but rarely were longer than a few minutes.\nArnes Research Center. Operational requirements were similar to those for\nthe Groningen experiment as regards telescope guiding (described above), but\ndiffered in most ether respets \t\nThere was no facility for computer control\nof the filter-wedge spectrometer, so the computer terminal was not activated.\nThe Ames data were recorded by the ADDAS, so the video and Groningen tape\nrecorders were not activated. Because of different densities and evaporation\nrates of the cryogenic fluids used (helium by Groningen and nitrogen by Ames),\nthe Ames operator had to maintain the telescope in reasonable balance by\nadding incremental weights to the dewar as the flight progressed.\nAmes\nFO was provided with a preflight timeline, a list of operational\nThe\nprocedures for equipment turn-on and data collection, a list of control settings rluring normal operations, and a brief list of possible problems and\nassociated diagnostic procedures.\nQueen Mary College/University of Southainpton/University of New Mexico.\nThese three experiments, located adjacent to one another in the front of the\ncabin, were operated by a single 1O on all simulation flights. The QMC experiment could collect data at the highest ambient light level, so was put into\noperation first. The other two were then turned on, but remained in a standby\nmode for another half hour or more awaiting proper operating conditions. Once\nstarted, the New Mexico and Southampton experiments required only periodic\nmonitoring and entries on log sheets from the lEO. The FO thus spent most of\nhis operating time on the QMC experiment, which required close attention at\nfrequent intervals.\nThe QMC equipment was complex, operated at a very low signal level, and\nwas subject to serious EMI from aircraft radio transmitters, a problem that\nwas not identified during the presimulation flights. Thus, in addition to his\nother duties, tht EO was asked to perform a diagnostic function - to identify\nthe source of the "noise spiklsu imposed on the primary signal channel and, if\npossible, take corrective action.\n95\n\nThe experiment required detailed attention from the LO in taking interferograms, and close coordination with the ADDAS operator. The process of taking\ndata involved mechanical travel of a mirror controlled by a load screw. No\nlimit switches were provided at the extremities of motion, and the mirror\njammed if motion was not stopped in time. Since recording an interfcrogram\ntook on the order of 10 min it was well that his other experiments required as\nlittle attention as they did. Despite the possibilities for error, both\nprimary and secondary EOs were successful in obtaining a reasonable number of\ninterferograms.\nOnly the 273 K reference body of the QMC experiment was used during th\xe2\x82\xac.\nsimulation week; the other 77 K reference was inactivated. This simplification was introduced so that the 1:0 would not have cryogen-refill (LN2)\nactivities to contend with during flight.\nThe Southampton team did not develop integrated procedures for the three\ninstruments that made up their experiment; three separate sets of detailed\ndirections were furnished to the EOs. The separate instruments werc: an allsky camera at a zenith window, a photometer at a 65 0 ele.ration window, and a\nTV camera at a seconc 65\xc2\xb0 window. Each instrument required a number of operations to start data taking, but required only periodic checks once started.\nThe TV system also required the reseating of an electronics card inside the\ncamera case, which was loosened by the vibration of takeoff. Once this was\ndone, the TV camera operated properly for the rern \'ider of the flight.\nNo attempt had been made on this experiment to coordinate controls. The\noperator was required to operate separate controls for each piece of\nelectronics equipment.\nAn abbreviated checklist for operation of the New Mexico experiment is\nshown in table 12. On a simulation flight, the EO was expected to fill out an\nexpanded 6 .-page list, and there were 22 pages of informational material covering each item of equipment, its operation, and possible problems. The operator\nwas required to mount the 16 .-mm camera after the start of each flight and to\nstow the camera before landing. Once everything was started on this experiment,\nno further attention was required of the operator except to make log entries\nwas\neach half hour.\nOperation was simplified during the simulation week by leaving the two\ninstruments photometer and 35-mm camera/intensifier, in their normal position\non the left side of the aircraft. Later on, the P1 optimized data collection\nby switching these two instruments to the right side when conditions warranted.\nJet P ro pulsion Laboratory/University of Alaska/University of Colorado.\nEquipment for these three related experiments was located in the after portion\nof the aircraft cabi (fig 35). A 35-cm telescope provided the main optical\ninput to the Alaska a.d Colorado spectrometers, and a mirror was inserted at\nthe telescope exit to switch from the Alaska to the Colorado instrument. When\nthe Colorado spectrometer was receiving the telescope beam a second mirror was\npositioned in front of thc. entrance slit of th Alaska instrument so that the\nspectrometer received zenith light through a 65 0 elevation window.

This mirror was considered experiment\nsupport equipment under the purview of the Mission Manager.\nThe 130 operating the three combined experiments had to make adjustment or\noperate controls on the telescope mount, on an electronics rack across the\naisle for Alaska, and at two other electronics racks for the JPL and Colorado\nexperiments. Both the Colorado and Alaska experiments involved the use of\ninteractive computer terminals. The fact that the keyboards of these two\ndevices were not identical led to frequent operational errors by the 130 as he\nmoved from one to the other.\nFor safety reasons, the JPL TAOP was stowed during takeoff and landing,\nand the E0\'s first task was to mount the IJV/TAOF on the telesope pointing out\nthe 14\xc2\xb0 window. Most of the many JPL experiment controls remained in one position from flight to flight, and few had to be checked or reset. Once put into\nwith\noperation, the instrument swept repetitively through the UV spectrum with ,io\nattention from the E0. However, he was required to make a hard copy for quicklook information and for later P1 perusal. This task, which was done fairly\ninfrequently, involved the use of an X-Y recorder that required resetting after\neach sweep a. .d a paper change after each two to three sweeps. Experiment\nparameters employed were hand logged an the X-Y plot.\nSince all three of these experi-ments could start collecting data on the\nfirst data leg, the E0 who ran them was extremely busy between takeoff and the\nfirst start point (30 to 40 min). The threo experiments were activated roughly\nin parallel, with the experiment an the 35-cm telescope receiving slight priority. To accomplish turn-on in parallel, the 130 spent short periods of time\nat each experiment, activating it a bit more with each visit. After the second\nsimulation flight the rules were changed to allow the off-duty E0 on any particular flight to aid the JPL/Alaska/Colorado 130 by mounting the JPL UV/TAOF just\nafter takeoff. This accommodation was, of course, peculiar to the aircraft\nsimulation since in Spacelab such instruments would have to be set up only\nonce.\nFor each experiment, the 130 had available complete turn-oii schedules and\ndiagnostic suggestions for the more common problems. However, he did not have\na priorities list that would tell how long to spend troubleshooting experiment\nA when experiments B and C were in need of his attention. This situation arose\nseveral times and was a considerable frustration.\nOperation of the JPL experiment was considerably simplified during the\nsimulation week by flying only the 1JV/TAOF. Omission of half the experiment\nwas in part an effort to reduce the E0\'s combined workload to a reasonable\nlevel and also reflected the fact that, in any case, the visihle/TAOJ was\nachieving only marginal clata quality.\nThe guide optics of the University of Alaska experiment were not mounted\nrigidly enough, and under various flight conditions (bumps, vibration, etc.),\nthey often shifted out of alignment with the 5-cm telescope, thus presenting\nsome problems in target acquisition. The 130 acquired the target with the guide\noptics and then raster scanned the star-tracker optics until the latter \'saw!?\n\nthe target, at which paint the system was switched to automatic guide. To\ndetermine whcn the tracker "saw" the target, the P0 monitored its voltage\noutput with a motor. Deflections were small and difficult to detect early in\na flight when the sky was relatively bright. Acquisition of the first target\nin a flight frequently took 20 to 30 min. After acquiring the first target,\nthe E0 realigned the guide optics to facilitate the acquisition of subsequent\ntargets.\nFortunately, other aspects of the Alaska experiment were less demanding\nof the E0\'s complete attention. Once on target, the spectrometer spectral\nsweep was activa t ed, and data acquisition commenced using the computer terminal.\nSpectrometer sweep was cyclic and required no further attention from the P0\nexcept to alter operating parameters.\nSpectra were summed and their average displayed on the computer terminal\ncathode-ray tube (CRT). The EO occasionally printed out a hard copy of these\nspectra (using the ADI)AS hard .-copy unit) for later P1 perusal.\nWhen the University of Colorado experiment was accepting signals from the\n35-em eiescope, the activities discussed in the first paragraph of the provious section (Alaska) applied. If the tcicsco - was on target, the beam could\nbe switched to the Colorado spectrometer with no further adjustment of the\ntelescope. As a prototype of an experiment designed to perform in space, the\nColorado spectrometer was operated completely by remote control. All the 190\nhad to do was to enter appropriate instructions at the computer terminal.\nE0 Interaction\nThe plan to have only three 130s directly involved in experiment operation\nat any one time was largely successful. Interactions among active 190. were\nnot precluded by mission guidelines, and a helpful interchange deveIo7d as\nthe simulation progressed. On the other hand, interactions with the off-duty\n190 (except verbally) were at first prohibited and then later allowed, to the\nextent of simulating the 1-hour overlap planned for Spacelah.\nDuring the first simulation flight, when each experiment was being\noperated by its primary E0, there was little need for 190 consultation. On\nsubsequent flights, however, when one or more experiments were being operated\nby secondary FOs, there was considerable interaction among all EOs, including\nthe off-duty 190 who had little cisc to do. Figure 45 gives timelines for P0\ninteraction for flights 7 and 8 (third and fourth of the simulation flights),\nduring which 190 interaction was greatest. Blocks above the heavy line for\neach experiment (or group of experiments operated by a single operator) show\ntotal experiment operation time and the operator for that flight. Smaller\nbloc\'ks h1ow the heavy line indicate assistance from another 190. For example,\non flight 7, Operator 13 was operating the JPL/Aiaska/Colorado experiment as\nhis secondary experiment. However, he also spent some time interacting with\nOperator C who, as a secondary 190, was operating the experiment for which\nOperator 13 was the prime 190.

The 130 interactions were primarily in the form of verbal exchanges oi\' operational information. Actual physical adjustment of the experiments also accounted for\neonsicJerablc time, however, as indicated by the assistance provided the\nsecondary EOs during experiment turn-on.\nOverall 130 Performance\nf10 performance during the simulation week was satisfactory. As might be\nexne\'ted, the major difference between E0 and P1 performance consisted in 130\nmeli.a1 L?rors resulting from lack of familiarity and the tight timeline requirein\xe2\x82\xacns for a single person operating several experiments. In some cases, the\norrois were seicnis (e.g., forgetting to turn on a camera during a complete\nflight, operating a tape recorder at the wrong speed for one hour, misjudging\nadequate signal-to-. noise ratio, and forgetting to turn on high voltage for most\nof prime data leg); in others, there was little loss of data (e.g, keyboard\nerrors when moving from one computer terminal to another with a slightly\ndifferent key arrangement).\nThe 1305 were resourceful in resolving problems encountered. Several\ntimes, strip chart recorders were patched from one experiment into another\nwhere a malfunction had occurred. AIso, the QMC problem that had seriously\ndegraded most data beginning with the first flight was correctly diagnosed by\nan 130 as aircra\'t radio EMI. \'T\'his diagnosis occurred in flight 8, but no\nsolution was attempted until the resumption of P1 flights since there wr.s no\nshielding material available onboard.\nOnly two exceptions to mission ground rules were made during the\nsimulation week, both with the approval of MPG representatives. The first\ncorrected a dOficiency in onboard spare parts. Four fuses were blown in a\nGroningen power supply at the end of flight 6 (the second of the simulation\nperiod). Since it was early in the simulation period and the power supply was\nvital to experiment operations, spares were obtained locally and given to the\nliOs. Thc second exception slightly revised the workload of one 130. After\nflight 6 it was dacided that the off-duty 130 would lighten the experiment\nturn-on burden of the JPL/Colorado/Alaska 130 by mounting the JPL UV TAOF at\nthe beginning of each flight. This decision was subsequently expanded to\nallow the off-duty 130 to spend up to one hour assisting other EOs where needed,\nas noted earlier.\n\nPostsimulation Flights\nFollowing the simulation period, two weeks were allocated for further\ndata flights during which the experiments were operated by the PI-, under\nnormal ASO operational procedures (no Mission Operations Center, Mission\nManager sole authority for all flight and ground operations). Seven flights\nwere conducted during this period.\nDuring this period EMI measurements on aircraft systems and experiments\nwere carried out by PSTEC specialists, both on the ground and in flight.\nAlthough the initial proposal by ESTEC included extensive EMI surveys duriig\n102\n\nthe experiment integration period, these had to be curtailed because of\naircraft and experiment installation schedules. Had the earlier measurements\nbeen made, they would have benefited the PIs who were bothered by 13M1; as it\nwas much valuable informatior was gained for Spacelab designers as well as\nfor prospective users of the CV-990.\nExcept for two sections of daylight flight, the flight plans of the PE\nflights were basically the same as for the EO flights. However, the observational situation was deteriorating; Venus was getting too near the Sun and the\nMocn was setting too late, and both events degraded the data with excessive\nbackground light. For this reason, the Southampton and New Mexico Pis did not\nparticipate in all the data flights scheduled.\nThe daylight section of flight 15 was made for the purpose of optical\ndetection of pollutant gases in the vicinity of Tuscon, Arizona. ihc astronomers were accommodated during this flight by landing at Tuscon and awaiting\ntwilight, then flying the astronomical-object data legs. The first data leg\nof flight 16 was used to calibrate the effzcts of the earth\'s atmosphere using\nthe Sun as a source of light.\nSeveral experiments entered the P1 flight phase with continuing problems:\nQMC had EMI from the aircraft radio; the Meudon telescope port was still\nco\'iered with mylar, which degraded the data noticeably and also iced on the\ninside; and JPL had trackirg, sensitivity, and EMI problems. Furthermore, the\nColorado investigator was far fromsatisfied with his results using the Alaska\ntelescope, and Southamptoi, with their results at high elevation angle. QMC\nexperimenters tried various shielding cages around their detector and preamplifier. All improved the situation somewhat, but none completely solved tho\nproblem. They stopped short of inserting RP filters in power cables.\nThe mylar icing prob].ein was solved by directing a stream of warm air\nagainst the inner surface (flight 11). The window thickness was changed from\n2 mil to 1 mil to reduce signal attenuation. However, the pressure differential\ncaused this window to bulge out, so the 2-mil window was reinstalled. Ames\nengineers designed a new aerodynamic foiicc to replace the Meudon configuration\n(flown successfully on a forward window of a French Caravel le). On flight 16,\nthe telescope performed well with the new ferice and without the mylar window.\nThe JPL P1 installed a stabilized mirror in front of his 14\xc2\xb0 window\n1cscope before the first P1 flight (flight 10). The mirror greatly improved\nhis guiding ability, but consistent guiding on an astronomical object still\nrequired constant effort by an operator. Automatic guiding remained impossible. The sensitivity and EMI problems encountered by the JPL TAOPs were not\nadequately resolved during the course of the P1 flights. In this case, new\ninstrumentation was put to use in the field before its limitations and\noperational requirements were fully understood.\nColorado joined JPL in adapting to the new telescope/mirror arrangement\n(fig. 28) and worked out a time-sharing plan for best use of observing time.\nThe Southampton group moved their TV camera to a lew-boy rack for viewing\nthrough a 14 0 elevation window, the same as New Mexico (fig. 46).\n\n103\n\nAll FOs except one (w had other commitments) were aboard during two of\nthe P1 flights. One was aboard on flights 11 and 16, and two on flights 12\nand 15. The EOs played active rules, participating directly in the operation\nof what had been their prime experiment. ro participation in P1 flights was\nnot p1anwd. It came about primarily because of I0 interest in making a\nfurther contribution to the m ssion.\n\nMISSION RESULTS\n\nThis section treats some of the more significant results of the Joint\nASSESS Mission: the performance of tne COs in their assigned duties, their\nresponse to equipment malfunctions, and their scientific accomplishments.\nBaseline comparisons with postsimulation PI data fliqhw have been evaluated\nto establish the relative effectiveness of 1O anc l P1 research operations.\nAttention is also given to performance of aircraft substem and their impact\non experiment performance, as well as to management performance in support of\nmission goals.\n\nExperiment .perator Performance\nGeneral Remarks\nTho primary objective of this mission was to test the concept of proxy\noperation of experiments by Pr-trained EOs. This concept has been ieStOd once\nbefore in an ASSESS Spacclab simulation study using a Lear Jet aircraft with a\nsingle experiment (ref. 10). During that Lear mission, two EOs operated an\nIR astronomy experiment on nine flights over a 5-day period with reasonable\nsuccess. For the Joint ASSESS Mission, each IiO operated one complex experiment\nor several simpler ones simultaneously. Mission results demonstrated the basic\nvalidity of this extension of the EO concept. Although kept extremely busy\nduring the simulation flights, the Ws managed to keep all experiments 111\noperation as required by the PIs\' respective observation plans.\nThis match of operation plan to available IiO time was not a chance occurrence, but rather evolved during final preparations of the mission. From the\nbeginning of the program it was intended that I0 assignments be demanding\nenough to permit a realistic evaluation of their capabilities. Thus, each\nexperiment had sufficient options for nearly full-time use by at least one\noperator, and as flight time approached certain simplifications were necessary\nto achieve a rcalistic FO workload. For this reason, as expected, there were\nsome concessions made to facilitate I0 operation of the two complex experiment\ngroups. In each three-experiment group, two oi the investigators reduced the\nnumbcr of operating options in their experiments to achieve a balanced time\nsharing for the group. Thus, Now Mexico limited operations to one position on\nthe left side of the cabin, while QMC used only one of the two temperature\nreferences available in the experiment. In the other group, JPL operated only\none of the TADF spectrometers and reduced the number of control adjustments on\nthat unit, while Colorado deleted the option for inflight data processing and\n105\n\nana1v-i.Witli the s e modifications worked out by the PIs and 1 :0s, the other\ntwo &?xperirnents, Southampton and Alaska, could function fully as planned.\nNeither Meudon/troniiigen nor Ames made any concessions to simplify FO tasks.\ns not as thorough as it might have been, the\nBecause the EO training\t\nsimulation got off to an uncertain start with the IOs lacking full confidence\nin their ability to operate s.gncd experiments. All of the EUs had extensive\nprior experience with olectrorie instrumentation, however, and three had prev jousi y flown with exerrn(nt s, so they were abi c- to adapt to the situation.\nAs the simu ttior week progressed, operating confidence developed rapidly with\na cuncoi,iita.0 ineroaso in performance level. Even so, ho 1Os felt that their\nperformance was still improving by the end of the simulation period. Ohiec tively, improved [Os performance also was apparent in their growing, but never\nomp1ete, independence from detailed checklists to guide txperiment ...perations.\nThe flOs provided assistance to one another across experiment 1nie which\npossible bv ross . traininr,. Most often it was the off-duty prime\noperator who advised or assisted his backup, secondary operator ir flight. in\ncontrast, the Pis seldom sought counsel from their neers diiri.g tile postsimulation flighrs, and whon they did it usually was in connection with a common\nproblem of the eilvironinent such as EMI, vibration, or background noise from\notbei sources. The assistance times of the off-duty LO were generall y of short\nduration and in agreate were tacitly assumed to represent the shift ove.lap\nperiod planned for Spacelab. One primary difference, of course, was their\noccuri ence at intervals over the data-acquisition period for trout) 1cshootjng\nproblems, or relieving peak workloads. As evidence of a growing teamwork among\nall the 0s, the frcquc\'ncy of such events increased to about 2 to 3 an\nhoir, overall.

The total simulation period was 130 hr. Times\nhavo been divided to show ground and flight activities separately. lstirnated\nflight times are based an the Moffett-Moffett takeoff and landing times. Thus,\nthe 31.7 hr total includes .6 hr spent an the ground at Los Vegas because of\nengine trouble during the first flight.

Operator A put in over\n2 hr in diagnostic efforts during the third simulation flight, while both\nOperators B and 0 gave generously of their time to assist other EOs. In the\n"ground time category, Operators A and B were involved in considerably more\ncryogenic servicing than the other Ms. Operator 0 was the only IO to remain\naboard the aircraft during an engine run-up and refuel period (2 hr) attempting\nto diagnose an equipment problem.\nThe time spent in P11130 consultation during the simulation period seems\nsurprisingly small (only 3 to 4 percent in table 13) since the microphone\napparently was in use almost continuously. However, the data show that calls\nwere frequent (as many as eight in a day between the same P1 and 130), but short\n(usually less than 4 minutes in length). The number of contacts doubled after\nthe first day and remained roughly constant at about 30 throughout the simulation period. The total amount of time per day spent by all 130s in P1 consultation similarly increased from 1 hr on the first day to about 2-1/2 hr thereafter,\nas mission activities settled into a routine.\nAn overview of the simulation period shows that an average of 40 percent\nof the ground time and almost 60 percent of the flight time was spent on oxperiment tasks (table 13). The average 20 day was divided as follows:\nExperiment tasks\t\n\n10-1/2 hr\n\nOff.-duty time in flight\t\n\n2-1/2 hr\n\nLife support functions\t\n\n8\t\n\nhr\n\nFree time (distributed)\t\n\n3\t\n\nhr\n\nmis balanco of activity appeared suitable for even longer periods than the\n5-1/2 days of the Joint Mission. After the first two days of familiarization,\nthe EOs settled into a routino that allowed more free time. Also, the off-duty\nflight gave each 130 a rest from the set routine for part of one day, an\nopportunity not available to the Mission Manager.\nIt should not be overlooked that an a standard day the 130 worked perhaps\nan hour or two longer than the average of 10-1/2 hr shown above, both in\nexperiment preparation on the ground and operation in flight, with correspondingly less discretionary time available. As the Mission Manager observed, the\nEOs seldom were without some experiment-related task to perform, except when\nsleeping.\nOperational Effectiveness and Data Quality\nTable 14 summarizes 130 performance in flight during the simulation period\nin terms of time effectiveness and data quality. Time effectiveness is expressed\nas percent of available time (time on track) t!it the experiment was operated\nto acquire data, and data quality is based on P1 estimates made at the end of\nthe simulation period using the rating scale shown in the table. It is immediately apparent that results were better for all-. sky observations than for\nastronomical targets involving acquisition and guiding functions, and depending\n108\n\n\t\n\nTABLE 14.- EO INFLTGHT PJ3RFORI4ANCE RATINGS\nData quality estimates (PI)*\nNumber (if\nPercent of available Type of\nAverage Type of operation\n-\t\nobservation\t\n\t .\t\nobservation\ntime utilized\t\nof all\nperiods\t\nobservation\t\nEquipment\nstroiT j7J\t\nii1-\t\nAll\nproblems\nEC targets sky\ntargets sky targets sky\t\n1.5\n3.3\t\n4.0\t\n9\t\n75\t\n1.9\t\n95\t\n1.4\t\nA\t\n3 80\t\nB\t\n\n2\t\n\n14 77\t\n\n65\t\n\n79\t\n\n2.5\t\n\n3.0\t\n\n2.9\t\n\n2.9\t\n\n2.5\n\nC\t\n\n6\t\n\n12 74\t\n\n40\t\n\n91\t\n\n1.8\t\n\n2.2\t\n\n2.1\t\n\n2.4\t\n\n0.5\n\nD\t\n\n7\t\n\n3 54\t\n\n40\t\n\n85\t\n\n1.7\t\n\n1.5\t\n\n1.7\t\n\n1.9\t\n\n1.2\n\nA111 24\t\n\n32 73\t\n\n523J\n\n*Data quality scale applied to P1 estimates:\nCD\n\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n\n= Excellent\t\nGood\t\n= Fair\t\n= Poor\t\n= No data\t\n\n11\n11\n18\n10\n6\n\ntimes\ntimes\ntimes\ntimes\ntimes\n\non aircraft positior a1td stability. Thus, EOs whose major assignment was\nastronomy usually s, ed lower than those making all-. sky observations. When\nequipment was operating normally, the EOs produced average or better data; when\nproblems occurred, the quality of their product dropped sharply. Overall, the\nresults are distinctly favorable; experiments were maintained in operable\ncondition to produce useful quality data for nearly three- . fourths of the time\navailable to the EOs.\nComparison of 130 and P1 Operating Performance\nDiffering modes of operation were employed on 130 and P1 data flights.\nDuring the P1 flights, there was a large increase in manpower (from 3 to 14)\nthat allowed operator specialization, and the experimenters had free access to\nequipment and outside support. In addition, significant improvements were made\non six of the eight experiments to improve data acquisition and quality. In\ncombination these factors should have created near optimum operating condition\nfor the P1s within the normal constraints of airborne research, during the\nseven postsimulation flights. The following comparisons are made with this in\nmind.\nTable 15 gives manpower loading, observation time s and data quality by\nindividual experiment for both flight periods. Data quality is based on P1\nestimates ratol on the () to 4 scale. Overall, the results for 130 and P1\noperation are quito comparable, in itself sufficient reason to commend the BOs\'\nperformance. There are some other notable factors that require attention,\nhowever. First, during the P1 flights, there was a substantial calibration\neffort for four experiments, as opposed to a modest effort for only ono during\nthe simulation period. This effort combined with actual observation times\ngives seven of the eight experiments a significantly longer period of P1 operation, clearly a reflection of the greater manpower loading. On the other hand,\ndata quality is not as favorably inclined toward the PIs. Of the three apparently significant improvements in data quality achieved by the PIs, two (Mcudon\nand Colorado) were influenced strongly by experiment changes that would have\nsimilarly benefited the EOs. Of the remaining five experiments, three achieved\nslightly better data qual.i ty and two (New Mexico and Southampton) suffered some\nreduction in quality due to sky brightness from various sources (e.g, the\nMoon) that thterferred with their observations.\nThe overall comparison at the bottom of table 15 shows P1 perfnranee\nsome 30 percent better in operating time and 20 percent in data qua1it but\nabout the same in uti1i:at.on of available observing time. If the PIs were\noperating at near peak effectiveness for the given conditions, then the EOs\nwere able to achieve about three fourths this level with less than one fourth\nthe manpower. Without question, this was an outstanding accomplishment.\nTo further clarify the relative performance of the two groups, table 16\nranks experiment in order of improvement on P1 flights and indicates the primary reasons for the observed differences. Results are given in terms of observation time and data quality. Again, manpower loading and equipment changes\naccount for the longer time periods and better data quality, respectively.\n\n110\nIrr LT7\'-\n\n\t\n\nTABLE 15.- COMPARISON OF EO AND P1 PERFORMANCE\n\t\nData quality\nCalibration\nobservation time\nestimates (P1) \t\n(avg)*\t\ntime per\nExperiment Operator manpower per flight\nfli gilt,\nPercent of No. obser.

The capability to evaluate and resolve\nproblems will be vital to the success of a Spacelab mission as it was to the\nJoint ASSESS Mission. In this respect, the present experience was a realistic\nanalog. Both the physical isolation and the means of communication were\ndesigned to duplicate the esseitia1 constraints of Spacelah.\nProblems encountered and 190 responses are summarized in table 17. Only\nthe overall trends are discussed here. Appendix A provides more descriptive\ninformation and analysis. Sixty-nine events were identified (table 17), of\nwhich almost three fourths were in the experiment, less than one fourth wore\ncaused by the operator, and the remainder by the vehicle and/or its support\nsystems (GFE). More than two thirds occurred while an 190 was operating his\nprimary experiment. Corrective measures resolved 29 problems during flights\n10 of which involved assistance from another 190 or the Mission Manager. in\nanother 25 cases, the 190 took positive action to troubleshoot the malfunction\nor to adjust his procedures to"live with it. Only 15 problems were deferred\nfor resolution after flight, and of these there were only two that caused\nexperiment operations to cease (one each on Ames and Colorado).\nTable 18 compares the frequency and resolution of only experiment malfunctions for the simulation and postsimulation periods. The total number was\nsimilar for both periods, but during the PT flights, over two thirds of the malfunctions were concentrated in the QMC and JPL experiments (RFI was a major\nproblem for both, as it had been earlier), The primary message of table 18 15\nthat the EOs were able to solve a larger number and proportion of problems\nthan the PIs, most notably in flight without P1 support. Some of the more\nserious problems required assistance from the PIs after flight, but postflight\naid of this kind was an accepted mi s sion guideline and does not detract from\n190 performance. In addition to the 90s\' competent handling of normal experiment operations, they also responded effectively, by P1 standards, to equipment\nmalfunctions. It should he noted, however, that both EOs and PIs were unable\nto solve a substantial number of problems. In a few cases, the impact of these\nunresolved problems on scientific accomplishment was significant, indicating\nthe need for a more positive input by management to the experiment development\nproc CIS S.\n\nScientific Results\nFinal assessment of scientific results achieved by the various experimenters\nmust await detailed study and interpretation 01\' the data.

It appears that the atmosphere\nis not very transparent in the wavelengths of interest, and the data obtained\non NGC-7000, M-17, and p Qphiuchi are not yet explicable,\nThe EQs contribution to the scientific reu1ts from this experiment was\nsignificant: Oer one third of the total observation time was achieved during\nE() operation, An equipment limitation beyind his control (the frosted mylar\nport window detracted from the quality of some of his records, but ctliorwise\nhis rosults compared favorably with the PPs on s imilar targets.\nQueen Mary College\nArnong the goals attempted for ASSESS was i improvement ir flic technique\nfor measiiring atmospheric infrared emission that would permit identification\nof minor atmospheric components, many of which have rich spectra. Thi.s\nrequired a trade-off between high-resolution separation and the requisite time\nto generate an interferogram. Unlike tho integrating spectrometer, which scans\ns\nonly one frequency at a time, the interfcromcter examines es entially all the\nfrequencies siiiultaneously, vielding a higher signal-to--noise ratio.\n\nSpecifically, the goals were:\n\n(\nV6\n\n1.\n\nTo o1)ttLI lino s pectra with five t imes the frequency resolution\npreviously obtained.\n\n2.\n\nTo obtain the line spectra in one-half the time\n\n3.\n\nTo identify the atmospheric components\n\npreviously\n\nrequired.\n\nthat generate the ililL\' spectra.\n\nAfter a number of obstacles were overcome, the first two goals were\nachieved, andthe status of the third will he known when data processing and\nana1 , sis ar\' completed. Although it was never intended to process all the data\nin the computation center at Ames, it was necessary to process those from early\nflights to improve and ultimately optimize the system parameters for subsequent\nflights.\nThe data processing was complex and required real-time interactions with\nthe computer to achieve results, in part because of UflCX1)ectCd RFI spikes (from\nthe CV-990 VHF system) oil the data tape that either s eriously distorted the output or stopped tho processing. Some 20 to 40 interferorams were generated\neach flight, requiring 10 min of computer time per interfcrogram. Adequate\nand timely processing was difficult, however, because access to the Ames 360\ncomputer was limited to the midnight to 8 a.m. shift, when both the P1 and the\nASO programmer had to be present for immediate postflight processing.\nThe technique for measuring infrared emission was proved valid during I0\noperations when many specLral lines with good signal-to-noise ratios were\nacquired. Further data acquisition to obtain thermal atmospheric emission\nversus wavelength calibrations was planned and carried out in the postsimulation\nperiod (the calibration data had been eliminated to simplify I0 procedure), and\nsubsequent data analysis at the PPs home base will permit source identifica\ntion. The EOs made a significant contribution to the total of scientific\nresults for the mission, although they had to operate two other experiments as\nwell. Thc.r task was unduly cop1iated by the erratic behavior of the system,\nlater identified as RFI. Over one-fourth of the interferograrns were recorded\nduring the simulation period, with it fivefold rise in output as the fiOs became\nmore adept at operations. Data quality was comparable to that obtained later\n!\t\nthe P1.\nUniversity of Southar ton\nData on 01f clouds were recorded at two different elevation angles (14\xc2\xb0 and\n60\xc2\xb0). Data ot the lower angle corrclatcd well with those taken by New Mexico\n(at 9\xc2\xb0). A trial of the TV equipment in recording meteors was not entirely\nsuccessful because of imago degradation due to aircraft roll.\nSouthampton 1oo1ed initially at high elevation angles (60\'). Will le a\nrelatively undfferent.iated haze could be detected using long integration\ntimes, i.t was not possible to see distinctive airglow features at the 600 elevation angle. Consequently, an auxiliary meteor viewing experiment was conducted, which rsu1ted in a fairly large number (about one every two minhites)\nof meteor detections on one flight due to the capacity of the intensified TV\ncamera to detect bodies of the seventh magnitude. However, viewing times were\nneither as long as desired nor in the most appropriate quandrant because of the\npriority given other experiments.\t\n117\n\nSubsequentl y , duriin , the final two weeks of the mission, Southampton\ninvestigators made U5C o \'f\' a 110 elevation window and were grat i fi oi to see an\nenorrnous amount of Oil ail-glow .ructure. \'Ilic P1 believe.,; tIat t1\t\nclifforence\nbetween results at 60 0 and 14\xc2\xb0 canilot be explained by horizontally ;tratified\nregions, but that the regions may contain wedgo-shape. strata instead. Analysis of the tapes at the experimenter\'s home base will permit more thorough\nstudy of the data on rnteors (there are about six frames per meteor) and on\nthe distribution and cometry of the airglow regions.\nThe J0s made a significant contribution to tne scientific r -x1ts from\nthis experiment. Again, the equipment was well automated for continuous operat ion with little attention. More than one-third of the total record was made\nduring r() operation, with a quality comparable to that of the P1 team.\nAlthough these data were recorded at 60 0 elevation angle (s directed by the 111)\nand, for the reasons given, do not reveal the detailed sructurc expected, they\niievertlielcss provide important evidence to aid the understanding of 011 cloud\nphysics.\nAmos Research Center\nDuring the relatively brief period in which the tunes experiinent made use\nof the Meudon telescope aboard the ( T_ 990, IR ol rvat ions werv. carried out on\nVenus,\t\n!1eru1is, and TRC 10216. The Moon was..!so obse rved for calibration.\nDuring each flight an which the Ames experiment was operated, at least a\nquarter hour of continuous Venus data was obtained. However, the data are\nacconpanied by considerable spectral noise and an offset duo to the rny1ar winthe\ndow over\ntelescope port. The rnylar not only reduced the spectral response\nrange of the detector from its normal 3-6 im to 3.7-5.2 p m but also introduced\nan offset that was an order of magnitude greater than the signal level. It\nshould he 110551b1c to average the noise and compensate for the offset to obtain\nuseful data on Venus. I}espito the attenuation of the signal by the mylar cover,\nthe absorption lines of this material have been used to provide an accurate\ncalibration of the filter wheel.\n\nin\n\nl\'here were problems on the flight\nivhich rz Ilerculis and IRC 10216, and\nVirginia were\nroll occurred, apparently due to a minor\nma1adj..tment in the aircraft autopi l ot. It was not possible to acquire either\ncx llerculis or\t Virginis long enough to obtain useful data.

Data obtained with the UV TAOF appeared of\nmarginal quality, e\'en though a stabilized mirror was introduced into the\noptical systeni after the simulation period to allow more consistent gulding on\n118\n\nastronomical objects. This instrument was delivered s o late that it received\nno laboratory checkout, o reasons for the lack of sensitivity are not\nunderstood.\nThe visible range TAU, operated only during the P1 flights recorded\npcctroscojic data on twilight airglow, the Moon and sornc night airglow in the\nrange from 43() to f 0o nrn. This experiment suffered from a high background\ni\nnoise 1cvo1 and 1.II, so the taped data will have to undergo computer analysis\nbefore yielding true spectral information.\nOver three-fourths of the operating time on the IJV system as accumulated\nby the FOs, and data quality was comparable to P1 results.

About 2-112 hr of Venus spectral data have been\nobtained, which will he normalized using solar data obtained on the single day\nflight of the mis s ion. This information will then be analyzed for contitticnts\nof the atmosphere of Venus, for example, SO 2 and Nil.\nSonia terrestrial airglow ({J flerzherg and 011 Meinol) data were obtained.\nAfter noise filtering, those are expected to yield information on airg10\ntemperature and intensity as a function of position. This information will\nthen he compared with theoretical calculations of hand shape as a function of\ntemperature.\nIn addition, sufficient information was acquired during twilight\nobservation ,, to deduce 0 densities in the Larth\'s atmosphere. Fhese data will\nbe used to deduce the total ozone content as a function of altitude for varinus\nsolar depression angles. This will yield atmospric transmission in the\nultraviolct region. A few spectra of atomic oxygen lines have been obtained\nfor referonce use (355. nm and 630 nn).\nP0 operations accounted for one-third of total mission observations on\nboth Venus and skyglow, although data quality was limited by experiment otics\nand P0 workload. Even so, tho bulk of the P0 acquired data cnn be u,;(-,d\ndirectly to augmonv P1 results.\nUniversity of Colorado. The 12.5-cm spectrometer has vie lded what appears\nto he good data, but a computer analysis will he required for a thorough\nassessment. Information to be derived includes, for example, the cloud cover\nof Venus (through observations of the Moon and Venus at the same wavelengths),\nand the Farth\' s atmospheric absorption in the near-1.11\' region (through nervations of the Moon at higher altitudes on the CV-990 and at the lower altitude\nof Mount 1vans, Colorado) .

Their contribution to\nscientific results\nis thus of 1eser value, but through no fault of their own.\nun:vorsit- of New Mexico\nExci1Ient data an 011 atmospheric 1ouds were recorded. When correlated\nwith tirne and airci ift positio11 the results will provide a more accurate\ndetermination of those clouds than had been previously possible. Preliminary\nindications are that some of the observed clouds are considerably higher than\nexpected.\nDuring the entire mission about 30 hr of data were obtained, including\n500 frames of\t\n1-,,;\'c exposures and 45 hr of photometer data in scveral\nselected narrow bandwidths. Comparison of the photographic and photometric\ndata wili permit the determination of possible correlations between the type\nof 011 structure observed with such factors as tropopause height, magnetic and\nsolar activity indexes, local weather, and geographic features such is mountain\nranges.\nF0 contributions to the scientific results were substantial. The\nexperiment .as well automated and reliable, allowing full-time operation with\nlittle attention. Thus, the flQ generated nearly one-third of the total data\nobtained, with a quality fully equal to that recorded by the P1 team,\nData acquisition was somewhat 1irnitd by (1) the large number of Venus\nruns during twilight, (2) the numerous p Ophiuchi runs durinl, which the instruments viewed the highly structured rogion of the summer Milky Way in Scorpio\nand Sagittarius, and (3) tho presence of the Moon on several of the flights.\nIn spite of this and by uti1iing both sides of the plane during nonsimulation\nflights, an average of more thaii 3.5 hr of data per flight were obtained from\neach of the three instruments for the 14 flights flown by this experiment.\nThe equipment was removed on June 18, since the last two flights would have\nbeen either in twilight or with bright moonlight.\n\nExperiment Problems and Operating Constraints\nResearch accomplishments have beer described in the previous section.\nFor Spacclab, however, therc is perhaps greater interest in the problems\ncncountored and solutions devised in the pursuit of research goals. It 15\nhoped that through an identification of weaknesses that emerged under simulated\nSpacelab conditions, the same or analogous situations may be avoided in real\nli..c whore the cost of failure, or of preventing failure, is of much larger\nconsequence. In this Jiscussion, problems are grouped by type or by functional\nthis\nsystem rather than by individual experiment. Specific problem categories, the\nand\nnature of the problems,\nthe corrective actions taken, are listed in the\nappendix at the end of this report. In the following sections, problems in\nthose categories are addressed.\n120\t\n\n-\n\nProblems were encountered even before experiments were shipped to Ames;\nsome were quic\'kly resolved, while others had a profound and long-lived impact.\nWith perhapsene exception, these and subsequent problems were adequately\nresolved and good experiment performance was achieved before the end of the\nmission. Some prohlcnis were aircraft related, with a loose-coupled but yet\nThe\nmajority, however, were more closely\nsignificant analogy to Spacelab.\nrelated.\nAs the laboratory stage of experiment development neared completion,\npreparations for integration became an impnrtant concern and interaction with\nthe Mission Manager increased accordingly. Standard instrument racks were\nshipped to participants in October, and Pis were requested to submit detailed\ninstallat i on sketches and stress analyses of rack and custom-mounted equipment\n(details of Level IV integration planning) by early December. In most cases,\nthese Level IV plans required one interaction to satisfy safety requirements;\nin two or three cases, several interactions were required. Even so, two\nexperiment mounts were disqualified by airworthLiess engineers at Ames, and\nseveral less significant but time .r onsuming errors had to be resolved. The\nthree contributing factors were: lack of P1 design experience with aircrafttype loading, the lack of on-sito safety reviews by ASO due to budget constraints, and the inadequacy of some CV-990 Handbook information for Joint\nMission participants.\nExperiment Integration Period\nCategory 1 includes problems that occurred during che integration period.\nThe nature of integration concerns (both in the home laboratory and at Ames)\nis indicated together with the corrective actions taken. Substantial ASO/Aincs\nsupport was required to satisfy flight safety and experiment/vehicle interface\ndemands, particularly for U.S. experiments. Unique schedule delays (one\ncaused by shipping damage) had a serious impact potential this late in the\nprogram; two were resolved but one could not he. Three experiment interface\nmismatches were finally resolved, but one caused a significant data loss.\nRecognized deficiencies in design for EO operation of one or a group of experimonts were partly made up by procedures lists and by on .-the-job experience,\nbut these"solutions" notably increased FO wcrkload and the amount of learning\nnecessary for effective experiment operation.\nInflight Experiment Operation\nCategory 11 problems are component malfunctions within experiments during\nthe flight phases of the mission: checkout (CO), imu1ation (EO) or postsimulation (P1). With few exceptions, they were first observed in flight and\ndirectly affected data acquisition. Of a total of some 50 to 55 problems in\nthis category, almost half had a serious impact on performance and fully onefourth could have either forced shutdown of part or all of the experiment for\nthe remainder of the mission, or severely degra 1 \'d the scientific worth of the\ndata. Portunate1y, all but five of this latter group were identified and\nresolved (at least partially) during the checkout/integrated mission simulation\nperiod. The rernaining five were a d3tector failure with no bacup unit, a\nlow-sensitivity optical system (enclosed package), an unsuitable control\n\n121\n\n(manual guidance) system, a marginally suitable optical window, and a lowsensitivity star tracker. Three o:curred in a single experiment employing two\nnew state-of-the-art instruments with relatively unknown characteristics.\nThe most frequent malfunctions occurred in data processors and signal\nelectronics, with optical systems and recorder problems occurring at a lesser\nrate. These troubles were generally of ci less serious nature and could he\nhandled by the EUs. Detector packages and control systems had fewer but more\nserious problems. The former could not he repaired on location and required\nbackup units to continue operation, while the latter were inherent design\nlimitations that could not be properly resolved without major effort.\nExperiment support Systems ((FE\nCategory 111 problems relate to GFE systems that supported experiment\noperations. Most were resolved prior to the simulation period by equipment\nand procedural changes. The notable exception was a vacuum system that had\nbeen inadequately defined in the r iginal P1 request for GFE support. Design\ncapacity was revised upward by a factor of 6 prior to installation, and again\ndoubled during the checkout period, but still was marginal for the large helium\nboiloff from the experiment. Surge limits on aircraft 60-Hz inverters prevented the use of yet a larger pump. By close attention to vacuum leaks the\nP1 was able to achieve a pressure level suitable for experiment operation, but\nat some sacrifice in overall sensitivity.\nCentral Data Facility ((FE)\nProblems in category IV are related to the central data facility on the\naircraft (AD[)AS). Historically, ADI)AS has provided a a1uah1e onboard capability to record primary research data and time-correlate them to flight parameters, as well as to process the input from several related experiments for\nnear real-time comparisons. At the same time, the overall effectiveness of the\nsystem has been limited by its modest size and by the software workload imposed\nby closely spaced flight missions having different experiments and/or dataprocessing requirements. ASO management recognized those limitations, but\nanticipated that advance planning would enable P1 requests to be implemented\nby WAS personnel for maximum effective utilization of the data system. To\nthis end, Pis were asked to finalize their software requirements for the Joint\nMission by mid-February, a date that wai not uniformly honored.\nAs it turned out, the requests for AI)DAS services exceeded the system\ncapability in two respects - the rate of data acceptance and the amount of\nreal-time processing. The resulting negotiations served to delay program\nimplementation. Software preparation was further complicated by two requests\nfor immediate postflight processing of ALJDAS tapes in the Ames computer center\nto yield information for daily evaluation of results and planning for the subsequent flight. Even with additional manpower loading, these requests could\nnot he fully implemented, in part because of delays in coordination of P1/AI)I)AS\nactivities. Finally, on-line checkout of experiment/ADIJAS integration was\ndelayed by experiment problems late in the checkout period when time for\nprogram changes was very limited, with the result that inflight operation was\nsubject to unnecessary faults and stops for much of the mission. For the Joint\n122\n\nMission, then, it appears that both the level of coordination with PIS and the\nsoftware development effort should have been greater and matured earlier.\nMI/EMC Effects\nProtection from EMI, both radiated and conducted was one uf the design\nprinciples recommended as a guide to experiment development. ESA-sponsored\nPis were required and NASA-sponsored PIs were requested to isolate, shield, and\nground their equipment to minimize sources and pickup. Definitive measurements\nwere carried out by ESTEC specialists during the mission; their results are\ngiveri in reference 15.\nThree experiments had serious [MI problems (category V) that resisted all\nefforts to correct them. Two sources were identified - the aircraft VHF radio\n(the CV-990 Handbook cautions the experimenter to avoid these frequencies) and\nthe aircraft power distribution system - and radiated pickup was the primary\nconcern for two of the three experiments. The third experiment was bothered by\nan ambient magnetic field that caused distortion of image-intensifier pictures\nthe offending source was not identified. In all three cases, some improvement\nwas made by standard procedures such as shielding and cable rerouting. Two\nexperiments acquired data of reasonable quality, but data quality for the third\nremained poor.\nSchedules and Time Sharing\nCategory VI illustrates situations that required time sharing, at some\ncompromise of individual goals, to achieve an integrated payload operation.\nAt the level of overall flight planning, certain experiment priorities for the\nmission were established by the MPG, but the Mission Manager implemented the\nschedule. At the level of daily flight planning, the PIS and the Mission\nScientist reached agreement (within mission guidelines and subject to Mission\nManager approval) on specific targets and timing to complement previous results.\nPriorities for iO time in flight were decided by the Pts of coordinated experiments. And in flight, the EOs made real-time decisions to maximize experiment\nperformance and data quality, including requests for assistance from an\nassociate where time constraints were critical.\nThis multilevel distribution of time-sharing decisions nroved effective\nduring the simulation period. In the pos\'tmission period, flight profile\ndecisions by the Mission Manager and operations decisions by the Pis followed\nnormal ASO practice.\nVehicle Operations\nThis category (VII) is clearly more aircraft-specific than the others,\nbut there is some analogy to Spacclab with regard to orientation relative to\ncelestial light sources, latitude requirements, and time-of-day constraints.\nSuch constraints resulted from the necessity to time-share flight profiles for\nthe benefit of the total payload, with deference to those experiments having a\npriority designation. Even so, there were several opportunities for real-time\ndeviation from the flight profile to accommodate special requests. These were\ndecided by the Mission Manager, after consultation and approval of the flight\ncrew. It is not unlikely that similar events can occur in Spacelab.\n123\n\nTwo experiments had localized temperature problems. In both cases the\nP1 depended on cabin air circulation for heat .supply or dissipation, and no\nproblems were anticipated since none had occurred in the laboratory. Although\nfixes were devised in flight for both experiments, this experience poinK to\nthe need or heat management studies of Spacelab experiments.\n\nMission Management\nIn normal ASO operations tht Mission Manager bears full responsibility\nfor mission planning and execution. Early recognition that both the simulation\nand the international aspects of the NASA/ESA mission would add greatly to\nmission complexity led to the assignment of an assistant mission manager\nshortly after the initial MPG meeting in January 1974. His primary responsibility was experiment integration and support systems, including the arrangement\nof equipment 111 the aircraft cabin. Even with an assistant, however, the\nmyriad details of the Joint Mission were all but overwhelming for the Mission\nManager.\nThe management areas in which most problems occurred were: (1) airworthiness engineering, (2) experiment development schedules, (3) coordination among\nPis, and (4) Ar)I)AS requirements and capahilities. Problems in the first area\narose mainly because NASA lacked travel funds to send an Ames airworthiness\nrepresentative to P1 laboratories prior to the ERRs. Participation by an Ames\nrepresentative at that stage would have avoided a number of time-consuming\nreworks of support hracketry and Level. IV integration details. The normal\nrequirements are stipulated in the CV-990 Experimenters\' Handbook, but many\ndetails slip by Pis lacking flight experience. Further, as in every airborne\nmission, unique situations required investigation and decision. Although the\nmajority of these were handled earlier, some were not recognized until the\nincoming inspection at Ames.\nProblems in the second area arose for two reasons: the delay in selection\nof U.S. experiments and the lack of sufficient emphasis on ERR requirements.\nDelays in experiment completion had a significant impact on final integration\nand LO training schedules in the last weeks before the mission. In the third\narea of P1 coordination, proxy operation by LOs involved human engineering, training, and time-sharing arrangements far greater than for normal ASO missions.\nAt the time, the required level of management direction to achieve acceptable\nresults was not known and, except for overall t r aining and flight schedules,\nthe details were left to the initiative of the individual PIs and Ws. This\narrangement was not satisfactory, even with specific reminders from the Mission Manager; the FO,,; were not in a position to work across experiment linos,\nand PIs were primarily concerned with their own experiment. Greater management\ncontrol clearly is needed to ensure timely and effective P1 coordination among\nthemselves and in terms of LO operating requirements.\nThe C irth management area in which problems occurred was the utilization\nof the central data system (ADDAS). This facility and any interfacing with the\nAmos computation center is supported by contract, both for software and operations. There was notable difficulty in communication between Ames personnel\nand the PIs until they met and could work on a one- . to-one basis. Unique\n124\n\n.ODUCIfflLJTY OF THE\n..GJNAL PAGY IS\n\nrequirements could not be clearly defined by reference to the CV-990 Handbook,\nand misunderstandings meant delay. To compound the software problem, P1\nrequirements changed as experiments neared completion. Thus, much work remained\nto be done at Ames involving program language, interface, hardware, signal input\nlevels, and offline processing - all matters that should have been resolved much\nearlier.\nMinor dif\'icu1ties and some loss of experiment checkout time occurred when\naircraft mainteilallce schedules conflicted with P1 work plans. Compromises\nworked out by the Mission Manager or his assistant werc not always acceptable\nto experimenters who were working a 16-hr day much of the time. Flight operations produced no management problems. The Mission Scientist was effective in\ndealing with planning activity that took p \' ace while the Mission Manager wa\nflying or asleep.\n\nASSESS-SPACELi\\13 SIMILARITIES\n\nAlthough experiment installation and operation on the Joint ASSESS Mission\ncannot fully simulate a Spaeelab payload and operation, there are many similarities between the two that provide a basis for identifying elements of ASSESS\nexperience that are relevant to Spacelab experiment planning and operation.\nThis section explores the parallels between simulated and planned Spacelab\nobjectives, procedures, and operations, Relevant ASSESS experience and lessons\napplicable to Spacolab operations are discussed in the final section of the\nreport.\n\nGeneral Mission Parameters\nSpacelab: Significant experiments to ASSESS: Authentic science conducted\nbe conducted froni Spacelah\t\nfrom aircraft\nReal oxperimits in astronomy and atmospheric physics were conducted, taking\nadvantage of the aircraft altitude to obtain data not possible from ground\nobservations. As discussed earlier, satisfactory scientific results were\nachieved.\nSpacelab: Fixed countdown to liftoff ASSESS: Rigid schedule to takeoff\nThe\none\nwas\nand\n\nblock of time allotted for this mission was scheduled a year in advance as\ncommitment in a full-time research program for the CV-990. Time of month\nfixed by phase of the Moon to minimize ambient light level for astronomical\nskyglow measurements.\n\nDaily takeoff times were controlled by the astronomical object first to be\nviewed - usually Venus. Precise positioning and heading of the aircraft were\nrequired to attain astronomical objects within the limited elevation angle\ncapability of the teloscopes.\n\n125\n\nSpace1ab Orbiter\n\nand Spacelab\t\noperations to be separated\t\n\nASSESS: Aircraft and experiment operations separated, yet both under\nthe cognizance of the Mission\nManager\n\nAll aircraft operations were handled by specialists - the ground crew and the\nflight crew. When necessary, the experimenters could interface with these\nspecialists through the Mission Manager.\nSpacelab: Large weight and volume \t\ncapability to be provided\t\n\nASSESS: Ample weight and volume\nprovided for Spacelab\nsimulation\n\nThe passenger cabin of the CV-990 approximates in volume and dimensions the\nmaximum space planned for Spacelah. However, the equipment on the Joint Mission was not arranged in a manner similar to Spacelab. The 20,000-Ib payload\ncapacity of the CV-90 aircraft is comparable to Spacelab and posed 110\nlimitation on the mission equipment.\nS_pacelab: Relatively benign environ- ASSESS: Mostly unmodified laboratory\nequipment used\nrnent to permit use of \t\n1 l boratory_t)rpe equipment\nIn general, lahoratoiy equipment was used without special modifications for\nthe aircraft environment. In a few cases, flight safety rules required minor\nmechanical or electrical changes. Frequent use was made of stabilized optics\nto fix the viewing direction.\nSpacelah: Short development times\t\nplanned for Spacelah\t\n\nASSESS: Less than 1 year scheduled for\nASSESS experiment development\nand flight\n\nSeveral experiments were developed for flight from ground-based prototypes in\na period of 7 months.\n\nServices and Hardware\nSpacelab: Essential services (power, \t\nenvironment, etc.) and\t\nstandard equipment fittings\t\n(racks, windows) to be\nprovided\n\nASSESS: Power and shirtsleeve atmosphere provided; standard racks\nand modified windows available\n\nThe basic power supply on the aircraft is 115-200 V, three-phase, 400 1i from\nthe engine generators. For experiment use, four 8-kVA 400-0 convertcrs are\nprovided. To accommodate European experiments, 50-hz power was provided for\ncritical equipment such as TV systems, and 28-Vdc power was supplied as needed\nin small amounts. Only 60-Hz and 400-Hz power are regularly available at the\nexperiment stations. This power 15 distributed through a control panel at the\nMission Manager\'s station to 20 individual power boxes. Cables run from the\npower boxes to panels of receptacles on each equipment rack into which\n126\n\nlaboratory equipment may be plugged using standard U.S. three-wire grounding\nplugs. Voltage and frequency are controlled to 2 percent or better, but the\nfrequency is not sufficiently precise for timing applications. Current surge\nlimits on the 60-Hz converters prohibit the use of electric motors larger than\n1/2 hp (375 W). Temperature in the aircraft cabin was coiitrolled by the flight\ncrew to permit shirtsleovo operations.\nAmes provides standard racks for mounting electronic and other equipment.\nThe racks fasten to the scat rails and so may be placed in the best location.\nThe racks take standard electronic panel-mounted equipment, but may also be\nused to support equipment such as telescopes and cameras.\nThe aircraft is provided with ports giving viewing angles of zenith, nadir,\n65\xc2\xb0 above the horizontal, and 14\xc2\xb0 (the standard passenger windows). Selected\npassenger windows and any of the special ports may be fitted with special\noptical glass or other material such as IR transmitting plastic.\n\nData System\nSp .elab: Control and data manage- \t\nment system (CDMS) to be\t\nprovided\t\n\nASSFSS; Airborne digital dataacquisition system (ADDAS)\nprovided\n\nThe CV.-990 is equipped with an onboard data management system with a moderate\ncomputational capability (fig. 47). The system is used to record flight parameters from the aircraft\'s central air data and inertial navigation systems,\ndata from experiments, and voice comments via typewriter input. The basic data\nare recorded in digital form on magnetic tape. Experiment data can be processed\nin real time, correlated timewise with flight parameters and comments, and\nprinted out as real-time, hard-copy record. Selected data are also displayed\nan television monitors (10 sec update), and can he plotted or printed as hardcopy. Table 1 indicates the data system usage\t\neach experiment.

The\ntool inventory was developed in consulation with the experimenters involved,\nand it included experiment-peculiar tools where necessary. A work station was\ninstalled in the aircraft for the simulation period (fig. 38). The common tool\ninventory was placed here along with the common test equipment and selected\nspare parts. In addition, a small 13-. cm oscilloscope and a nultiinetor that\nare carried on the aircraft at all times were available to the Ws.\n\nPayload Crew\nSpacelab: Payload specialists and\nASSESS: Experiment operators and Mission Manager confined for\nmission specialists to be\nconfined to Orbiter/Spacelab\n5-1/2 days\n\nfor 7 days\nDuring the simulation period, the EUs and the Mission Manager were confined to\nthe aircraft. A living/sleeping area was mounted on a lift van truck for\npositioning adjacent to the rear passenger door (fig. 48), and a cryogenic\nservice area was located at the base of the forward passenger stairway (fig.\n49).\n\n129\n\nSpacelab.

The fourth was permitted to assist, briefly, during the start tip\nof onc group of experiments. It developed that mutual assistance between primary and secondary EOs on an experiment for periods of only a few minutes each\nwas very bncficia1 for troubleshooting malfunctions.\n\nThe Mission Manager controlled power, data system, communication, and\ncryogenic resources. He coordinated overall payload operations with flight\nactivities, and was the interface contact between payload and fli"ht crews.\n\nFlight Operations\nSpacelab: Communication to be provided ASSESS: TV downlink and bidirectional\n- voice link operational during\nbetween payload specialist\t\nand P15 on the ground\t\nperiods the aircraft was on\nthrough TV downlink and\t\nground\nbidirectional voice link\nDuring flight, no facilities were provided for communications between 10s in\nthe aircraft and Pis on the ground. While on the ground during the simulation\nweek, the aircraft was connected to the Mission Operations Center by two bidirectional voice links and a downlink video channel (with audio). A facsimile\nuplink was simulated by hand carrying small quantities of printed or graphic\nmaterial when necessary.\nSpacclab: Experiment facilities to be ASSESS: Two PIs used common telescope\nused by more than one group\t\nby changing detectors at focal\nof investigators\t\nplane; two PIs used common\ntelescope by placing beam\nreflecting mirror in optical\nPath\nThe two primary examples of shared use of equipment on the ASSESS mission were\nthe Ames/Groningen use of the Meudon telescope, and joint use of the Alaska\ntelescope by the Alaska and Colorado experimenters. Ames and Groningen provided\ntheir own dewars and detectors to be attached to the telescope, as well as their\nown data-handling electronics. Physically, the two detector units were sufficiently different to require rebalancing of the telescope each time the units\nwere changed. Because of the complexity of this operation and the time\nrequired to complete it, no attempt was made to change dewars in flight.\nShared telescope use by Alaska and Colorado experimenters was handled\ndifferently in that the sensing components were pemanent1y mounted and a small,\nplane mirror was inserted into the optical beam to deflect it from one experiment to the other. However, similarities in observational objectives for the\n132\n\ntwo experiments led to scheduling difficulties, and the Colorado spect "metcr\nwas moved during the P1 flights so that it time shared on of the J111,t.1e\nscopes with a JPL instrument. Telescope w;e was now similar to the first type\ndescribed: one sensing component was substituted for the other when a change\nin user was made; in this case, the conversion could be made in clight, since\nno balancing was required.\n\nLESSONS L!ARNED FOR SPACELITh\n\nThe Joint ASSESS Mission illustrated that a low-cost program with a low\nlevel of preparatory reuirernents, testing, and documentation can operate successfully under a simplified, focused, and directly interactive rnanagc nt\napproach. Appropriate and timely information on constraint5 and capabilities,\nas well as guidelines for hardware development, do cnhance the chances for\nsuccess. From the knowledge gained, it can he projected \t\nreasonable\ncertaint that an analogous approach will enable low-cost programs such a\nthose envisaged for Spacelab to be successfully implemented.\nThis mission also showed that an aircraft can serve as an excellent\nplatform for optimizing the methodology, design, and operations aspects of\nexperiments concei v ed for Spacelah. This observation is particularly valid\nfor experiments that are still in an embryonic stage, before large mounts Of\ndevelopment time and money have been expended.\nThe 1esEn5 learned for Spacolab cover soverni specific areas. Some\nunderline experience that 1:; familiar to participants in the NASA Manned Lpace\nProgram, but which may be new to ESA personnel preparing for Spacelah\nparticipt .n.\n\nManagement\nSimplified management techniques can he effectively applied to\nexperiment development, integration, and operations- with a low\nlevel of imposed specifications and testing, resulting in relatively low cost, if the participants arc\' competent and are\nstrongly motivated.\nThc key to effcctive, low cost management of airborne or Spacelah mis.ions\nis a close working rL1ations11ip between the experimenter wh o is directly\nresponsible for implementing his own re s earch plans, and the Mission Manager\nwho is responsible for coordination among participating experimenters, adherence\nto safety requirements, vehicle and support s y stems itt i1iation, and overall\nplanning of mission operations.\nExperimenter centered responsibility for the development and performance\nof an experiment, as well as for the quali.t v of research results, is not only a\nstrong motivation for success, but also serves to minimize the arnoirnt of control\nand proof docuinentation rcquircd to implement a mission.\n\n133\n\nA .a11 planning group with representation from each appropriate\n\nparticipating rganization is effective in establishing policy and\nguidelines for mission implementation.\nThc Mission Pl.nning Group (MPG) proved its value in sctting the overall\nobjectives of the mission and in developing guidelines for the implementation\nof the objectives. The group worked efficiently because it ivaF small and composed of interested persons from the various organizations involved in management. The MPG did not include experimenters representatives. However, members\nof the MPG also sat in on meetings with the experimenters anti so interacted\nwith them in a reasonable manner. Details of the mission implementation were\ndelegated by the MPG to the Mission Manager.\nA Mission Manager with adequate authority can effectively execute the\npolicies of the planning group and act as the single paint of contact\nfor the management of all mission integration activities. Such a\nmanager must have the appropriate background to understand experiment\nobjectives and instrumentation, and interexperiment and carrier interfaces. Ile should have a small and competent staff, working with him\nthroughout all phases of the mission, to which he can delegate responsibility for d.ai1s. To ensure effective coordination through all\nphases of the mission, the Mission Manager should not normally fly\non Spacelab.\nThe responsibilities of the Mission Manager throughout the Joint Mission\nhave been described. These management techniques, refined by ASO experience\n\nover a dozen years, have proven , cry effective in the management of airborne\nscientific research. The concept of a single point of contact makes it easy for\nand\nproblems consh! ered in a\nthe scientists involved to have their objectives,\nstraight forward r. inner.\nThe manager for this mission had operated earlier missions with objectives\nin astronomy and atmospheric physics. This background and experience in these\nfields contributed significantly to the success of the mission. The scientists\nand operators must feel that they caii talk on a professional. level with the\nMissionManager to ensure a satisfactory understanding of their objectives and\nproblems.\nThe Mission Manager served quite effectively as Mission Specialist during\nthe simulation period. This is normal ASO practices which was estahlishcd for\nthree reasons: The staff is small, flight operations are self contained, and\nreal-time decisions are vital to optimum payload operations. Management\nexpertise thus is concentrated where it will be most valuable. But in the\nJoint Mission, the basic structure was different, with science planning by PIs\nand science operations by EOs as largely separate functions. For proper\nchronological coordination of the two functions, early data analysis and planning was done while the simulation crew was asleep. The major task of the\nMission Scientist was to develop a plan for the next flight in consultation\nwith the PIs, so that a uetailed flight profile could be machine .-. computed and\napproved by the Mission Manager and aircraft operations personnel well before\nflight. An alternate solution was a separate Mission Specialist. The Mission\n134\n\nManager\'s porspoctKo of the total mission would perhaps have been better\nfrom the ground, witil important onboard duties handled by a thoroughly trained\nMission Specialist acting as interface between aircraft and the payload.\nSpacelab operations similarly may he more effectively coordinated if the\nMission Manager remains on the ground, again locating the expertise whore it is\nmost valuable. Certainly the Manager\'s staff will he substantially larger and\nmore specialized, and interactions with vehicle support groups will he more\ncomplex. Furthermore, ther\' will be coinmuiications with the Spacelah crew to\nfacilitate on-ground science planning and, if necessary, real-time decisions to\noptimize payload operations. Thus, the Mission Specialist concept could be\ndeveloped into a very significant role. In the ovnt that a separate Mission\nSpecialist is chosen, he should he a full- . time rnernhcr of the Mission Manager\'s\nstaff through all phases of the mission. His associations and responsibilities\nwill require background and experience similar in kind and second only to the\nManager\'s. Thus, in practice, he should be an assistant Mission Manager.\nThe application of ASO management practices to the Joint ASSESS\nMission was generally successful, and these techniques can provide a\nvaluable basis for the planning of Spacclab payloads and operatDns.\nAs expected, however, the added complexity of Spacelab-type operations will require somewhat more rigid and formal arrangements than\nthose normally associated with ASO payloads. In particular, a com1 prehensive implementation plan that details key activities is essen.tial, to monitor experiment progress and promptly counteract delays.\nReliance on the P1 for development of his own experiment provides a\nhigh degree of motivation to ensure successful delivery and operation of the hardware. Free contact between the P1 and other mission participants (via the Mission Manager) encourages the successful conclusion of these activities. Some limited fcnia1 review of\n[experiment progress is needed, however.\nNormal ASO practice for airborne experiments confers the entire\nresponsibility for proper experiment operation on the P1. If the P1 does not\nobtain satisfactory operation from his experiment, he is the loser, but no one\nelse is directly involved. In Space1ab however, the P1 will probably not be\noperating his experiment, and its improper operation could detract from another\nexperiment by requiring excessive time of the payload specialist. Thus, for\nSpacelab, some formal assurance of proper operation will be required.\nThe experiment readiness review (ERR) was used on the Joint Mission and\nthe two previous Lear Jet simulation missions (refs. 8-10) as a means of\nchecking on experiment progress. In principle, the experiment is in final\nconfiguration, fully tested, and proven operational by the ERR date, one month\nprior to shipment. The procedure is desirable, but needs further refinement\nto assure compliance. The ERR guideline was not viewed as a requirement on\nthe Joint Mission and could not he enforced. For the ASSESS mission, experiment development and equipment changes continued right up until the first\nflights and interfered with the training of the EUs. To permit suitable training of Spacolab payload\t\necia1ists, experiments must be in their final flight\nconfiguration at some rsonab1e time before launch.\n135\n\nExperiment/experiment interface areas require some management con- trol to assure proper development of hardware, operator training,\nand time-share schedules. A c1ar management responsibility exists when several experiments are\ngrouped for a single operator or when equipment is shared by several investigators. The resulting interface areas require early definition to guide\nindividual development efforts. Although this management function was specified\nin the Joint Mission, it was not implemented in sufficient depth to preclude\nsignificant problems. Whereas P1 time-sharing relative to flight schedules and\nprofiles was adequately managed, and overall 130 training schedules were defined,\nthe details of interexji\'riment planning were left to the PIs initiative, with\nmanagement in an advisory role. The result was not satisfactory. Communication among PIs was not adequate to resolve even soiiir basic hardware interfaces,\nand planning and training for multiple-experiment cerations was minimal.\nThe obvious lesson 15 that these interface areas should be bridged at a\nhigher 1cvc1 of management where payload integration, rather than an individual\nexperiment, is the primary concern. It is fair to say that the significance of\nthis management role was perhapz not fully recognized at the outset, but became\nabundantly clear during final integration when actions were being taken by the\nMission Manager to redress the most obvious deficiencies.\nRelatively small amounts of control and interface document. and\nprocedures suffice to ensure a successful low-cost mission, so long\nas the requirements are clearly specified. To be effective, this\nsimplified documentation approach requires clear delegation of\nresponsibilities to participants and quick and efficient\ncommunication amon\nThe small amount of Thcumentation used on this mission proved sufficient\nand satisfactory except for two notable items. A ilunl \' er of experimenters\npointed to what they considered deficiencies in the Experimenters\' Handbook for\nthe CV-990 aircraft. Their comments were constructive and revisions are being\nmade. The other deficiency in documentation resulted from delays in experiment\ndevelopment schedules. The full attention of most Prs to their experiments\nwell into the integration period precluded their preparation of training documents for the EOs at a reasonable time in advance of the final training period.\nMost of thc\' checklists actually were prepared by the Ws and confirmed by the\nPis. Management adherence to experiment development milestones would ensure\nth at training documents were available when needed.\n\nExperiment Equipment\nEarly in the development of the experiment equipment, the design of\nindividual components must be guided by the fact that each experiment will be operated as an integral part of the total payload.\nLittle attempt could be made by PIs during the Joint Mission to coordinate\nthe design of their several experiments for control by a single operator due to\n136\n\nfunding limitations. As a result, the EOs were put to the additional trouble\nof operating experiments from physically separated control panels. The implication for Spacelab is that groups of experiments that will be operated by a\nsingle payload specialist must be coordinated early in the design process.\nFurther, this requirement poses an additional burden on the mission manageinent\nas noted earlier.\nPayload specialists can make significant contributions to experiment\ndesign, particularly in the area of equipment operation, if they\nbecome involved sufficiently early in the design process.\nwere\nIiOs believed that there\nmany human-engineering aspects of equipment\ndesign that they could have favorably influenced had they been involved in the\nexperiment during the formative stages of hardware design, Even as late as\nthe experiment-aircraft integration stage, the EOs were making suggestions for\nhardware and operation changes, many of which were implemented.\nThe probability of experiment success 011 a Spacelab mission should\nbe demonstrated and confirmed well before payload integration\nbegins. A reasonable level of risk should be accepted, but this\ncannot be defined if an experiment has not been proven operable in\nthe flight configuration. In any case, the Mission Manager should\nhave the option to deny flight approval\nOne U.S. experiment in the Joint Mission payload consisted of new equipment\nthat had not been sufficiently tested prior to installation because of schedule\nconflicts both internal and external to the Pi\'s staff and organizational support. There was an obvious time constraint that prevented the timely development of the associated electronics, and the necessary familiarization of the P1\nand his team with the operational characteristics of the equipment. Inadequate\nreview procedures failed to screen out this experiment and forced management to\ngamble on the outcome. Although much useful ASSESS information was gained, the\nscientific return was not satisfactory.\nAnother experiment consisted of a new instrument coupled to a telescope\nthat (because of late delivery) had not been properly checked for optical\nalignment and stability. Experiment integration and testing were limited by\ntime and funding. The complete electro-optic system was not assembled until\nthe installation period at Ames. Althcugh much was done to overcome the\nearlier deficiencies, the final result was reduced effectiveness of the experiment during the mission and a significant negative impact on an ass iated\nexperiment that time-shared optical equipment.\nElectromagnetic compatibility (EMC) engineering should be considered\na basic requirement throughout the Spacelab payload design process.\nThe frequencies used by radio transmitters aboard the aircraft are listed\nin the Experimenters\' Handbook so that these may be avoided. Two experiments\nnevertheless proved very susceptible to RF pickup when transmitters were operating. Such interference commonly enters experiments through high-impedance\ndetector circuits. PIs and EOs lost considerable time in attempting to diagnose\nand alleviate these situations. Significant data degradation resulted from such\n137\n\npickup. In another experiment, external magnetic fields caused some distortion\nof electron-beam images, but without serious loss of data.\nIn all three cases, the P1 was unaware of the potential for trouble in\nhis equipment, not because of un\'i1iarity with EMC procedures but because he\ndid not foresee a problem in the aircraft environment. This experience clearly\nsuggests the need for laboratory tests during development to simulate the 13M1\nconditions for Spacclab, especially when high-impedance circuits or electronic\nimaging devices are a necessary part of the experiment.\nthe\nDuring\nmission, EMI tests and measurements were made tinder the\ndirection of I3STEC personnel. P1 preparations for these tests undoubtedly\nreduced the influence of EMI on the experiments, while an-site measurements\nsuggested some corrective actions. Unfortunately, the effort was not begun\nas an integral part of experiment design, nor was it available to U.S.\nexperimenters before payload integration.\nAlthough the use of off-the-shelf equipment 15 encouraged, some\nminimal standard of performance should be established to avoid the\nlow relia1 ility that was noticed in some minor i.tems, such as strip\nchart recorders.\nStrip chart recorders, as a class of equipment, have consistently shown\nlow reliability in airborne operations. However, experimenters find them\nconvenient in examining trends in the data. Rather than discouraging their\nuse altogether, it would he better to ensur that the operation of an experiinent does not depend critically on a chart recorder. Alternately, much of the\ntrouble could be avoided by using other recording methods, as for example, a\nheated stylus.\nIn a more sweeping indictment of recorders in general, one flO observed\nthat each had a different procedure for loading, none of which could be done\nquickly and with complete assurance. Ile recommended that all Spacelab\nrecorders be equipped with standard cassettes - whether for film, tape, or\ncharts.\nAnother persistent cause of trouble was the loosening of electronic cards\nin their sockets by vibration during takeoff. The obvious remedy is to\nengineer better holddowns for such cards.\nTh implication for Spacelah is twofold: that minimum equipment performance standards should be adopted, and that all electronic equipment should be\ninspected by a specialist in (for example) airborne electronics who can suggest\nimprovements in the equipment that will reduce the likelihood of problems.\n\n138\n\nWith no limitation imposed on power, volume, and weight, the demands\nof available equipment can be quite high. For example, on the ASSESS\nflights the values of these quantities were as follows:\nVolume: 10 m 3 , total payload\nWeight: 1700 kg, total payload\nPower:\t\n\n3 W/kg\n\nAlthough these values could be reduced by state-of-the-art advances,\noff-the-shelf equipment used on Spacelah may still require modification to satisfy \'payload constraints.\nA significant difference between the CV-990 as a laboratory and Spacelah\nwill be the basic electric power available. Adequate 60-Hz power was available\non the aircraft. On Spacelab, the basic power supply will be 28 Vdc. The\nconversion of that basic power to 60-Hz power, only to have it re-rectified to\ndc for use within the equipment, will be wasteful of both power and total stored\nenergy, and could become criti 1. Thus, it seems clear that as much equipment\nas possible should be modified rom its off-the-shelf configuration to permit\ndirect utilization of the 28-Vuc power.\nMinor (hut time-consuming) activities, such as switching, should be\nautomated to permit full concentration on the real experiment operation. All experiments should include displays that indicate proper\n\'peration.\nFixed sequential operations in experiments could be automated for the\nbenefit of the payload specialist. Timers or other sequential txpes of switches\ncan readily he tied to go-no-go indicators 50 that the operator iay be made\naware if some step fails to operate properly. Since the design of such switching circuits is a specialized branch of electrical technology, it would be\nreasonable for the management staff to aid experimenters with this portion of\ntheir equipment.\nCryogenic support for experiments should be included in any general provisioning support system developed for Spacelab. On ASSESS,\nsignificant problems were encountered with experiment-provided\ncryogenic equipment.\nFour experiments required cryogenic support in the form of 70 liters of\nLife, 850 liters of LN 2 , 6 kg ice, and 6 m 3 (standard) of helium gas during the\n5-day simulation. 450 liters of the LN 2 was used to supply a continuous drygas purge to one experiment.\nFour significant problem-, with experiments and one with GPE occurred during\nthe entire mission. During the checkout flight period, two dewars were damaged\nby ice plugs and replaced with backup units, while the GFE LN 2 evaporator was\nflushed to remove trace-oil contamination. Malfunctioning equipment that caused\nthe other two problems was repaired by EOs with verbal support from Hs, a\nleaking Life evaporator that caused a partial ice blockage in one experiment,\nand a broken dewar insert that served as a helium-surge baffle in another.\n\n139\n\nSubsystems\nFour minicomputers were provided as part of the experiment equipment,\ndespite the availability of the ADDAS on the CV-990. The tendency of\nexperimenters to provide their own minicomputers suggests that the\nneed for CDMS for basic recording and computation may not be as great\nas originally anticipated. In addition, the Spacelab MIS capahilities for interfacing with minicomputers should be investigated further.\nAt the same time, however, the use of AN)AS emphasized the very real\nneed for centralized - handling of housekeeping data. \t\n____\nIn general, experiments that included their own primary signal processing\nand recording faired better than those that relied on central recording. Selfreliant systems were system tested before installation in the aircraft and lastwere\nminute interfaces\navoided. Problems were avoided in noise, signal strength,\nand computer programming. On the other hand, there were a number of operational\nproblems with dedicated minicomputers that resulted in some loss of data, and\nwere not amenable to solution by the EOs except in consultation with PIs. It\nshould he noted, however, that the local operations performed by these units\nunder the guidance of the EOs would have been very difficult if not impossible\nto do on the ADDAS in t. real-time frame.\nThis application of distributed data processing is only one example of a\ncurrent trend in computer development in which the use of yet smaller units,\nmicrocomputers or microprocessors, can further reduce software complexity at\nthe minicomputer level. Such a dual approach could greatly reduce the software\nrequirements of the Spacelab CI)MS, and at the sLme time allow the EO to respond\nto changing situations or unexpected events that influence the individual\nexperiment.\nIntegration of experiments with the CV-990 data management system and\nits associated software presented problems on ASSESS. This area can\nbe expected to be problematic with Spacelab as well, and w\'ll require\nspecial and timely attentior1.\nTaken together, the great variety of experimenter demands on a centralized\ncomputation facility may exceed the capability of the system. Clearly, the\ndesign of software for such a facility will be very difficult and time consuming.\nBoth limitations were experienced in the Joint Mission. An even more basic\nconcern was expressed by several experimenters - that the use of a common computer might cause undesirable interexperiment interference. Optical coupling\ntechniques for digital signals now becoming available should eliminate such\nproblems.\nExperiment/data system integration problems were partly due to the fact\nthat the AI)DAS was relatively new and not completely debugged in all possible\noperating modes. Also, the detailed requirements of the various cxp.rimcnts\nwere not presented sufficiently far in advance, and kept changing. For these\nreasons, personnel assigned to computer operations had very limited time in\nwhich to make the necessary changes in software, and no opportunity to augment\nhardware in one or two areas where present capabilities are 1imite. On\n140\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2.UCil1iITY OF IL\ncAL PAGE IS Pthh\n\nSpacelab, a very significant investment in time and adequately trained computer\npersonnel will he necessary to make the most efficient use of the CDMS\ninstallation.\n\nGround .-based processing of scientific data contributes significantly\nto the successful proxy operation of experiments when large amounts\nof data have to be evaluated.\nThe CDMS on Spacelab will have a substantial computational capability,\nbut for reasons iscussed should not he the primary processor. Large amounts\nof processing - calculation of Fourier transforms, for example - will require\ntelemetering and ground computation. In the general case, therefore, the CDMS\nmight better be used for data compacting to reduce transmission rates, with\nperhaps simplified processing of a few samples. This latter function was successfully performed in flight during the Joint Mission to guide the operator\'s\ncontrol of his experiment in real time. With proxy operations, however, the\nbest judge of data quality and research progress (the P1) is on the ground.\nWithout questions the computation and availability of data to the P1 at the\nground computer center will enhance the feedback of relevant information and\ninstructions to the operator in Spacelab.\nDuring tracking and pointing operations a dedicated keyboard and\ndisplay is required. It is questionable whether time sharing of a\nsingle keyboard and display by several users can provide\nsatisfactory results.\t\n-\t\n--\t\nDuring the Joint Mission, three experiments each utilized a keyboard and\ndisplay essentially full time. It was obvious that the same equipment was not\navailable for time sharing by another experiment. For Spacelab, utilization of\nsuch equipment must be carefully timelined in advance, and in consultation with\nthe Pis and payload specialists, to determine if any time sharing of such\nequipment is possihle.\nA downlink TV capability will be important for occasional repair\ntasks, but probably will not be required frequently for normal\nSpacelab experiment operation.\n\nThe downlink TV was sparingly used during the Joint Mission during periods\nwhen the aircraft was on the ground. r0s and PIs agreed that it was a valuable\nadjunct to repair work. (See also references 9 and 10 on the fourth Lear Jet\nASSESS mission.) However, none could see that its use would materially aid\nnormal experiment operation in real time; rather, it could be a significant\ndistraction in a very busy P0 work schedule.\nNominal experiment operations should not require real-time communications with ground-based PIs. Principal investigator/payload\nspecialist con\xc2\xb1cr\'3nces, howrver, should be scheduled on a regular\nbasis.\nThe EOs found that they could operate experiments satisfactorily without\nany real-time communication with the Pis. Tri fact, most FOs felt that outside\nconrnunications of any kind during experiment operations would he a handicap to\n141\n\noperation of he experiments. However, the immediate postflight debriefings\nand subsequent communications with the Pis on a scheduled basis to fit the\nworkload proved beneficial to both the EOs and the PIs Spacelah communication\nbetween payload specialists and PIs should be scheduled during nonoperating\nperiods.\nExperiment setup times and procedures can represent a major part of\nexp eriment operation and must be considered in developing the\nmission timelines.\nAlthough notable success was achieved in reducing manpower loading, none\nof the experiments on the .Joint Mission had been refined to the paint of being\neasy for an EO to use. Each experiment was provided with a large number of\ncontrols and ad j ustments. Thus, experiment operation, particularly startup\noperations, required an inordinate amount of attention from the EOs. Mission\ntimelines were affected by the inability of the EO to operate all the necessary\ncontrols on several experiments simultaneously. All recommended an increased\namount of automation for basic control operations.\nPayload specialists should normally not be responsible for subsystem\noperation and maintenance, but should concentrate fully on payload\noperation.\nExperience on the Joint Mission showed that EOs had little or no time\nduring experiment operation to attend to subsystems. Furthermore, any time\nspent training in these tasks would have detracted from LO preparations for\ntheir assigned research duties.\nVehicle subsystems that support experiment operation -. for example, CDMS\nor cryogenics resources\t\nare not the province of the payload specialist, and\nany effort in this direction will detract from his primary assignment. The\noperation and maintenance of these systems should be handled by the Mission\nSpecialist who has been trained in their use, and his backup should be one of\nthe orbiter crew. A high level of automation will be required of these subsystems to minimize routine tasks and free the Mission Specialist for\ncreative interaction and direct support (as required) of the research team.\n\nflD Selection and Training\nSelection and training of payload specialists for Spacelab missions\nwill be critical elements in the overall success of the mission.\nFrom the unique 13O/PI relationship evaluated during the Joint ASSESS\nMission, it is apparent that the Spacelah payload crew should comprise specialists who can interpret the data and can develop an\nintuitive feeling for the measurements. They should understand the\nexperiment and its objectives and should have sufficiently detailed\nknowledge of electromechanical aspects of experiment hardware to\npermit troubleshooting and correction as warranted.\n\n142\n\nThe Ws on the Joint Mission were all trained scientists in fields at\nleast closely related to those represented by the experiments they operated.\nRe E0s felt that their scientific knowledge of the experiments eliminated\nthe need for much background indoctrination.\nThe EUs also felt that they needed to be trained experimenters to dce1o1\na feel for the experiments and their indicated results, and to minimize the\ntraining required for the mission. They also noted that flOs must be quite\nknowledgeable about the electromechanical aspects of the experiment - that is\nthey should not only know how to operate it but should understand its operation\nthoroughly. Only then could they he expected to perform any unusual maintenance and troubleshooting. All agreed that there is it bit of mystique in the\nability to handle electronic equipment, particularly to service it ufficint1y.\nAll of the LOs were capable of operating electronic equipment to this requirement and one had outstanding skill in troubleshooting.\nPayload specialist participation in experiment development, integration, and payload checkout phases is highly desirable. Therefore,\npayload specialists should he selected and start their training\nearly enough to enable them to participate during these phases. \t\nThe development of a scientific experiment for proxy operation should\nthe experimenter and the operator in all its phase for best\nresults. In the Joint Mission, FO input was delayed in some cases until final\nassembly or CVOfl later. As a rsu1t, the P1 almost always and quite naturally\ngave first priority to science-related tasks, and paid little attention t\nlayout of controls, displays, and procedures for efficient operation. T\nbe combined into one\nwas particularly true where several experiments were to\noperational group. To avoid this situation in Spacelab, the liOs strongly\nrecommended that payload specialists become involved sufficiently early in the\nexperiment design to provide meaningful input to the development and\ncoordination of control hardware and operations plans.\n\ninvolve both\n\nSimilarly, the IOs found that the payload integration and checkout phases\nwere a necessary part of their training in the operation of the experiment.\nThey recommended that Spacelab payload specialists have the same opportunity\nto participate in payload checkout as a part of their training.\nThe flOs also made numerous suggestions regarding the design and operation\nof the experiments during the final integration and operational phases of the\nmission. As late as they were, many of these suggetions were still adopted\nby the PIs. The EOs felt they could have made even more improvements had they\nbeen involved at an earlier stage of the experiment development.\nPayload specialist training should he well planned and organized as\nan integral part of the total mission, and should include substantial training at payload level for which adequate equipment is\nrequired to fully exercise the man-machine interface. -\n\n145\n\nAdequate time was scheduled for FO training during the Joint ASSESS\nMission. Unfortunately, the time was not used as effectively as planned,\nlargely because experiments were not completed in time for integrated training.\nflOs made visits to experimenters\' home locations, but seldom did they have an\nopportunity to operate anything like a complete experiment. Thus, the final\nstages of training after payload integration assumed more importance than\noriginally planned. The integrated mission simulation period (as short as it\nwas) was perhaps the most valuable of all training experiences, since for the\nfirst time the operator was exposed to near-real constraints. In fact, a\nstrong recommendation was made by the EOs that more time he allotted to this\nfull-simulation training, both in future ASSESS missions and in Spacelah.\nLimited presimulation flights of the ASSESS flOs and payload were an\nextremely important factor in their training, adjustment to environment, and overcoming latent snags. This experience suggests that\nSpacelah payload specialists will benefit from aircraft flights with\ntheir equipment or some equivalent form of integrated mission\nsimulation.\nEarly flights proved unsettling to EOs who had not flown with experiments\nbefore or had had little flight experience. Environmental factors such as\ndarkness, noise, head sets, close quarters, and aircraft motion were distracting. On later flights, these EOs became seasoned veterans who were able to\nperform well despite such distractions.\nThe development of a payload specialist/Pr team relationship is\nessential to successful experiment proxy operation.\nThe EUs and I l ls on the Joint ASSESS Mission developed excellent working\nrelationships based upon mutual understanding and trust. Hardly less important\nwore the team relationships developed among the Mission Manager, the EOs, and\nthe Il ls. These working relationships developed naturally out of months of\nworking together toward a cornlrnln goal. Continuity of relationships will he\nsimilarly beneficial in Space1b.\nMission simulations should include practice in payload\ncommunication under realistic conditions.\nEffective verbal communication was an acquired skill requiring a definite\nlearning period. Data records alone did not provide sufficient information, and\nthe Prs expected to use IiO commentary during experiment operation to aid assessment of research progrLss and equipment malfunctions. Thus, FO comments were\ntyped into the A!)UAS record in real time durin7 flight, and hard copies were\nmade available to the P15 at the flight debriefing meeting. However, this mode\nof communication its ncvcr effectively developed; liOs were not trained to\nutilize the inteicom for this purpose and so did not find time in their busy\nschedule to make an adequate record.\nWhen problems were being worked out on the ground between sirnulation flights,\nit was several days before FOs could communicate accurately and effectively with\nIl ls - a further demonstration of the need to develop skill in verbal documentation of payload specialist activities in Spacelah.\n144\n\nAmarked improvement in LO performrincc\nperiod advanced, implying that training\n\nwas notod as thesinmlation\nand extended flight duration\nare important aspects of Spaeelah operation. In audition, at least\none payload crewman should be well trained in maintaining facility\nequipment.\nFollowinp the simulation period, the EOs indicated tlutt they were still\nimproving their performance, especially an their secondary experiments. All.\nagreed that a longer period for a SpacelaF\' mission would be dsirab1e to assure\npeak performance from payload specialists. One LO even remarked that the\ncurrently planned 7-day mission for Spaeelab would he a "disaster."\nAs noted previously, payload specialists should not have operatiu\nmaintenance responsibility for hasic facility equipment. However, the EOs felt\nthat in case of trouble with such equipment, one operator should he knowledgeable about facility equipment and should he able to carry out simple troubleshooting and repair on an emergency basis, as backup to the Mission Specialist.\nUnder such circumstances, he could work in communication with cognizant ground\npersons.\n\nCONSIDERATIONS FOR TUT FUTURE\n\nThe planning group for any futurc? Spacolab simulation mission should\nconsider the results of this first Joint Mission in developing mission guidelines. The new guidelines should probably include somewhat more formal management techniques and a longer period of integrated payload training for JOs.\nConsiorab1e thought should be given to the simplification of experiment operation for the benefit of the LOs. The planning group might also consider other\nmeans of improving the realism of the simulation within the limits permitted by\nthe aircraft to he used.\nIt should be noted that guidelines for this mission were selected before\nthe capabilities of Spacelah and its resources were finalized. Consequently,\nsome of the basic simulation objectives and guidelines may have to he modified\nto reflect current Spacelab thinking, in planning for any future ASSESS\nmissions.\n\n145\n\n1.\n\nMulholland, 1).
