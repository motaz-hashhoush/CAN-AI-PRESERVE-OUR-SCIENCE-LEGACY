Although this frequency band is allocated to passive measurements only, RFI (Radio-Frequency Interference) is present in the data of all three missions. On a global scale, the three sensors have observed approximately the same distribution of RFI. Japan is an important exception that has implications for the design of RFI detection algorithms. RFI in Japan is caused by a large number of emitters belonging to the same system (TV receivers) and for this reason some traditional RFI detection strategies detect little to no RFI over Japan. The study of this case has led to an improvement of the approach to detect RFI in Aquarius data.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20170003109, "endDate": "2016-10-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "National Radio Astronomy Observatory", "location": "Charlottesville, VA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "75c9b49d0c9e4c16aba2f1695fe2de31", "id": "c715544eb3474dc1abea709ca995b081"}], "name": "2016 Radio Frequency Interference (RFI)", "location": "Socorro, NM", "id": "75c9b49d0c9e4c16aba2f1695fe2de31", "startDate": "2016-10-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20170003109, "id": "f9213d3088d84c7d9efb0189d33c1036", "publicationDate": "2016-10-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20170003109.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20170003109/downloads/20170003109.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20170003109/downloads/20170003109.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20170003109/downloads/20170003109.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
