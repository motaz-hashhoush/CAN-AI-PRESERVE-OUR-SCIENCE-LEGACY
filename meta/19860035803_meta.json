First, a root condition which implies stability for the initial-boundary value problem for this type of interface is derived. From the root condition, the stability of several interface equations is proved, using the maximum principle. In some cases, the final verification steps can be done analytically; in other cases, a simple computer program has been written to check the condition for values of a parameter along the boundary of the unit circle. Using this method, stability for Lax-Wendroff with all the interface conditions considered, and for Leapfrog with interpolation interface conditions when the fine and coarse grids overlap is proved.", "title": "Stability of interfaces with mesh refinement", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T19:17:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19860035803, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Berger, M.
