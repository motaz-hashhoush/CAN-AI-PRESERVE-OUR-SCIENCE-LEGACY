The boiling point of helium is the lowest of all the elements.\nHelium can therefore exist as a gas in temperature\nand pressure equilibrium with any cryogenic fluid\n(e.g., liquid hydrogen, oxygen, or nitrogen); hence its\nuse as a pressurizing agent for cryogenic rocket propellants. Helium could likewise be used to maintain\npressure in liquid methane fuel tanks.\nMany of the purposes for which NASA uses helium\nare the same as those of industry: welding, atmosphere\ncontrol, leak detection, and refrigeration. A 6-foot\ndiameter by 10-foot tall space chamber is cooled by\nhelium to simultaneously produce a temperature of\n4.2\xc2\xb0K and a vacuum of less than 10- 13.torr.\nHelium provides the lowest possible liquid-bath\ntemperature. It is used to cool other materials to low\ntemperature ranges where unusual phenomena occur.\nIt is also used this way to produce superconductivity\xe2\x80\x94\nthe state of zero electrical resistance\xe2\x80\x94in certain\n\nmaterials, and to maintain superconductivity in devices such as superconducting magnets. Helium itself\nexhibits very unusual properties at temperatures below\n2.l7\xc2\xb0K, including: virtually zero viscosity, extraordinary thermal conductivity, the ability to flow up and\nover container walls, and a peculiar heat-seeking effect. These superfluid effects are already used in superconducting magnets and may become important in\nvery low temperature refrigeration applications.\n\nNote:\nRequests for further information may be directed\nto:\nTechnology Utilization Officer\nLewis Research Center\n21000 Brookpark Road\nCleveland, Ohio 44135\nReference: TSP70- 10673\n\nPatent status:\nNo patent action is contemplated by NASA.\nSource: G.
