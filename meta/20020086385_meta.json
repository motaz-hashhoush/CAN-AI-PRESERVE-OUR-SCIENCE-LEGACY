The technology was adapted to a LAN system by Wilton Industries, one of the participants. Because the system is cable-free, installation charges are saved, and it can be used where cable is impractical. Resultant products include the IRplex 6000. Transceivers can be located anywhere and can include mobile receivers. The system provides wireless LAN coverage up to 44,000 square feet. applications include stock exchange communications, trade shows, emergency communications, etc.", "title": "Wireless Communications", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-20T23:27:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020086385, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020086385, "isbn": "0-16-035821-3", "id": "02dc6092cde7473d95df7b57a07685fd", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1991", "publicationDate": "1991-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020086385.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020086385/downloads/20020086385.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020086385/downloads/20020086385.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020086385/downloads/20020086385.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
