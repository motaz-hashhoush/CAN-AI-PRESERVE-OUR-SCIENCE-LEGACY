b"June 1964\n\n\t\n\nBrief 64-10145\n\nNASA TECH BRIEF\nThis NASA Tech Brief is issued by the Technology Utilization Division to acquaint industry\nwith the technical content of an innovation derived from the NASA space program.\n\nFlexible Fastener Allows Thermal Expansion\n\np Surfaces\n\nViount\n\nThe problem: Provide flexible yet secure attachment of wind-tunnel research model skin sections.\nThermal expansion of skin sections rigidly fastened\nto supporting structures produces stress concentrations which often cause the skin to rupture or buckle.\n\nThe solution: A flexible fastener that employs a\nmodified ball-joint contact between the fastener and a\nskin section.\n\nHow it's done: The contact surfaces between the\nfastener head and skin section are mated to form a\nmodified ball-joint. This allows the skin section to\n\nmove laterally without creating the large bending\nmoments which would occur if the mating surfaces\nwere flat. The threaded end of the fastener shank is\nsecured to a spring-held nut housed in a rigid mount.\nA rectangular protrusion from the nut into a fixed\nslot prevents rotation during installation; however, it\ndoes not prevent wobble or vertical movement after\ninstallation.\n\nNotes:\n1. Although this fastener was designed to relieve\nthermally induced stresses, it may be used to\n(continued overleal)\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National\nAeronautics and Space Administration.
