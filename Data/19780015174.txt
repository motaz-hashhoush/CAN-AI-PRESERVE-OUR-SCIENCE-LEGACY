Spa~p.lab is being developed and constructed in Europe under direction of the European Space Agency (ESA). The Space Shuttle Orbiter is being\nbuilt by the United States und.er management of the National Aeronautics and\nSpace Administration (NASA). Spacelab is designed to be a versatile laboratory\ncapable of accommodating a variety of experiments. The pressurized Spacelab\nmodule provides a shirtsleeve environment in which up to four Payload Specialists can operate experiments using basic resources provided by the laboratory.\nNASA, Ames Research Center (ARC) has developed over many years a very\nefficient system for accommodation and operation of a wide range of experiments for airborne research using a variety of aircraft. The ARC approach,\nwhich is characte.rbed by deep involvement of the individual Principal\nInvestigators in development and operation of the scientific payload, has\nbeen very attractive to experimenters and is enthusiastically supported by\nthe scientific community. It has similarities to the approach considered for\nSpacelab. Many Spacelab planners have felt that, with emergence of the \\\\\nSpac.elab program, it is time to consider simpler and less costly techniquE:\\s\nfor manned space endeavors, and that the ARC approach in managing a payload\nis a desirable basis for development of payload operational concepts aboard\nthe Shuttle/Spacelab. Thus, NASA management initiated the ASSESS Program in\n1972 to evaluate and document management and operational practices developed\nand employed by the ARC Airborne Science Office (now the Nedium Altitude\nMissions Branch) as these practices might apply to Spacelab (refs. 1-5).\nTo test the validity of the ARC approach to Spacelab, several missions\nsimulating \xc2\xb7aspects of Spacelab operations have been conducted as part of the\nASSESS Program.. From 1972 to ~975 six Spacelab simulation missions were\nflowrt. Four relatively simpl~s!l)luflations were conducted aboard the Lear Jet.\naircraft (refs. 6-10) and two nXf\xc2\xb7fe/complex aboard the CV-990 "Galileo 11"\n(refs. 11-16). Each mission was designed to evaluate potential Shuttle/Spacelab\nconcepts in increasing detail. The first four missions studied the operation\nof th~ payload by members of the Principal Investigator team associated with each\nexperiment. The last two missions, one on each aircraft, explored experiment\noperation by a limited number of carefully selected experiment operators\n(Payload Specialis~s). These missions were managed at ARC. The second of\nthese missions, using the CV-990 (fig. 1), in June 1975 was conducted jOintly\nwith the European Space Agency. It was the first extensive Spacelab simulation,\nand has become known as ASSESS I. The success of that mission (refs. 12-16)\nled to a second such mission (ASSESS II) with flights in May 1977, which is\nthe subject of this report. For this second joint mission, emphasis was\nplaced on development and exercise of management techniques planned for Spacelab\nusing management participants from NASA and ESA who have responsibilities for\nSpacelab 1 which will be launched in 1980.\n\n2\n\nASSESS II BACKGROUND AND ORGANIZATION\n\'-:-,\n\n2.1\n\nProject Background\n\nInitial approval to conduct ASSESS II as a jOint mission sponsored by\nNASA Office of Applications (OA) and Office of SpaceFlight (OSF) and by ESA\ncame in late 1975. Final approval was obtained in March 1976 and "launch"\noccurred 14 months later on May 16, 1977.\nBoth NASA and ESA set ~~\\management organizations according to Spacelab\nplans to test and evaluate :i:"llterface activities,. NASA/MSFC was assigned\nresponsibility for the payload and appointed a Mission Manager. NASA/KSC was\ngiven responsibility for Launch Site Payload Processing, NASA/JSC was assigned\nFlight Operations, while ESA/SPICE handled all activities in Europe. All\norganizations worked closely with NASA/ARC where the integration and flight\nprOGram were conducted using the CV-990 Ai13borne Laboratory.\nc\n\n0\n\nOperational costs of the mission were shared between NASA and ESA.\nExperiments from the U.S. were totally funded by NASA. In Europe, basic\nexperiment costs were nationally funded, with ESA providing additional funds\nnecessary for the special requirements of the ASSESS mission.\nThe project studied the full range of Spacelab-type activities including\nthe following items of special interest:\nManagement interactions;\nExperiment selection;\nHardware development, including design for centralized controls;\nPayload integration and checkout:\nMission Specialist (M/S) and Payload Specialist (pIS) selection and\ntraining;\nMission Control Center/PayloadcOperations Control Center reactions\nto ground and flight problems;\nReal-time interaction during flight between Principal Investigators\n(PIs) and the flight crew (MIS and PiSs):\nRetrieval of scientific data and analysis;\nDocumentation.\n\nh\nMission Obj ec1 ves\n\n2.2\n\n}J\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTo maximize the utility of the ASSESS II Program for Spacelab, the following objectives were established:\na)\n\nScience related\nEvaluate experiment selection procedures;\nscience data.\n\nMaximi~e\n\n(J\n\nb)\n\nManagement\nStudy proposed NASA and ESA/SPICE Spacelab payload management\nconcepts and interface relationshi~s;\nEvaluate Mission Manager, Mission Specialist, {nd Payload\nSpecialist roles in mission planning and implementation;\nEvaluate participation of PIs in mission planning and implementation;\nEvaluate utili~~tion of an Investigators\' Working Group (IWG) in\nmission planning ~nd implementation.\n\nc)\n\nAnalytical Integration and Mission Planning\n! \xe2\x80\xa2.. ,.1\n\nEvaluate the methods and effectiveness of performing analytical\nsystem engineering, mission flight definition, and payload\ninterface identification and control.\nd)\n\nPayload Specialist Selection and Training\nEvaluate methodology of Payload Specialist selection and\ntraining; ,\nDetermine practicability of using a PI as a Payload Specialist.\n\ne)\n\nMission Specialist Selection and Training\nEvaluate methodology for selection and assignment of a Mission\nSpecialist;\nEvaluate the }tission Specialist responsiblities relative to the\nSTS systems and the payload.\n\nf)\n\nGround Operations\nUnderstand and gain an appreciation of integration activities\npertinent to Spacelab payloads;\nIdentify ground operation~/)and testing requirements for efficient\nexperiment integration and checkout;\nEvaluate Mission Specialist, Payload Specialist, and PI involvement in experiment ground operations.\n\ng)\n\nMission Planning and Flight Operations\nAssess methods and degree of real-time experiment/mission\nplanning for Spacel~b missions;\nEvaluate concept of proxy operation and maintenance of experiments\nby pISs during flight opurationsj\nEvaluate poce concept and operating procedures.\n\nh)\n\nOocumentation\nDevelop and evaluate minimum cost documentation approach consistent\nwith Spacelab payload requirements.\n\n{\',~\n\n~\\..\\\n\n2.3\n~\\\n\nProject Guidelines\n\no\n\nTo fulfill the objectives of ASSESS II, the following guidelines were\ndev\'elope.d:\n\n\'-\n\n-\n\nr;,\n\n.-:;:\n\nr;\n\nNa.",inlUm Spacelab reality withintunding limi~ and the limitations\nillherent with aircraft operation;\nTen-day mission with payload crew confined to the aircraft and contiguous\n. living quarters (see fig- 2) with one aircraft flight planned for\neach 24-hour period; the total of the aircraft flights and confined\nperiods between flights to rc::present a si1181e Spacelab missiOn;\n/)\nPayload creW to consist of two European Payload Specialists to operate\nthe E\\.tropea.n ~pel:\'ilr\\ents. t",\'O u.s.

His office was to be the single point of contact between experimenters and the project. Initially, the manager of Spacelab 2 from the Spacelab\n~fSFC was assigned to mal\'lage ASSESS II. An Assistant\nPayload Prpject Office\n~Ussion Manager, who had participated in earlier ASSESS missions, was also\nappointed from the Spacelab Payload Project Office. About four months before\nflight (January 1977), the ASSESS II mission management responsibility was\ntransferred to an ind;ividual at 1\'1SFC who had been assigm,ed to handle all OA\nSpacelab projects. it SPICE, ESA elected to have the ~Ame individual serve as\nboth the Program Manager and the }fission Manager. He was aided by a deputy\nfrom ESTEC who functioned as Payload Manager and worked closely "with the\nEuropean experimenters throughout experiment de\'\\~elopment, integration, and\nflight operations,\n"\n\nat\n\n"\n\n\'\\\n\n2.4.4\n\nMission Scientists and Investigators\'\n\nt~orkil\'lg\n\nGroup\n\nMSFC appointed the Chief of the Solar Science Branch, Space Sciences\nLaborato:ry as the Mission Scientist and the Chief of the Optical Physics\nBranch of the same laboratory as his assistant. The Assistant l1fission Scientist\nhad served in the same capacity on ASSESS lit ESA appointed a staff astronomer\nfrom ESTEC, who had served as a Payload Spetialist on ASSESS I, as their\nMiSSion Scientist, but did not appoint an assistant.\nAn Investigators\' Workiug Group (ll~G) was establ.ished early in the ASSESS\nII Project, and was made up of a PI from each experiment. The mission Scientist\nfrom MSFC chaired the IWG with the ESA Mission Scientist as cochairman. Functions\nof the IWG were to provide a forum for PI discussion and to make recolnrnendations\nconcerning science plans and prio:rities for the mission. NASA and ESA IWG members\nprovided recommendations to their respective managements for Payload Specialist\nselection.\n\n2.4.5\n\nMission Specialist\n\nThe ASSESS II mission was the first trial by NASA to identify and assign\na Mission Specialist (H/S) to serve in a Spacelab-type activity. After\nsubstantial difficulty, a role was established and agreed to as follows:\n\n8\n\nTo act as the inflight alter ego of the ~fission Manager and to be\ngenerally responsible for coordination and conduct of combined\npayload operations during flight;\nTo be the single interface between the Payload Specialists and STS\nflight cre\\.;\' (pilot/copilot);\nTo be responsible for all aircraft experiment-support systems such\nas power distribution, central data system, etc;\nUpon approval of the NASA Program Nanager, to be trained to act as\nPayload Specialist and oper.ate e;Kperiments during the flight mission;\nTo work with the POCG, NeC, Payload Specialists, and Flight Commander\n(pilot) to solve inflight problems caused by equj.pment failures\nand/or flight conditions leading to changes of science priorities.\nA scientist/astronaut from JSC was assigned to serve as H/S. Although\nhe reported administratively to JSC, \'he w\'as assigned to report directly to the\nNission "Hanager at NSFC in accomplishment of the above assi.gned responsibilities\nfor ASSESS II. The M/ S,WBS an as tronomer \\"ho had previously served as a\nPayload Specialist during an earlier ASSESS Spacelab simulation (ref. 9, 10).\nA second scientist/astr\'p!\'~Pu.t from JSC was appointed as a backup. He also was \'/\nan astronomer and had served\' as PiS on the ASSESS I mission (ref. 12-16).\n2.4.6\n\nPayload Specialists\n\nSince the payload was about evenly divided between NASA and ESA, it wa~\nagreed that the fr~ght crew would consist of four Payload Specialists (p/Ss),\ntwo fronl the U.S. and two from Europe, and that the ESA piSs would be responsible\nfor the European experiments while the NASA piSs would handle the U.S. experiments. Thus, with only minor exceptions, there would be no cross-training\nresponsibility. This segregated arrangenlent was chosen mainly to save travel\ncosts for training and reduce individual commitments.\nIn the U.S. two piSs \\.,ere selected from JPL. One was a radar technician and\nthe other was a physicist who was also the PI for one of the payload experiments.\nNo PI proposed candidates were selected for backup. Instead, also to reduce costs,\nthe Assistant r-assion Nanager from NSFC, an aeronautical engineer, was assigned\na second role to serve as the single backup pis for the U.S.\nIn Europe, ESA selected fOllr PiSs, illitially plann:i.ng to identify two\nas prime piSs and two as backup. The four piSs were: a graduate student in\nphysics from the University of Southampton, England; a staff astronomer from\nESTEC Nho was formerly an airline pilot; an electrical engineer from DFVLR;\nand a physicist from DFVLRo The plan of selecting t\\.,o as prime piSs and two\nas backup was altered somewhat be.fore the mission actually got underway at\nARC. (The final nrrangement is discussed under Mission Implementation.)\nPayload Specialist responsibility was to serve as the direct representative of the PI in opet\'ating the experilllentf~ during "Spacelab" flight with the\ngoal of obtaining the best data possible. Thus, the pISs trained extensively\nfor their assignments. During the "Spacelab" flight they operated their\nrespective experiments to obtain high quality data according to plans determined\nbefore each data-take period. When necessary, they adjusted and repaired\nexperiment rn.\'1lfunc tions, using skills developed during tlHdr training periods,\nand communicated directly with the PIs via the roce during the flight mission.\n\n9\n\n3.\n\n}fISSION IMPLlmENTAl\'ION\n\nThis settion details the events during implementation of the ASSESS II\nprpject, and provides support for conclusjolls given in Section i.. 5ignific(lnt events during implementation of the project are shown on the ove\'rall\nschedule, figure 4.\n3.1\n3.1 \xe2\x80\xa2. 1\n\nFlight Payload\nExperiment Selection and Funding\n\nIn NASA, the Office of Applications (OA) decided to select experiments\nfor ASSESS n from ongoing e)(;periment programs. with emphasis on experiment\nprototypes destined for Spacelab that had previously flown on the CV-990.\n\'fhifilvas done particularly to save costs of instrument development, but also\nto takE~ advantage of the ASSESS progrllnl to further d.evelop experiments\nfor approved applications programs. This eliminated the use of an Announcement of OpportUnity. The OA Discipline Offices (see figure 3) were called\nupon to propose experiments. Final selection turned out to be a difficult and\ntime consuming process. \'rhe OA ASSESS II Program Nanager finally achieved a\nfull baseline experiment selecUon about three months (June 1976) after official approval of the project, but funding was extremely tight and it was\nrecognized that one or two experiments might have to be dropped. The baselined experimenters began .work in earnest to modHy ..:.heir experiments for the\nASSSSS II "Spacelab" payload, but interactions within OA continued to delay\nfull solidification of the NASA payload. Some e)(;perimenters slowed their\nefforts due to unresolved funding problems, and it was not until December\n1976 that funds were finally d:f,stributed, almo.st nine months after NASA Headquarters project approval, and only five months before launch.\nApproval and funding for the experiment from GSFC was still being held\nup after eleven Dlonths (until February 1977) for lack of an interagency\ndecision regarding the data to be obtained. By that time all levels of management, as well as the PI, agreed that the exper:f.ment had to be dropped unless\nimmediate approval was obtained. A decision was finally made to go ahead,\nbut, as a result of the inordinately late decision, that experiment was in a\ncrash mode of activity lintil the flight period.\nIn Europe, I~SA issued an Annollncement of Opportunity in December 1975\nfollowing preliminary project approval. The proposals were screened by the\nERA science departments and reviewed by a special board. Final payload\nselection was announced by ESA in Al\'ril 1976, one month following final ASSESS\nproject go-ahead. Funding of the European experiments was handled on a\nnational basis with l~SA ptov:i.ding additional funds over and above the hi\'sic\nexperiment costs to support activit:i,es peculiar to the ASSESS II Spacelab\nsimulation.\n\n10\n\n,\n\n1976\n\n1977\n\nJ F M A M J J A S 0 N D\nPROJECT APPROVAL NASA HQ\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nESA PARTICIPATION APPROVED\nNASA BASELINE EXPERIMENT\nSELECTION\nESA EXPERIMENT SELECTION\n\nIFIRST IRD MEETINGS\n\nI\n\nj~\n\nI\n\nI\nr\n\nt ESA\nNASA\nMISSION SPECIALIST SELECTION\n\nl\n\nf\n\nk\n\nAPR\n\nMAR\n\nMAY\n\nI\n\nFIRST ANALYTICAL INTEGRATION\nSECOND IRD MEETINGS\n\nI SECOND ANALYTICAL\n~\n, INTEGRATION\ni PAYLOAD SPECIALIST SELECTION\n\nFEB\n\n1\n\n,\n\nI\n\nJAN\n\nI\n\n. .-\n\n,\n\n.\n\nfi\n\n\\\nj\n\nPAYLOAD INTEGRATION &\nCHECKOUT\nATSPICE (ESA PAYLOAD)\n;\nAT AMES\nLAUNCH SITE.

Table 2 provides a brief background of the experiments.\nAll of the experiments except the CTM had flown in aircraft previous to\nASSESS IIo The CTM experiment had been used in a ground installation. The\nMED experimenter had obtained data from several subjects aboard a long commercial flight, but ASSESS required centralized design and periodic attachment\nof the self-carried units to the ADDAS interface. The IR telescope, AWS,\nand EMI from Europe had flown on ASSESS I. LIDAR, LAS, and AEES had flown\non light aircraft. The other three experiments from JPL and LaRC had flown\nbefore on the CV-990. However, without exception, all experiments underwent\nsignificant modification in preparation for ASSESS II.\nThe infrared astronomy experiment involved three organizations from\nthree countries - the telescope was supplied and managed by the Paris Observatory\nat Meudon (France), while two separate detectors from Germany (l-1PI) and The\nNetherlands (Groningen) were adapted to it, to be operated selectively by\nbeam switching. The medical experiment from Germany acq\\Uired added scientific\ncooperation from NASA/ARC during latter phases of the project.\nFigures Sa through 5j show the sensing and data handling components of\nmost of the ASSESS II experiments. Items of particular interest are indicated\nin the illustrations and are discussed for each experiment as follows:\nIRA (Infrared Astronomy) Figure Sa shows the Meudon telescope with both\nthe Groningen and Max Planck detectors attached. The Groningen detector was\nmounted at the Cassegrain focus and moved with the telescope. The MPI detector\nwas mounted at the Coude focus and so did not move with the telescope.\nBoth dewars were pumped during flight to achieve liquid helium temperatures\nof 2K or below at the detectors. A \'l\'V camera was mounted on the tracking\ntelescope to provide the signal for the automatic tracking electronics.\nAWS (Airglow Wave Structure) Figure 5b shows the two AWS TV cameras\xc2\xb7\nlooking out either side of the aircraft along with associated equipment.\nSignals from the cameras were recorded at a slow frame rate on the video tape"\nrecorder. A small monitor was provided to aid in focussing the cameras.\nLIDAR (Light Detection and Ranginj) The laser transmitting and receiving\noptics for LIDAR were mounted in the forward cargo compartment (no photograph\navailable), with data handling equipment in a separate rack in the main cabin\n(fig. 5c). In the original design of this experiment for a light aircraft\nthe optical paths were open to the atmosphere.

Other principal components of the experiment are\nindicated in the photograph.\n,EM! (Electromagnetic Interference) m-tI sensors, consisting of 15 current\nsensors and four voltage sensors, were located at various test points leading\nto the experiments and in the aircraft power supply.

Detectors\nwere cooled tonK by liquid nitrogen. This experiment was also used to\nview the sun. using a stabilized mirror to direct the signal.\nAEES (Airborne Electromagnetic Environment Survey) Antennas for th~\nthree fixed frequency receivers were mounted on passenger window blanks in\'\nthe right rear of the aircraft, while those for the swept frequency receiver\nwere mounted in the nadir general purpose pylon. Because of the high\nfrequencies involved, the swept receiver was mounted in the rear cargo\nhold adjacent to the antennas. All other radio frequency related components\nwere mounted in the Spacelab rack number 2.\n3.1.3\n\nPayload Configuration\n\nFigure 6a shows the configuration of the payload as it was mounted in the\nCV-990 aircraft cabino Additional equipment for some experiments was located\nin the cargo compartments (fig. 6b). A photograph of the payload looking\naft in the aircraft cabin is shown in figure 7. Particular attention is\ncalled to the five Spacelab-type racks installed in the forward area to\ncentralize controls of experiments. This was the main operating:(area for\nthree of the four piSs..\n\\\\\nGeneral features of the Spacelab-type racks built for this mission are\nshown in figure 8\nThe.se racks, while patterned after Spacelab racK design,\nhad to be somewhat shorter to fit Within the CV-990 cabin. The pullout writing\nsurfaces included a shallow drawer in which the PiSs could store frequently\nrequired references and log books. Some experiment components in these racks\nwere mounted on drawer slides to allow front side access to internal parts in\ncase of equipment problems. Figures 9a through 9c show photographs and equipment layouts for these racks o Guidelines applied in developing the layout\nof experiment components in the racks were the following: 10 The center of\ngravity and overturning moment of each rack had to be within specified limits,\n2. the components for a given experiment were grouped as closely as possible,\nand 3. experiment groupings were arranged to permit each pIs the best possible\naccess to the experiment controls for whiqi,h he was assigned responsiblity.\nUsing these guidelines, the analytical.infegration processes (section\'3.3.2)\ninitiated layouts for these racks.

However, with the\nexception of ARC participation in ASSESS II and the Mission S~eering Group,\nwhich is not planned for Spacelab, the remainder of the ASSESS II management\norganization closely represents the re,lationships presently envisioned to\ncarry out a Spacelab ndssion with a combined NASA and ESA payload.\n\n1\n\n~\n\nMission tolanagement\nThe Mission }1anager concept for payload management is planned for Spacelab,\nand the application of this concept in ASSESS II was the first experience in\nexercising the concept throughout an entire Spacelab-like mission.\nSerious efforts were made to handle all aspects of mission operations in\na Space1ab-like manner. the Nission Manager at NSFC assumed overall responsiblity\nfor the payload. System Level Payload Integration* and payload flight operations\nwere carried out under MSFC management. Launch site integration, analogous\nSpacelab level III, II, and I, was managed by KSC. JSC set up a Mission Control\nCenter at ARC and managed flight operations.\nESA/SPICE managed the ESA portion of the payload. Hhile SPICE representatives worked hand-in-hand with U.S. participants to acquire and clarify\ninterface data for final payload integration at ARC, they also worked closely\nwith the European experimenters to prepare their experiments, and conducted\nan integration and flight operations simulation of the ESA portion of the\npayload before delivery to the U.S.\n\n,\n,\n\n~\n\n.;\n\'.\n/\n~\n\n. ,;:\n\n;\n\n~\n\n,\n\n.~\n\nf\n\n1\xc2\xb7\n\n\xc2\xb7t\n\n:\'\n\nThe Mission Manager initially appointed to the ASSESS 11 program was also\nthe NSFC Mission Manager assigned to Spacelab 2.

(See secUon 3.3.2.) MSFC\'Management\nassigned a new Mission Manag~r in January 1977, but by that time many of the\nexperimenters were bypassing~ the Mission Manag~r\'s staff and dealing directly\nwith ARC to solve their integration problems in order to meet schedule.\nThe Mission Manager\'s staff was supported by personnel assigned from\nvarious divisions and branches at MSFC.

A\ntot3~ Qf 13 MSFC people participated during Systems Level Payload Integration\neff\\">rt at ARC (section 3.4 0 2).\nEarly in the ASSESS II project (~~rch 1976) MSFC drew up a list of Mission\nManager" s responsibilities. These are given as follows:\n- Determines compatibility of experiments in aircraft;\n... Groups individual experiments and their objectives into conunon payloads;\n- Does detailed planning of experiment placement into aircraft;\n- Plans and executes design and fabrication of experiment interface\nhardware;\n- Determines experimenters\' data requirements, negotiates and schedules\nprogranuners for tasks, determines data distribution dUl;\'lnl\'lS\'.nd\npost flight;\n.\nDevelops Mission SaJled!"tl~;.

However, no\nwritten delegation of specific tasks was made to ARC, and as the project\nmoved into the implementation phase, responsibility for hardware interface\ndefinition was not clearly established. As a result, much of the interface\nidentification was not accomplished, and this led to significant operational\nproblems.\nIssuance of the Mission Operations Plan was proposed ,.to be done by the\nMission Manager, but WClS assigned to JSC by the Headquarte:(s Program Manager.\nJSC issued the document under a revised title called the Mission Implementation\nPlan.\nOf the other proposed Hission Manager responsibilities, selection and\ntraining of NASA and ESA 11/8s was handled independently by NASA/NSFC and E8A!\nSPICE until the pISs came. together at ARC for total payload integration, at\nwhic:h time the NSFC nd.ssion men took charge of the pIs activities and flight\noperations. Project management progress reports were not issued. However,\nmission updates were presented by the Nission Manager at each of the five MSG\nmeetings and at the two formal lWC meetings.\nAt ARC, 114.5 man-months were expended to support planning and operational\nfunctions fOl\xc2\xb7 the payload as follows:\nSupport\nof MSFC\npayload Management\nEngin~ering Design\nData Systems\nShop Fabrication\nElectronics Support\nInspection/Safety\nFlight Planni.ng\n\nSupport\nof KSC\n\n36\n14.5\n14\n15.5\n\n0.5\n\nSupport\nof JSC\n3.5 man-months\n1\n\n6.5\n4\n1.5\n\n11\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n1\n\n12.5\n\n94.5\n\n7.5 man-months\n\nKSC expended a total of approximately 22 man-months, and used a three-man\nlaunch site integration management team.

The JSC effort totalled approximately\n12 man-months.

SPICE arranged to have DFVLR construct a CV-990\nmockup, complete with cr.ew living facilities and a POCC, at the DFVLR laboratory\nPorz-Wahn, Germany" DFVLR also provided major support effort to integrate and\ntest the ESA experiments there and to conduct simulated flight operations.\nESA concentrated a five-man team at ARC beginning with the arrival of their\ne}:perimentsD Essentially all ESA payload intt:\'lrfacing was handled through the\nESA Payload Manager, with an ESA objective of shielding the European experimenters\nfrom complexities of multi-oreanizational responsiblities within NASA. Thus,\nfOrI1Jill requirements to and from ESA experimenters were handled through a single\nESA interface. ~rQtal European ;i,nvolvement through SPICE (not including ex.perimenters) ,,18S reported to total about 35 man-months,,Mission Steering Group\nA precedent had been established on earlier ASSESS missions whete a\nsteering group was used to set simulation guidelines for overall conduct of the\nmission. Thus, for ASSESS II it was a logical development to create an NSG,\nand it was made up of representatives from all participating organizations.\nWith the payload divided almost equally between NASA and ESA, it was agreed\nthat the group would be cochaired by the NASA and ESA Program Hanagerso Five\nMSG meetings were held during the course of the ASSESS II project, and because\nof the sigql~ficant :interest in the function of this group, minutes of the five\nmeetings ar\'& included as Appendix Ao\nDuring early phases of the project the MSG operated smoothly and successfully. 1-tission guidelines and objectives ~lere established and roles of the\nvarious participants were clarified. It must be recognized that the ASSESS\nII mission was breaking new ground relative to Spacelab management, and,\n\\Jhereas much discussion had taken place regarding Spacelab management, this\nmission was the first real attenlpt to organize and completely carry out a\ncomprehensive simulation of Spacelab-type activities with participants who\nwere to be latel: involved in Spacelab. Thus, as expectl~d, some issues regarding roles and missions of various grO\\lps were sensitive;, and substantial\njockeying and negotiation occurred, since it was generall~~ recognized that\nprecedents could be established which would carry through to Spacelab\'.\n\n43\n\n~I\n\nn\nD\nD\n\nc\n~\n\nPAYLOAD\nMANAGER\n\nn\n\nDFVLR\nSUPPORT\nMANAGER\n\nMISSION\nSCIENTIST\n\nSYSTEMS\nENGINEERING\nMANAGER\n\nPAYLOAD\nSPECIALISTS\n\ng\nD\n\nGROUND\nOPERATIONS\nMANAGER\n\nFLIGHT\nOPERATIONS\nMANAGER\n\nU\n\no\no\n;1\n\n[]\n\nl\n\nb\nF:tgure LO.\n\nESA/SPICE Nanagement Structure\n\n44\n\nr\nI\n\nHajor issues addressed by the }!SG were:\nMission objectives;\n}fission guidelines;\n,\'\\\nManagement structure and responsiblities;\nDivision of the payload between NASA and ESA;\nDivision of pis respon~iblity between the NASA and ESA portions\nof the payload;\nReview and agreement on the overall schedule;\nSelection and role of the Nission Specialist;\nGuidelines for nlission documentation;\nDivision of Mission Scientist responsiblities between ESA and\nNASA during flight operations.\nMost of the above topics ~"ere aired and a consensus of agreement ,qas\nE)stablished within the NSG ,qithout significant problems. However, the\n/1\nselection and role of the N/s and the guidelines for mission documentatioC_~\\\nbecame issues of contention. A complete impasse developed between MSFC\nand JSC on the N/s issue and the problem ,,,as finally solved independently\nby the NASA Program Nanager ,.rho worked 11 solution through NASA Headquarters\norgani;:::ational channels and finally achieved MSFC and JSC concurrence\n(see section 3,,3.4.1). \'rhe documentation issue \'vas considered important\nsince a major objective of the mission had been established to achieve an\nefficient documentation pattern for Spacelab. It was difficult to foresee\nthe total project documentation needs early in the project, but the NSG\nnevertheless established an overall documentation plan as a guideline\n(see section 3.6)Q\nIn general, the opportunity afforded by the NSG for all participants to\nreview progress and discuss problem areas ",\'as ,.,elcomed by everyone. It\nappeared that the MiS and documentation discussions ,.,ere fruitful even though\nneither of these subjects was fully resolved by the MSG. Some participants\nstated that this was the only means by which they were aware of total mission\nactivitYQ However, there is a fine line between the best intentioned plan\nfor a steering group to establish guidelines and provide a forum to address\nproblenl areas, and a }Iission Nanager\' s responsiblity to implement the mission.\nEven though the NSG was set up only for ASSESS and is not planned for Spacelab,\nthe question of the usefulness and desirability for such a group for Spacelab\nmission came up for consideration. \'rhere was strong disagreement on this point\nwhich is discussed further under Conclusions (section 4.3).\nNission Scientists and the Investigators\' Working Group\n\'rhe IWG meetings were the only opportunities for PIs to meet together for\nreports from the mission management staff as to plans and progress, and for\nthe PIs to discuss their mutual problems. ESA/S1\'ICE ?nd NASA/HS}?C initiated\near.ly independent meetings of the European and U.S. 1\'Is about one year before\nflight to acquaint them wi th initial plans for the proj ect. No formal record\nof those meetings \'vas made. Later, t,vo basic nw meetings were held that\n\n. . _ . . . \'._\n_. . "5\n_~_\n\nall PIs were expected to attend. Specific action items were addressed and\nIr.inutes of those meetings were prepared.\nThe first basic IWG meeting, held at Porz-Wahn in July 1976, was a\nwell attended meeting. Nission management presented elements of the "entire\npayload and mission operation. Plans had been developed sufficiently by that\ntime to show an early layout of experiment hardware in the CV-990, an early\nversion of possible flight tracks, and 1Jmany other details which resulted in\nlively discussion both among the PIs and between the PIs and mis.sien management planners. A number of problems were identified and many solutions were\nnegotiated. One case of cooperative experiment endeav ;\'I,r between European and\nU.S. PIs resulted.\n\n1\nJ\n\nIt was at this meeting that the PIs were inforrued\'that, like Spacelab,\nthere would be no flight checkout of any experiments on the CV-990 prior to\nthe constrained flight period representing a Spacelab flight. Thus, they were\ncommitted to successful integration and thorough ground checkout to insure\nflight success o Also, at this meeting an executive session of the PIs alone\nwas conducted under the chairmanship of the NASA and ESA !-1ission Scientists\nto establish their recommendations to management for the NASA and ESA Payload\nSpecialists. Credentials of each proposed pIs were aired, and the PIs discussed\nthe required capabilities to handle each experiment in conjunction with pis\nbackground and experience. Results of this exercise were considered inconclusive,\nsince the PI sponsoring a given pIs was biased in his favor, ,and it was difficult\nfor other PIs to gain a balanced judgment of the proposed pIs\'s abilities and\naptitudes.\nThe second and final H/G meeting was held at NSFC in December 1976 following concentrated effort by mission management to establish firm payload\nintegration and flight planning information. Unfortunately, the increasing\nproblem w~th availability of travel funds resulted in poor attendance by the\n-PIs. Only one ESA expe1;imenter (LIDAR) was able to attend, and the ESA experimenters were generally represented by the ESA Hission Scientist. While he\ndid an excellent job representing their interests, there was little opportunity\nto address their problems first hand or react to the plans being pursut~d.\nIn general, the IWG meeti11gs were very successful. The early partial IHGs\nheld in Europe and the U.S. were appropriate, and a fruitful exchange occurred\nbetween mission management and the PIs~ There was no real need to expend\nresources to bring all the PIs together at that early point in time. Two full\nmeetings of the IWG seemed about right for the mission and they were scheduled\nat optimum times. The only serj,ous deficiency in the nvG approach for ASSESS II\nwas the lack of attendance at the second meeting held in December 1976. By\nthat time a more extensive intelichange with the PIs should have occurred.\nFU1;therJ 1details of the two basic nvG meetings are given in the minutes\n~~ich are reproduced as Appendix B.\nIn add2tion to chairing the rWG meetings, the Hission Scientists also\nvery actively participated in the process of collecting information for the\nInvestigator Requirements Documents (IRDs). Both the U.S. Mission Scientist\nand his assistant traveled with the mission management team during the first\n\n[\n46\n\n[\n\nI\n\n1\n\n,.1\n\nI\n\nround"of visits to the U.S. expel:imenters for IRD information. The Assistant\n~~ssi~n Scientist was particularly effective because of his earlier experience\non ASSESS I. In the 11\\1) update effort carried out in conjunction with the\nJuly IWa meeting,in Por~-Waht\\, both the U.S. and ESA Nission Scientists took\npar~.\xc2\xb7The ESA Nission Scientist was the key ESA representative during the\nlate:r round of visits to the European e>:perimenters conducted in November\n1976, and he did an c>:cellent job in assisting the PIs and in negotiating a\nnumber of problem areas toward solution.\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\nl\n\n3.3\n\n303.1\nco\n\nl>1ission Development\nInvestigator Requirements Document\n\nThe llm represented 11 ne,,\' approach to interfncing between mission lIUl.nagement and thePIs o Previous space flight endeavors have . uSlmlly involved an\nextensive series of documents to identify and. ~ie dO\\o111 e~\'"Periment needs betNeen\nthe experir.tanter nnd spacecraft management.

(For $pacelab\nt.hl\' document :is now being called an Experiment Requirements Document - ERD).\n\'fh~ }ussion Hauager\'s staH very hurriedly created the first IRU in a question\nand answer format. IRb subject areas were intended to cover every PI requirement irom actual hardware data int:erfaces to operational data needs during\nflight operations and even furniture requirements to ac{!ommodate the 1\'1 and\nhis staff. This first attempt to create an efficient document of this type\nwas judgeg to be reasonably satisfactory, but with many shortcomings that\nneeded to be improved.\nThe 1Rl) outline ,,,as quiti:\'. complete and a good attempt was made toward\nthe questions in a mannel: to help the PI. Hi$sion management recognh:ed that\ntace-to-face discussions would be reqltircd to complete the I;IDs, but they\nmailed out the document to the PIs as n first step to ac:,quaint them with the.\nINlterinl. The space provided in tile docum~nt to ans,...er each question resulted\nin a bulky appearance, which elicited a negative reaction from many PIs upon\nfirst exposure since the job of answering all the questions looked formidable.\nSome e...\'tperimenters made a good effort unilaterally to" provide the needed data.\nOthers put the IRD aside after cursory review and concentrated th~ir efforts\non more apparent. e~pe:rim~nt hardware developnlent pt\xc2\xb7obl~ms.\n\'I\n\nTwo rounds of visits were made to nearly all PI laboratories to gain\nunderstanding of the e$perinlent requirements and arrive at solutions. An early\nattempt to obtain IRD~ information \\.,.as (,~ ..u:ried out by a NASA managel1\\ent team\nwho visited the u.s. 1)18 in JUne 1976 in preparation for the \xc2\xa3i\'tst analytical\nintegration effort in July. In Europ~"al\\ IRD was sent to each experimenter\nand then the ESA/SPICE l\'rogram Nanager visited inuivid\\l8l lnboX\'atories to\nexpedite IRD action. The resultant IRDS wet\'e sent to the. Hission Nanager at\nNSFC in preparation fot: analytical integration.\nA second and fiual round Qf discnssions ,...ith each PI i1\\ the U.S. and in\nEurope, using Il{.l)s of some\\ihat revised !;ormat, WllS c.arried out in Novembe.r\n1916 b)\' a NASA management t<\'am (pItlS ~)ll ESA repr~seuta tive ill Europe) in pt\'e-\n\n,\n\n\'J\n\n\'paration for the second and final analytical integration activity. This was\na very concentrated effort to complete the IRDs. Discussions,:were extensive\nand tedious, but extremely important since the information established would\nnot only set the pattern of actions to be taken by the experimenter at his\nlaboratory to p:r:epare for the flight mission, but would also establish the\npattern of actions to be taken by mission management in preparing to accom,modate ,the experimenters upon arrival for inte,gration and flight.\nSeveral key problems became apparent as the meetings with each experimenter began to open up crucial areas. Some experimenters, especially those\nwho were little experienced in operations away from their own laboratories,\ndid not appreciate the multitude of interface items which had to be settled\nfor benefit of their own successful experiment operation and conduct of their\naffairs during integration and flighto In many cases, initial hurried attempts\nto address complex issues soon settled down and it usually required not only\nextensive discussion with the PI but also substantial support from his staff\n~s well to establish understanding.\nCompleteness of the material covered\nby the IRDs did an excellent job of opening many subjects to the experimenters\'\nattention and forced earlier planning than might have been the case. Some\ncomplieaticn was introduced by forej.gn language difficulties when th-= li.S.\n~issioll management team visited European experimenters\' laboratories, but\nthis was not serious.\nA significant shortcoming of the IRD format was the overlap in inforrna tion req ues ted in the various sec tions. This \'r:esul ted in considerable was te\nof time during the field visits. Also, it became increasingly obvious that\ninterpreta tion of the nm language varied subs tan tially, no t only on an\nindividual basis, but particularly bett.een engineers on the. mission management\nside and scientists on the PI side. Substantial improvement of the 1RD format\nand wording of the specific questions are needed to make such a document efficiently useful for Spacelab. All experiments differ in their requirements yet it is desirable to have only a Single document format for general use with\nminimum redundancyo This is difficult, and it is to be expected that such a\ndocument for general SpaceL"lb use will improve wi th experience.\nIt became painfully apparent that interviewer expertise in each technical\narea of carrier vehicle operation was needed in every meeting (i.e., me.chanical,\nelectrical, data handling, safety, etc.) Perhaps the most serious omission\nwas not to include a di. ta expert during any of the visi t.3 to the experimenters\'\nlaboratories. As the later integration effort developed at Porz-Wahn and ARC,\nthis was an area of siflnificant difficulty, and even though the problems tolere\nsuch that total solutions probably could not have been fully achieved in advance,\na better understanding during the interface discussions would certainly have\nbeen beneficial.\nThe two rounds of IRD discussion seemed about right for the ASSESS II\nproject, and even though much information was still lacking, understandings\nhad reached a point where added or revised materiAl could have been gathered\nby telephone discussion. Although some further communication occurred with\nexperimenters to address specific problems, the IRDs were not updated o While\n\n-~-~--~\n\n.-......\n\n,\n\n,~--\n\n...\n\n--------._-_._--\n\n,:1.\n\nthe two sets of IRDs from the first and second interview efforts were never\nconsolidated, these documents were the basis for the two analytical integrations conducted in July and December, 1976. After that, with no further updating,\nthe IRlls quickly became obsolete. EXperimenters dealt directly with individual\nproject managment personnel on a more informal basis (usually by telephone or\nTWX) to solve interface problems. Thus, the IRD approach which started quite\nwell,was never carried to completion on ASSESS II, and no full record of\ninterfaces for each experiment was avaj.lable for reference:)\nMission management was criticize,d by some of the experimenters because\nthe IRDs were not cleaned up and fed\' back to the experimenters for their approval\nand use. As a result, the longhand ~~rsions were quickly duplicated and returned to all experimenters a few months before launch, but much of the material\nwas hardly readable and no further interaction occurred with the experimenters\nregarding the IRDs.\nIn spite of the IRD difficulties, there seemed to be general agreement\nthat the IRD approach is sound. Recommendations for improving the IRD process\nare given in section 4.4.2.\nAnalytical Integration\nThe two analytical integration efforts conducted in July and December\n1976 were accomplished at NSFC by ad hoc groups enlisted at NSFC and supported\nby representatives from KSC, JSC, and ARC.\nThe first analytical integration effort took one week. It was well\nstaffed and organized into five teams to address integrated mission planning\n(flight path planning), mission operations (POCC planning), payload specialist\noperations, ground operations (mai.nly preflight payload integration), and flight\nvehicle payload layout~ NSFC applied 15 people.to this effort supplemented by\none from KSC and t\\110 from ARC. The preliminary information about the experiments then available from the Ilills permitted a good start in general planning\nfor the mission and pinpOinted areas where further information was needed.\nWith the initial input of ARC flight planners to set bounds for aircraft\noperation, and the PI desires expre~)sed in the IRDs for experiment objectives,\nthe flight planning group developed a variety of proposed aircraft flights,\nboth day and night, to acconmlodate nearly all requirements. In conjunctlon\nwith these plans, general time lines were developed for the payload flight crew\n(payload specialists) to carry out the necessary activities to prepare and\noperate the experiments, to obtain data, and allow for necessary periods of\neat, sleep, and other personal requirements. Initial planning was accomplished\nfor POCC operation. A fi~st layout was prepared for physical accommodation\nof all experiments on the aircraft. Also, a good preliminary plan w~s worked\nout among HSFC, KSC\'~ and ARC for integration of the payload on the hangar\nfloor (corresponding\' to Spacelab Level IV integration) and integration of the\npayload onto the airl.:raft (corresponding to a combination of levels III,\nn, and I for Spacelab) 0\n\n,~__ ._. __ ~9 .___ ._ .. _____ ..\n\nThe second analytical integration at ~1SFC in December 1976 had the benefit\nof much better inputs from the just completed second version of IRDs resulting\nfrom a new round of discussions with the experimenterso Unfortunately, however,\nless manpower was available at ~FC for the second analytical integration\nthan for the firsto Thus, results of the second and final analytical integration\neffort we:re limited. The teams were organized much like the first effort. MSFC\nwas able to assign only eight people to the task, supplemented again by a\nrepresentative from KSC and. four from ARC. By tM.s time a Mission Specialist\nfr.om JSC had been identified and he, along with the two U.S. pISs from JPL, \xe2\x80\xa2\nactively pursued flight crew planning.\nGeneral results of the second analytical integration effor.t were: some\nrefinement of payload tntegration activities, additional planning for the\nproposed flight tracks, further planning for payload\'configuration in the\nflight vehicle, extensive layout and operational planning for the POCC, and\ndetailed preliminary planning for the HIs and U.S. pIs timelines. Some effort\n,,,as made to identify documentation requirements for the overall project,\nbut that effort was very limited.\nSome work was done during the second analytical i\'ntegration to establish\nplans for data transmission from the flight vehicle and to arrange for quicklook data processing in the poce, but little effort was expended until much\nlater to insure proper data interfacing and processing between the instr.uments\nand the onboard data processing system. No data system experts were brought\njnto the IRD effort except very briefly during the IWG meeting in Europe. As\nstated earlier, no data experts participated in the IRD tours, therefore the\ninformation was inc.omplete so that total analytical integration of this area\nwas not possible.\nIn summary, the two analytical integration efforts were successful as\nfar as they went. It would have been better if the early large effort could\nhave been spread to the second analytical integration period when IRD data\nthen available would have permitted a greater depth of planning which by that\ntime was sorely needed. Further concentrated analytical integration effort\nwas also needed as flight time Clpproached, but. was not applied. The result\nwas lack of completed flight and ground operations requirements documents from\nthe Mission Manager to those who needed them until the need time had passed.\nlvith integration solUtions necessarily being worked out on an individualto-individual basis, total configuration of the payload was not identified\nin sufficient detail for flight vehicle integration. This led to some time\nconsuming problem solvj.ng during flight vehicle integration. For ASSESS II,\nthe payload was small enough so that most safety and configuration details\nwhich had not been fully identified could be successfully worked out on an\nad hoc basis as payload installation proceeded. For Spacelab, analytical\nintegration requirements obviously should be carried only to the extent necessary, and some level of informality is probably appropriate to save cost.\nHowever, the limited analytical integration effort and lack of payload interface identification on ASSESS II led to extensive informality whichre.sulted\nin significant problems for almost every experiment.\n\nu\no\nill\nm\nru\n\nfl\nB\nn\n\nIJ\n50\n\n3.3.2.1\n\nFlight Planning for Disparate Objectives\n\nThe PIs were requested to enter in their IRDs the flight track parameters\n, that they desired for their experiments during data-take periods, including\nall relevant requ.irements that would allow them to collect a complete package\nof, scientific dat~\'during the ASSESS II mission. Parameters to be included\nwere altitude, heading, profiles, patterns!, desired objects of observation,\netc. This was done, but with considerable variation in the level of detail.\nOnly four PIs gave priorities among the possible flight tracks they desired,\nand only one gave exact coordinates for gI:ound target overflights. In this\nsection, the difficulty!n satisfying diverse mission objectives is illustrated\nby a comparison between the PI flight requests in their IRDs and the flights\nwhich mission management finally was able to provide. While the ASSESS II\nexperience in this regard was unique to aircraft operations, Spacelab can be\nexpected to face similar difficu1ties, even though for different reasons,\nif the payload objectives cannot be well match~d.\nASSESS II flight tracks can be categorized into those that required maximum altitude and exact heading (astronomical objects and solar viewing), those\nthat required maximum altitude independent of heading (upper atmospheric\nphysics), and those which had less severe al titude and heading l"equirements\nbut requiI:ed overflight of specific ground coordinates (nadir viewing experinlents). Requirements to fly each of these flight track types were pxoesent in\nASSESS II planning. Combination of the first and last type of objectives\n(astronomy and gxoound targets) was particularly difficult to achieve and led\nto most of the compromises of PI desires for nadir viewing. Astronomy was\naSSigned high l:>riority, thus overflights of specific targe.ts could not always\nbe accomplished. Tables 3 through 6 shm~ experimenters\' desires versus final\nflight plans.\nIt must be rec.ognized that, as a starting point, the PIs were given complete\nlatitude in requesting desired flight requirements. and this was proper to\nestablish maximum bounds for flight planning considel,"ation. Obviously, flight\nplanners could not possibly accommodate all the requests and, using priorities\nestablished by mission management, they arranged the flights to allow the\ngreatest possible opportunity for data retrieval. Thus, in some cases there\nwas wide disparity between the original PI request and the actual flight\nopportunity.\nThe IR astronomy PIs (Neudon, Groningen, and NPI) submitted a list of\nIR targets in the IRDs with viewing pl.\'iorities, but openly negotiated that\nthey be allowed to add other objects of more consuming interest during the\npl,"eflight pe\'tiod so long as the added objects had basically the same celestial\ncoordinates (right ascension and declination) as those in the ol,"iginal list,\nso that previous plans would remain approximately valid. Accordingly, additional target nnmes were submitted as late as December 1976, with specific\nIR targets in the galactic plane not named until after the second analytical\nintegration (table 3). The planners were able to incoporate a reasonable\nnumber of first and second pdority targets into the flight: plans (the prime\ncalibration sources, Jupiter and Nars, weI:e sinlply not available during the\nmission). Real-time flight planning (sect:i,on 3.5.1.1) modified viewing times\nin.several instances and introduced two unplnnned activities for "targets of\nOPPol."tunity" \xe2\x80\xa2\n\n51\n\n> "\n\nI)\n\nID j\n\nf\n\nD\nTable 3 - Desir/ed vs. Actual Observations -- IR Astronomy\n1\nI\\~~,.....!./\n\nTargf/!ts\n\n-\n\n-Priority\n1\n\nRequested\nin IRDs\n,\n\n">\n\n3\n\n~\n\nU\n\n~\n;j\n>:1\n\n~,.:\n\nm 1.\ni::\n\n\xc2\xbb\n\nRequested\nlater\n\nAnalytical\nIntegration\n\nJupiter\nNars\nt+-l7\nN-8\nGalactiC plane\n\nActual\nFlight\n\n.\nD\n\n~\n\n~\n\n235 min\n\n265 min\n\n40\n\nK-350\nG-45\nSagittarius A\np-Oph\nArcturus\nR-Cr-A\nMonR2.\nS-140\nS-88\nS-235\nON-l\nW-75\nDR-2l\n2\n\n:~\n\nScheduled Viewing Time\n\n,\n\n-_ ..\n\n~\n\n40\n\n110\n65\n40\n\n135\n65\n25\n\n90\n\n90\n\n70\n\n70\n\nD\n\nU\n0\n\nn\n0\n\n185\n\n180\n\n25\n\nSaturn\nNGC-7000\nIC-1396\nNGC-7027\nIC-4l8\nW-3\nG-333.6-0.2\n\n60\n\nu\nn\n\n10\n10\n\nD\nD\n0\n\nNGC-l068\nW-5l\nVenus\nSun\n\n0\n0\n\n!\n\nm\n\nu\nu\n52\n\n0\n\n-\n\n......UCtPII\n\nTable 4 - Desired vs. Actual Observations for Solar Viewing Experiments\n\nAltitude - km\n\nExperiment\n\nDesired\n\nFlights\n\nActual\n\nDesired\n,-\n\n\'I\n\neTM\n\n6.2\n\n10.2, 10.8\n\nIHR\n\n4.6-12.3\n\nActual\n\nAs many as\npossible.\n\n2 fUghts\n\n10.2\n\nTwo flights\nwith low\nsun elevation.\n\nOne. flight\ninstead of\ntwo.\n\n10.8\n\nOne flight\nwith Mgh\nsun elevation.\n\nOne flight\nas requested.\n\nTable S - Desired vs. Actual Observations for Atmospheric Physics Experiments\n\nExperiment\n\nAltitude - km\nDesired\n\nActual\n\nAs high as\npossible.\n\nAWS\n\nFlights\n\n>9.3\n\nDesired\nAll night\nflights.\n\nActual\n5 night\n2 night-to-day\n\nTurned. off at\ndawn; could not\noperate Oll\nday flights.\n\naTM\n\nAny.\n\nDay & night.\n\n::\'9.3\n\n2 night-to-day\n2 day\n\n.\nMLS\n\nS night\n\n>9.3\n\nDay & night.\n\n~9.3\n\ngenerally\n\n53\n\nS night\n\n2 night-to-day\n2 day\n\nI\n\nU\nTwo PIs expressed a desire to view the sun. eTM wanted all sun flights,\n:if that had been possible, to dete1;\'mine the temperature of its chromosphere,\nand IHR wanted three sun flights to use the sun as a light source to study\nozone in the earth\'s atmosphere. Table 4 shows their desires compared with\nwhat they were able to fly. CTM finally obtained only two sun viewing hours\nout of the "total of 46 data-take hours.\nThe desires of PIs interested in physics of the upper atmosphere are\nlisted in t.ble 5. Their requests were easily incorporated into the flight\nplans since neither aircraft heading nor geographic position was imPil?irtant.\nHoweverr, as originally planned, AWS could not be operated in ambient\'1ight\nlevels that approached dayli.ght intensity, and therefore had to be turned off\nduring 13 of the 46 data-take hours.\nRequests of some of the PIs with nadir viewing experiments were cunsiderably compromised. This was primarily because priority weighing for astronomy\n:in most cases precluded the inefficient flight patterns necessary Lo divert\nover exact geographical sites not on the astronomy track, and particularly\nthe inefficiency of performing vertical profiles over the geographical target,\nunless the target overflight occurred near the beginning or end of a flight\nperiod to eliminate the necessity to climb back to altitude.\nRequests of PIs with nadir viewing experiments and results of integrated\nmissi.on flight planning are listed in table 6. Few of their desires were\nfully incorporated into the flight plans. The IHR PI desired to study the\ndiurnal formation of ozone in the Los Angeles area, and to calibrate his\ninstrumentation he needed to do an altitude profile over a ground site simultaneous with release of an instrumented balloon (table 6a). Three overflights\nwere correlated with ground-truth balloon releases, but no simultaneous altitude\nprofiles were included in the flight plans. Three flights were requested in\nthe Los Angeles area. The same track ,qas to be flown each time, but at different times of day. As shown on the table, the IHR type of track over Los Angeles\nwas scheduled only on flight eight. Transit flights over Los Angeles were\nscheduled on flights two and six, but they could not be made to match the IHR\nrequirements. Thus, the IHR ground-truth calibrations were compromised, and\nozone measurements over a heavily populated and industrial area (Los Angeles)\nwere limited.\nThe LAS PI was also interested in ozone measurements over the Los Angeles\narea, as well as in four other areas (table 6b). His desires were considerably better met than those of the IHR PI. Four of the five areas of interest\nrequired direct traverses and could be included. The pattern flight requested\nover the Los Angeles area was finally fitted into the last flight.\nThe AEES PI specified tht:ee prioritized groups of cities to be monitored\nprimarily during daylight hours (table 6c). Not all of the cities could be\nincluded, and only LO$ Angeles and San Francisco were measured during daylight.\n\nu\'I\n"\n\ni\nI\nI II\nt\n\nm~\nj\n\n~\n\n~\n.!\n\n[\n\n\xc2\xa7\n~\n\n0\n\'.\n~\n\n0\nQ\n\n0\n0\n~,\n\n~\nHI\nq\n"\n\nru\n54\n\nIJ\n\n1\n~\n\n\';\n\nii\n\n~\n\n~\n1\n\n1\n~\n\nTable 6 - Special Flight Characteristics - IRD Requests\na.\n\nTargets\n\nActuai Flights\n\nVS o\n\nIHR EXPERlltENT\n\nA1 ti tude - km\n\nHorizontal Pattern\n\nRequested\n\nIJl\nIJl\n\nActual\n\nRequested\n\nLA industrial\narea plus\nopen farmland\nand water for\nreference.\n\nFlight 2\n\n9.1-12.2\n\n10.7\n\nFlight 6\n\n"\n\n8.8\n\n"\n\n0100, not\ndownwind.\n\nFlight 8\n\n"\n\n10.7-5.2\nin 1.5 km\nsteps.\n\n"\n\n0850, not\noverwater.\n\nFlight 9\n\n"\n\n9.4\n\n"\n\n1400, patterns\nfor LAS.

Most of the SAR t~rgets were incorporated into flight plans.\nHowever, the priority 3 overwater flight requested was not accomplished because\nneither of the two overwater flights scheduled included the ground-truth sit~\nspecified in the ~IRD, so were of little interest to the PI.\nThe LIDAR experimenter, whose instrument detected aerosols below the aircraft, wished to study the industrial environments of San Francisco and Los\nAngeles or San Diego using Tucson, Arizona as a nonindustrial reference, and\nto calibrate his instrumentation by comparing airborne observations with those\nmade by ground based LIDAR systems in Menlo Park, California and Colstrip,\nNontana (table 6e). Aircraft altitude constraints for LIDAR were severe because\nlaser safety considerations placed a lower limit of one kilometer on operational\naltitudes, and preferable altitudes dictated by instrument sensitivity were\nless than 4.a km at night and 3.0 kIn d4ring the day. Resultant flights for\nthe LIDAR PI were a 5.2 km daylight flight over the San Francisco area in a\npattern approximately as desired, and a proper box pattern over Los Angeles\nduring daylight but at 9.4 km. The Tucson, Arizona reference measurement\ncould not be included and the Colstrip, Montana calibration was flown at\n11.9 km ins tead of the lower al ti tude reques ted.\nTables 3 through 6 indicate the complexity introduced into flight planning\nwhen the payload includes experiments from unrelated scientific disciplines.\nIn general, PIs had to settle for less than they desired because, after extensive\nflight planning trad~offs, i t was impossible to include all facets of the\nPIs\' requests into the flight tracks, Only the }~S PI achieved most of his\nobjectives in the flight plans primarily because almost any flight path at\nhigh altitude, day or night, was suitable. Some PIs got complete data packages,\nbut had to settle for fewer targets (IRA, SAR), or less time on prime target\n(CTM, AWS). Some data packages were compromised due to lack of desired groundtruth calibration (IHR, LIDAR) and one data package was severely compromised\nby not repeating a flight pattern at appropriate times (IHR).\n3.3.3\n\nPaylo~d\n\nI\nt\n[\n\nu\nU\nfl\n\nSpecialist Selection and Training\n\nAll of the piSs were interviewed by the ASSESS II Observer Team and each\nESA pis was required by SPICE to submit a report about his experiences. Information from these sources as well as general observation of activities by the\nteam has been used to prepare the following sections and the discussion in\nsection 3.5.1 covering operational effectiveness of the piSs. ThUS, the\ndiscussion regarding selection, trainins, and operations by the piSs represents\ntheir point of view as well as that of the observers.\nAn early ground rule was established for ASSESS II that ESA would\nselect piSs specifically to operate the European experiments and NASA would\nselect piSs to operate only the V.S. experiments. That decision was driven\nby funding limitations which precluded inftercontinental travel for experiment\noperational training, but secondarily, there was hardly enough time in the\nschedule for pis training on all the experiments, and also there was a real\nquestion as to whether it made sense to dilute pis expertj.se too widely over\n\n60\n\nu\no\n\nmany experiments. Only the European medical experiment involved all the\npISs and it "Nas \'agreed that the U.S. pISs would train for that, begiuning\nwith the integration period at ARC.\n" All pIs nomiJ;lees for ASSESS II were required to meet Class III aviation\nflight crew standards c That was the only basic requirement. With the ground\nrule of separate responsibilities fdr the ESA and NASA PISs, ESA and NASA then\neach selected two pISs for flight so that, with the MIs, the payload flight\ncrew totaled five. The selection and backup philosophy differed significantly\nbetween ESA and NASA as discussed in the following.\nSelection of ESA Payload\n\n3.3.3.1\n\nS~ecialists\n\\\'\n\n\',\\\n\nESA pIs candidates were nominated by partic::lpating PI organizations,\nDFVLR, and ESA. University of Southampton, England nominated two, DFVLR\nin Germany nominated six, and ESA nominated one. The PI and ESA nominations\nwere made with operation ,of particular exp~riments in mind while DFVLR cho~e\non the basis of generalized background qualifications (IR astronomy, solar\nphysics, a~mospheric physics, or medicine). Fluent English was considered an\nessential qualification.\nESA used three basic selection criteria as ,follows:\nPractical laboratory \'experience in the areas of electronics, optics,\ncryogenics; or astronomical observations;\nScientific background appropriate to payload operations, sufficient\nto interpret data and make appropriate decisi~ns;\nFlightworthiness, i.e., adequate physical well-being, team membership\nadaptability, and response to flight environment.\nFlightworthiness was determined by a series of medical and psychological\ntest.s carried out. by the DFVLR Institute of Aviation Medicine and Luftnansa\n(German Air:j.ine) Medical Office for Flight Personnel. The standards applied\nwere thos~ for Flight Engineers, taken to be the position most closely appro~\xc2\xad\nimating that of a pIs. Results of the flightworthiness testing resulted in\nlow ratings for three of the candidates.\n\'"\n"\nThe European PIs in an IWG meeting attempted to apply the first two\ncriteria to recommend pIs candidates to ESA management, but the spread in\nrating for each candidate l-iaS wide as reflected by the fact that one PI would\nrate a certain candidate "best" while the next PI rated him "worst". Neverth~...\nl~ss, PI recommendations were given considerable weight in pIs selection.\n\nESA management, using the results of the medical and psychological tests\nalong with recommendations from the European IWG, selected four pISs; a\nphysicist and an electrical engineer from DFVLR, an astronomer from ESTEC\n.and a phy$;lcist from the University of Southampton, England.

The ESA pIs training cmcompassed about 1150\nhours each for four partl.tipants. Thl? two prime Nt\\SA pISs trained approx-.\nimately 900 hours each; the bnckup only about 500 hours.\nSeveral factors caused significant differences bet\\.Jec.\'r1 the NASA and\ntraining activities. In NASA, three of the five experiments ,~ere. at\nJPL where both prime rlss were located. ThUS, productive and efficient\ninvolvement could take place on short notice. Because one pIS was also the\nPIon one of the JPL experiments and the other had partiCipated in construction and opera tion of another of the JPL experiments, they \\vere already well\ntrained on two of the. five U.. S. experiments. The AlmS experiment from GSFC\n,.,tas not authorized early enough for any training at the PI laboratory.\ntraining f01,\' that experiment took place during the integration p~riod.\n~SA\n\nIn Europe, only one of the four piSs ~"as directly involved in the background history of one experiment - n~l1H"ly~ the University of Southampton\npIS :who t-.1as responsible for con$truction of the AHS experiment.

All piSs were scheduled to receive training on all\nEurope~n experiments so that each pis would have a primary and secondary\nexperiment operating responsibility. Subsequent to initial general training,\nthe piSs ccnsidered prime for particular experiments received more detailed\ntraining on those experiments to the extent required to achieve operating\n; proficiencyo The training schedule was arranged so that all four pis candidates\nreceived concurrent initial training at the PI laboratories. Prime operational\ntraining generally followed on a personally scheduled basis.\n\')\n\nThe Es~p/Ss attended an initial two day orientation at ESA/sPICE during\nwhich the training philosophy and schedule were established. ESA management\nhad requested that the PIs supply each pis with pert:i.nent information on the\nbackground of their experiments for study prior to the first visits to PI\nlaboratories. ESA left all other details of individual training programs to\nthe PIs. The ESA piSs all reported that the original packages of background\ninformation contained much more material than was necessary for subsequent\nopera\'tion, and that they unwittingly spent too much time studying it. Also,\nthey reported that they encountered considerable diversity in efficiency and\nusefulneas of training programs at the various PI laboratories. Only one\nexperiment (LIDAR) was sufficiently complete so that the instrument could be\nfully operated. It was installed on a light aircraft and several flights\nwere made for training purposes. All other experiments lacked one or more\nimportant components unti.l just prior to shipment to SPICE for integration.\nThe piSs reported two instances where language comprehension proved to be a\ntraining obstacle. ESA piSs were unanimous in rating the period of European\nexperiment integratiou activity at SPICE far superio~ to visits to PI laboratories for training p~rposes.\nInitial NASA training philosophy included considerable cross-training\nfor the piSs. However, when funding became a problem, plans for cross-training\nwere reduced to only what could be accomplished at little or no additional\ncost. Prime experiment training plans were formulated at the introductory\nU.S. IWG meeting held in September 1976. General agreements were reached on\nduration of training and dates, where travel was involved. The exact dates\nfor travel to PI laboratories were later arranged via consultation of the pis\ndirectly with the PI. Also, mission management held a two-day orientation\nmeetihg for the U.S. piSs at MSFC to initiate the training process, and to\nprovide them with suitable background material for home study.\nPrime pis training on the inhouse JPL experiments was arranged in a rather\ncasual way and on a time-available basis. A little cross-training was included.\nTravel was involved on only two occasions; once to the IHR laboratory and once\n\nG\n\n63\n~~:. \' }\n\nfor both PiSs to fly aboard the CV-990 in fall 1976 when the payload had two\nof the planned ASSESS II experiments aboard o Some cross-training also occurred\nwhile the piSs were with the CV-990 mission (approximately two days). The\nAEES experiment was not funded until February 1977 which precluded training on\nthat experiment until Systems Level Integration at ARC.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nI\n\nI\n\nThe extra assignment of the NASA Assistant ~tlssion Manager as the backup\nrequired extensive travel for training, and presented a serious conflict,\nsince he really did not have er.ough time to do justice to either responsibility.\nHowever, he was able to visit JPL for training on MLS and SAR, and got valuable\ninflight training by accompanying prior CV-990 missions when the payloads\nincluded earlier versions of the ASSESS II experiments. He made one flight\nwith SAR and three flights with }~S and IHR. The early CV-990 flight training\ncan be considered analogous to training on high-fidelity trainers which might\nbe made available prior to Spacelab flight.\n\npIs\n\nSeveral factors probably made the NASA home laboratory training more\neffective overall than in Europe. The NASA pISs were both already expert in\nthe operation of one of their experiments. The experiments operated by one\npIs were conceptually similar (LAS, IHR), and the laboratory training\ntook place shortly before the shipment of the experiments to ARC when they\nwere complete and approximately in their final flight configurations. Experiment similarities lessened new operational concepts and information to digest.\nThe training situation (experiment configuration) was much more realistic with\nthe instruments in final configuration.\n\nF\n\n[;\n\nBeginning with the System Level Integration at ARC, almost every mission\nrelated activity involved the PISs. This was the first opportunity for the\npISs to work with the entire payload and served as excellent training. Both\nthe ESA and NASA PISs were used extensively for integration and operation of\nthe payload. At ARC the ~l/s was present from the beginning along with all\nthe p/Sso The MIs was very experienced and exhibited strong leadership\nqualities. He had participated with the ESA pISs at SPICE so that he was\nalready well ac.quainted with their activities, and it was natural for the\npayload crew to pursue their training very rigorously as a team under his\nleadershipo\nDuring System Level Integration the pISs worked closely with the PIs\nwho, at this stage, were responsible for integration and operation of their\ninstruments. For Launch Site Payload Processing involving integration of the\npayload onto the aircraft, the responsibility was reversed, and the pISs were\nassigned prime responsibility for experiment integration and operation with\nthe PIs participating only as needed. These two integration periods along\nwith the ESA integration for ESA piSs, provided by far the most fruitful\ntraining for the entire flight crew.\nAt the onset of ARC integration activities, ESA had made a decision\nidentifying the prime and backup piSs. Nevertheless, all four ESA pISs participated together to provide assistance and to achieve further training as\nwell o\n\n[1\n1J\n\no\no\n\no\n64\n\nD\n\nI\'\nMission independent training consisted mainly of safety briefings conducted by aircraft operations personnel at ARC prior to the flight period,.\ninvolving both a safety lecture and onboard aircraft safety discussions.\nThe mission independent training had very little analogy to Spacelab since\nSpacelab flight will entail much more mission unique training not applicable\nto the ASSESS program. Conversely, the experiment training was highly analogous\nto that expected for Spacelab.\nThe different apProaches to payload training as well as the difference in\ntotal training time between the ESA and NASA PiSs seemed to result in no difference in performance. The PiSs as well as the PIs all expressed confidence in\nthe ability of the payload ,crew to satisfactorily handle the experiments at\nthe final Flight Readiness Review. Any differences in ability among the piSs\nseemed more directly related to individual capability and personality traits\nrather than to a lack of training.\nIn general, the overall PiS training was considered to be very good, and\nthe only critical observation made by the piSs was that it would have been\nhelpful if they could have participated early in operational design considerationsoThis same observation was made by the PiSs after the ASSESS I mission.\n3.1.4\n3.3.4.1\n\nMission Specialist Selection and Training\nMission Specialist Selection\n\nThe selection of a M/S was a very difficult and sensitive process.\nResponsibilities of the position ~"ere the subject of extensive debate both\nprivately and at management meetings during the early phases of the ASSESS\nII project. This paralleled a larger dispute on the same subject for Spacelab\nitself. The real question centered around the extent to which a representative\nof the STS organization should be involved in payload activities o It was\nrecognized that some inflight responsibilitjes will exist in Spacelab for STS\nsupplied payload support systems such as the central data system, power system,\netc. Similar systems exist on the CV-990 so that the same problem had to be\nfaced. Efforts to settle this issue in the ~lSG reached an impasse and, as a\nresult, the NASA Program Manager initiated a solution through NASA Headquarters\nadministrative channels (OA and OSF) which ,,,as accepted by the l-fission Manager.\nResponsibilities thus assigned to the M/S are given in sectj.on 2.4.5.\nThe long delay in settling the M/S role postponed M/S nomination until\nDecember 1976 when JSC appointed a scientist/astronaut with expertise in\nastronomy to serve as M/S and a second scientist/astronaut with similar background as backup.\nNis~ion\n\nSpecialis t Traini.M\n\nBoth the prime M/S and the backup M/S had experience on earlier ASSESS\nmissions, which, coupled with their extensive background and training as\nastronauts in the JSC program, equated to a high degree of training already\naccomplished for ASSESS II.\n\nThe prime N/s started participation in the second analytical integration\nactivity at NSFC in December 1976 inunediately following his assignment.\nWhile neither he nor the backup N/s spent time at PI facilities, they quickly\ndeveloped an understanding of the experiments and the mission objectives.\nThe N/s participated actively with the ESA pISs during one of the two flight\nsimulation periods at SPICE. Hoth he and the backup MIs trained on carrier\nsystems by accompanying a previous CV-990 mission (three flights). (The backup HIs received no other specific training.) During the integration,period at\nARC, the ~l/s participated in all operational activities and worked closely\nwith all the pISs during their activities. In fact, he took on a leadership\nrole for pIs training activities for which every pIs later expressed appreciati,on.\nThe N/s achieved proficiency in all responsibilities assigned to him\nexcept the central data system o He operated the power system, the surface\ntemperature and atmospheric \'-later vapor radiometers, the video camera and\nrecorder system for cloud cover data, the ENI monitor sys~am, and the ozone\nmonitoring system. His late selection permitted only limited training on the\ncomplex central data and housekeeping systems where "ghost" participants were\nadded to the payload crew, in accordance with the mission guidelines, to assist\nthe HIs. AlthQugh an interactive data system terminal was available at the Nls\nstation, it was not practical to extend all the controls for these syst~ms to\nhis operating position, so that it would not have been possible for him \'to\nhandle these systems even if he had achieved full proficiency.\n3.4\n\nNission Integration\n\nTwo discrete steps were planned by NSFC mission management far integration of the ASSESS II payload in preparation for flight. Analogous\nto their plan for integration of a Spacelab payload at MSFC, they proposed\nan ASSESS II System Level Payload Integration in a test area at ARC under\njurisdiction of MSFC. This would be followed by Launch Site Payload Processing\nonto the aircraft under jurisdiction\' of KSC, analogous to the levels In~ II.\nand I planned for Spacelab by KSC.\n\n\xc2\xb01I:\nU\n\nD\nU\n\no\n\nESAlsPICE made an \' l :,ldependent decision to bring the European experiments\ntogether at SPICE for integration and operation because they felt strongly\nthat this step was necessary to work out experiment hard\'-lare and operational\nproblems before their lines of conununication and support became too long and\ncostly in the U.S. Conversely, ESA felt that once they had accomplished\nintegration of their portion of the payload in Europe, very little time would\nbe required to integrate their pOl,"tion of the payload into the whole at ARC.\nIn fact, they preferred to skip System Level Payload Integration and go d:lrectly\'\nto Launch Site Payload Processing on the flight vehicle to save their time and\ncost. \'rhe NSFC Nission Hanager insisted on ESA participati.on in the System\nLevel Integration in order to assure operation of the entire payload before\nturning it over to KSC for Launch Site Processing, but did agree to a shorter\nthan initially planned period for European payload preflight integration at\nARC.\n\n66\n\nUi\n\n3.4.1.\n\nESA Payload Integration in Europe\n\nThe .ASSESS II integration of the ESA portion of the payload at SPICE\nfollol-led the fOrIl\',at which they plan for Space1ab. C:SA/SPICE arranged with\nDFVLR at Forz-Wahn, Germany to COllstruct a full scale mockup of the CV-990\ncabin to accommodate the European instruments (figures 11 and 12). Se.rious\nattempts were made to provide power and data handling systems similar to the\nplanned C\\I-990 installAtion. They contracted with the A}{C AlmAS computer\ncontractor. to participate throur,hollt the SPICB integration to work prosramrning\nand data hl:mdlinr, problems. They borrowed ARC flight data hardware to assure\nIl d~lt\\l system interface as much like the flight system as possible.\nDFVL}{\nadded HvinS quarters to the simulator to accommodate the "flight crew". A\nscreen room was built to solve mlI problems, and a full scale POCC was\nprovided. ARC arranged to send a safety engineer to Porz-Wahn to advise ESA\non experiment safety problems o\nActivities at SPICE/DFVLR during the period from January 15 to March 15,\n1977 included:\n\n-\n\nCompletion of experiment development and integration;\nESA acceptance testing;\nEMI characterization and corrective action where necessary;\nDevelopment and integration of experiment software;\nExperiment integration on system level;\nFlightworthiness verification;\n!nterexperimen t cOlllpa tibili ty tes ting;\nMission simulations;\nTraining of flight and ground support personnelo\n\nExperiments were brought sequentually into the acceptance testing/EM!\ntesting area during the first month. Functional testing and some development\nchanges were carried out first. Each experiment was then subjected to EMI\ntesting with concomitant introduction of electrical grounding or screening\nalterations to meet minimum EM! requirements in accordance with Spacelab\nstandards as measured by the ESTEC/EM! team.\nAfter sucr~essful acceptance testing, experiments were integrated into a\n30-foot long :i~ction of the full scale mockup of the CV-990 cabin. The configuration of el;)ch experiment was approximately as planned for the eventual\nairl.!\'j:\'lJft jns~~allation, but distribution of the experiments in the mockup was\nsome~hat different than planned for the aircraft.\nRelative positions of the\nESA experiments\' were correct, but physical separation was much less than in the\nfinal flight configuration where the ESA expe~iments were interspersed with\nNASA experiments and the ADDASo However, the interconnecting cables had been\ncut to fit the aircraft installation so that problems associated with cable\nlength were addressed except for the effect of EM! problems later introduced\nat ARC by the balance of the payload. After completion of payload testing in\nthe mockup, two flight simulation periods of three days each were conducted"\nDuring each period the crew was confined to the CV-990 mockup and the adjacent\nliving quarters, and contacted the "ground" via the fully manned POCC. Thus,\na full rehearsal of activities anticipated during the mission proper at ARC\nwas carried out Using the European complement of experiments.\n\n68\n\n-\n\no\n\nI\n\n0"1\n0"1\n\n>\nU\n\n<\n\nt.J\n\ntI)\n\nD\n\no\n\n\xc2\xb71\n\nm\n\nI\n!\n\n~l\n\n;\n\n,.~\n\nNumerous dif~iculties were encountered in attempting to implement soft-,\nware development and the central data system interface verificationo In addition\nto lack of complete data interface information in the IRDs, another major\nreason for the. data handling difficulties was that insufficient time was allowed\nfor the data system contractor to assemble and check out the system used at\nSPICEo The components had never been operated as a system, and systems of such\ncomplexity have their own. operational idiosyncrasies which had to be discovered\nand understood by the operator in addition to attempting to carry out the\npayload checkout activities o When problems arose during this period both\nthe data sys.tem and the particular i~xperiments were suspect. Hardware problems\ndelayed significant software development until about the middle of Februaryo\nIntegration of the experiments provided valuable pIs training, but the\nprincipal training activity was accomplished during the two mission simulations\ncarried out March 1-3 and 6-9. During the first period the prime ESA pIs 3\nand backup 4 were confined to the CV-990 mockup and living quarters together\nwith the NASA lotls who had been invited to participate. The other two pISs\nperformed communication tasks in the POCC. During the second confined period\nthe pIs assignments were interchanged so that prime 4 and backup 3 were\nconfined 0 The ESA Systems Engineering Manager took over the M/S role and was\nconfined with the payload crewo 1o1ission simulations were timelined according\nto the preliminary flight plans that had\xc2\xb7 been developed by MSFC analytical\nintegration activities o\nDuring the periods not devoted specifically to checkout and payload\nintegration at SPICE, ESA pISs in conjunction with PIs developed written\noperational procedures for each experiment. The mission simulations, which\nintroduced timeline activities for the first time, brought about considerable\nrefinement of the operational procedureso\n\ni;\n\nIn order to address safety i.ssues early, an ARC safety engineer was sent\nto Porz-Wahn to participate in the ESA payload integration effort. Many minor\nand several major safety problems were identified there and solved. A few\nwere recognized and deferred unt:ll final integration at ARC where aircraft\ninstallation geometry had to be consideredo However, this early attention to\nthe flight safety area, when lead time was available, was successful and\neliminated the problems at a latl~r time when they probably would have been\ncritical.\nThe ESA simulation was conducted using European 50-Hz rather than 60-Hz\npower to be used later in the UoS o since only a small 60-Hz generator was\navailable.

Fifteen open items were passed on\nto KSC\xc2\xb7 for ac~p.on during launch site processing on the aircraft. Most, but\nnot all of these, required the, final aircraft configuration for proper action.\nt\xc2\xb7\n\nThe large number of open H:ems upon arrival of the experiments represent\n41 of \'the\n71 ~pen items identified upon experiment arrival were for one reason or\nanother purposely deferred by the PIs until arrival at ARC. Six open-ondelivery items could only be addressed using facilities available during PCU\ntesting. Others were problems which the PI had not had time to close. Data\nproblems were strongly related to the LIDAl{ and CTM/AnDAS interface problems\nwhich had been,encountered during Sl?ICE integration in Europe and were still\nopen on arrival at ,ARC. The two facility/data problems passed to KSC were\nrelated to small subroutines which ADDAS was supposed to per\xc2\xa39rm for various\nPIs. ,; Two of the" ai.ne experiment problems pnssed on to KSC.~olei= missing hard\'ware components caused by late funding which delayed procurement.\n62~\' of all the open items id\'e:ntified during Level IV integrationo\n\nq\nl\n\n,~\n\nI;.,]\n\nrJ\n\ni\n\nn\nD\nf ,t\n..\n\nq\n\nLJ\n\nT<l\n\n\xc2\xa3\\\'\n\n\\ii,".\'\n\nq\n\n".~\n\nPerhaps the most disturbing aspect of Level IV integration became apparent\n:ilnmediately upon arrival of the experimeris. Every experiment arrived at ARC\nwi.th some part of it in a configuration different from that H\';:entified in the\ninterface definitions contained in the IRDs and the resultant drawings and\nsketches which had been prepared as a part of the analytical integration\nprocess. It was to be expected that some unidentified changes would show up\n" w i t h the cessation of the formal IRD effort some six months before flight,\nbul; the. changes we\'re extensive. Some changes had been addressed but they were\nmainly problem areas where the e,xperimenters had contacted ARC to achieve\nresolution. No attempt was made by ~ission management to track changes in\nexperiment requirements during the. fClur months prior to systems integration.\nSome experiments arrived with deleted components, others with added components.\nIn many cases units had been interchanged.

ActiVities included:\nExperiment installation;\nExperiment/aircraft interface verification;\nEquipment testing and calibration;\nCompatibility test;\nMission sequence test;\nAn Integrated Mission Simulat;ion;\nFinal preparation for launch.\nThe entire process was completed during a four-week period by a, team\ncomposed of KSC, ARC, the N/S, pISs, and experimenter personnel. Significant\nfeatures of the activity on board the aircraft were the considerable amount of\nexperimental testing found to be necessary to insure achievement of payload\nobjectives, and the large number of hardware and software problems encountered\nduring experiment operations. Following integration and testing, special\nmaterial was placed aboard the aircraft in accordance with a formal stowage\nlist \'similar to preparation for space flight. This material. included the flight\ndata file, tools, test equipment, n~terials, and spare parts. The Integrated\nMission Simulation was carried out OVf!r a 2-day period as a final checkout and\ntraining exerciseo This was an all-up dress rehearsal invol.ving the payload\ncrew confined on the aircraft, and a fully staffed POCC and MCC all operating\nas if the aircraft was in flight.

They were\nsupported by the ARC aircraft technicians and shop personnel, similar to Spacelab plans to use a support contractor at KSC. In addition, all the pISs along\nwith the MIs were heaVily utilized by KSC to integrate and test the payload.\nOriginally, KSC representatives established a ground rule that PIs and their\nstaffs would not be involved in integration of experiments on the aircraft\nunless a special problem required their support. This is consistent with the\nrules at KSC, which they expect to maintain for Spacelab, that limit access to\nthe flight vehicle to only those people who are mandatory to do the work. This\naccess rule was not strongly enforced for ASSESS II, and the PI teams as well\nas pISs and the ARC support personnel often worked together in order to accomplish integration and checkout of the payload. As a result, it was not possible\nto fully evaluate the effectiveness of using the pISs to represent the PIs\nduring integration since, without question, the use of PIs expedited the\nintegration and testing activity.\nIt is expected that heavy participation by the pISs to represent the PIs\nduring launch site integration would be of great benefit to the launch site\ncontractor, and their intimate familiarity with the payload would negate the\nneed for T(!,uch detailed documentatiori. Since the pISs ultimately must fly with\nthe resultant configuration, they are properly motivated both from the point of\nview of satisfactory experiment operation l~!ld safety.\n3.4.3.2\n\nLaunch Site\n\nPaylo~d\n\nProcessing Actions\n\nIdeally, Systems Level Integration and Testing (Level IV) would solve\nall problems internal to the experiments and incompatibilities between experimehts, and would exercise all interfaces between experiments and duplicates\nof flight vehicle ha\'tdware and support systems o Thus, the mechanical installation and electrical hookup in the vehicle could proceed directly to final\n\nU\nU\n\nn\nn\nH\n\nn\nn\n\nn\nm\n\nu\nU"\n;,\n\n"\n\nU I\'\nEI\n\n~\n\nI\nI\nI\n\n\\\n\noperational verification, compatibility testing, and in situ calibrations as\nrequired. However, this was hardly the case for ASSESS II, and cannot\nbe expected for Spacelab because the fidelity of the Level IV integration is\nlimited by the fidelity of the Level IV integration device (PCU)o For ASSESS\nII, the PCU fidelity was not high, primqrily because it was not cost effective\nto construct an extensive Level IV checkout system for, a single mission.\nCompatibility testing after installation aboard the flight carrier\nintroduces several areas for consideration that do not exist during similar\ntesting in Level IV integration. These are: 1) the effects of payload operation on flight carrier systems; 2) the effects of flight carrier systems operation on the payload; and 3) the possible effects on payload operation of\nshifting from PCU ground supplied power to flight carrier power.\nIn considering the first area for ASSESS II, mission management, along\nwith cognizant aircraft systems personnel, reviewed payload operation and\ndecided that specific tests for the effects of payload opp.ration on aircraft\nsystems would not need to be carried out. l\'he aircraft systems were sufficiently protected to negate any forseeable problem. There was general concern\nin the second area among the PIs because opera.tion of aircraft systems has\noccassionally had adverse effects on experi~ent operation and some of the\nexperimenters were aware of a potential problem. However, only the AEES\nPI requested specific tests, and the Mission Manager took the position that all\ninterested Pl;s would be allowed to monitor their experti~ent operation during\naircraft/AEE;S testing.

First, to provide satisfactory artificial sources can be\ncostly and all the experimenters were very cost limited, but second, in most\ncases tl:\\e PIs did not th:tnk far enough ahead to request special test requirements\nin the lRUs. Probably, if the IRD effo:r::t-,had been continued as the project\nprogressed toward flight, more of the requirements would have been identified\nearly enough to permit planned solution. However, experience of KSC personnel\nled them to provide sufficient schedule time to handle unplanned requirements\nwhich the PIs developed o\nU\n\nMany of the experiments were sky-looking and a realistic method of\ncalibration is to use sky sources. This type of test appeals to PIs because\nit is relatively cheap for them "md provides a direct check of experiment\nsensitivit;yo However, in most Cclses the final flight equipment configuration\nmust be used for valid results. !\'Therefore, such tests are best performed after\nlaunch site integration. Such tE~sts could be performed with high fidelity\nsimulators, o\'r even during flight, but that would use valuable flight time otherwise better scheduled to obtain scientific data. For ASSESS II, a decision was\nmade to use sky sources for the c.alibrations, and Table 12 summarizes these\ntestso They requ;i.red four days ~iuring which the aircraft was parked outside\nand oriented to make specific sky targets available to the experimenters.\nFortunately, good weather prevailed so that the sky targ~ts were visible.\nMi.ssion Simulation Tlest\nThe all-up integrated l<1ission Simulation Test covered a continuous 31-hour\npe,riod, and was considered a very valuable activity, not only to check out the\nentire system, but particularly as a training exercise for everyone involved.\nThis was the first and only opportunity for the entire operation to be exerciseu\nas an entity before the "Spacelab flight"\nThe test consisted of detailed\nactivities as planned for two aircraft flights scheduled for the actual flight\nperiod, except that the aircraft. was parked on the hangar apron. Communications\nwere hard wired to the aircraft in addition to a radio link. The full cycle\nwas exercised including payload preparation for flight, simulated payload flight\noperations, sleep cycle between data take periods, stowage, and preparation of\nthe l)ayload for landing. Some lilroblems \'vere artifidally imposed by management\nto test the systemo\n0\n\nAlthough eve\'ryone benefited from the training experience, perhaps the\ngreatest benefit was derived by the flight crew. Their attempt to work to\nthe preplanned timelines was severely tested o The Meudon computer problem\nwas still real and required a work-around. The LIDAR data problem had not\nyet been resolved and tried the pis\'s ability at trouble shooting. The AEES\nscanning receiver started out scanning poorly 8tld finally quit.\n(This led to\nhome laborato\'ry repairs prior t(J the later flight period.)

(Ac~ually tfiis was coupled with an equipment failure since\nthe gas system should not have allowed so much gas to escape even though the\nsupply valve was not closed.) These problem areas clearly illustrate the\ndifficulties faced by the (PISs, and the Hission Simulation ;jest experience was\nextremely valuable in helping them prepare for ~he rigors of later flight\nactivities.\no\nThis first a11-\\\\o experience for the HIs was also valuable. It was an\nexcellent opportunity\' for him to further develop his own timeline ac~ivities~\'\nsuch as reminders to the crew for start and stop of data-take periods, the\nneed to assist pISs during high activity periods, and operation of the experiment support systems. The stowage list was referred to several times, and on\ntwo occasions assistance from "the ground" w~s required to locate needed, items.\nPOCC aud HCC operational procedures benefited significantly from the Simulated }!ission Tes t. Also, several facility type problems were discovered\nand corrected. as a result of the test.

The payload flight crew, consisting of the four\npISs and the, HIs, were\' confined to the aircraft and the attached living quarters\nfor the entire period e-x;cept for brief moments to refill dewars. That process\nwas handled outside the aircraft on the ground where the~e WLlS more adequate\nspace. For Spaci:!lab, such refilling is not planned, since hold time for dewars\nwill Cover an entire Spacelab flight period.\nSome support equipment aboard the aircraft and one experiment (IHR) were\nnot automated to the extent planned for Spacelab. Therefore, "ghost" operators\nwere used to maintain and operate the central data system and the gyro-controlled\nmirrors used for IHR and CTN and to reposition mirrors internal. to the IHR.\nThe ghost operators interacted minimally \\"ith the Spacelab flight cre~~, and\npl:\\rformed tasks which would normally have been autqmated.\n3.5.1\n\nPayload Operations\n\nThe nine aircraft flights (data-take periods) totaled 53 flight hours, of\n...hich 46 were at altitude and therefore useful a8 data-take time.

The first and most\nsignificant took place on a daily basis using results of debrieUng of the\nflight crew after each flight. Using computers, the ground based planners\nthen developed a specific plan for the next fl;i.ght, factoring in new or altered\nIII requirements and updated weather predictions. Nany different groups and\nindividuals were involved in coordination of flight plans including logistics\npersonnel, we~ ther personnel, air traffic control. PIs, 1>1ission Scientist,\nflight crew~ Nission Nanagcor, and others. The .final pl.an which included a\nroute map, n science priority chat\'t for the payload crew, and a flight log\nand planning chart for the pilots, was passed to the aircraft approximately\nthree hout\'s before flight. The second type of iterative flight change was\noccassiOnally made by the flight crew during actual flight. \'rhis was coordinated with the Nce and raGC, nnd came about because of onboard changes in\ntimeline activities usually caused by difficulties :In experiment operation.\nThe combination of viewing c~rtain uatronomical targets and overflying\nspecific ground targets made i t difficult to make fundamental changes in\nspecific flight plans. but as the mission progressed and tho PIs assessed\noperational and scientifiC results, they utilized the POCC and NCC system\nto introduce cet\'cain changes which sought to enhance scientific return from\nthe mission. The most Significant of th0se changes is shown in figure 17\nfor the fourth data-tak~ period. The initinl plan for this flight did not\ninclude the pattern in the Salt Lake area which was to have been flown for\nSAR on flight three. However, because SAR was llonoperational on that flight,\nthe pattern W~lS rescheduled for the following day. at the expenst\' of n lowet\'\npriority SAR ground target, a salt seep in western North Dakota, which resulted\nin the conSiderable change in flight plan shown in figure 17.

The pIS countered that he\ncould not comply and also keep his other experiments in the planned operational mode. Permission was obtained from PIs in the paee to put them in\nstandby so that the SAR tests could be performed.\nThe use of printed time lines and procedures varied considerably among the\nmembers of the ASSESS II payload flight crew. The HIs occasionaUyreferred\nto a timeline, but more frequently to the fUght path map and the science\nchart. The pISs seldom referred to a pl.anned timelines at all. \'rhey relied\non the ~I/Sfor such information. The most frequent questions were "what data\nleg are we coming onto\'?" and "how much time to the end of this data leg?".\nThe latter question was asked frequently by pIs 1 and pIs 3, both of whom\noperated computer controlled equipment. The use of printed equipment operating\nprocedures in flight varied from none at all by pIs 1 (SAR, HLS, and AEES) to\nextensive use for most operations by pIs 4 (tIllAR, C\'rH, and A\'~S). PIs 2\nused none for LAS, for which he was the 1)1, and only rarely for IHR. pIs 3\n(IRA) began the mission using procedures for most operations, but apparently\ninf1ight training negated the need well before the end of the mission.\n\n3.5.1.2.2\n\nt-lission Specialist Activities\n\nThe Nissioll Specialist had been aSSigned specific duties relative to\npayload operation when his position was established (section 2.405). His\nmajor responsibility, to act as the alter ego of the Hission ~fanaget as a\nmember of the payload flight crew, dictated that he be aware of the PIS\nactivities and provide assistance when needed. He maintained surveillance\nof the experiment support systems as well as the eXperill\\ent operations and\ncommunicated with the Nce and pace, to report on progress during flight.\nHe also kept the Hission Scientist fully informed regarding experiment status\nand problems. The pISs were extremely busy most of the time and appreciated\nthe communication load being handled by the Nls so they would not be interrupted un1eas a problem required their participation.\nThe Nls logged experiment and experiment support system status, coordinated with the pilots and navigator as flights progressed, announced the\nbeginning and end of each data leg and any deviations from plan for benefit of\nthe Nee/pace. The pISs also found it very beneficial to use his announcements\nto schedul<\'l their activities. This allowed them to concentrate on experiml~nt\noperatlolW without constant reference to flight progress. \\~hen problems developed, the N/S negotiated real-t1 nto Rolutions with inputs from the flight\ncrew, the pISs and the ground elements as required.\nIn some cases the N/s made minor flisht ulteration decisions based on\npayload activity requirements. For example, the tRA experiment automatically\ncarried out computer controlled raater scans of the target area. If a scan\nwas interrupted, the information it contained was considerably reduced in\nvalue because it could not be computer avet\'aged with other scans. To avoid\ninterruption by aircraft turns, PIs 3 almost invariably requested another two\nto four minutes on a data leg to complete his scatt. These requests were\ngranted by the WS without consuldng the paee i f it appeared thnt the\nremainder of the flight path would not be significantly altered.\n\n97\n\n3.5.1.2.3\n\nPayload\n\n~ecialist\n\nActivities\n\nThe pISs were each assigned specific responsibilities for experiment\noperation. The following gives some detail to illustrate how each pIs spent\nhis time. pIs 1, who handled SAR, AEES, and MLS, was able to remain at his\nSpacelab rack station much more consistently than the others. Even his extensive troubleshooting on SAR during the first fOlrr flights was on a component\nmounted in the Spacelab rack. pIs 1 was also much more driven by periodic\nduties than the others. The AEES experiment included four tape recQrders, one\nwi th a 24-miriu te tape dura tion and three With 48-minu te cycles. The pIs used\ntwo alarm bells, which he resut after each tape change, to remind himself that\na tape change was imminent. Only two activities normally took pIs 1 away from\nhis prime station; changing the sweep limits of the AEES swept. receivel:\' which\nwas infrequent, and the 24-minute AEES tape change cycle. Little commute time\nwas involved in the latter activity since the recorder was mounted close by.\nThe 48-minute tape change cycle did not take pIS I from his control position.\n\npIs 2 spent considerable time at the IHR experiment. The PI occasionally\nrequested that the mode of pollutant laser operation be shifted during flight.\nThis required 30 to 40 minutes of concentrated work. Also, numerous efforts\nwere made by the pIs to adjust operating parameters in an attempt to increase\nthe low IHR reference laser power. Fot LAS, poor performance of the experiment\nand consequent troubleshooting efforts by PIs 2 frequently took him away from\nhis central position. This was especially true on flights five through eight\nwhen he concentrated on resolution of the LAS problem. During these flights\nhe spent considerable time in the forward cargo area making optical adjustment~,\non the laser package, with pIs 1 relaying to him the results as indicated by a\nstripchart recorder at the LAS central control position.\nThe PIs 3 timeline (IRA) was oriented almost entirely around the IRA\nobservations of astronomical objects. In addition to the observations, he\nspent the balance of his tilne doinS either internal calibrations at the start\nof each flight or measuring sky brightness. His operating position was\ncentered among the several IRA racks of equipment and the"- telescope.\n\npIs 4 (AWS, eTM, and LIDAR) spent more time away from his control station\nthan any other PIs. Two major factors brought this about; the right viewing\nAWS TV camera had a pers:istent poor focus problem (eventually both cameras),\nand the eTM centralization of controls was not sufficient for full operation\nof the experiment from the centt\'al control position. For AWS, efforts to\ncorrect the focus had to be performed at the cameras, and he spent much t:l.me\nduring the early night flights working with the right viewing camera. Later,\nwhen both cameras started giving trouble, starting with flight six, he spent\nstill morR time at AWS. The experiment was turned off on flights eight and\nnine as planned which relieved the pIs workload. The eTN centralized controls\nallowed the pIs only to start and stop the linear mot:i,on mirror, the oscillating mirror, and the chopper wheel. Any other adjustments had to be made\nat the eTM rack, about 10 meters from the central control position. Also,\nwhile outputs of the lock-in amplifiers were displayed at the central position\n\n98\n\nI\nI\n\nnn\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\n\npre"\n\nfor quick-look information, the stt"ipc;hart recorder, wldeh required annotating\nif the record W3f.\' to be meaningful, \\o}[lS at the Cn! rack. Thus, especially\nduring datu legs of prime C\'.tN intel"Ost, the pIs tended to remain at the Cnt\nrack rather than travel frequently bl1tween it and his SIHlcelab rack station.\nThe 1.IDAR requit:l~d only occ\xc2\xa3181.ona1 vis.lts, except for the first flight when\nthe PIs was soci.ng real-data for thl\' first time and he spent some time at\nthe noncentrali~ed instrumentation to bo sure he had all controls set properly.\nEffectivenes~\'of Central Control!\n\nIt was il1lpract:.lcnl to mount all experiment controls in the Spacelab-like\nracks for ASSESS II. n,erefore l the major controls were centralized at the\ncrew posit:lons \\dtll ancillary equipmcmt and detectors located thrt)ughout the\ncabin area.

Two experiments were of very marginal\nsensitivity through most of the mission and, although one was finally improved\nsomewhat, the overall\'\\data return from both was very limited. A third could\nnot be made to operate satiefactorily within mission constraints, but was\nrestored to full capability at the sacrifice of its "Space lab" status. All\nother experiments yielded a substantial science return for the PIs.\n~mny df the experiment difficulties were apparent during the first flight\nperiod. Also, it became quickly evident that several, though not all, of the\noperational problems could have been avoided with better check-out before\nflight. When the Systems Level Integration team turned the payload over to\nthe Launch Site Integration team, they turned over 15 open items, but the\nsolutions to those items seemed straiiiltforward, and the payload was judged\nto be in good shape. Again following flight vehicle integration, all open\nitems had been closed and the experiments were determined to be flight ready.\nThe PIs had had complete access to their experiments for checkout. However,\nsome aspect of almost every experiment evidenced less than optimum operation\nalmost immediately after launch.\n\nOf the experiment malfunctions which were related to insufficient preflight testing, perhaps the most serious was with SAR, where the two prime\nexperiment data recorders would not function simultaneously with a consequence\nof no initial recorded data return. Repeated efforts by the Pis, with remote\nassistance from the PI in the poce, failed to locate the difficulty. Only\nafter a decision following flight four to declare the experiment a failure by\nSpace lab standards, and a member of the PI staff was allowed to go aboard, was\nit found that the recorders were improperly powered from two dc power sources\nwhich opposed each other. The fix was simple, but it was determined that preflight checkout had failed to operate both recorders simultaneously as planned\nfor flight, and the malfunction was missed.\nThe SAR recorder problem illustrated the need in the Flight Data File for\nsome insight within the experiments for purposes of troubleshooting. As stated\nearlier, it is the intention in the Spacelab era tQ leave responsibility for\nexperiment operation in the domain of the PI. Accordingly, ASSESS II mission\nmanagement did not request any information within experiments except for safety.\nMuch time was spent by the payload crew during the flight mission trying to\nidentify the SAR recorder problem in the flight vehicle electrical systems.\nWith only a general electrical schematic of the experiment, the problem within\nthe experiment might well have been quickly identified and fixed.\nIn the case of LIDAR, the pis attempted (after flight one) to charge b~"t\xc2\xad\nteries while the instrument was turned on, which blew a fuse. The routine tor\ndaily battery charging was included in the pis timeline, but was not exercised\n, during preflight checkout. All data from flight two was lost, after which the\nsource of the problem was identified and fixed.\n\n100\n\nc\n\nFor IRA an optics alignment problem became apparent during the first\nflight period and hampered experiment performance throughout the mission.\nDuring Systems Level Integration a test device was utilized to check the optics\nalignment, but somehow during flight vehicle integration the alignment apparently shifted. The ground based alignment system had been constructed for\nlaboratory use and could not be utilized on the flight vehicle. While thf\'s\nproblem can nominally be charged to lack of preflight testing, the omission\nof flight vehicle alignment was deliberately planned. Provision for a flight\nvehicle altgnment device was not practical for ASSESS II, and previous similar instlr.l1ation experience had demonstrated that it was n~"1t needed. How the\nchange of alignment occurred in this case ;;"as not determined.\nSome additional difficulties showed up during the first flight which were\nassociated with the flight environment llnd ctn:.lld not have been easily addressed\nduring pref1igllt testing. In the case of AEES, static electricity built up\nand periodically discharged from the antenna mounting plate producing noise\ninterference on the signal channel. Grounding of the plate had not been specified for the installation and air seals around the plate isolated it. \\V\'hi1e\nthe net result on data return did not turn out to be serious, the pIS spent\ninordinate time during the mission trying to identify and solve the problem\nwhich was suspected to be w~thin the instrument syst~m.. The simple cause\nof the difficulty was discovered following the Space1ab simulation program.\nThe ~ILS expedenced a basic sensitivity problem on the first and all\nsucceeding flights. The experiment had been well automated, compared to\nits pre-ASSESS configuration, to reduce pIs workload. These changes apparently had an adverse effect on sensitivity that was nQt observ(>d during\ntests at the home laboratory, and it was not planned to repeat these tests\nat ARC. \\V\'hen the problem surfaced for the first time in flight, it was\nrecognized as serious, but the PI was not able to devise a work-around\nthat could be implemented by the pIs during the mbsion. After the mission\nthe PI was able to improve the sensitivity of the instrument by using a more\ncomplex manual mode of operation.\nFor LAS, early flight experience revealed that no laser signal was being\nreflected from the ground; a prerequisite for proper j~xperiment operation.\nAircraft motion, or a means to simulate it, was necessary to discover this\nproblem. The pIs (who was also the PI for this experiment) made many adjustments throughout the flight period and was finally able to get some return\nsignal, but the result was never as satisfactory as desired.\nIn the case Q,f AWS, difficulty W,QS experienced illm~illtaining focus on\nthe IR cameras. Although they could be focused on the\\ground, one of the\ntwo cameras in particular, lost focus during flight. Despite considerable\ninflight effort to improve the focus, the rls had only limited success.\nSince the ~ameras could be used only at night, at low ambi.ent light levels,\nthere were few opportunities to address the problem on the ground during the\nfirst half of the mission.\n\n1i.\'.\'\n\nIn general, the pIss did an excellent job in performing the routine experi\xc2\xb7ment operations work, interspersed with concentrated periods of troubleshooting.\nThe pISs, as well as the N/S, a,greed that adjustment to the flight environment\nand the routine of operations required about three days. This is a high percentage of a mission period lasting only ten days. Unfortunately, t,he onslaught of\nop~rational problems showed up immediately after launch during initial experiment operations, based on ASSESS experience, and this is the period when the\nflight crew is the least acclimated and pr.epared to address dl,fficulties.\nThis same limitation will certainly apply to Spacelab, and probably te:!a greater\ndegree with the added requirement for adjustment to z.ero-g.\n\n3.5.1.4\n\nOnboard Data Handling\n\nl\n\nI\n[\n\nf\n\nThe experimenters for ASSESS II had three choices in handling their data.\nThey could provide for data processing wholly within their own experiment, they\ncould interface with the central data system (AnDAS) which had significant\nstorage and processing capacity, or they could use the CV-990 central data\nsystem in addition to their own systems. There were certain advantages in\nusing the ~entral data system because it interfaced with the aircraft systems to\nobtain ho~s~keeping data such as airspeed, altitude, latitude, longitude,\nambient temperature, etc. All experiments require certain of the housekeeping\ndata for their data calculations, and interacting in real-time with the central\nsystem for this purpose ,.ras much more convenient than picking up that data\nin printed form after the flight mission for subsequent data processing.\nAnother key value in using the central data system during ASSESS II was for\nquick-look by the PI in the POCC as the flight mission progressed. A ground\nrule of the ASSESS II mission permitted transmittal of basic data from the\ncentral data system to the POGG and a ground-based computer on a daily basis\nto simulate downlink of data from the, Spacelab. However, a disadvanta~"",~n\n[\nusing central data system was the necessity to establi"sh a proper \'ii1b~rfacet"""""""\'\'\'\'\'\'\'\'\'\'\'\'\'\'\'\xc2\xb7\'\'i\nbetween the central system and the experiment.\n\n[\n\n\xc2\xa3\n\n, ",\n\nWith the advent of minicomputers, there appears to be a tendency to build\ncomputer capacity into specific experiments. Although this increases exper1ment cost, it gives the PI more complete control of his own data handling, and\nthe total data system can, theoretically, be perfected in the PI laboratory as\nthe instrument is developed for flight, thus eliminating one of the most\ndifficult and complex interfaces during integration. The use of an internal\nexperiment data processor still leaves the experimenter an option to pass\neither all of his data, or representative data, to the central system for\nstorage and possible quick-look opportunity. Storage of data in both the\nexperiment: and the central data system to increase confidence of success has\nbeen a growing practice with other GV-990 PIs.\n\nI\nI\n\nTable 14 outlines the method of data handling used by each ASSESS II\nexperiment and some indication of difficulties encountered. ESA/SPICE specifically encouraged the European eJo.."Perimenters to use the central data system\nto gain experience both for ESA and the experimenters. Thus, although LIDAR\nand the NED experiments both had internal experiment tape recorders, they\ninterfaced with the central data system. The AivS camera outputs \'.rere recorded\non video tape within the experiment.\n\nI\nI\n\n~~:~\n\n-------\n\n__"\'"\n\n102\n\n1\n\nt\n\nI~,\n\nTabl~\n\nr\n\n14 -\n\nData~Handling\n\nand Recording }lethdds\n\n,\n\n,\n\nExperiment\n\nCentral Dat,<:; SyHe[lj\n\nPI Supplied\nExpet:imeht Data\n\nlRA/Heudon\n\nlRA/Groningen\n\nVideo magnetic tape,\ndigital magnetic tape,\nand minicomputer.\nCassette magnetic tape.\n\n_i\n\n-\n\n\'0\n\nData Display\n\nHousekeeping Data\n\ni-later vapor overblfrden on CCTV,\n..\nand line printer. -..\nI.\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n.\'\n\n--\n\ni\n\ni.....--- \\\n\n\\\\\n\n-\n\nlRA/l-fax Planck\n\n1 channel,\n\n7 channels,\nanalog\n\nana~.og\n\nI\nl\n\nA\\olS\n\nIntegrated video\nmagnetic tape for two\ncameras sequentially.\n\nw\n\nLIDAR\n\n9 channel digital\n\nt\n\nMED\n\no\n\n......,Digital\n\nAverage spec:tra\ncopy.\n\n-\n\n,.\n\n-\n\nCCTV and hard\n\n...\n\nAerosol spatial distribution,\nnumerical array on hard copy.\n\nmagnetic tape .\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n[\n\n~n\n\n-\n\n.~{\n\n\'>\'--:""17:\'\n\n4 channels,\nanalog\n\n2 data to housekeeping ch~qnels,\nCCTV, and line printer.\n\n7 channels,\n\nanalog\n\n... ..\n",."\n\n8 channels\nanalog,\n1 digital\n\nDigital\n\n4 analog cassette\ntapes (one each PiS),\n4 channels each.\n\nFourier tra!?sforms on hard copy.\nStabilized mirror position on\nCCTV.\n\n3 channels,\nao.::log\n\nHousekeeping signals on CCTV\nand line printer.\n\n\'<~:,; ..\'~;\n\nSAR\n\n0\n\n-\n\n2 film recorders 4 channels total.\n"\n\nt1LS\n\n15 channel digital\n\nDigital\n\ncassette t~pe and\nmipi(!omputer.\n\n-\n\n1 channel,\nanalog\n..\n\n~\n\n~\n\nr"\'I\n\nLAS\n\n-\n\n2 channels,\n\nanalog\n\n2 channels,\nanalog\n\nOzene concentr2.tion on CCTV and\'\n/.;c "-=r=_l.j,ne printer.\nII\'\n\n~\n\n~\nt:\n~\n\nTable 14 concluded\n\nLXperiment\n\nCentral Data System\n\nPI Supplied\nExperiment Data\n\nIRR\n\nAEES\n\n.....\no\n\n~\n\n-\n\n\',,<\n\n-\n\nDigital magnetic tape\nand 3 analog caspette\ntapes.\n\nDigital\n\nHou~ekeeping\n\nData\n\nData Display\n\n4 channels,\n\nSun azimuth and eIevation,\nmirror position on CCTV and\nline printer.\n\n-\n\n-\n\n(\'-\n\n\\)\n-!--\n\ni\n\n.1\n\n~J\n\n\'rhe infrarcd telescope systmll (IRA) .,.!:",<;\\d a complex itlter3ctioh be.tweeh\nsclf-rontaine.dequ:I.pmcnt and the ce.t\\tral\xc2\xab~:\';\\ra system.

It was organized and\noperated by MSFC in a manner similar to their plans for Space1ab 1. They\nstaffed the POCC with a Payload Operations Director, a Payload Activity Planner, and an Operations Coordinator, along with the Mission Scientist and each\nPI or his representative from each experiment. Voice communications were\nprovided to maintain contact among all elements of the POCC, with the payload\ncrew, and the MCC throughout the flight mission.\nA video downlink and a text uplink similar to the system planned for\nearly Spacelab flights were also available to the POCC and were operated by\nthe MCC. In the POCC, the Mission Scientist coordinated PI science requirements and science communications wit.hPOCC management and the payload flight\ncrew.\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\nI\n\nPOCC operations consisted of:\nUpdated payload planning on a daily basis;\nBriefing of the payload crew for each day\'s activities;\nCommunications with the payload crew to address problem areas\nand coordinate decisions;\nDaily payload crew debriefing;\nQuick--look scientific data analysis by the PIs.\nThe floor plan of the POCC operational areas is shown in figure 19.\nAdditional space in a contiguous area included a conference room, a data room,\nand a large office area for the PIs.\nOrganization and management for the POCC is shown in figure 20. General\nsupervision of the POCC operation ,,,as provided by the Payload Operations\nDirector (POD). This position was manned on a 24-hour basis by two MSFC\npersonnel. The POD, in addition to overseeing the POCC staff, was the principal channel for communication with the Mission Control Center (MCC). The\nPOD maintained a log of his activities and of all communications.\nThe Ope,rations Coordinator was the primary communicator between the POCC\nand the payload flight crew. Thus, it was important that the Operations\nCoordinator be intimately familiar with the payloads. For ASSESS II, the ESA\nand NASA backup pISs were assigned to this pOBition on a r.otating basis. A\ndetailed log of communications was maintained by the Operation$ Coordinator,\nsomewhat duplicating that maintained by the POD. Two of the ESA backup piSs\nwere nonnative speakers of English, and they had considerable difficulty,\nparticularly because of the poor quality of the radio communications link to\nthe aircraft. As a result, the POD assisted in handling much of the communication with the aircraft during flight.\n\n[\n[\n\n[:,\n"\n\n~\n\nI\n...\n\n106\n\n[\n\nI\n\nI\nNASAIESA\nPROGRAM\nMANAGERS\n\n~\n\no\no\nz\n\n~\n\n~(]\n8 (]\n\n~G\n\nPB\n\nos\n\na\nG\n\n~\n\no\nc\nz\n\n.~\n\no\no\nz\n\n~\n\n~\n\nTVCTVD\nVISITORS\nVIEWING\nROOM\nLEGEND:\n\nFigure 19.\n\n\\\n\nTVC\nTVD\n\nSCIENCE\nOPERATIONS\nROOM\n\nPAYLOAD\nOPERATIONS\nROOM\n\nMISSION MANAGER\nPAYLOAD OPERATIONS DIRECTOR\nOPERATIONS COORDINATOR\nDC\nPAYLOAD ACTIVITIES PLANNER\nPAP\nDATA COMMUNICATIONS SPECIALIST\nDCS\nMSNSC MISSION SCIENTIST\nPRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS\nPis\n\nMM\nPOD\n\nPB\n\nCB\n\nCB\n\nCHALKBOARD\n\nPB\n\nPLOT BOARD\n\nTVC\n\nTV DIGITAL TIME MONITOR\n\nTVO\n\nDOWNLINK TV MONITOR\n\nOS\n\nOVERHEAD SPEAKER\n\nPayload Operations Control Center Layout\n\n00\n\n~e\n\n"C~\n\n~e:\n\n~~\n\n~~\n_fa\n\nI\nPAYLOAD\nOPERATIONS\nDIRECTOR\n\n~- -\n\n-\n\nMISSION\nSCIENTIST\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n- .

The position was\nmanned by two MSFC personnel nearly 24 hours a day. As described in section\n3.5.1.1, preliminary flight plans were prepared in advance of the total mission.\nHowever, for each data period both updated weather information and updated\nscience priorities were used to prepare a final daily flight plan. Figure 21\ndetails the various steps and timing in the work of the Payload Activity\nPlanners.\nThe position of Data t-tanagement Coordinator was handled by one\nspecialist supplied by ARC. He prepared and managed a schedule for\nground based data handling and computation devices by the PIs after\ndown linked data following each flight. He was also responsible for\nand retention of all down linked data for ultimate use by the PIs.\n\ndata\nuse of\nreceipt of\ncollection\n\nThe position of Data Communication Specialist (DCS) was not manned during\nthe simulation period to the extent planned. The DCS had been expected to\nhandle the recorder for air/ground cow~unications but this task was not justified during much of the flight period because of the air/ground link difficulty. Except fo~ the handling and logging of data following each flight,\nthere was little for this staff mombcr to do.\nThe. NASA and ESA Mission Scientists rotated assignment in the POCC. The\nMission Scientist acted as the primary liaison between the PIs and the POCC\npayload managment and activity planning staff. During daily briefings and debriefings with the payload flight crew, the Mission Scientist was in charge of\nscheduled PI discussions with his counterpart pIs, and insured full uttderstanding of total flight objectives. He coordinated science priorities with\nthe PIs arid established the list of pri.orities published by the POCC for each\ndata-take period. Most of the planning activity took place during non-data-take\nperiods. After each data-take period the NASA assistant Mission Scientist\nprepared a ahort science summary of the results attained by each experiment.\nThe PIs participated in POCC planning activities by providing, through\nthe Mission Scientist, their requests for priorities and changes in operations\nplans. It had been planned that a member of each PI team would be in the POCC\nduring the entire data-take period to track experiment operation and be available for problem consultation. However, this plan was negated due to the poor\nradio communication link, and it was agreed only that each PI or his representative need be quickly available if required. A representative of each experiment was present in the POCC for daily flight debriefing, and during these\nperiods usually the PI would personally discllss his experiment with the cognizant pIs to the maximum extent that scheduled time would permit.\nA position was provided in the POCC for the t-tission Manager. It was\npurposely planned that he woul.d have no direct operational responsibility so\nthat he could maintain an overview and carryon discussions with the variolls\noperations personnel that led to decisions to be implemented by the POCC staff.\nLikewise space was provided in the poce for the NASA and ESA Program Managers\nfor observation and immediate consultation in case of a majqr mission problem.\n\nT+8hrs\n-.--.\n\nI PAYLOAD\n\n1\n\n......... - -\n\n----,\n\nI}.

Xt was located\nadjacent to, but separate from the POCC. Three JSC personnel staffed the MCC\nwhile ARC provided support to JSC in direct management of CV-990 flight operaions. The HCC was not closely analogous to Spacelab plans for an Mec because\norbiter operations will be significantly different from eV-990 operations.\nHowever, an MCe was included in the ASSESS II project to complete organizational\ninteractions and gain interactive experience with the Mission Management concept\nfor payload operations. It was manned 17 hours per day with no coverage\nprovided during the payload crew sleep period.\nActivities performed by the HCC in its abbreviated version included the\nfollowing:\nAircraft flight plan development;\nUpdating of Integrated Crew Activity PlaD fOl~ each flight;\nApproval of flight passenger manifest;\nHanagement and coordination of overall mission timeline;\nInterfacing with flight vehicle ground crew;\nCoordination of food service for payload crew;\nTransmission of uplink messages;\nReceipt and distribution of downlinked data materials;\nParticipating in briefing and debriefing of payload crew.\n\n3.5.2.3\n\nQuick-Look Data Assessment\n\nDuring the data-take periods, activity in the POCC was relatively quiet\ndue mainly to the communications problem between ground and the aircraft in\nflight. Upon landing, ground communications links were established and the\npostflight debriefing began with each experimenter allotted ten minutes for\ndiscussion with the payload crew about results from his experiment. This activity was under close supervision of the Mission Scientist in order to complete\nscheduled discussions Within the timeline.\nDuring postflight debriefing other simultaneous activity was occurring\nto downlink data. The AWS video signal ,.,as downlinke.d for PI perusal as a\nslow frame-rate Signal which required less than an hom: for the total flight\n; ilrecord. A video monitor was used for this purpose. (The A\\.JS equipment could\nalso be used to transmit the Neudon video record, but no operational situation\narose that made this necessary.) Simultaneous with the AWS video transmission,\ntelemetry of data was simulated by phYRic.al removal f..rom the aircraft of many\ndata records as follows: centr;tl data system magnetic tape, memory disc., and\nhouskeeping printout; AEES cassette, reel tapes, and .3:. stripchart; SAR film;\nMLS cassette tapes and stripcharts; mll digital data t;:\'hpe; Groningen ca.ssette\ntapes; CTM otripchart; and lRA/Neudon data tape and *lrd copy record. IRA/\nMeudon video taper, and medical tapes were stored ouboard until the end of the\nmission.\nA compu ta tion facili ty was provided for th~; use by the PIs for limi ted\ndata processing of quick-look flight data. Thi~ facility included a basic\ncomputer capability quite similar to the central di:ita system computer onboard\nthe aircraft, two interactive video computer terminals, and a hard copy printout unit for each computer terminal.\n\n...........\n"\'.........,...\nam.-..\n--------.-.---------~----,---------.\n2311\n\n~\n\n\xc2\xab\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSf\n\n11~\n\n~=o:::::!\n\n_ _~_.a.._\n\n_____ ,. ____\n\n.~. _ _ _ _ _ \xe2\x80\xa2\n\nInunediately following the end of a daily flight, ~ach PI submitted a\nrequest for specific data that he wished to examine fQr quick-look assessment.\nThese data requests, in terms of data-slice time, were processed by computer\npersonnel, who created a disc file for each flight, containing only the requested data slices. Construction of the quick-look disc file took place during\nthe postflight debriefing, and was finished about the end of the debriefing\nperiod. This new file was then accessed by the PIs for examination of their data\nusing the two video terminals located in the data analysis area adjacent to the\nPOCC.\n~lile the special disc files were being constructed, both MLS and IHR\nwere reading out data directly from a storage disc recorded in flight.\none on each POCC data termi~lal. MLS received numerical printouts of data at\none-minute intervals from wtlich a simple plot could be made. For IHR, the\ncomputer developed plots of/anyone of ten parameters selected by the\'PI.\n\nThe t<tedical experiment: obtained a limited one-minute interval printout\nof pIs body temperatures and heart rates primarily as a check on the operation\nof their experiment equipment.\nIRA/NPI obtained a numerical printout of signal strength from which to\nselect complete scans of interest. Sonle selected data scans were plotted by\nthe computer after a c.ompJex averaging process to smooth the data. The result\nwas a group of points representing average signal strength at several wavelengths measured by the NPl tilting filter spectrometer.\n\'l\'he LIDAR presentation calculated by the computer was a matrix of numbers\nrepresenting signal strength as a fUnction of time. In addition, plots were\ncalculated and presented on the video terminal.\nLAS obtained a numerical presentation of data for inspection, from which\n\nPlotso:::et~:d:p::i:~V:i::p:;::e::c:::a::::~:b~:,aO:~n::i::eO:o:~:::r\n\nterminals\nHI\nwas used exclusively by cnl. Their program permitted examination of the operation of the lock-in amplifier by recreation of a st\'t\'ipchart record, tabulation\nr:l,\',\'f\nof numerical data, and development of interferograms following a fast Fourier\ntil\ntransformation of the raw data. The bulk of the time was used in calculation\nand examination of interferograms, each of which took a minute or more to be\nIi,-,\ncalculatp.d and d:l splayed on the terminal. \'fhose that appeared satisfactory with- I:l\nout excessive noise were preserved for later analysis by making hard copies.\nThe Groningen PIon the IRA had his own equipment for examinatiou of his\nsignal tapes and stripchart records. SAR did not inspect their experiment out.,.\nputs in the POCC, but rather sent their records directly to JPL for processing.\nThe quick-look data processing and examination in the POCCworked out\nvery well.\xc2\xb7 The PIs were very pleased with the arrangement. Of course, data\nexamination was of a preliminary nature for the primary purpose of checking\nequipment operation and for consideration of change du~ing the next data-take\nperiod. Further examination of the data was left for attention at the PIs\'\nhome laboratories.\n\nm\n11\n112\n\nm\n\n3.6\n\nDocumentation\n\nA special objective of the ASSESS II mission was to simplify procedures\nand minimize the amount of paper work necessary to accomplish thJ mission,\nconsistent with plans for Space1ab. \'fhree aspects of ASSESS II management\nhad a strong influence on docum~ntation planning: 1) the centering of\npayload responsiblity in the Mission l>lanager, 2) full PI responsibility to\ndevelop good and reliable experiments, and 3) direct participation by both\nPIs and pISs in payload integration. These management features were the base\npotential for a low-level system of formal documentation, with fuce-to-face\ndiscussions and direct support of the best qualified personnel in place of\ndetailed procedures and hardware verification required of the PI.\nThese considerations led to significant discussions in the Mission Steering Group, and a Baseline Documentation and Information Fl.ow for ASSESS II\nwas issued by the MSG about 10 months before flight. That documentation plan,\nshown in figure 22, represented an early viewpoint of optimistic desire for\na very few documents to implement the mission. The plan was followed in a\ngeneral sense, but many j.ndividual documents were prepared and issued. Little\ndocumentation planning and control was pursued by mission management, even\nthough the documentation issue ~as a special objective of the mission.\nASSESS II addressed only the docume1htation requirements necessary to\nintegrate and operate the payload. There was no intent, to evaluate flight\nvehir.le documentation analogous to the orbiter system, except as it would\npertain to interfaces with the pay;J.oad components or their operation.\nDocument Classification\n\n3.6.1\n\nThe actual documents issued by the various participants and used in the\nmission are listed in table 15. Top level interagency agreements between\nNASA and ESA Headquarters are not included. Also, ESA documentation used\nfor ESA payload integration and checkout in Europe is not included. The\ndocumentation is divided into three classes as .follm\\ls:\nCLASS A Reference Documents - not mission unique\nCLASS B Payload Interfacing Documents -\n\nmission unique\n\nCLASS C I.nterna1 Working Documents\nMuC\'h discussion about documentation took place in management echelons of\nNASA as the ASSESS 1I miss~.on progressed. Referring to the three classes of\ndocuments listed above, little concern existe.d for CLASS A documents, which\nfor Spacelab will be issued as handbook-type do~uments and \'wi11 not constitute\nnew documents for each mission. Also, there was little concern for CLASS C\ndocuments, which are internal working documents and do not materially affect\nother organizations. \'fhe CLASS n interfucing documents were of prime interest,\nbecause they are the type which can create extensive requirements on other\norganizations and compollnd cost.\n\n\' ...\n\n,Fl\n\n......\n\nEW\n\nt nut\n\n*\n\n/;I\n\nI\n~\n\n\',I\n\nI\nI\n\nMSFC\n(MISSION MANAGER)\n\nt\n\nI\n\nSTS\n\nI\nI\n\nPAYLOAD\n\nGROUND\nOPS\nREQTS\n\nPis\nINVESTIGATOR\nREQUIREMENTS\nDOCUMENT\n(lRD)\n\n-- ..\n-\n\n-\n\nINTEGRATED\nPAYLOAD\nDESCRIPTION\n(lPD)\n\nFLIGHT\nOPS\nREQTS\n\nFLIGHT\nSUPPORT\nREQTS\n\nf\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\n-.\n\n\xc2\xb7..\n\n-- I\n\nI\nI\nI\n- I\n\n\xc2\xb7\n.\nI ..\n\n-I\n-\n\nGROUND\nOPS\nPLAN\n\nI--\n\nJSC\n\nJSC\n\n-- .\nI\nI\nI\n\nKSC\n\n-\n\n\xc2\xb7 ..i\n\nFLIGHT\nOPS\nPLAN\n\nLa.\n\nJSC\nFLIGHT\nSUPPORT\nPLAN\n\nMIP APPROVAL\n\'e ASSESS II PROG.

KSC issued a Launch Site Implementation Plan in t~vQ parts. Part A ~vns\nhandbook type information describing procedures by \'vhich they proposed to\nhandle launch site acthrities. (Part B, found under CLASS B documents, described plans for the tipecific payload at hand.) The POCC Requirements document listed under CLASS A W\'as the NSFC pnylcad Nission }tanager\'s general\nrequirements for a more or less standardized POCC facility which w\'ould serve\nall payload missions. The poce Operations Implementation Procedures and the\nrocc Operations Handbook \\vere both one time type issuances and could have been\ncombined.\n\n3.6.2.2\nProbably th~ most basic interface documer.ts for the ASSESS II mission\nwere the Investigator Requirements Documents (IRDs) issued by the }Kssion\nHanager to each PI in questionnaire f0rmat \\dth space provided for each\nnns~ver.\nOne IRD \'(.;oas prepared for e\'h\'h experiment, and they are discussed at\nl~ngth in section 3.3.1.\nThe objective to create only t,,\'\\e interfacing document bJat\\veen management and the. expe.rimente.r a.ppears to have been desirable\nand valid. Significant progress ,vas made during ASSESS II in developing a\nfOl\'lUat for the IRDs, but it qui(~kly became apparent that :::\'uc 1, improvement is\nrequired in the format to eliminate redundancy and clarify the questions. The\nlRDs \\Vere \'vell accepted by the e;:...-per.iml\'mte.rs, after tbe initial shock for some\nas to the numbe~ of requirements and int(lrfaces ,vhich ,vere ::.mportant to specify,\nand h;:ld to be addressed st.")oner or later. It should be. noted that the IRD did\nnot go into details internal to thl" experiment; the. st~le,~ti.on and use of components (except for safety features) ,vas a rx de.ci$il1n. Oper~tional reliability\n,vus his responsibili ty and no justification or analysis ~vas required.\nUnfortunately, the IRDs did not get a full trial during ASSESS II. The\ntwo specific attempts to establish IRD information, ,,,!lich \'tJ~\'l:\'e several months\napart, resulted in t\\vO separate IRDs ,dth sottle difference in format and they\nware not consolidated. ThE\' IRD effort \\Vas terminated after the second analytical integration. }Kssion management filled out the IRDs in most cases, based\non discussions ,.;oith ~;:"\'\'\'Perimenters, but the completed documents ,,,ere not fed\nback to all experimenters for concurrance until much later.\nAs plans for e;:...~eriment integration developed, it ~"as generally recognized\nthat the IRDs should have been continually \\tpdated to be fully useful, but it\nwas.too late to recover that effort, and the nal::\\nce of interface information\nwhich became available during the las t five months before launch ,vas 1-)andled\non an fld hoc basis.\n\nIn addition to the actual IRD documents, the PIs submitted appropriate\ndrawings and sketches of their equipment to identify physical interfacing\ndetails. Stress analyses were also submitte~ to satisfy safety requirements\nstated in the CV-990 Experimenters\' Handbook. These drqwings and stress\nanalyses were really adjuncts to the individual IRDs for each of the experiments.\nThe Mission Implementation Plan (MIP) document, developed from the MSG\nproposal shown in figure 22, was intended to be a synopsis of the activities\nplanned by all participants to carry out the ASSESS II mission. Its original\npurpose was to provide a single concise source of information for PIs and\nupper management regarding general conduct of the overall mission. Questions\narose as to whether such a document should be prepared by the Mission Manager\nor the STS organization which would implement flight operations. For ASSESS\nII, the NASA Program Manager assigned responaibility for the MIP to JSC. The\ndocument summarized the objectives of the mission and responsibilities of the\nvarious participating organizations, but did not serve the purpose originally\nintended.\n\nQ\n[]\n\nThe Payload Mission Rules were issued by the Mission Manager to spell\nout the rules for the specific mission. These rules would generally be mission\ndependent based on the type of payload to be flown. In the case of Spacelab,\nthe payload might consist of pallet only, a combination of pressurized modules\nplus pallet, or other payload arrangements.\nMission. management used the IRD information as the base for several payload requirekents documents covering different facets of the mission. Following the plan of figure 22, these were intended to relay to support groups the\ninformation necessary to develop operating plans. These were the following:\n\nrr\n\nLJ\n\nPayload Level IV and Launch Site Ground Operations Requirements\nDocument;\nPayload Flight Definition Requirements Document;\nData Requirements Document;\nPayload Operator Requirements and Preliminary Training Plan.\nThe Payload Level IV and Launch Site Ground Requirements Document issued\nby MSFC was really a two-in-one document, and probably should have been split.\nThe requirt:ments to .handle Level IV integration and launch site integration\nwere unique in many respects, and were implemented by different organizations,\nso that even though some requirements may have been the same, two separate\ndocuments would seem to have been justified.\nThe five individu,sl documents listed immediately under the Payload Level\nIV and Launch Site Ground Requirements Document should have been included in\nthe basic documents just discussed instead of being issued separately, since\nthey were part of the requirements for }evel IV Integration and/or launch site\npayload processing. The first three were drawings and sketches that were\ntransmitted to KSC by letter, but since they constituted important launch site\nrequirements from the payload manager, and never showed up in any\\~ther way,\nthey have been identified as separate ASSESS II documents.\n\no\nfl.;\nu\n\no\n\n;(\n\n118\n\nD\n\n=\n\ntWTTT55T?\n\n5\n\nFErRarO ."".?WH3\'P-?FW\n\n. FE\n\nSupport groups then issued responding documents to the mission requirements in their areas of responsibility. These were the following:\nLevel IV Integration Implementation Document;\nLaunch Site Integration Implementation Plan (Part B);\nIntegrated Summary Cre,\\\' Activity Plan;\nDetailed Payload Crew Activity Plans;\nIntegrated ~tlssion Simulation Plan;\nCV-990 Daily Flight Plans;\nPayload Specialists Training Implementation Document.\nThe Level IV Integration Implementation Document was the ~lSFC operating\ndocument, to accomplish Level IV integration and testing, while Launch Site\nIntegration Implementation Plan (Part B) was KSC\'s implementation plan. The\nKSC Operation and Maintenance Instruction, sho,m on table 15, was really part\nof their implementation plan, and could just as well have been included in\nthe basic document.\nThe balance of the CLASS B documents are generally self-explanatory by\nthe titles. ~fSFC issued the Payload Specialists training implementation documents. JSC issued the document for the all-up Integrated Mission Simulation\n"\'-ast that occurrred just prior to flight, and an Integrated Summary Crew\nActivity Plan which for Spacelab will integrate flight crew activities with\npayload crew operations for the overall flight mission. All of the CV-990\nDaily Flight Plans together would be analogous to a single ov~rall mission\nflight plan issued by JSC for Spacelab.\n\n3.6.2.3\n\nInterna~\n\nWorking Documents (CLASS C)\n\nThe CLASS C documents are shown in table 15 for completenesso All of\nthese documents have been discussed previously in the implementation section\nof this report. They represent essentially internal documentation used by\nMSFC, KSC, and JSC to handle and track their own operational responsibilities.\nOnly in a few cases, such as in the development of Test Procedures for use\nduring integration, were the PIs significantly impacted by the CLASS C documentation.\n3.6.3\n\nEvalue,tion of Documentation\n\nThe documentation used for ASSESS II was basic to the entire mission\nand has been discussed throughout the implementation section of this report.\nEvaluation of documentation used during ASSESS II is complicated by several\nfacts which became evident as the mission progressed. Lack of management\ncontrol resulted in multiple documents, late issues, and changes of title.\nConsiderable effort was expended where not justified, while areas in need of\nattention were neglected; the pis training was over documented, IRD records\nwere deficiento But it should be recognized that ASSESS II was a realistic\n\natii\n\nI\ni\'liarning experience, not an exercise of proven methods. Accot\'dingly, the\nfollowing summary observations give pe~spective to tIle documentation effort.\n1.\n\nInsufficient management attention was exercised over documentation\nidentification, content, and schedule of issuance.\n\n2.\n\nBaseline documentation plan (figure 22) served to guide information\nflow, even though little if any overt action was taken to develop\nthe base plan.\n\n3.\n\nIRD concept was implemented sufficiently to prove its validity,\nbut not enough to show its f\\l11 potential.\n\n4.\n\nIntegrated Payload Description (IPD) of figure 22 was not: realized\nas a s1ngle document with feedback to the PIs. Rather. the several\nrequirements documents from the Nission Nan8ser were developed from\nthe IRD data, base as elements of an IPl).\n\nCertainly, ASSESS II was somewhat simpler than Spacelab is expected to be,\nbut the basic approach to payload development exercised is believed valid in\nthe larger context, so that the corresponding documentat:l,on pattern need not\nbe appreciably expanded.\n\nI\nI\nI\n\n4.\n\n4.1\n\nASSESS II CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SPACELAB\n\nMission Summary\n\nThe ASSESS II mission was a successful simulation of a total Spacelab\nmission. Management interfaces to be involved in Spacelab were deeply exercised among experimenters and the ESA and NASA organizations. The Mission\nManager concept for Spacelab is new, and, even though the early Spacelabs are\nproceeding under the Mission Manager concept the ASSESS II project was\nthe first significant experi~nce in exercising this concept throughout an\nentire Spacelab-like mission with active Spacelab organization participants.\nInternational aspects of ASSESS II added special reality. The spectrum of\nactivities for experimenters, including experiment development, payload\nintegration, flight operation, data retrieval, and active participation with\nan operating POCC and MCC was a realistic. representation of similar activities\nto be experienced in Spacelnb operations. A Mission Specialist and Payload\nSpecialists were selected and trained, and perforMed well in flight.\nAs in any simulation, the exercise was imperfect, with some deviations\nfrom Spacelab planned activities. Aircraft system constraints and funding\nlimitations, particularly in the U.S., limited fidelity of the simulation\nin some areas, and the very tight project schedule, coupled with limited\nmanpower resources, forced some preliminary work to be done in parallel and\nseriously delayed some activities. Use of an airborne laboratory instead of\na space vehicle reduced the cost of the project to a fraction of Space1ab\ncosts so that the economic driver, even though it was significant for ASSESS\nII, was small compared to Spacelab. The overall resultant "fishbowl" effect\nof reaction to mistakes or severe problems was minimum. Also, the airborne\npayload involved a smaller number of experiments than planned for Spacelab 1,\nalthough the amount of equipment was comparable in volume. Payload preparation and flight were fully realistic. Safety was Mandatory. Mechanical,\nelectrical, and data interfaces all had to be fully addressed. Participation\nof scientists with intense efforts to obtain meaningful data was complete, and\nthe schedule was held rigid so that events could not be easily shifted. The\nentire exercise was regarded by all participants as excellent and valuable\ntraining for future Spacelab operations.\nFollowing are specific conclusions derived from the ASSESS II mission\nwhich are considered pertinent for Spacelab planning along with a synoptic\ndiscussion of each conclusion.\n\nu\n4.2\n4.2.1\n(a)\n\nPayload Selection and Funding\nPayload Selection\n\nCompatibility of payload scientific discipline requirements simplifies\npayload planning and mission implementation.\nFor ASSESS II the experiments chosen for the payload established requirements for IR astronomy, solar viewing, upper atmospheric measurements, and\nearth viewing which included some very specifically identified overflight\ntargets. This immediately led to requirements for both day and night flights.\nWith this mi\'X of e\'Xperiment objectives, there was no poss:i.bility of accommodating every PI\'s requirements. Flight planning was complicated. Night\nflights and the astronomy experiments were given priority, resulting in\nserious compromise of other experiment\nobjectives, particularly those\nrequiring overflights of earth surface targets.\nAlthough it may be necessary to carry interdisciplinary payloads on\nSpacelab, and some diverse requirements may be easier to accommodate than\nwith an airplane, similar scientific objectives will simplify flight planning and increase efficiency of experiment operations, which will in turn\nreduce the scope of crew training, and should be expected to yield more\nusable data for an overall mission.\n\nI\n,\n\nQ\n\n~\n\n.~\n\nBi\n",\n\nd\n~\n\n~\n\nI\'\n\nI\n\n~\n~\n~\n.""\n\n1\n!\n\n0,\nU;\n0 i\xe2\x80\xa2\nl\nU\n\'.\nU\nU\ni\n\nI\n\n!\n\ni\n\n\\\n\n\\\n\nI,\n\n! ,i\n\\\n\n(b)\n\nPayload compl ement can be formed by sel ecting from ongoi ng experiment\ndevelopment programs or existing instrumentation.\n\nI.\n\ni\':\n\nI:\n\nNASA Office of Applications (OA) avoided use of an Announcement of\nOpportunity for generating its payload complelnent for ASSESS II because\nof limited time available and lack of funding to support new proposals.\nInstead, in June 1976, OA identified payload candidates among various\ndisciplines tlutt were planned for future Spacelab missions and for which\nearly prototype tests were being conducted using the CV-990. The five\nOA experiments \xc2\xb7flown on ASSESS t! were selected by this method. In view\nof planned Spn,t~elab/Shuttle launch rates in the mid 1980s, this selection\nmethod could hI:! used with "disc:i.pline" AnnoUllcemell.ts of Opportunity used\nto secure pr!\\~lposals without regard to a specific mission (e.g., Spacelab\n1, etc.). Al.though ESA llsed an Announcement of Opportunity, all the\ne\'Xperimen~s they selected were in some stage of development, which also\nsupports the conclusion.\n\n4.2.2\n\nPayload Funding\n\nConclusions on this topic arise primarily from experience with NASA\nfunded experiments on the ASSESS II program. Spacelab planners should try\nto avoid these complications which caused conSiderable difficulty during\nASSESS 11.\n\n~~\n\n.,\'1\n\n",\n.,\n\n;.\n\nr:\n\n~,\n\n,.\n\n\'I.\n\nU\nU\n\nE\n~\n\n~\n\'"\n\n..\n-\n\n--------~--\n\n________\n\n122\n___ ________\xe2\x80\xa2_____\n\n._&_~\'~t.MI._bt~_.~a\n\n~.\n\n0\n\n(a)\n\nTimely authorization and funding of the payload is mandatory to avoid\nserious impact on mission definition and resultant compromise of\nscientific return. Analysis of payload funding schedules is of equal\nimportance to payload\' analytical integration.\nFull understanding and distribution of funds for several U.S. experiments was not accomplished until December 1976, almost nine months after\nNASA Headquarters approval and only five months before "launch". The GSFCABES experiment was not authorized and funded until February 1977, only\nabout three and a half months before flight. This problem reflected\nthroughout the whole chain of participating organizations and delayed payload configuration decisions, interface definition, data processing software,\nand,construction of experiment support hardware. The AEES experiment was\nin a "crash" schedule mode from authorization to flight with premium time\ncosts, equipment failures not properly addressed, and some loss of scientific\ndata.\n\n(b)\n\nFunding deficiencies and multiple funding channels must be avoided to\nprevent compromising payload elements.\nThe selection of five experiments comprising the baseline OA payload\nwas made by the NASA HQ OA "discipline" program offices having management\ncognizance. Funding for hardware was available for all but one experiment,\nbut was not adequate for integration and data analysis. Reprogramming from\nother funding sources caused delays in getting funds distributed. There\nwas no central control authority established in NASA Headquarters (and;\ntherefore, none at the mission management level) to work these problems.\nMultiple authorities over funding resulted in on-again-off\xc2\xb7-again decisions.\nOne experiment was dropped for lack of funding, only to reappear later\nwhen reprogramming actions were taken.\n\n(c)\n\nFunding allocations should cover all required integration and miSSion\noperations support in addition to hardware development and data analysis.\nInsufficient effort was made to budget for integration and support\nactivities by experimenters. The analytical integration effort, in\nparticular, was insufficiently supported, ~.;rith resultant detrilnent to\nmission planning, integration, and checkout. Several experimenters were\nlimited by travel fund restrictions to a lower level of personal support\nthan was necessary to do a minimum proper job. One PI ~"as unablE\' Co\nbe present for any of the critical preflight integration and testing of his\nexperiment because of lack of funds. Many PIs were unable to attend the\nsecond IWG meeting when experiment and mission plans were firming up and an\niterative exchange with mission management personnel would surely have prevented many surprises and problems when e.quipment was delivered for integration.\n\nI,:\'\n\nNanagement Relations\n(a)\n\nMission Manager concept is sound, but adequate staffing is essential and\nfurther development of the concept is necessary to insure efficient coverage\nof all program aspects.\nImplementation of the ASSESS II project under the Mission Manager from\nMSFC worked very well. There was general feeling that the concept could be\nimplemented at any organization having responsibility for a payload if the\nMission Manager had adequate resources in terms of funding and qualified staff\nto fully organize the payload, identify and track all of \xc2\xb7the payload interfaces, conduct meaningful analytical integration, identify payload requirements\nto STS, and plan and staff the POCC during flight operations.\nIt must be recognized that ASSESS II was not a complete trial of the\nMission ~mnager concept for several reasons: (1) The first appointed Mission\nManager could not apply adequate time to the project, and the Assistant\nMission ~mnager was not given sufficient authority or resources to act effectively for the manager in all aspects of the program; (2) the eventual change\nin Mission ~nager introduced a hiatus while he picked up on the project;\n(3) the Mission Manager\'s staff was not sufficient to handle all of the\nassigned responsib1ities; and (4) continuity of staff assignments was not\nmaintained, resulting in some learning curve inefficiencies.\nEngineering support available to mission management was not adequate\nto complete or maintain the Investigator Requirements Documents properly. The\nlack of support also affected the analytical integrations, particularly in\nthe areas of physical, electrical, and data requirements. These areas\nof the analytical effort were inadequately handled resulting in subsequent\nprobl~ms.\nAdequate analytical integration support plus continuity\nof effort to maintain the Investigator Requirements Documents on a current\nbasis should eliminate these difficulties.\nThe ESA/SPICE Payload ~~nager served as the single official interface to\n11\nthe MSFC Mission Manager for the European experiments and also manag,ed integU\nration and operation of the ESA portion of the payload in Europe. The ESA\nPayload Manager took on all European experiment problems and provided strong\nESA support to the experimenter to solve them. KSC representatives, i n U\nparticular, observed that this single interface arrangment for European experiments worked smoothly and efficiently. ESA was able to maintain continuity of\nmanagment personnel throughout the project, and their arrangement interfaced\nJ1D~\nwell with the NASA Mission Manager concept.\n\n(b)\n\nThe Mission Steering Group proved an effective forum for solving interface\nproblems and exchanging views and philosophies on the conduct of the mission.\nESA suggests that a similar O1ultiorganizational group be used to oversee all\njoint Spacelab missions.\n\n_\'O_-._L. . . -.. ..\xc2\xb7. .___. . . . . ._._____. . ._.__\n.\n\n124\n\n._~t .~_._~\n\n___\n\n~.\n\nD\n\nU\n\nu\n\nThe Mission Steering Group (MSG) was established for ASSESS II specifically to guide the. mission and establish ground rules for the simulation in\norder to maximize results for Space1ab. As the mission progressed, the MSG,\nwith key representatives from all of the participating organizations, became a\nforum for addressir.g basic mission problems.\nIt is difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of a higher level body such\nas the MSG uSed on ASSESS II as it might apply to a single Space1ab mission or\na series of missions involving the same organizations. While the MSG was not\nestablished as a prototype for Space1ab, some representatives, particularly\nESA. felt the MSG forum was their only means to interface with the total\nproject, and to address basic issues which they considered important. Dilution of management at MSFC during the first half of the project period left a\nvoid which the MSG tended to fill, and some expressed concern that the MSG was\ngetting involved in implementation decisions rather than in policy. Strong\nmission management would probably eliminate that problem, but in the case of\nASSESS II a tendency to address implementation areas developed before effective mission management was established, and the ~lission Manager later felt his\ndecision making prerogative was being usurped by the MSG.\nIi\n\n" After the mission experince was completed, both ESA Headquarters and\nESAI\'SJlICE management personnel strongly endorsed such a "board of directors"\ntype overseeing body for Space1ab projects where their invo1vment is substantial. The MSFC ~lission Manager was just as strongly opposed. NASA Headquarters program level representatives finally agreed with the Mission\nManager.\n(c)\n\nManagement should clearly inform all participants early in the mission as to\nroles and responsiblities.\nIt is essential that an early, deliberate effort be made by program and\nmission management to inform all prime participants as to the management structure, the various roles and responsibilities, and the manageme\'nt paths required\nto obtain optimal results. This is particularly necessary for such complex\nmanagment arrangements as existed for ASSESS II and are planned for some\nSpace1ab missions. The STS role and its relationship to other implementing\ncenters was not clearly defined by NASA Headquarters at the outset of ASSESS\nII. Interviews with several participants late in the ASSESS project revealed\nthat they had only sketchy ideas as to the responsibilities of various organizations and of their relationships with them.\nThe first IWG meeting was the only meeting that included most of the\nparticipants, and an attempt was made there to inform them as to the various\nroles and responsibilities. However. that was almost a year before flight\nand some roles and responsibilities were not yet fully established. U.S.\nPayload Specialist arrangements came about later. The ~assion Specialist role\nand selection were difficult to develop and finally occurred very late. The\n\n125\n\nsecond IWO meeting at MSFC, five and a half months before flight, was poorly\nattended which precluded much information exchange. No other such\nmeetings were held. Thus, it is not surprising that some participants (PIs\nand pISs) interviewed during the final. weeks were not familiar with some of\nthe key management personnel and their responsibilities.\n(d)\n\nParticipation by PIs throughout the mission planning and implementation\nphases can enhance overall mission understanding (by both management and user)\nand thereby improve science return. PIs must recognize their leadership\nposition concerning th~ir experiments.\nIn ASSESS II, each PI andlor his staff participated directly in IRD\nactivity, IWO meetings, System Level Payload Integration, and the real-time\nflight operations through the POCC. In addition, access to his equipment was\nrelatively easy during Launch Site Payload Processing if he had such a need.\nThe PIs were pleased with their degree of involvement. The intent of ASSESS\nII was both direct involvement and major responsibility on the part of the\nPl o Responsibility for experiment success was in his domain, except for\nconstraints of safety and interference with the flight vehicle or other experiments. This plan for PIs to accept full responsibility for experiments was\nnot fully recognized by all PIs. PI effort to aggressively identify their\ninterface needs in some cases required strong prodding by mission management,\nand the need for thorough and complete testing during integration was not\n.\nfully achieved in all cases and led to serious experiment problems in flight \xe2\x80\xa2.\nThe degree of his responsiblity for integrated testing, pIs training and\noperational procedures, and support of all mission operations with a sufficient and effective support team, must be realized and fully sponsored by the\nPI.\n4.4\n4.4.1\n\n(a)\n\nPre-flight Planning and Payload Integration\nInvestigators\' Working\n\nI]\n\nU\n\nU\n\nD\n\no\n\nu\n\nOro~\n\nThe IWG can be a satisfactory forum for scientific inputs and a valuable\nchannel for information flow between management and th~ PIs.\nFor ASSESS II the IWO concept worked very well. The two independent 1ndocttination meetings in Europe and the U.S. were excel1en~. Two other full\nmeetings were called, and although attendance at the second meeting was kept\ndown by the unavailability of travel funds, in general. the IWO had the\nfollowing beneficial results: discussion of mission plans and objectives.\nscience interchange among PIs. evolution of a cooperative experiment between\n\nI\nII\n\ntwo PIs, recommendations for selection of Payload Specialists. transfer of\ninformation about the flight carrier and interface limitations, and PI contributions to mission planning. With more extensive use of the IWG, all of these\nfunctions can be better exercised for Spacelab. Whila for ASSESS II, one indoctrination IWG meeting plus two full working meetings seemed about right,\na much longer preparation period for Spacelab flight probably necessitates\nmore IWG meetings. They should start early in the mission to disseminate\nmission plans and information about experiment integration requirements.\nAppropriate additional meetings at regular intervals will permit organized\nupdates of information from the experimenters, continued beneficial interaction among experimenters, as well as planning updates by mission management.\nA teamwork approach enhances opportunity for great~r mission success, and IWG\nmeetings provide the best forum for building a successful team.\n(b)\n\nThe Mission Scientist (and any IWG cochairman or vicechairman) needs to have\nclearly defined responsibilities, full support by the PIs, and be provided\nwith a management overview.\nThe Mission Scientist served a key role in planning and execution of\nscience activity, and provided focus of science requirements and science\ntradeoffs to the Nission Manager. He worked independently with the PIs and\nwith planners for flight operations to present the science case to mission\nmanagement. This mode of operation was very effective. During flight operations, the NASA and ESA Mission Scientists were very successful in coordinating and managing PI activities.\nThe Mission Scientist must be carefully selected. He serves dual and\nsomewhat opposing roles. On the one hand he serves the Mission Manager and\nmust be realistic about management constraints, even at the expense of science\nobjectives if warranted. On the other hand, if he is to represent the PIs in\ntheir absen~e, he must have their respect and stand hard in favor of the\nexperimente*s in the face of project management resource and schedule pressures.\nThus, a M\xc2\xb1dsion Scientist is the bridge between mission implementation actions\na~d the scientific objectives.\nHe must be strong in his own right to insist\non and maintain a solid objective position, and to do this he must be kept\nwell informed on a timely basis of the overall project activity. His effectiveness in performing this role will depend upon his mffl stature as a science\nmanager, and the degree to which all other partiCipants recognize the requirement for his analysis and possible arbitration of science considerations.\n\n4.4.2\n(a)\n\nInvestigator Requirements Document\n\nA single requirements document interfacing with each PI is desirable and\nfeasible. Face-to-face discussions, with the participation of technical\nexperts, are necessary to clarify interfaces. These discussions must start\nearly in the mission and continue to be iterated througout the mission to\ninsure proper information transfer.\n\n127\n:It:\n\n~\nIJ\n:(\n\nThe use of the IRDs during ASSESS II was a pre-Spacelab, trial of this\nsingle interface document concept. The IRD exercise was very good, and\nwhile improvements are in order, indications are very strong that the concept\n. desirable and workable. Several lessons become apparent from this experi~ ,;e and are summarized as follows:\n\nI: The single document plan has merit. From a mission management point\nof view, a single document which addresses all interfaces with the experimenter\nconcentrates managment attention to all his needs in an organized way, and at\nan appropriately early time to identify lead time requirements before a schedule\ncrisis. From the experimenter\'s point of view, he grew to recognize that the\ndocument truly addressed his needs, and provided him the opportunity to spell\nout his total requirements early. Even though the IRDs were not maintained\ncurrent during the entire implementation period, they contained the basic\nrequirements for the entire payload. Eleven such documents were employed to\ndescribe all PI and experiment requirements in detail.\n2,. The organization and wording of the IRD requires careful attention\nfor application to Spacelab. The question and answer format was good, but\noverall organization of the questions needs very careful study and improvement\nto eliminate redundancy and to achieve maximum clarity with brevity. It is\nrecognized that no single document can be comprehensive enough to elicit all\ndetails of all experiments in a simple predetermined format. However, the\nIRD must be~ructured to identify all basic requirements to a workable level\nof detail, with prOVision for expanding sections where more information is\nneeded by management team specialists to implement requirements. It was\nfound that careful wording is needed so that management and experimenters can\nunderstand each other unambiguously. A significant wording problem was obvious\nin the ASSESS II IRDs, where the use of engineering jargon confused several\nPIs.\n\nm\n\nu\nu\nu\n\nn\n\n3. The IRDs mu&t be filled out during face-to-face meetings. It was\nquickly recognized that face-to-face meetings were necessary to provide an\nopportunity for discussion of background for the various IRD questions and\nto discuss interfaces with the vehicle. Without exception, PIs required\nassistance in aligning their interface requirements to vehicle capabilities.\nThe discussions clarified many points and led to enthusiastic responses by the\nPIs to supply information. Both in Europe and in the U.S., a two-day meeting\nwas scheduled with each PI. In general, this resulted in overtime sessions\nand a rush to finish on the second dayo A longer first meeting is necessary,\nespecially for a first-time experimenter with a complex experiment.\n4. Mission management staff must be well qualified and experienced to\nattain a satisfactory rapport with experimenters in filling out IRDs. The\nASSESS II meetings to fill out the IRDs were successful. Only a small interfacing group (perhaps 3 or 4) is needed to deal with experimenters in filling\nout lRDs. However, it is absolutely mandatory that experts who fully know .. the\ninterfacing systems (electrical, mechanical, data, etc.) work with the experimenters in developing this information. Further, it is helpful if the interviewing group has developed some background knowledge on each experiment, and\n\n128\n\nI\nH\n\nis generally familiar with the methods of scientific research\nof view of experimenters. The interview team should not only\nrequirements of an experimeltt, but the representatives should\nfor better usage in situations where the experimenter has not\nadvantage of Spacelab facilities.\n\nand the points\ncodify the\nmake suggestions\ntaken optimal\n\n5.\nConcentrated effort is required following face-to-face meetings to\nclarify information and insure completeness. A very large quantity of data\nwas generated during each IRD meeting and most of the information was handwritten. This simple informal recording proved adequate for management use\nwhen clearly worded and carefully written. Some hastily written material was\ndifficult to decipher and should have been clarified and cleaned up quickly\nwhile the thoughts were still fresh. A small point, which turned out to be\na significant problem on some IRDs, was the use of a shade of ink that would\nnot make satisfactory copies.\n6.\nCompleted IRDs must be fed back to the experimenters. It is important that IRDs be returned quickly to each PI for his information as to interface plans, and also for his concurrence that the information correctly represents\nhis needs.\n7.\nIRDs must be maintained up-to-date by mission m.anagement since they\nbecome the basic reference documents for the experiments and drive t.he .,whole\nprocess of payload preparation, integration, flight planning, arid flight\noperation. It was intended that the ASSESS II IRDs should be the basic source\nof information about all aspects of the experiments and their interfaces, and\nthat one could refer to the IRDs for all requirements for ground testing,\ninstallation, and operation in flight. Because the ASSESS II IRDs were not\nkept current, their use was limited after the second analytical integration.\nWhile the two visits to fjll out the IRDs seemed about right, subsequent updated\ninformation that was gathered without meetings should have been fed to the IRD\nformat to maintain the documents as complete authoritative sources throughout\nthe flight preparation period.\n\n4.4.3\n(a)\n\nAnalytical Integration\n\nThe analytical integration of a Spacelab payload must be accomplished in a\ntimely, complete fashion so that all participants can receive complete payload\ndefinition and requirements early enough to plan the payload proce~sing\nactivities.\nThe analytical integration effort for ASSESS II was well done and timely\nto the extent it was carried out. However, after the last organized effort\nextensive work was still required to solidify final physical, electrical,\nand data interfaces. The feedback tq. experimenters and others was excellent\nafter initial analytical integration, largely because management presented\nresults directly to the participants and could interact with them. Following\nthe second analytical effort feedback to the experimenters was less effective\ndue to poor meeting attendance, and results had to be relayed by the Hission\n\n129\n\nScientist. No further organized exchanges took place between management\nand experimenters before the payload integration period.\n\n4.4.4\n\nIntegration of ESA Payload ill Europe\n\nFor Spacelab payloads involving ESA experiments, testing, integration, and\noperation of those experiments under ESA management at a centralized European\nsite would be extremely beneficial.\n\n(a)\n\n~----~~~\'--------------------~------------------------------------------~\n\nThe ESA sponsored integration, test, and operational activity at ESA/\nSPICE was extremely beneficial. In most cases, the experimenters needed\nextensive support to get their equipment assembled and working properly.\nIndividual assistance was supplied and many problems were identified and\nsolved dur.ing the ESA/SPICE integration activity. With the support of a NASA\nsafety representative, safety issues were addressed, thus avoiding major\ndifficulty later. Valuable pis training was accomplished. The ESA integration activity insured that the ESA complement arrived in the U.S. as a tested\nset of experiments, thus reducing their integration time with the balance of\nthe payload.\n\n4.4.5\n(a)\n\nSystem Level Payload Integration\n\nThe value of off-line System level Payload Integration activitie~ (level IV)\nis direct\'ly related to fidelity of the test facility and complete:ness of the\n, tests per/formed.\n~\n\nI\nI\nt\n\nI\n[\n[\n\nt\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------~\nFor ASSESS II, off-line System Level Payload Integration activity (Level\nIV) was performed in a special ground based integration and ~heckout area at\nARC. It was a minimum cost arrangement, which simulated the\'system functions\nquite well, but was not intended to duplicate physical interfaces to any great\ndegree.\nThis first-time integration of the entire payload uncovered many\nproblems --. most were solved, although some were passed on to launch site\nprocessingo The ability to address all problems in an off-line system simulator\nis strongly proportional to the investment in simulator equipment to achieve\nhigh fidelity to the carrier vehicle. Without exact cabling configuration (both\ndata and power), duplicates of the flight support systems, and exact physical\ninterfaces some problems cannot be identified.\n\n(b)\n\nI\n\nOff-line System Level Payload Integration activities (level IV) are very\neffective in crew training.\nFor ASSESS II, although the ESA PISs had participated and trained during\nthe ESA integration activity, the off-line System Level Payload Integration and\n\n_\'_M_~\n\n____=_. . _.. . . .__\n\n~_~.~1--\'aA--~~-\n\nn\n\nU\n~,\n\nU\n\nm\n\n----------------------------..----,----------------...,~\n\noperation at ARC was the first time all PISs had an opportunity to operate\nexperiments as a complete payload. The PiSs were given basic responsibilities\nduring this phase, side by side tvith the experimenters, who also participated\ndirectly in this phase of integration. This was excellent training for the\npiSs, and it is highly recommended that PiSs be given this same opportunity\nand assignment for Spacelab.\n\n4.4.6\n\'o\'cc(~L\n\nLaunch Site Payload Processing\n\ncEof,cJal!nchcsitELID\xc2\xa3e.gr.ation,,--\xc2\xb1Jinely\'defalled technical definition\npayload/carrier interfaces is essential.\n\nof----\'-\xc2\xbb-~\'\n\nMost of the ASSESS II launch site integration requirements were delivered to KSC about two weeks before start of Launch Site Payload Processing.\nAs a result, KSC had inadequate lead time to prepare for their work. Interfaces were not totally defined. However, for ASSESS II, the pISs and experimenter support groups were utilized essentially full time to accomplish the\nintegration, and alleviated the situation.\n(b)\n\nEffective launch site payload processing can be performed using a Single\ndi rect payloild manager interface to the KSC payload process i ng management.\nA payload test team approach,. using the M/S, PISs, and PIs when necessary,\nunder the jurisdiction of KSC, to directly support and par\'ticipate in the\xc2\xb7\nKSC launch site processing operations was very successfu\'J and is recommended\nfor Spacelab.\nFor ASSESS II the KSC launch site Manager, utilized the MiS and the piSs\nfull time, as well as the ,\\R.C support staff representing the launch site\nsupport contractor, to carry out integration and testing. The Mission Manager\nwas the single off.icial interface with KSC for the payload, but close liaison\nwas maintained with the ESA Payload Manager and the MSFC Grounn Operations\nManager, who had handled the Level IV Integration.\nAlthough KSC maintained strict control of the schedule and operation,\nthey were also very receptive to participation by the experimenters. This\nteam approach was v<;!ry successful for ASSESS II "lid simplified the launch\nsite integration and testing efforts. While this arrangement worked well for\nASSESS II, the STS participants seriously questioned that this procedure can\nbe followed at KSC for Spacelab, for several reasons. First, the support service\ncontractor at KSC will be responsible for carrying out most of the detailed\nwork o Although there appear to be valid arguments in favor of this approach~\nin the past this practice has forced heavy documentation emanating from pa.yload\nparticipants, mainly experimenters, to provide sufficient detail so that personnel not fully familiar with theexper:i.ments can carry out the work sarely\nand successfully. It should be recognized that direct participation by experimenters and piSs who have lived with the experiment hardware and know it well\n\n131\n\nu\n,\',\n\nII\n\ncan substitute for large, quantities of such documentation if they are permitted\nto do so and are available. The second reason put forth by STS participants\nfor limiting the ASSESS II team approach is a valid concern about too many\npeople participating in flight vehicle activity where safety is paramount.\nTheir concern may well limit participation by the experimenter and his immediate staff. However, the pISs are perfect candidates for overseeing experiment\ninstall~tion and testing.\nThey are few in number, yet know all the experiments,\nand very i~portantly, they will fly so that their consideration for safety will\nbe totally:~erious, yet should be sufficiently practical to permit them to do\ntheir job in flight. Another positive feature in favor of pIs participation is\nth~ additional training to be gained with the flight configured payload.\nThe\nteam approach with heavy and responsible use of the pISs during launch site\npayload processing is recommended for Spacelab.\n\n,\n\n\\\n\n(c)\n\nTo mlnlm14.e experiment systems failure, time should be scheduled to conduct\nexperimen~ functional tests on the integrated vehicle.\nFailure to perform\nthese tests, at least on priority experiments, implies technical risk that\nmay not be conmensurate with "11ssion investment.\n~--------------------~----------.;.;..,-.- - - - - -\n\n..\n\n\\.\n\n\'.\\\n\n.1\n\nThere is no fully satisfactory substitute /or test ot; the payload components in the actual flight configuration. While\' a high-fidelity test device\nfor system level (Level IV) integration does allow very significant debugging\nof the system interfaces and the payload experiments, there will always be at\nleast minor configuration varistions in such a test/ device from the flight\nsystem that can produce serious anomalies in payload operation. In ASSESS II,\neach experiment was checked out on the aircraft after final flight vehicle\nintegration. A number of problems were found and solved. For Spacelab, the\nKSC integration is baselined only to insure interface and EMI compatibility.\nIt is recommended that a full operational check of at least priority experiments be included to insure proper data producing capability.\n\';;\n\n(d)\n\nPast experience should be applied to insure that experiment tests are conducted\nthat will indicate possible experiment hardware weaknesses or susceptibilities.\nA great deal of experience exists at both NASA and ESA centers for checkout of experiments to be flown in space. The participation of the implementationcenters in thEo\' design review and tes t planning phases of the experiments\ncan assist the Pl l s rate of success through experience transfer. The ground\nrule now being considered for Spacelab puts prime responsibility upon the PI\nto insure satisfactory operation of his equipment, while the STS responsibility\nis limited to safety and interface compatibility. For ASSESS II, at the discretion of the experimenters, experiments were not thoroughly tested in all cases\nbefore flight. One prime experiment failed; others had operational problems.\nA positive approach to marry the knowledge of experienced integration management personnel with the experimenters\' responsibility to perform critical\nexperiment tests is r(!t~ommended.\n\n132\n\n!J\nill\n\nru\n\nli\n\nm\n\n(e)\n\nAn all-up Integrated Mission Simulation is valuable and is recommended, at\nleast for the early Spacelab missions. Inclusion of instrument operation\nto verify operational interfaces during the simulation enhances the probaLility\nof experiment success.\nA generally effective end-to-end Integrated Mission Simulation was\nconducted in ASSESS II with the payload flight crew carrying out experiment\noperation supported by full MCC/fOCC participation. Many problems were\nidentified, some with hardware, and some with operations. This level of\nsimulation offers the most realistic possible training for the total operations team (MCC, POCC, and payload crew), and should, be included during the\nfinal integration period for Spacelab, especially for early missions.\n\n(f)\n\nTime should be provided in the launch site processing schedule to allow\nfor some final experiment testing in the launch vehicle and for handling\nlast-minute problems, which are bound to arise. Suitable facilities\nfor handling these problems should be available at the launch site.\nExperience with previously launched space systems, as well as the analogous ASSESS experience, has shown that experiment problems will inevitably\nshow up at KSC during integration of the payload into the flight vehicle.\nSome final experiment testing or calibration with flight system hardware\nmay be required, particularly if problems arise during integration, to assure\nthat acceptable flight data will be acquired. While this could be done in\nflight, the inherently greater risks would appear to justify onground verification. Facilities for metal work and electronics operations, together\nwith highly trained personnel innnediately available to the launch site integration operation to provide support for experiments, are most desirable. Equally\nimportant are simple procedures to use these facilities and personnel so that\nquick fixes can be implemented with minimum disruption of the integration\nschedule.\n\n4.4.7\n(a)\n\nSafety\n\nSafety considerations for ASSESS II were effectively applied with a low\nlevel of formality, but it was not considered that the level of detail\napplied to ASSESS II contributed materially to understanding the required\nlevel of detail necessary for Spacelab.\nMany safety considerations for Spacelab were not required to the same\ndepth for ASSESS II (e.g., olltgassing, stress corrosion, and detailed hazard\nanalyses), although design control and review were exercised in all areas\nof potential hazard to personnel OT. equipment.\n\nB\nFor ASSESS II payload management provided guidance in safety matters\nto\'the PI and his team, starting with the initial IRD meetings, to assure\ntimely development of safety-qualified experiments. Early identification\nand tracking of potential problem areas, on-site consultation, and suggestions for alternate solutions to accommodate science requirements by the\nresponsible management specialist greatly benefits the experimenter and can\nreduce his documentation effort. The safety specialist\'s knowledge of each\nexperiment facilitates review and approval of experimenter supplied design\ndocuments, and aids in prc.paration of operational safety plans.\nSafety ~onsiderations for the aircraft systems and the payload at ARC\nwere handled by the Airworthiness Assurance Office. General safety inspections were handled on a daily basis during integration and ground operations\nby the Aircraft Inspection Branch, with simple problem sheets which incorporated provision for signoff on the same sheet upon corrective action. Final\nall-up mission safety approval was issued in writing by the Airworthiness\nand Flight Review Safety Board, after formal meeting(s) with review of all\nsafety related items and operational procedures. All flight personnel were\nrequired to participate in formal safety briefings. The Aircraft Commander\nwas the final safety authority during flight.\n4.5\n4.5.1\n(a)\n\nPayload Flight Crew\nMission Specialist\n\nThe MIS role in ASSESS II and the management arrangement were very successful\nand are recommended for Spacelab.\nAfter much controversy and delay, the arrangement for a Scientist Astronaut to serve as Mission Specialist (MiS) for ASSESS II \\4Tas worked out.\nThe MIs remained administratively under JSC but was assi!,;i1ed functionally to\nthe Mission Manager at MSFC. In addition to his ground based duties, he\nserved on the flights as the alter ego of the Mission Manager. As the mission\nprogressed, it became apparent that he also operated very effectively as\nleader of the Payload Specialists (piSs). He assumed this added role naturally\nas a result of his experimental background, his training experience, and his\npersonality. The pISs were all well satisfied with this arrangement, particularly appreciating his acting as a buffer between them and the PIs during\ntheir busy operating times in flight.\n\n(b)\n\nThe MIS functions for ASSESS II were unique to that position and served a\nvital need.\nOn ASSESS II the MIs had the sole responsibility to handle aircraft\nsupport systems that interfaced with the experiments. These were the cental\ndata system, the power supply and distribution system, and the specialized\n\nH~\n~\n\nB1\nU\nD\n,\n\n:"\n\nt~\n\nH\n\nB\nD\nD\n\nj\n~,\n\nn\nU\n\nn.\nn\n"\n.\n\n}-;\n\n.J~,\n\n"\n~\n\n"\n:J\n\n~:,~\n\nD\n\nn\n\n\xc2\xb7~~\n\'i\n\nI\nI\n\nI\n\n\' .~\n\n.\nC\n\nj\n\n;~\n\n"\n.,\n\n\xc2\xb7\n\nD\n\nn\n\nOF\n\n\'",",\n.""~\n\nU \',,,\n~\n\n,\n\n.>\n\n~"\n\n",\n~.\n\n134\n\'i\n\nyt\n\nm\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\ninstrumentation such as gyrostabilized mirrors and a water vapor overburden\nradiometer. The overall function was extremely important and necessary, and\ncould not have been handled by the pISs.\nThe tot/S was also very effective as the commUllicat:lons coordinator between\nthe payload c1:\'ew, flight crew, and the POCC. He provided the Mission Scientist\nin the POCO with a balanced ove1:\'view of the paylof:\\d operations, and abo\nhandled many speci.Ucs in behalf of the pISs. This unloaded the pISs of the\ncommunications burden to a substantial degree wh:l.ch they apprec:;iated because\nthey were completely occupied with thei1:\' experiment ope1:\'ation tasks. Further,\nthe HIs kept track of the va1:\'ious legs of the flights and assisted the piSs in\ntiming of their llctivities with respect to va1:\'ious flight tracks, and coordi,..\nnated requests fo1:\' flight plan change.s with the flight and payload crew. As a\n1\nscientist\xc2\xbb he could appreciate what the 1 /Ss were dOing, anel frequently could\nhelp them in overburdened situations. As a team, the 1-1/S and the pISs operated\n\nvety smoothly.\n\'/\n\n(c)\n\n},\n\nThe MIS should be assi:gned e",r{y in a mission so that sufficient time will be\navailable for training~"\'i~~\'i1 aspects of activity for which he is assigned\nresponsib1 ity.\nOn ASSESS n\nthe MIs was not ~wlected until Dec.ember 1976~ five and\nhalf months before the simula ted spaceflight. \'1\'his time was insufficient\nfor training on all systems for which he was to be responsible. In particular,\n:i.t was impossible .for him to get more than cursory training on the complex\ncentral data system.\n\n<l\n\n4.5.2\n(a)\n\nPayload\n\nSpec~alists\n\nParticipation of the PISs (time of selection, training schedule, etc.) should\nbe included as an integral part of the mission planning so that their involvement begins at the optimum time COlllll1enSUl\'ate with their assignments. In\nparticular, PIS involvement should commence at a stage that would allow their\ninputs to the contl~ol and operations aspect of the exper\'iment design.\nASSESS n piss were selectod oight manti\'ll\') bufor.e flight. By the time\nthey got to most of the PI lnhol\'lltorioB lor trnlning, much of the hardware\ndesign was solidifiod. As in ASSESS I, the PISs all made strong observations\nthat their early input to des:lgn would have, enhanoed successful operation\nof. the h~lrdwm=t~ and obtaining of science dnta.\n\n(b)\n\nEffective verbal communication skills should be an important criterion for\nPIS sel ection.\n\nDuri~g ASSESS II, it was ~oted that some piSs were significantly less\nadept at giving and receiving information than others, and tended to communicate less effectively under stress. This problem does not relate particularly\nto whether or not a pIs is a native speaker of English, but to fundamental\ncommunication skills and attitudes which affects the success of making\nrepairs and collecting data. This aspect of competence should be carefully\nconsidered in making pIs selections for Spac\\.llab.\n\n(c)\n\nPrior to final selection, PIS candidates should be subjected to some type\nof stress, including timeline activity.\nObservations indicated that the ability of pISs to operate under stress\nof multiple activity varied considerably. In Europe, psychological tests were\nused that clearly eliminated some pis candidates and raised cOllcerns about\nothers. These concerns were borne out on ASSESS II during the integration and\nflight periods.\n\n(d)\n\n-,\n\nAny PI candidate for PIS must be nllly cognizant of the workload time\ncOl1l11itment and demonstrate his abiffty to support both roles.\nOn ASSESS II, one pIs was also a PI. Some interference was- noted when\nhe interrupted h1s ASSESS II activity to take care of urgent PI management\nresponsiblities. Very careful: consideration should be given to any PI who\nproposes to be a pIs on Spacelab, to assure his genuine willingness to forego\nhis basic PI duties or have them handled by others, and that he thoroughly\nunderstands the t~me required away from his home base for meetings, training,\nand operational duties associated with the Spacelab payload.\n\n(e)\n\nThe use of backup PISs from the mission management team is feasible, but\npracticabil ity depends upon the ba-~ance of duties required fora specific\nmission.\nFor ASSESS II, the NASA Assistant Mission Manager was selected to be\nbackup PIs for U.S, experiments. This plan for a single backup for both NASA\nPISs was adopted particularly to save travel funds, and was acceptable because\nthe individual was considered to be well acquainted with the U.S. experiments.\nHis management duties were severely diluted, but he handled pis training and\ngenerally represented the payload crew to management during the preflight\nphases in addition to undergoing his own limited training. The question arises\nas to whether capable candidates will be willing to accept only a backup assignment for Spacelab, with historically a very low probability of flight assignment, unless there is some accompanying responsible assignment (which dilutes\nboth jobs), or some strong liklihood that a backup pis assignment is a step\ntoward prime assignment on another mission.\n\nu\nn\nE\n\nn\nI\nI\nD\nU\n\nu\nn\nn\nn\n\no\no\nn\nD\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\n(f)\n\nThe pISs \\vel:e vel:bally infonned about the m~dical experiment befol:c the\nASSESS II mission, but obviously all did not realize the potential physical\npl:oblems. Some substantial physical difficulties were experienced by one\npIs during the 72-houl: collection of Fls pl:eflight baseline medical data at\nARC. The pl:oblem was sufficiently sevel:e that, due to potential loss of\nmedical data und/or degradation of his overall e.ffectiveness, serious consideration \\vas given to rt;!placing him for the flight mission. He was not\nreplaced, and the medical data \\vus collected \\v:lth no detectable degradation of\npIs pCl:formance. However, the situation stl:ongly illustr3ted the nepd for a\nbetter understanding early in thp project.\n\nB\n\no\n\nEach crew candidate should be subjected to sufficiently realistic functional\nand environmental simulation of his role early in the training period to\npermit self-evaluation of his desire to proceed.\n\nig)\n\nPIS training must be tailo~ed to the individual PIS selected and the\ncomplexity and degree of PIS understanding of any given experiment. PIs\nmust devote adequate time and effort to maximize the training effectiveness.\nOn ASSESS II, pIss training "\'vas varied. Ini tial training was scheduled\nOn a time basis per experiment without regard to pIs capability or initial\nunderstanding of experiments, but some adjustments \\vel:e mada as training\nprogressed. Discussions \\vith pISs aftel: the mission indicated that training,\nin some cases 1 had been ovcrdon~ for some experiments and ,~as inadequate for\nothers. Hission management judgment should b(;1 blended with PI and Pis\nappraisal of need for training time, consis tent \\vi th the background and\ncapability of each pIs for each expet\'iment and its pl:iority.\n\n(h)\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\nNASA should consider special means to provide administrative support for\ninhouse as well as out-af-house PISs in order not to preclude nomination\nof highly qualified candidates.\nFor ASSESS II, nonlipu.t;ons of ant\' inhotlsc and one contru.ctOl: pIs candidate ,vere wi thdl:u\'vn from the NASA porrj,ol1 of the payload. The contractor\nproposed pIs had no chance of being selected because there was no means t(,)\npay his salary or SUPP0l:t his tl:avel. The inhouse candidate was wi thdl:a\\Vl1\nfor lack of administrative support. Consideration of pIs nomination fl:om\na NASA centel: raises the question of devoting travel funds from his organ12;atlon, if that organization has no basic responsibility for Spacelab\noperations. The travel fund pl:oblem is so severe under the present system\nthat, without some obvious incentive, this al"eU of consideration can exclude\nqualified candidates ,. Based on ASSESS II experience, NASA salaried candidates have an advantage oval: out-of-house nomineees, and even within NASA,\nunless some special meanS to pl:ovide StlPPOl:t is arranged, the best possible\npIs candidate may not be nominated.\n\n137\n\n...,...". i\n\n\'77\n\nI\n(i)\n\nI\nI\n\nPIS participation in development of experiment operation procedures contributes significantly to their training and operational \'.mderstanding, and\nsupports their responsibility as the onboard PI representative.\nFor ESA experiments, the piSs were given the responsibility to develop\noperational flight procedures for their assigned experiments. This proved\nto be a very effective method to assure their complete understanding of\nexperiment operation, and caused a very deep interaction with the PI to\niterate various modes of operation. The further hands-on operational\nresponsibility assigned to the pIs during Level IV and launch site integrations was an excellent combination to maximize pIs training for flight.\n\nR\n\nn\n8\n\nNASA chose to have the PIs maintain respousibj,l i ty for all procedures\ngeneration, with review and iteration with the pISs. However, one of the\npISs was a PI and the other was well acquainted with much of his experiment\nresponsibility at the outset. Although little difference in PIs operational\nsuccess could be detected between the ESA and NASA approaches, the ESA pISs\nstated that their preparation of operational procedures was of significant\nbenefit in their training.\n\n"\n\nm\n\nD\n\n(j) Fl~i!:1ht\n\noperations workload planning must allow for a PIS adaptation period,\nwith attendant lower effectiveness for the first several days of the mission.\n\nEven without the effects of zero-g, for ASSESS II the pISs readily\nstated that th,ey required from one to three aircraft flights before they had\nreacheda.,high degree vf effectiveness in experiment operation. The pIs\nwho bad many\'rletails to ~Dn$ider, but was concerned with only one operational\ngO.f~:t.!;. ,dev\'eloped operational effectiveness more rapidly than those faced with\narn\\;;ltJ.plicity of operational goals (single vs multiple experiment operations).\nE\'w\';\'rt the MIs, with his considerable flight experience, felt that he was not\nhandlir,tg his several duties with full efficiency until about the third flight.\nIncreased expeJ::l,1\\\\ent/system level training can minimize, but not eliminate\nthis initial lc:rwet: ,effectiveness.\n4.6\n\nFlis,htIGl.\'ound Operations_ Interactions\n\n(a) ~---------------.~--------------------------------------------------------~\nAdequate resources and time must be provided for training of POCC personnel,\n\nespecially PI sci~nce teamso\n\'"-_____________________________ -. . ,\n\n.,....~p \'~~.\n\n_________....\n,\n\n...\n\n~!<~\n\nt-/W\'\'\'\'\'...--..-\n\n_\n\n...\n\n,\\\n\n~ \xe2\x80\xa2\nI\n~ .\nj\n\'"\n\n-~\n\n\'~\nI\n\nU\nB\n0\n,.\n\n;\n\nn\n,\n\nr\n3)\n\nThe POCC for ASSE$Sn was fufly manned as plan1.11~d for Sp,acelab. Some\nPOCC training occurred for ESA personnel during the ESA integr~tion and operation activity in Europe, but very little operational training took place at\nARC before the start of flight operations.

Initial operations were\ninefficient, but improved with time. Whereas experienced management personnel\n~y man key positions for Spacelab, which eliminates their training needs,\nmost PIs will be untrained. PI participation in flight conununications was\nvery poor in many cases during ASSESS II, especially during the early flight\nperiod. Leadership of the PI group in the poee by the Mission Scientist was\nvery good, but some training for that arrangement is reconunended.\n(b)\n\nThe TV text uplink is a beneficial mission operations tool. Facsimile\ncapacity for transmission of troubleshooting information is desirable and\nshould be incorporated into the Spacelab concept at an early date.\nThe TV text uplink and its Polaroid readout in the aircraft proved its\nutility by being used increasingly as the ASSESS II mission progressed. The\nability to send simple messages to pISs and the MIS, with a record for reference, was found to be far less interruptive of work than extensive voice\nconununicationo Inability of the link to handle facsimile precluded sending\nwiring diagrams that were needed for troubleshooting. Provision for such\ntransmission to Spacelab would be very beneficial.\n\n(c)\n\nPeriodic data samples from Spacelab to the POCC during the mission are\nessential for PI experiment surveillance and to provide for operations\ninstructions to be sent back to the spacecraft.\nData slices were passed to the poee each day, and ground-based facilities\nwere available through the poee to determine the effectiveness of experiment\noperation. This system was highly successful, and is recommended for Spacelab.\nIn ASSESS II, some interface problems occurred between poee displays and the\nexperiment data record, but with the quick-look information available, in\nevery case a work-around was implemented so that nearly all data were retrieved.\n\n(d)\n\nIf backup PISs are to be used effectively in the POCC, they must be trained\non all experiments. Also, on joint missions, Mission Scientists must be\nfamiliar with all experiments.\nFor ASSESS II, the backup PISs served as the main poce communicators.\nThis was an effective arrangement because of their familiarity with the payload experiments and crew. However, because project guidelines prevented\n~ross-training by the piSs for both NASA and ESA experiments, they each had\nli.m:tted knowledge of some experiments, which was a disadvantage. This experi\xc2\xa2,:at.e empruld:r.es that for Spacelab conununication to be fully effective, both the\nj;;ender an,; receiver must be conversant to a. reasonable level of detail with\n!tll aspects of the payload.\n\n139\n_~_~~\n\n_\n\n_ _ .... _____\nr_\n\n\xc2\xb7_~~\n\n.\nr\n\nThe Mission Scientist must also be conversant with the payload to a\nconsiderable level of detail so that he can make decisions on the best use of\nflight time. It is therefore imperative that he understand the science and\noperation of all experiments.\n\n4.7\n(a)\n\nExperiment Hardware Considerations\n\nAutomation of routine tasks is recommended to reduce PIS workload and\noperating errors; however, manual bypass cao;bility is also desirable.\nExperiments that contained automation of routine tasks and did not require\nextensive adjustments or setup of controls by the pis appeared to have a\nhigher data-take success ratio than those wi th extensi,ve manual setup and\ncontrol. However, where possible, proviSion should be made for manual override of automated systems in the event of a malfunction. Two examples from\nASSESS II illustrate these points. The infrared telescope experiment was\nhighly automated with computer control. However, when the computer occasionally malfunctioned, adequate manual operation by the pis was possible. Conversely, one U.S. experiment was also highly automated with computer control,\nbut not in such a way that the pis could easily bypass it. When the PI recognized early in the mission that the ,data were badly degraded, he was unable to\ngive corrective instructions to the pis because there were no suitable manual\ncontrol provisions.\n\n(b)\n\nI\nII\nI\nFl.:\'\n..\n\ntJ\n\nn.\nfj\n\nD\n\nUse of off-the-shelf hardware should be considered where modificat\'ions or\ntesting to meet the Spacelab constraints is cost effective.\nThe majority of the components that made up the ASSESS II experiment.s\nwere off-the-shelf items. They seemed to perform as well as specially constructed components. The primary reason for resorting to special construction\nwas the need for a uni<{ue functional capability. Reliability, low power\nconsumption, etc o , were definitely secondary considerations.\n\n(c)\n\nPayload integration and operations management personnel, as well as the payload flight crew, should have available a complete set of simplified schematics. These should clearly show all interface connections and controls\nfor ready reference during integration and operation when problems occur.\nIn the preparatory phase of ASSESS II it was generally accepted that the\ndefinition of electrical and control interfaces between the experilt;ent and\nsupport systems would be adequate to perform integration and checkdJ.lt operations. Thus, except fot Spacelab rack interfaces with other experim~nt\nelements, the PIs provided intraexperiment electrical and control di~:grams\nin various degrees of detail. During Systems Level Payload Integration\n\nru\n\nU\nIJ\n,\n\n/n\n140\n\n[j\n\nit was recognized that a greater depth of information could be used to advantage, and other diagrams were developed by management in cooperation with PI\nrepresentatives. These were of benefit in subsequent integration and checkout\nactivities, and also were made part of the Flight Data File to aid pIs troubleshooting. \'Even though it is recognized that intraexperiment hardware is a PI\nresponsibility, unless some reasonable inner visibility is immediately available, internal components can cause severe interface problems without a capability to quickly trace the problem to the source.\n408\n(a)\n\nData Handling\n\nFace-to-face interactive discussions between responsible representatives\nof the experimen/t and the central data system with a resulting bilateral\ninterface agreement, including verification procedures, are necessary to\nfully define and establish the data handling interface.\nInterface resolution between experiments and the central data system\nis tradi"tionally a difficult area. ,Furthermore, experiment interface\nidentiftcation usually comes late in the process of experiment hardware\nprepa~tion, which compounds the problem because interface limitations may\nf01r:rredeSign or compromise of the experiment. All of this dictates that\nexp rts from each side of the interface start face-to-face discussions early\nan continue interaction until firm interfaces are fully defined and agreed\nto by both parties. Attempts to define these interfaces without extensive\ndiscussion and0understanding will almost guarantee problems except for the\nsimplest cases o\nFor ASSESS II, the key data system experts were unfortunately not brought\ninto discussions with experimenters when the IRDs were filled out. Data\ninterfacing turned out to be a severe problem area. For Spacelab, pt\'oper\nearly expenditures of resources in this area will almost certainly be cost\neffective to prevent later severe problems.\n\n(b)\n\nHardware and software interfaces should be standardized wherever possible\nbetween the experiment and the central data system, to simplify integration\nand checkout and enhance operating reliability.\nIn the CV-990 central data system, analog data are generally received\nthrough an analog to digital converter that is sampled by standardized\nsoftware. Thus, any analog signal that conforms to the limitations of the\nconverter can be quickly and surely added to the data collection system.\nLimiting digital interfaces to a format and procedure for which the central\ncomputer is designed likewise reduces the need for special programming which\nis costly, prone to error, and generally makes inefficient use of all\nresources.\n\n==== apc\n\nE \'. . . .\n\n(c)\n\nSuc(,,~ssful\n\nsoftware debugging can be accompl ished only if enough time is\nprovided with all experiments being stimulated simultaneously in the planned\nflight configuration.\nAlthough interfaces betwe.en individual experiments and the central data\nsystem should be well verified by the time the total integration phase commences, interaction between experiment software modules can only be reliably\ntested in a full system environment, and sufficient time must be allowed to\nidentify and solve total system problems which are almost guaranteed to show\nup. The ASSESS II schedule did not provide sufficient debugging time with\nall experiments operating, and consequently some data processing problems\noccurrred during flighte Software debugging should be expected to continue\nwell into payload integration, and with the real possibility that this type\nof problem is likely to show up during flight, it is recommended that the\nuplink be capable of handling data processing computer programs.\n4.9\n\n(a)\n\nDocumentation\n\nDocumentation should be carefully planned and scheduled for issuance. Documents should cover only specific needs, titles should be precise and informative, redundancy should be eliminated, material should be carefully grouped\nso that the number of documents is minimum, and language should be carefully\nchosen to eliminate or clarify jargon that is unfamiliar to the recipient.\nAlthough ASSESS II documentation was far from a perfect example for\nSpacelab, it was a realistic learning experience using the new 1-11ssion l-Ianager\nconcept of payload management with the actual-Spacelab organizations participating in their planned roles. The documenr/ ~on created and used was nearly\nall newly developed, and, apart from many sh\\.. :/tcomings, substantial progress\nwas made as a pattern for Spacelab. With the objective of placing full\nresponsibility on the PI for experiment success and simplifying his documentation requirements, the Investigator Requirements Document concept was implemented sutficiently to prove its validity, but not enough to show its full\npotential. \'Huch improvement of that document is needed for Spacelab.\nThe documentation plan outlined by th.;,ASSESS II Mission Steering Group\nwas generally valid, but insufficient management attention was exercised over\ndocument identification, content, and schedule of issuance.\n(,\n\n(b)\n\nFor joint NASA/ESA missions, both sides should have an opportunity to review\nall basic mission documents. Some form of mission implementation agreement\nshould be developed and jointly agreed to by both parties. This should\nidentify those documents whi ch comllli t each other I s resources or si gnificantly\nimpact mission objectives and should be concurred in by both parties.\n\n\\\\\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nB\nI\n\no\no\nD\n\no\no\nI\nI\nD\n\nDuring the progress of the ASSESS II mission, ESA management felt they\nwere bei<n8 committed without recourse to certain lines of action by NASA\nissued documentation. No formal means was developed during the program for\nNASA/ESA discussion of such documents before their issue. ESA feels that they\nmust be able to discuss jointly those areas where commitments of manpower are\nto be made before detailed policies are set by NASA issued documents.\n\nu\nREFERENCES\nASSESS Project Background\n1.\n\nr-tulholland, D.

The ESA proposed night\noption (ESA experiments 3, 4, 6, 10, 11) were accepted by NASA to assure ESA\nadequate lead time to proceed with firm contract arrangements for experiment\nhardware development. Four NASA experiments (31, 198, 500, 439) were identified by NASA as the prime candidates for ASSESS II. These experiments will\nbe complementary to the ESA preference for night flights. Preliminary analysis\nby ARC indicates that all of the above experiments can be accommodated on the\naircraft. However, final selection of the NASA experiments requires some\nfurther evaluation of operational requirements to include. the possibility of\nconducting some daytime flights. If daytime flights can be accommodated, ESA\nwill consider adding a Solar Atmospheric Measurement Experiment, and NASA will\nconsider operating an Infrared Heterodyne Radiometer (439) in the solar mode.\nNASA is also considering the Laser Absorpdon Spectrotneter (502) to complement\nthe IHR. Such decisions are also contingent on the available space aboard the\naircraft and the workload on the payload crew.\n\'l\'he ESA Nedical Test Experiment will require instrumentation of the\nconfined personnel. While ESA has decided that this will be no problem for\nthe ESA Payload Specialists, further evaluation is required to determine constnlints imposed on the U. S. participants and the physical space requirements.\nEvaluation of the above and the select:f.on of U.S. experiments to round out\nthe payload is continuing.\n\n4. .\n\n~\n\nARC will establish preliminary fUght tracks by\nNay 13.\n\nAction:\n\n_\n\nOA working with ARC will complete payload analysis\nand finalize selection by Hay 6.\n\nAction:\n\n_\n\nAction:\n\nMission ~lanager (NSFC) \'will determine extent of\nimplementation of the Nedical E~periment by Nay 6.\n\n&:_ ____.....\n......\n\n. . . ._ _ _ _ . . - , _ . . _ . . .\nI\n.\n._\n..\n\n..\n\n_~Io_ ~\n\n._.A... ~1_~_. ~ ...... ,~~_~~.. ,. ,\'. __\n\nW\n\nI\nAction:\n\nARC will determine by May 6 i f the HSFC proposed\nexperiment which ~\'ould be operated only during\nnon-flight periods can be accommodated.\n\nElectromagne.tic Interference (EMI)\nESA would like to further their studies of EMI which were carried out\non the ASSESS I mission.

A major flight is planned each\n24 hour period; however, it is l\'ecognized that limitations of aircraft support\nat ARC may result in a down-period if severe aircraft operations problems occur.\nThis possibility supports the need for the MSFC eltperiment which would load the\npIs with meaningful tasks during non-flight periods.\nIt was agreed that a Hission Operations Control Center (MOCC) and a\nPayload Operations Control Center (POCC) physically separated from each other\nwill be implemented for the mission.\nIt is planned to implement round-the-clock voice communication with\nthe aircraft during the mission.\n110\n\nAction:\n\nARC will continue to evaluate how full time voice\ncommunication can best be done and report at the\nnext MSG meeting.\n\nIt was agreed not to attempt to utilize the free time expected to\nbe available from the flight deck crew on Shuttle for payload operationso Since,\nin the 990 aircraft operation, neither the pilot nor the co-pilot can easily be\ntaken from their stations during flight, as might be done on S.huttle, it was\ndecided that it would complicate the ASSESS II mission beyond reason to substitute and train prOltY individuals to evaluate that situation.\n\nCentralized Experiment Controls\n\nI\nI\n\nD\n\nU\n\nB\nI\n\nu\nI\n\nD\n\nU\n\no\nn\n\nResults of the ASSESS I mission showed that Spacelab experiment design\nwill require careful attention to the centralization of experiment controls if\n\nIJ\n\nthe limited flight crew is to have success in managing and operating many\ncomplex experiments. MSFC has investigated the possibility of providing some\ncentralized panels so that the pis can . better manage several experiments.

ESA representatives very strongly requested that the next meeting be held at ESA. The\nproposed dates are May 24-25, 1976.\n\n1\nMINUTES\nNASA/ESA ASSESS II t-1ission Steering Group Meeting\nMay 25-26, 1976\n\nThe meeting was held at the ESA-SPICE office located within the DFVLR\nLaboratory at Porz-Wahn, Germany.\nThe ESA Program Manager reviewed the general status of the project\nfrom the ESA standpoint. The SPICE organization (Spacelab Payload Integration\nand Coordination in Europe) is moving rapidly into a fully operational organization to handle their interest in ASSESS II. They will exercise their SPICE\norganization involvement with ASSESS II to the greate3t extent possible for\napplication to Spacelab 1. They will do a full pre-Level III integration of\nall ESA experiments at SPICE (DFVLR) and accomplish integrated operation and\nPayload Specialist training prior to delivery to the UoS. The Life Science\ngroup at DFVLR is building a full scale Spacelab mockup under the auspices of\nthe Institute for Space Simulation. The ESA Program Manager has requested\ninstallation of the ASSESS II simulation system to be put in the same building\n(perhaps a temporary inflatable building initially) to be connected to the\nadjacent existing computer facility which they plan to program to handle\nappropriate experiment stimulation and simulated interfaces.\nAn ESA experimenters\' meeting was held at SPICE on }~y 20 at which\nthey were updated on ASSESS II plans in some detail. ESA established scheduled\nactions to the European experimenters at that time.\n\nThe NASA Program Manager summarized the programmatic status of\nASSESS II in the UoS. He recently briefed the Administrator of NASA on ASSESS II.\nOf primary interest at that meeting was the extent of training which will be\nrequired to fly on Spacelab and whether PIs will be interested in flying versus\nproxy experiment operators. The NASA Program Manager also summarized a recent\nbriefing to the NASA Administrator for the Office of Space Flight (OSF) to\ndiscuss participation in ASSESS II by JSC and KSC.\nKSC is very actively pursuing their plan for participation. The\nSpacelab Project Office representative from KSC elaborated with emphasis on a\nKSC desire to use ASSESS II to help lead to simplified procedures and documentation to achieve p/L integration at KSC. The following areas were identified\nfor special attention by KSC:\na)\n\nAcceptance Data Package for experiments/payload;\n\nb)\n\nResponsibility for experiment performance during integration,\ntest, and checkout;\n\nc)\nd)\n\nMission independent and mission dependent training;\nLong period of time between final C/O on ground and activation\non orbit;\n\nI\ni\nI\nI\nI\nI,\nI\nI\n\ni\nI\nI\nI\n\n.\n\'.\n:;\n.,\n\nI\n\nJ\n\n\xc2\xb7".1\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\n\'i\'\n.)\n>",,,,:\n\n,i\',\n\nI\n\n,\n\n",\n.\'1\n\n,\n\n"\':;\n\n\xc2\xb7\\~\n..!\n\n\xc2\xb7;:\\~\n\'",-\n\n~\n\n.~\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\ne)\n\nLevel IV integration completed before delivery to launch site\n(no Level IV at KSC);\n\nf)\n\nOrganized (controlled) storage of crew equipment;\n\ng)\n\nFeasibility of simple document for all experiment requirements.\n\nA request was made by some representatives on the Steering Group for\nKSC to also give attention to direct participation of the Payload Specialists,\nif not the PI, in the integration process (in addition to experiment responsibility, item b), with a view toward elimination of documentation for detailed\nproxy integration procedures.\nKSC plans to have two or three key personnel at ARC to participate\nduring the ASSESS II integration process and others involved as appropriate to\nplan for integration activity and establish useful analogs between ASSESS II\nand Shuttle/Spacelab. They also plan to participate in an upcoming CV-990\nintegration for an on-going mission to better establish their int.eraction in\nASSESS II. The KSC plan for ASSESS II is in preparation.\nThe NASA Program Manager reported that JSC announced at the OSF meeting\nthat their plan will be presented soon. No one from OSF or JSC was present at\nthis meeting to provide any details.\nHission Management\nThe NSFC Assistant Nission Manager reported on the status of ASSESS II\nmission management at NSFC. A Mission Hanager for ASSESS II has been named (he\nis also Hission Nanager for Spacelab 2) along with an assistant.. Also, a\n~tission Scientist and an assistant have been selected at MSFC.\nSeveral specific\nkey individuals from the ~ISFC Spacelab Payload Project Office have been authorized\nto move out rapidly on analytical integration analysis.\nNSFC plans to establish an Investigators Working Group (I\\VG) made up\nof all the PIs to enhance maximum experimenter involvement in payload-oriented\ndecision making, including Payload Specialist selection, allocation of flight\ntime to the various experiments, etc. While the Steering Group endorsed this\napproach, very strong concern was expressed about the formality proposed\n(meetings of the PIs). The discusison centered around U.S. Payload Specialist\nnomination and selection which must take place very soon if the Payload\nSpecialists are to be effectively utilized. (ESA plans to select their pis\nby June 15.)\nThe Assistant Nission Nanager also reported on the U.S. experimenters\nmeeting held at NSFC on Nay 14. They Were briefed on SpaceJ.ab plans and details\nof the ASSESS II project including plans for the Investigator Working Gr.oup and\ntheir participation in selection of Payload Specialists.\nDocumentation\nThe Assistant Hission }tanager presented the NSFC preliminary general\nplan for interface documenta tion. The Mission Nlmager \\~ill work with KSC/ ARC\n\nI\nto generate a "Ground Operations Requirements" document and with JSC/ARC to\ngenerate a "Flight Operations Requirements" as a reference document. These\nwill be provided to each experimenter along with the 990 Experimenters Handbook to provide reference material for ASSESS II. In order to provide a data\nbase on each experiment, for planning use by all organizational elements, a\nstandardized fill-in-the-blanks type form entitled, "Investigator Requirements\nDocument" (IRD), will be developed and will be filled out by each investigator.\nThese will be used to generate a (1) Payload Ground Operations Requirements\ndocument, (2) Payl.oad Flight Support Requirements document, and (3) Payload\nFlight Definition document. These few documents are planned at this time to\nbe the basic interface documents. From all of these and other inputs, a\ngeneralized overall }lission Operating Plan will be produced by the ~lission\nNanager. There will be other documents to carry aut implementation apart\nfrom the above interface documents.\nDiscussion ensued particularly as to objectives and use of the\nOperating Plan and consistency of ASSESS II documentation development\nwith Spacelab documentation discussions taking place within the Spacelab\nOperations \\vor\'king Group. It was the consensus that ASSESS II documentation\nplanning should be pursued independently, but with full recognition of Spacelab\nplanning and adherence to any NASA/ESA policy agreements.\n~lission\n\n1.\n\nAction:\n\nNSFC will review NASA/ESA documentation agreements\nand Spacelab Operations Working Group plans, further\nrefine the ASSESS II documentation plan based on\nminimum documentation concept, and present status\nat next meeting.\n\nPayload and Accommodation\nThe ESA Program Hanager and the NASA Assistant ~lission Scientist\nbriefly reviewed the ESA and NASA experiments planned for ASSESS II.\nThe ARC Nanager described tlH~ preliminary layout planned for the\nCV-990 and verified that all the experiments can be accommodated within the\naJrcrnEt: constraints of physical space, power, viewing ports, etc. Preliminary\nconsiderations were presented of the viewing limitations of the astronomy and\nother ehlH~,riment objectives. Tht~ high demands of the ESA IR astronomy objectives which must be integrated with otller experiment requirements into a\ncomplex detailed flight plan emphasized the urgency tu move quickly with this\nphase of analyti.cal integration analysis. NSFC plans to implement an Experiment Accommodations Team as soon as possible to interface with experimenters\nto address requirements and negotiate flight tracks and timelines.\nCentralized Experiment Consoles\nThe ARC Nanager alonr, "11 th the NSFC Assis tan t Nission Nanager\nreported on considerations to provide Spacelab-type racks to accommodate\ncentralized controls for the e>\'"p(\'riments so that the limited number of\n\nA-8\n\n~\n, .\n\nPayload Specialists can efficiently control and operate multiple experiments.\nConfigurations and layouts w~re presented. Costs and schedule were discussed.\nESA expressed a need for the racks much earlier than the presently proposed\navailability to avoid repackaging for their pre-integration in Europe.\n\n2.\n\nAction:\n\nARC will proceed immediately to provide the\ncentralized control racks with stroq~~ effort\nto compress the delivery schedule. I ,\n\nIntegration Philosophy\nESA will accomplish pre-Level III integration of all European experiments at SPICE (DFVLR) and conduct integrated operation tests and pis training\nprior to delivery to the U.S. They plan to provide experiment input stimulationl\nsimulation equipment (EIS) and the necessary GSE required to accurately simulate\nthe experiments to the aircraft and central computer interfaces.\nNo plans presently exist in the U.S. Spacelab Operations for full\nfunctional payload checkout of the integrated payload. No off-line GSE~ been\nauthorized and schedule limitations during on-line integration at KSC permit\nonly continuity checks and Spacelab compatibility with some time reserved to\nsolve expected E~a problems. Previous airborne science experience has shown\nthat system level interfaces (particularly with the data system) require deep\nattention after integration to prevent serious data loss. The ASSESS ~ mission\nalso demonstrated the problem.\nSteering Group representatives voiced strong concern about this\nproblem and discussed alternatives to best utilize the ASSESS II mission to\nfurther id~ntify and communicate ingredients in this area for Spacelab planningo\n3.\n\nAction:\n\nPerform integrated system tests of the entire payload\non the ground after total integration on the aircraft\nand immediately prior to the constrained flight period\nusing experiment stimulation data. No checkout flights\nof the experiments will be performed befor~ the constrained mission. Obtain detailed ASSESS project data\nto identify problem areas and solutions for each\nexperiment.\n\nSelection and Training of Payload Specialists and Mission Specialists\nThe MSFC Assistant ~1ission Manager explained their proposed process\nto have the experiment4ars nominate candidates for pis within the guidelines of\nSpacelab planning. TbIB Investigator Working Group under the chairmanship of\nthe Mission Scientist would then reduce that number by negotiation to make up\nthe prime and backup p/So All selected PiS will be fully trained. The prime\nand backup pis will be designated by the ~1ission Manager after initiation of\nthe training pro~ess. Apart from the ASSESS mission requirements it is also\nplanned to expose the selected pis to at least some activities similar to those\nwhich will probably be required for space flight training to obtain some data\n\n1\non individuals selected by this procedure. Such activities may include zero-g\naircraft flights and water tank space activity simulations. Any probl.ems during\nsuch activities will not disqualify the selected pIs for participation in ASSESS.\nThe ESA Program }mnager stated that ESA will select four pis made up\nof one PI, one from the ESA Space Science group, and two from DFVLR.\nThe NASA Assistant }ussion Manager presented\n\npIs\n\nrequirements as\n\nfollows:\n\nI\nI\nm\n<\'\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFAA Class III medical status;\nOSF established anthropometric standards;\n\no\n\nAvailability for ESA medical experiment;\nAvailable full time beginning October 1, 1976;\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nParticipate in S/L oriented environmental\nfamiliarization study;\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nReport organizationally to the HSFC Mission Manager;\nDiscipline expertise as defined by the Investigator\'s\nWorking Group.\n\nProposed Payload Specialist pre-mission duties were listed as follows:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nParticipate in experiment development as appropriate;\nAssist in development of experiment operating procedures\nand timeline elements with PIs;\nObserve/participate in selected Level III/II integration;\nParticipate in Level III/II experiment hardware checkout\nand test;\n\no\n\nParticipate in selected mission planning activities;\nParticipate in simulations;\n\no\n\nServe as subjects for the medical experiment;\n\no\n\nSupport Payload Operations Control Center (Backup PIs) \'.\n\nH\nH\n\nn\nn\nn\n~\n\nH\nH\n0\n\ni\n\nn\nn\nn.\n",\n\n\'"\n\n~\n\nFlight Phase Payload Specialist duties were proposed as follows:\n\n"\n\n\'~);,\n\nInteractively operate experiments;\n\n,~:.~\n\n<\n\n,,!,.~\n~.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPerform required instrument maintenance/repair;\nCommunicate with POCC for experiment operations;\n\n-_.\n\nA-IO\n\nn\n\n,\n\n\';y,:\n\n~\'1;\'\n\n.\n\n~ "\'.:\n\nIl ~\n\nTil\n\no\n\no\n\no\n\no\n\n,\'\n\n:/\n\nrm\n\nInteract with POCC for real-time mission planning;\nInteract with CV-990 flight crew for changes in\nintegrated flight plan;\nOnboard responsibility for management of plL\noperations and accomplishment of FIL objectives;\nOne\n\nFls\n\nto be selected as "lead F/So"\n\nThe Mission Steering Group asked for more details to demonstrate\nspecific plans for deepest possible involvement of the rls since a basic guideline of the ASSESS program is to demonstrate that direct activity with responsibility by the PI or his closest participating representative can both reduce\ndocumentation requirements (cost) and enhance experiment success.\n\n4.\n\nAction:\n\nMission Manager to develop details of pIs\nresponsibilities and activities for discussion\'\nat next meeting.\n\nDiscussion of }dssion Specialist selection and duties was deferred\nbecause the JSC representative was not at the meeting. Concern was expressed\nthat the project is moving through important phases and decisions without MIs\nparticipation.\n\n59\'\n\nAction:\n\n(\n\nMedical\n\nOA Program Manager will work with OSF to reconcile\nthe Mission Specialist issue and to verify a plan\nto name an HIs and define appropriate functions\nand tasks.\n\nExpe~iment\n\nThe ESA Pr6gram Manager explained the ESA medical experiment to\nobtain selected medical data on each pIs for 7 days prior to flight, throughout\nthe constrained flight period, and for 4 days post-flight. Data will be obtained\non each backup pIs on the ground during the flight period for comparison. Objectives are to gain data relative to Circadian rhythm and workload. The project\nis highly organized. Excellent and detailed planning has already been done to\ninteract and utilize the ASSESS program to gain specific data.\nThe Medical Experiment PI from DFVLR has discussed the project with\nNASA Headquarters, ARC, and JSC, and it was reported that the experiment is now\nconsidered to be a joint endeavor between DFVLR, NASA-ARC, AND NASA-JSC.\nThe NASA Assistant Mission ,Manager said that all U.S. as well as ESA\nPayload Specialists will participate in the experiment.\n~AS\n\nRequirements\n\nThis subject was deferred until after a proposed jOint experimenters\nmeeting where ADDAS familiarization and requirements will be discussed.\n\nElectromagnetic Interference (EMI)\nil\n\nThe ESA Program Manager reported on ESTEC\'s plan to conduct EMI\nstudies. In accordance with an action request from the last meeting, he dis- "\ntributed an ESTEC report spelling out guidelines for hardware design to reduce,\nEM! and establish tolerances for acceptable emissions. Details of the EMI\n/1\nspecifications and plans f~T-\\EZ.lI measurements were presented to the ESA ex~eii\xc2\xad\nmenters at their meeting 0[> .h)y 14. Agreements were reached there foroES..T~C to\nserve as advisors and cons~~ants to the ESA experimenters to achieve acceptable\nEMI levels. ESTEG will visit each European experimenter\'s laboratory to conduct\nEM! measurements prior to delivery of instrument packages to SPICE at DF\\r~R for\npre-Level III integration and tests. Also, EMI tests will be included on the\npartially integrated (ESA experiments only) payload at DFVLR.\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\n(\n\nu.S. experimente~s received a very ~eneral summary of the EMI study\nproject at the U.S. experimenters meeting at;,\' JSFC on May 14. Details will be\npresented to them at the joint experimenters meeting to be held on July 12-13.\nSome discussion ensued about the desirability of ESTEC\'s direct interaction\nand assistance to U.S. experimenters prior to delivery of instruments to achieve\na maximum effort toward good design for EMI for the entire payload. This was\ndeferred until discussion at the joint experimenters meetingo Mu.ch of the\nhardware for U.S. experiments already exists in aircraft flight configuration,\nand it is questionable that funi!s are available for any significant redesign.\'\nESTEC has requested that ARC isolate the power generators on ~he\naircraft and supply power to the payload through a single bus. Also, that the\nAnDAS system be grounded through a single ground connection. The ARC Manager\nstated that these will require significant effort, expense, and time in an\naircraft schedule already very tight. Some or all of the work might be done\nduring the aircraft modification period scheduled for January 1977.\n6.\n\nAction:\n\nInvestigate the possibility of accomplishing the\nESTEC requests to modify CV-990 wiring system to\nreduce EHI levels.\nARC.\n\nOpen Actions from Past Heeting (4/9/76)\n1.\n\nKSC and JSC participation plans due 5/15 are still in process.\n\n2.\n\nA draft Hission Plan will be prepared by 6/15 - HSFC ...\n\n3.\n\nDocumentation plan present.\nMSFC.\n\nFurther action item at 5/26 meeting -\n\n11.\n\nFull time voice ,communication with aircraft evaluation still in\nprocess by ARC.\n\n13.\n\nJSC to propose a\n\n15.\n\nMSFC plan to select\n\n16.\n\nESA selection of\n\n~lission\n\npIs -\n\npIs -\n\nSpecialist - still open.\nin process.\n\nin process.\n\nA-12\n\nI\nI\n\nit\nI\nI\n\nAll other open actions have been completed.\nNext Meeting\nConsiderations were discussed of having the next Steering Group\nmeeting in conjunction with the joint experimenters meeting to be held at\nSPICE-DFVLR on July 12-13. It was. decided that more time is needed after\nthat mee.1;ing occurs to hold a meaningful MSG meeting.\nProposed dates for the next f.ISG meeting are July 28-29 at NASA-ARCo\n\nA-13\n\nMINUTES\nNASA/ESA ASSESS II Mission Steering Group Meeting\nAugust 17-18, 1976\n\nThe meeting was held at NASA/Ames Research Center\nMoffett Field, California\nThe NASA Program Manager reviewed the proje~t status from the NASA\npoint of view and reported that the selection of U.S. experiments is still not\nsolidified due to funding problemso The conununications experiment from GSFC\nhas been removed from the payload. Of the remaining four experiments, another\nwill probably be eliminated, leaving a U.S. complement of three experiments.\nThe funding problem developed because of a) the added experiment costs for\nredesign of existing equipment to semi-automate in order to reduce the manpower\nrequirement to operate the experiments, and b) the costs to support experimenter\'s staffs through the ASSESS period. These areas of cost were identified\nalmost a year ago, but the reality of specific cost impact pointed out that this\nhas been an important "lesson learned" from ASSESS for OA because the same\ningredients will apply to Spacelab and can b~ an extremely severe problem\nespecially with a larger Spacelab complement of instruments.\nThe representative from ESA Headquarters suggested that ESA WQuld be\ninterested in expanding their experiment complement to replace cancellation of\nU.S. experiments. Subsequent discussion precipitated a decision that it is now\ntoo late to add new experiments, but it may be possible to expand the activity\non ESA experiments already selected.\n1.\n\nAction:\n\nThe NASA Program Manager will interact with OA management by\nAug. 27 to reconcile the U.S. experiment support and selection problem.\n\nI\nI\n\nThe ESA Program Manager voiced a mild plea to retain the IR Hetrodyne Radiometer fr.om Langley based on the cooperation that developed at the\nrecent Investigator\'s Working croup meeting between that experiment and the\nSolar Physics experiment from Italy.\n\n2.\n\nAction:\n\nThe Mission Manager will notify the ESA Program Manager\nby S~Pt. 15 of any additional payload capability that may\ndevelop so that ESA can consider expansion of activity for\nexisting ESA experiments.\n\nThe ESA Program Manager summarized the ASSESS II status ~rom the ESA\nstandpoint. All contracts with the various experiment groups have been completed.\nWork on the experiments is progressing on schedule. SPICE representatives plan\nto visit all the European experiment laboratories within the next month to check\nprogress and iron out any difficulties o\n\nAn agreement between ESA and DFVLR to carry out integration of the\nEur.opean experiments at Porz-Wahn, Germany is essentially complete. Only minor\n\nA-l.4\n\nI\nB\n\nconsiderations remain to be clarified. Drawings are nearly complete for a\n9-meter long wooden mockup of the 990 cabin to be used for the integration.\n3.\n\nAction:\n\nThe ESA Program Manager will notify the Mission Manager\nby Oct. 31 of any desired expansion of activity for ESA\nexperiments which may result from action item #2 above.\n\nSCHEDULE\nThe ASSESS II Assistant t-iission Hanager discussed the plan for ~lSFCI\nARC to solidify the aircraft layout of experiments immediately after the NASA\nexperiment decision. He expects to arrange for visits to all experimenters\nduring a 3-week period beginning Oct. 1 to update Investigator Requirements\nDocuments (IRDs)o This will be followed by an updated analytical integration\neffort during a 3-week period beginning Nov. 1 leading to a freeze of the\nintegrated payload requirements by Dec. 1. A decision was made to begin the\nconstrained "Spacelab flight" on Nay 15,\' 1977. NASA Headquarters representatives\nexpressed concern that the schedule of e.vents leading to the launch date are\nnot sufficiently hard to delineate which decision points are critical to the\nlaunch date. For instance, they questioned how much longer the decision on U.S.\nexperiments can be delayed before the launch date is impacted.\n\n4..\n\nAction:\n\nMission Manager will develop an overall hard schedule as\nsoon as possible with emphasis on critical paths and identification of critical milestones leading to launch of the\nconstrained mission on Nay 15, 1977.\n\n,EMI MEASUREMENTS\nThe requests by the ESTEC representatives to modify the 990 electrical\nsystem to reduce EMI, and for design modifications of the U.S. experiments to\nprovide single-point grounds has been considered. The NASA Program Manager\nannounced that, nothwithstanding the good work done on ASSESS I to identify\ndesign features to reduct; EHI and the opportunity to further refine the results\non ASSESS II, the funding problem within NASA precludes modifying either the\naircraft or the experiments. The ESA Program Manager said it is not feasible\nfor ESA to fund these items. As a result ESTEC will continue their work with\nthe European experiments and will carry out EMI measurements during the integration of those experiments at DFVLR. They would stj.ll like to fly the EMI measuring equipment during the flight mission to obtain general data, but they will\nnot conduct detailed tests aboard the aircraft during level II and I integration\nas earlier planned.\nAIRCRAFT SCHEDULE AND EXFERIHENT RACKS\nThe ARC ASSESS II Manager presented a goneral schedule of 990 flight\nactivities showing that the flight scheouJr! "I\'1ll. accommodate a May 15, 1977 launch\ndate for ASSESS IIo He also discussed thl~.schedule for delivery of experiment\nracks to the European experimenters. Standaru racks will be shipped by Sept. 1.\n\nA-15\n_\n\n......._ _ _ _..........- - . -I!!I\n\'\xc2\xb7\n..\n\n..... _ jMhl\'!M~qi!S!J:\xc2\xa3tt\nA_\n_\n\nhWltLi\':tlK .:IE:b1\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nLow-hoy racks and the new "Spacelab" racks will be shipped by Nov. 16. Some\nEuropean experimenters need low-boy racks before that dateo The problem cannot\nbe alleviated easily because all of the available low-boy racks are scheduled on\na previous mission and cannot be made available until that mission is completed.\n\n5.\n\nAction:\n\nAction:\n\nThe Mission Manager will insure that experimenters understand that objectives during the follow-on unconstrained\nperiod will be the same as for the simulation period, and\nthat their effort during the unconstrained flights will be\nfor the purpose of refining or obtaining data which was\nplanned for the simulation.\n\nAction:\n\nThe Mission Manager will report to the Program Manager by\nSept. 1 the implication and recommendation for the number of\nunconstrained flights within a maximum limit of four.\n\nPAYLOAD SPECIALIST SELECTION\nThe ASSESS II Assistant Mirdon Manager and the ESA Program Manager\nreviewed progress on Payload Special\xc2\xb1~t selection. Nominations for PIs were\nsubmitted to the IWG during their meeting on July 130 As a result, the U.S. pIs\nnominations were to be submitted to the Mission Manager by Aug. 1 and the ESA\npIs by Augo 60 DFVLR is doing some medical and psychological tests for ESA.\nESA is planning a meeting for Augo 25 at which time they will decide on four pIs\nto provide two prime and two backup PIs for the mission.\nIn the UoSo, the funding problem is driving a decision toward only the\ntwo pIs with one backup selected from someone already involved in the project who\nwould receive limited training to serve as a pIs if required. Thi.s will save\ntravel costs and training costs. The U.S. pIs selection is closely tied to the\nexperiment selection problem and cannot be fully consummated until experiment\n\nA-16\n1\n\n_C!!\xc2\xa3..\n\nD\n\nn\n\nThe number of unconstrained flights to be provided during the period\nfollowing the constrained Space lab flight simulation was the subject of extensive\ndiscussion. During the unconstrained period, the PIs will be allowed to operate\ntheir own equi.pment, and this period will provide the opportunity to insure\nsatisfactory data return for the PI. Naturally, the PIs would like many flights.\nHowever, ASSESS I proved conclusively that if the unconstrained flight opportunity is too generous, there is a strong tendency to unload the Payload Specialists during the simulation in favor of the PI getting the desired data when he\nflies later. The ESA Program Manager preferred a ratio of two to one which\nwould allow four unconstrained flights. Two have been tentatively scheduled.\nIt was agreed by all the the PIs should not reduce their goals during the simulation in favor of later attention by themselves.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n.\'\n\nARC will immediately provide low-boy rack designs to ESA\nto permit them to build mock-ups for use until the actual\nracks can be shipped.\n\nSCHEDULE OF UNCONSTRAINED FLIGHTS\n\n6.\n\no\n\nly\'fl!\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 "\'\'\'_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ __\n\nfl\nU\n\nE\n\nu\nn\n\nn\no\no\no\nu\nu\n\n"\'fEU_\n\ndecisions are made. However, the Missi.on Manager expects to submit P/S candidates to the Program Manager by Sept. 1.\nThe ASSESS II procedure for pIs nomination and selection using the IWG\nfor inputs has been an interesting and enlightening process which was considered\nby the Mission Steering Group to be of immediate importance to Space1ab planners.\nESA considered eight nominations, some of which were submitted by DFVLR directly\nand will be supported by them. In the U.S., 30 nominations have been considered,\nmainly from JPL who advertised throughout their Center and who are viewing this\nas a significant first step toward selection of candidates they may wish to fly\naboard Shutt1e/Space1ab.\n8.\n\nAction:\n\nARC will prepare an interim ASSESS II report by Oct. 1\ncovering the selection of Payload Specialists.\n\nPAYLOAD SPECIALIST TRAINING\nThe ASSESS II Assistant Mission Manager presented the present status of\nplanning for pIs training. A training plan has been drafted, but must be reworked depending upon the final decisions on U.S. experiment and p/S selection.\nNo cross-training of ESA and U.S. p/S is planned except for one session of the\nU.S. pis with the ESA Life Science experiment. Partial training will be provided for the one U.S. backup P/S. ESA will fully train all of their four pis.\nThose selected for backup will serve in the POCC during the mission.\nSome discussion ensued about the procedure to be followed if a pis\ngets sick during the mission. Should the p/S be replaced or should he be removed\nand the remaining pis attempt to pick up the load perhaps using a preplanned\ntime1ine? It was decided not to address the more complicated of .the alternatives\nfor this mission, but instead merely replace a sick pis with the appropriate\nbackup individua1 0\nGROUND OPERATIONS\nThe Launch Site Operation representative from KSC presented charts\nshowing the schedule of ground activities leading to the May 15, 1977 flight date.\nCopies of the overall ground operations schedule, the integration and checkout\ntime line , and the integrated payload checkout configuration are attached. This\nschedule calls for U.S. ,experiment Level IV integration beginning March 14 with\nthe ESA/SPICE acti"Hy by April 1, 1977 in preparation for integrated payload\ncheckout with the l,\'(:.i.J:\'craft simulator system. All j.nstruments will be installed\nin the aircraft beginning April 5. The integrated P/L checkout will represent\nthe use of the Core Segment Simulator at KSC by connecting the plL to an external\npower supply and an external ADDAS data system. Each instrument will be exce\'X\'cised as fully as possible using appropriate experimenter provided sensor stinlu1i.\nFinal checkout will involve use of onboard power and the onboard data system and\nwill be limited mainly to interface plL compatibility and EMI checks. No flight\ntest checkout of the P/L will be performed commensurate with the Orbiter/Space1ab\n1imitation\nKSC expects to obtain detailed checkout procedures from each PI\nQ\n\nA-17\n\nin order to be responsible for plL checkout. It is planned to use the pIs\nduring the integration and checkout process to operate the experiments, and\nthey will need to be totally available during that period for that purposeo\n\nFLIGHT OPERATIONS\nThe Flight operation representative from JSC presented a preliminary\nFlight Planning Integration schedule together with some details of an Integrated\nMission Implementation Plan to be issued by JSC. Other documentation and activities leading to the flight period were identified and discussed, including the\nCrew Activity Plan, Payload Support Plan, and a pre-mission rehearsal to check\nout conununications and interactions between the }tOC, POCC, and aircraft.\nDOCUMENTATION\nThe ASSESS II Assistant Nission Manager discussed the general approach\nto documentation. As a result of an earlier time, he and the ESA Headquarters representative prepared a summary of ASSESS II documentation and its\nrelevance to Spacelab documentation. This is attached. The Launch Site Operation\nrepresentative from KSC emphasized that, apart from the interface documents,\nthe ASSESS program has prompted action at KSC to reduce internal implementation\ndocumentation with commensurate delegation of responsiblity. He said that KSC\nwants it understood that their requirements for Spacelab are going to be minimal\ncompared to the past.\nCREW ASSIGNHENTS\nThe NASA Program Nanager explained that, apart from pis selection\nactivity, duties and responsibilities particularly for the t-lission Specialist\nare not yet reconciled. The NASA Headquarters representative stated that the\nCommander/Pilot combiuation have now been identified to handle interface duties\nbetween the Orbiter and Spacelab which leaves the ~lission Specialist totally\navailable for Spacelab activitiesu A lively and extensive discussion followed\nin an attempt to identify a satisfactory role for the l-lission Specialist which\nled to an impasse between the principal representat:l.vos involved. The Chairman\ndeferred the problem to separate negotiation between managements of the affected\norganizational ent:l.ties to settle on a solution.\n\nu\n\nu\n\nU\n\nH\nD\n\nn\n\no\n\nD\n\nn\n\nD\n\nn\n\nTRAJECTORIES\nThe ESA Program Hanager pOinted out that as a result fo the IWG meeting,\nsome PIs changed their viewing objectives and are concerned that they are\nexpected to harden their requirements soon. They want flexibility. The ASSESS\nII Assistant Mission Manager, the Flight Operations repres\'antative for JSC, and\nthe ASSESS II }tanager from ARC explained the problems of handling changing\nrequirements a After the IRDs are updated in October, there will still be some\nflexibility as the mission approaches, but any major change will be difficult\n\nliD\n\nto implement. Small deviations can be handled into the flight period if they\nare justified, but it was strongly emphasized to provide hard requirements\nduring the October period. New trajectories for the combined payload will be\npresented at the next IWG meeting which will probably be held in early or\nmid-December after the IRD update and the resultant second phase of analytical\nintegration effort.\nUSE OF ADDAS DURING SPICE INTEGRATION\nESA has investigated the problem of constructing an ADDAS system for\nuse during the integration of the ESA experiments at DFVLR. The ESA Program\nManager explained that while most of the equipment is available at DFVLR, some\nof the unique U.S. manufactured equipment has been modified for ADDAS which\nthey would have to procure and similarly modify. In addition, they need the\nsoftware program for the internal ADDAS system. Consequently, he requested that\nthe ADDAS equipment to be used off-line during the integration at ARC be shipped\n~o DFVLR for their use.\n\n9.\n\nAction:\n\nARC will determine by Aug. 31 the possibility of sending\nthe ARC-ADDAS hardware together with a software engineer\nto SPICE at DFVLR.\n\nFollowing review of previous action items, a meeting date for the\nnext MSG was established for Dec. 7-8 at KSC.\n\n...\n\n_,...\n_____\n\n~~\n\n,~\n\n_ _ BlIiiZL_"_W_,_",_II, _________\n.....\n~\n\n.u _ _ _\xe2\x80\xa2 _ _",, _ _ ..\n\n~\n\n~~--~\n\n- -\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 - . -\n\n\xc2\xb7t .....\n\nU\nMINUTES\nNASA/ESA ASSESS II Mission Steering Group Meeting\n\nID\n\nDecember 15, 1976\n\nThe meeting was held at NASA/MSFC on December 15, 1976.\nSome confusion developed regarding the meeting when the Co-chairman\nfrom NASA Headquarters called to explain his inability to attend the meeting,\nand to request that the MSFC Mission Manager act in his place as Co-chairmano\nThe MSFC Mission Manager was absent, and it was not clear that he would be\navailable to co-chair the meeting o Several alternatives developed which\nresulted in the representatives from OSF in NASA Headquarters, KSC, and JSC\nbeing notified of a possible delay in the meeting. On the morning of\nDecember 15, the MSFC Mission Manager arrived and agreed with the ESA Cochairman to proceed with an official MSG. As a result, official representatives from the above organizations did not attend.\n\no\nD\nD\n\no\n\nSeveral summary presentations of material given to the Investigator\'s\nWorking Group just concluded were shown to the MSG starting with the MSFC Ground\nOperations Manager who described the ground operations plan for ASSESS II. He\ndiscussed the guidelines and assumptions, procedure preparation with scheduled\nneeds of input particularly from the experimenters, GSE, and status of operations documentation. The overall ground operations schedule was discussed in\nsome detail. Whereas ESA had earlier planned to deliver their experiments to\nAmes on April 1, the ESA Program Manager agreed to advance delivery by two days\nto March 30. It was also agreed to start the constrained period on the evening\nof May 160 An earlier consideration to start the constrained activities on\nSunday, May 15, was relaxed one day to avoid difficulties and added overtime\ncosts necessary to begin on a Sunday eveningo\nSome diSCUssion ensued regarding the extent of direct involvement by\nthe PI and his staff during the integration. It was agreed that the PI will\nhave full responsibility for his equipnlent and will be fully and directly involved during Level IV integration. He will be expected to operate his equipment in accordance with prepared procedures. This will be his last chance to\nstimulate his experiment to insure fully satisfactory data response before it\nis "launched."\nA guideline was accepted that the experimenter will not go aboard\nthe aircraft during Levels III, II, and I integration except in very special\ncases where there is concern that the experiment will not operate properly.\nThe Mission Specialist and Payload Specialists will assist in the integration\naboard the aircraft in behalf of the experimenter and the installation and\ncheckout will be done according to prepared procedures as if the experiment\nwere being installed aboard Spacelab by the integration contractor at KSC.\nThe ESA Program l>lanager presented a summary of pre-integration\nactivities relative to the ESA experiments to be conducted at SPICE in PorzWahn, Germany during February and Marcho He showed a flow of experiments\n\nH\nD\nH\n\no\no\nu\nn\n\nA-20\n\nI\n\ninto the simulation system, which is being constructed by DFVLR, along with a\nsched~le of events leading up to a constrained period of operation to be run in\ntheir ground facility using the ESA Payload Specialists to operate the experiments with management control in a re~ote Payload Operations Control Center.\nA DFVLR representative showed details of the facilities to be used\nfor the SPICE pre-integration operation including layout of the ESA experiments\nin a CV-990 mockup, the conununicatio.n system, and their plans to handle data\nthrough a system they are building ~o very closely resemble the ADDAS system\non the CV-990.\nThe ESA Program Hanager invited U.S. observation anq participation\nin the SPICE activity.\nThe MSFC pl.an to carry out an off-the-aircraft integration of the\ncomplete payload using a separate Payload Checko\\1.\'; Unit was thoroughly discussed.\nTIle MSFC }tlssion Manager described the rationale for conducting the off-line\nintegrationo t~ile recognizing the extensive effort on the part of ESA to do a\npre-integration of their experiments in Porz-Wahn, he wants to use ASSESS to\nslmulate to the greatest extent reasonably possible a pre-integration test of\nthe entire payload as it will occur at any Level IV integration site and deliver\nto KSC the payload with zero experiment test requirements. He recognized that\nthere will always be some exception to such an ideal case, and while the aircraft program does present some unique problems that prevent exact reflection\nof the Spacelab approach, it does allow a very high degree of opportunity to\ntryout the basic approach.\nThe ESA Program Manager presented in chart form (attached) the ESA\nanalysis of the MSFC proposalo In summary, while he showed a number of reasons\nfor disagreement with the MSFC plan, as outlined in his presentation, he stated\nthat he will accept the MSFC proposal to do off-line pre-integration without\nusing the aircraft as shown on the MSFC schedule if the other participating\nNASA Centers who were not officially in attendance agree. This was accepted.\nThe MSFC representatives presented the POCC and data handling\nconcepts for ASSESS II including the physical and organizational arrangements\nand responsibilities of the various participants.\nSince the last meeting, substantial progress has been made regarding\nthe role of the Mission Specialist. The Mission Manager presented the proposal\nmade by the NASA Program Hanager for JSC to assign an MIs to functionally\nreport to the Mission Manager at MSFC, for him to act as the alter ego of the\nHisdon Mana~er during flight, to be the interface between the payload crew and\nthe "STS" flight crew, to be responsible for aircraft-experiment support systems,\nto be trained as a PIs at the discretion of the Progra.m Manager, and to work\ndirectly with the POCC during flighto This proposal has been implemented,\nthrough NASA Headquarters to JSC and the Mission Manager expressed satisfaction\nwith it. There was general agreemento\nThe ESA Program Manager invited participation by the MiS in the SPICE\nactivity, and also suggested that the MIs should handle the EMI experiment\nduring flighto The Mission Manager agreed to look into the possibility of\nthe HIs handHng that ass:i.gnment.\n\n1\n\n~lSFC representatives briefly reviewed the flight operations planning\nthat had been presented to the IWG including the agreements reached and the outstanding action item. Seven night flights and two day flights are planned with\none possible additional optional flight track. The preliminary timeline plan\nfor the HiS and U.S. PiS for one flight has been delivered to ESA representatives\nfor their use in preparing compatible timelines for the ESA P/Sc\n\nDeep concern was expressed regarding the tardiness in obtaining optical\ninformation from the ESA solar experiment. The ESA Program Manager said they\nare worldng with the experimenter to solve the problems, but the responsibility\nmust remain wj.th the experimenter. They are helping all they can.\npat~\n\nParticipants adopted the report of material which had been presented\nto the IWG.\nThe [SA\n\npis\n\ntraining plan was transmitted to MSFC.\n\nA previolls action item regarding ESA support for taking the CV-990\nwith the ASSESS payload to the Paris Air Show is still openo ESA is receptive,\nbut a formal requE-st from NASA is still awaited in order to respond. This action\nwas transmitted to the NASA Program Hanager for attention.\nThe ESA Program Manager announced that an ESA-IWG will be held in\nconjunction with the SPICE pre-integration, and he suggested that it would be\naJ.ipropriate and timely for the last meeting of the HSG before "launch" to be\nheld at Porz-Wahn at that timeD No specific action was taken on his suggestionD\n\n".,\n\nD\nI\n\no\n\nH\nD\n\n6\nD\n\nD\nU\n\no\n\nu\n\nA-22\n\n\xc2\xa3\n\nMINUTES\nNASA/ESA ASSESS II Mission Steering Group Meeting\nMarch 9, 1977\n\nThe l-fission Steering Group meeting was held at ESA/SPICE in PorzWahn, West Germany.\nSince the last l-lission Steering Group meeting a new individual was\nappointed ASSESS II Mission Manager at MSFC. This change became effective\nJanuary 19, 1977.\nThe philosophy of Payload Operations Control Center (POCC) staffing\nwas discussed in depth to establish and clarify the guidelines under which the\nASSESS II POCC will be handled and the relationship and application of the\nASSESS II a.ppI\'oach to that being considered for Spacelab. The poce activity\nfor ASSESS\'II is essentially a complete reflection of that planned for Spacelab\nincluding all of the identified operating positions. However, the discontinuity\nof aircraft flights presents some anomalies with respect to real-time flight\nplanning and POCC operationo\nPOCC Mission Scientist Position Staffing\nThe l-tlssion Manager pOinted out that for Spacelab, MSFC plans to have\nthe Mission Scientist sit in a staff position with the l-lission Manager as an\noff-line activity with respect to the on-line POCC operation. In that position\nhe will handle overall science-oriented mission planning. The science position\nin the POCC will be staffed by the Deputy Mission Scientist to participate in\ndaily real-time ~xecution of the mission.\nThis concept was relatively new, but ESA expressed concern that while\nthe off-line science planning function might be applicable to Spacelab, for\nASSESS II this would place the ESA Mission Scientist in a shared role with the\nU.S. Deputy Mission Scientist in the POCC. If an off-line mission science\nactivity is to be implemented, it is the desire of ESA to use their prime ESA\nMission Scientist to participate in that: activity with the prime U.S. Mission\nScientist and to appoint an ESA Deputy Mission Scientist to serve in the POCC\nin conjunction with the U.s. Deputy Mission Scientist. However, ESA expressed\nconcern that science judgements will be compromised in ASSESS II by removing\nthe prime Mission Scientists from the real-time active execution activities\nin the POCC.\nA negotiated settlement of the issue was reached by agreeing to\neliminate the off-line science planning function for ASSESS II and concentrate\nthe prime U.S. and ESA Mission Scientists\' efforts in the poce on a shared\nschedule basis during the most active periods of POCC operation and to use the\nDeputy U.S. and ESA ~[ission Scientists during the less critical periods. A\nspecific schedule of participation was established as follows:\n\nDAY 1\nT-a hours Pre-flight\n\n14-1/2 hrs\n\nT+6-1/2 hrs Flight Peri,od\n\nDAY 2\n\nu.s.\n\nESA\n\nNis.

Sci.\n\nbriefing and PI data\nevaluation\nThis schedule of POCC manning by the ~1ission Scientists was based on\na typical day plan, and would repeat throughout the mission period.\nThe ASSESS II Mission Manager reserved the right to reevaluate this\narrangement after the first two days of operation; however, it was agreed that\nchanges to this plan would be discussed with ESA before implementation.\nPOCC Operations Position Staffing\nDetailed discussion also took place regarding POCC staffing of the\nOperations position. It had been previously agreed that this position will be\nstaffed by the backup Payload Specialists since they have been deeply trained\non experiment science and operation and will have established a strong working\nrelationship wi,th the payload flight crews. However, the U.S. philosophy of\nproviding only one backup pis from the mission management staff to back up the\ntwo initially selected U.S. Payload Specialists for operation of the U.S.\nexperiments differs from the ESA approach where two backup Payload Specialists\nfully trained on the ESA experiments will be available. This imbalance of\nbackup Payload Specialists between ESA and NASA raised the question of guidelines for shared responsibility in the POCC operation position assignments.\nIt was generally recognized that the U.S. backup pIs had developed\na deeper overall interface and understanding of both the ESA experiments and\nthe UeS e experiments through his mission management activities in developing\nthe investigator requirements for all the experiments as opposed to the ESA\npis who have worked only with the ESA experiments. Thus, it was agreed that\nthe U.S. backup pis will be assigned the key periods of operation in the poce\nduring the first two days for the initial flights followed by rotation with\nESA backup Payload Specialists for flights 3 and 4. Subsequent days will be\na repeat of the assignments.\n\n4 hours\nPreflight\n\n8 hours\nFlight Period\n\n4 hours\nPost Flight\n\nDays land 2\n\nESA III\n\nNASA\n\nESA 112\n\nDay 3\n\nNASA\n\nESA III\n\nESA 112\n\nDay 4\n\nNASA\n\nESA ff2\n\nESA III\n\nThe Mission Nanager also reserved the right of reevaluation of this\narrangement after initial operation similar to that stated above for the }lission\nScientist assignment.\n\n1\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nD\n\n.;\'\n\n,\n\n,\n\nU ";\n\nii.,\n\n~1.\n\n~.\n\n~\n\n0\nm\n\n",\n\'\n\n.~\n\nL\n\nPOCC Activity Planner Position\nIt was agreed that the poce Activity Planner position will be manned\nHO,"Tever, an ESA representative will assist the NASA\nActivity Planner for the purpose of gaining experience ~n this activity.\nby NASA throughout.\n\n}tlssion Implementation Plan\nApproval of the }~ssion Implementation Plan (MIP) being prepared by\nJSC has continued to be delayed due to lack of acceptance by the participating\norganizations. Another recent attempt to reach agreement during a telephone\nconference was not successful and a new round of rewrite is in progress.\nA key point generally accepted during discussion at the MSG meeting\nis that the present document as written differs substantially from the original\nintent. TIle initial understanding was to have a document which would summarize\nthe plan for operations emanating from the Flight Operations Plan, the Ground\nOperations Plan, and the Flight Support Plan. The ESA Program Manager pointed\nout that it is inappropriate for ESA to be expected to approve the document\nsince ESA is not involved in the present version.\nThe NASA Program Manager proposed that statements be included in the\ndocument to the effect that arrangements lvi th ESA are covered in the ASSESS II\nNASA/ESA Letter of Agreement and other existing NASA/ESA documents so that ESA\nconcerns and approval of the document can be dropped. This proposal was\naccepted thus leaving a continuing need for agreement and approval of the document within NASA.\nDocumentation\nThe NASA Program Manager postponed discussion of documentation since\nmost of the documentation is yet to be identified and prepared.\n}tlssion Schedule\nThe }~ssion Manager briefly reviewed the mission schedule as attached.\nHe emphasized that some changes have been required to delay integration of the\nU.S. experiments due to their late availability. Particularly, the EES will be\nlate, specifically due to late authorization by NASA Headquarters. The first\ntwo weekends, originally planned for real-time contingency need, are now fully\nscheduled.\nThe ESA Operations }tanager reviewed the ESA status of their simulation\nof the pre-Level III activities at SPICE using the ESA portion of the ASSESS II\npayload. He described the 990 mockup and living quarters used for their simulation including an ADDAS simulator, POCC, Payload Specialist selection, and\ntheir flight planning actiVities. The ESA Operations Hanager pointed out that\ntheir simulation activities will end on March 13 after which they must change\n\n~:;;v,\n\niioiI&it~\n\nQij,. .\n\n.\' ~."\n\n"\'l, ". ~,~\n\n.a. ,-,,,- ,,;~ \xe2\x80\xa2.-::.-:~!\n\'\'..\'\n\n.\xc2\xb7~\'~\':4 :-",.1.\n~.\n\n",,\'1"\n\n\'l\n\ni,\n\'\n\n~r....;,;.~l-.Io1iilbj~;:;&...."\'_\'h~\';\';"\xc2\xb7,,"\xc2\xb7 ~::2~~.Jt~-~j(~.. i,i1\' \'.. \'\\..J_\n\n...........\n\nall experiments to operate on U.S. electrical power and check them for satisfactory operation to be followed by packing and shipment beginning March 21.\nThey plan to make delivery of the ESA experiments to Ames by March 30.\nASSESS II Debriefing\nIt was agreed t:.hat the Dlajor debriefing meeting for the ASSESS II\nproject will be held at Ames the day following the constrained mission.

This was\nthe first opportunity for the ASSESS II investigators to meet together. Functions\nand responsibilities of the ItvG and the Chairman and Co-chairman are shown on the\nattached charto\nObjectives of the meeting were (1) to obtain first-hand information\nabou.t details and objectives of each experiment, (2) to gain an appreciation of\nthe mutual requirements and interfacing compromises necessary in mission planning in order for each experimenter to obtain meaningful data, (3) to identify\nand plan interfaces and data exchange for mutually supporting experiments,\n(4) to update the experimenters regarding the overall mission planning status\nwith the opportunity for Mission Management to get reactions and suggestions\nfrom the experimenters, and (5) to submit nominations by the Principal Investigators for Payload Specialists for the missiono In addition, ~lission Management\nrepresentatives had the opportunity at this meeting to expand and clarify interface i.nformation contained in the Investigator Requirements Document (IRD)\nIn\nfact, some of the IRD\'s had not previously been received from ESA experimenters.\nThe process of developing an easy-lo-comp1ete, yet adequate IRD has been an\nimportant learning process, both for Hission Management and for the experimenters\nas it will apply to Space1ab. Face to face discussions have proven highly\nefficient and are considered essential to expose the experimenters to the\ninterface alternatives and obtain hard answers from the experimenters to solidify\nmission planning. Such face to face discussions have also proven highly useful\nin informing the inv(\'stigato1\' and his team of the details of mission planning\nand the characteristics of carrier hardware.\n\n1\n\nI\n\n0\n\nAlso in conjunction with the meeting, and as part of an ongoing\nCV-990 flight project to Iceland, the aircraft was flown to the Cologne/Bonn\nairport which j.5 adjacent to DFVLR. Arrangements were made for the experimenters to visit the aircraft and observe installed and operating experiments\nand to di.scuss their own experiment situationu A special effort was made to\nacquaint them with the data system (ADDAS) and :f.ts interfacing requirements.\nThe ESA Progr,\'1m Nanager welcomed the group and described the ESA/SPICE\norganizational arrangement as it applies to ASSESS II and Spacelab management in\nEuropea The NASA Assistant Hission Manager from NSFC discussed the overall\nASSESS Program, the particular emphasiS of ASSESS II, and the involvement of all\nthe actual Space lab management elements. It was explained that the IWG, which\nis intended to be implemented for Spacelab as well as ASSESS II, serves in an\nadvisory capacity to Mission Management. However, it was emphasized that\ninputs from the investigators individually, as well as the IWG as a whole, will\n\nI\n\no\nD\n\nu\n11\nII\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\n7 7 . _ IMIIII\n\nbe carefully recognized and strongly supported within the limits of cost and\nmanpower resources. The ESA Program Manager stated that the ESA Mission\nScientist will be the ESA representative for all European experiments for\nASSESS II, and will be the channel for experiment information and critical\ndecisions.\nThe Principal Investigators each presented details of the various\nexperiments.\nThe NASA Assistant Mission Manager introduced the operational\nplanning activi ty being carried out by Mission Management with a brief explanation of the importance of getting a complete and accurate input from each\nexperimenter through the IRD. He pointed out that the integration analysis\neffort to consolidate the entire payload requirements is based on the IRD\ninputs, and that they also serve to formulate the total ~tission Plan including\nboth ground and flight operations. The ARC Manager described plans for\nlocation of the equipment aobard the aircraft including the central control\nracks for the various experiments. He explained the constraints imposed by\nviewing port availability and grouping of experiments to permit operation and\ncontrol by the Payload Specialists.\nMSFC representatives presented details of the flight operation\nplanning, the plan for integration and checkout of the experiments at ARC, and\nbriefly discussed the ~lission Control Center (MCe) and the Payload Operations\nControl Center (POCC) concepts to be implemented at ARC during the mission.\nThe experimenters were infornled that there are to be no check flights for the\nexperiments prior to the constrained flight period; instead, experiment flight\nreadiness will be verified by tests to be performed during the ground operations\nactivity.\nThe NASA Assi.stant Mission Manager concluded the f.lission r-Ianagement\npresentation to the IWG on mission planning activity by discussing the crew\nfunctions and training. Payload Specialist training will be essentially a\nfull-time activity beginning September 1. Two schedule options are still\nunder consideration leading to starting the constrained mission either on\nMay 15 or June 9, 1977.\nAn executive session of the IWG was conducted by the Chairman mainly\nto submit candidates for Payload Specialists. Much discussion ensued regarding\npis qualifications which ranged from capable technician/engineer with expertise\nin electronics and optics to a scientific background particularly for interpretation of star fields o It was generally agreed that the PiS must have intuition\nwith respect to the data quality. In Europe, the pIs opportunity had been\nwidely advertised. Many applications had been received, and so far, only very\ncoarse screening had been done. The EtiA Mission Scientist volunteered a deadline of August 1 for submittal of their candidates. In the U.S., some experimenters were still pondering the question of pis candidates, but the lack of\nfunding definition to the experimenters had basically prevented submissions.\nT~e Chairman established a deadline of August 6 for pis nominations.\nThe CV-990 data system specialist from ARC described the capabilities\nand operation of the ADDAS ~iata system together \'\\lith the experiment interfacing\nrequirements.\n\nB-3\n\n11\n11\nlJ\nrelative\nnew ones\ncided to\nboth for\n\nThroughout the meeting there was extensive di.scussion and suggestions\nto all aspects of the mission.

However, the ESA\nProgram Manager noted that the last minutes had not been sent to ESA for perusal\nbefore distribution. The Chairman stated that he will send the minutes to them\nfor approval in the future.\n~,\nThe NASA Assistant Mission Manager from MSFC reviewed the project\nstatus and reported that the mission is on schedule with a launch date for the\nconstrained flight of May 15, 1977. (This date was later moved to May 16 by\ngeneral agreement to avoid difficulties and extra overtime costs to start the\nmission on Sunday evening.) A round of visits to all the investigators was\ncompleted in late November to solidify information regarding experiment requirements and interfaces. Each Experimenter Requirements Document (IRD) was fully\nupdated with some exceptions where the experiment design and/or operational\nconsiderations had not progressed far enough to complete the information. A\nfinal formal session of analytical integration had just been completed at MSFC,\nthe results of which formed the be,sis for the IWG presentations.\n\nm\nm ,\'!.,\'\n..\n\nr\nml\'\nIII\n\n1:\n..\n\nlJj\n\n1\n\nI\xc2\xb7 \'\ni\nI\n\n1\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe IWG meeting was broken up into a first day of presentations\nfollowed on the second day by several working sessions and a summation meeting\nof conclusions and actions required.\nARC representatives reviewed the aircraft configuration for the\nmission. Several changes had been made sin~e the last IWG~ but the configuration presented was essentially final reflecting the latest inputs from the IRDso\nThe optical tracking art\'angement for the ESA solar phys:Lcs experiment is still\ndue and will probably require movement of their racks, but only slightlyo They\nalso presented the layout of the living quarters, configuration and contents of\neach of the "Spacelab" central consoles, and a summary of electrical power\nrequirements. Additional information was requested from some experimenters\nregarding electrical power as shown on that chart. Experimenters were also\nrequested to submit any special data display requirements to be shown on the\nclosed cj,rcuit TV display in the aircraft during flight. This request was\nmade in the lRO, but perhaps was not fully understood.\nIt was explained that, as opposed to Spacelab, the aircraft experiment\nsupport systems are not intended to be unattended. Therefore, some non-confined\npersonnel (ghosts) will fly on the mission to maintain the aircraft electronics,\nAnDAS system and stabilized mirror system, plus an ASSESS observer. The PI from\nNASA/Langley requested an additional "ghost" to hf\'ndle laser maintenance since\nhis ell:periment has not bec~ funded to improve the\'~r laser to Sp<i(\'.elab quali ty.\nIt was agreed to support this request.\n\nlJ\n\nDi~\n\nn\nD\n\no\nu\n\nB-8\n\nll\'\n\nD\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\nHSFC representatives presented a detailed schedule of ground operations\nto take place at Ames showing activities for every experiment and for functional\ncheckout of the entire payload. An off-the-aircraft pre-integration (Level IV)\nof th~ entire payload to be managed by MSFC was shown, which will employ a\nspecial payload checkout uni t (PCU). Tl:lis will be followed by integration of\nthe payload on the aircraft to be carried out under the jurisdiction of KSC\n(Level III, II, I). The Level IV payload checkout represents off-line payload\ncheckout of the Spacelab payload before it reaches the orbiter. Final agreement\nfor this plan for off-line checkout of\' the ASSESS II payload had not been\nreached with ESA, but this was the MSFC plan. A final decision was to be\nreached at the upcoming Mission Steering Group meeting.\nMSFC also presented a number of charts giving the guidelines for\nground operations with a request for experiment operations procedures from each\nexperimenter with due dates. They strongly emphasized the need for these procedures\nsince that information is the basis for much of the integration document preparation. In addition, GSE requirements were identified and discussed.\nA summacy was presented of the integrated payload mission planning\nincluding th~ guidelines used, a summary of experimenter requirements and\ncons.traints taken from the IRDs, and some details of each of the proposed\nflight tracks to accommodate the requirements. The ensuing discussion uncovered\nsome potential problem areas where some instruments would be turned on and off\nas their periods of opportunity become available in the integrated flight\nplanning for the entire payload. For instance, it was proposed that the JPL-SAR\nwould operate only over specified targets, and timelines would be built around\nthis plan. However, it was pOinted out that during previous flight experience\nwith that instrument, it was never turned off during flight which raised questions\nabout its operation. An action was taken to determine the ramifications of this\nproblem with the JPL PI who was not at the meeting. Also, the Langley PI must\nidentify tis specific interactive ground stations in the immediate future to\npermit solidification of flight track patterns. The DFVLR clarified a desire\nfor continuous measurements versus measurements only over specific truth sites.\nAlthough it was recognized that flight tracks may be altered in real\ntime during the mission for a variety of reasons, the constrained flight period\nwill begin with a hard schedule and very specific plans and timelines for each\nflight. PIs were encouraged to study the details presented at the meeting to\nassure that their requirements are appropriately accommodated.\nA preliminary detailed payload crew activity plan had been prepared\nfor one flight by the Mission Specialist and the U.S. Payload Specialists. It\nwas presented and discussed to show the detailed individual timelines which\nwill be used to guide each individual efficiently through the entire awake\nperiod. Specific time allocations were scheduled for all experiment operations\nincluding pre aircraft flight warmup and calibration, interactive flight operations of the various instruments, shutdown after landing, and the debriefing\nperiod. A similar complete timeline for the entire payload flight cr~w will be\nprepared for each flight, and will be used by the POCC as well as the onboard\n~rew as the baseline schedule.\n\n13-9\n\nThe preliminary sample payload crew activity plan was submitted to\nthe ESA representatives so that the timelines for the ESA Payload Specialists\ncan be developed in a similar manner. The ESA and NASA plans will then be\nmerged into a complete composite plan probably during the pre-integration\nactivity at Porz-Wahn when the total payload flight crew will be together.\nThe ARC Manager announced that arrangements look very favorable\nthat the U.S. Air Force will support the mission by providing relay of HF communications from the aircraft to the POCC at Ames throughout the flight period.\nThis will siwulate voice communications with Spacelab and permit real-time\ninteraction with the payload crew. However, the MSFC Assistant Mission Manager\npointed out that all communications with the crew will be shut down about 25\npercent of the time to simulate the black-out periods applicable to Spacelab.\nThis has not yet been scheduled but will apply to some of the HF communications\nduring flight as well as data and TV transmission when the aircraft is on the\nground--which is considered to be part of the "Spacelab" mission flight period\nand will be fully constrained.\nMSFC presented and discussed the Payload Operations Control Center\n(POCC) concept and arrangement including guidelines, organizational concept,\nindividual responsibilities, and the proposed physical layout. These plans\nare yet to be hardened with the JSC arra.ngement and interaction with the\nMission Control Center (MCC), and with Ames who will provide the facilities.\nHandling of data during the constrained period was discussed and a\ntypical POCC mission timeline for one day was presented showing how data will\nbe .. retrieved from the aircraft, the interactive use and scheduling of data\nterminals to permit PIs to analyze and scan the data output, interactive\np1anning for the next aircraft flight period utilizing inputs from the PIs\nand the Mission Scientist together with mission management and the professional\nflight planners, and also how external information such as weather satellite\ninputs will flow into the system. A schedule of data requirements milestones\nwas presented along with the guidelines and ground rules which \'will apply to\ndata handling during the constrained period to be properly compatible with this\nSpacelab flight simulation. A list of problem areas where more information was\nneeded from some experimenters was discussed along with open items yet to be\nfinalized\n0\n\nDuring discussion of the various open items and requests from the\nPIs for more information, the Langley PI observed that since mission management\nrepresentatives had actually filled out his IRD some time ago during discussion\nwit.h him, it was difficult for him to remember the details, and he has never\nreceived a copy of t!::e completed document. He recommended that a copy of the\nIRDs be sent to the PIs so they will have a baseline from "tlhich to submit\nfurther information. It was quickly agreed that this should have been done.\nMSFC will send a copy of each IRD to the respective PIs as soon as possible.\nA variety of action items and decisions, in addition to those shown,\ndeveloped during the presentations as follows:\n\nB-lO\n\nI\nI\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n1.\n\nThe LIDAR Experiment (DFVLR) needs space for PI-provided ground\nequipment and general concern developed about space for the PIs to\nprepare their experiments at Ames. The ARC Nanager will furnish\na proposed plan to HSFC to handle this problem.\n\n2.\n\nAn unresolved problem as to whether a tinung signal must be added\non one channel of the CP-100 recorder was discussed. This would\nelimir,ate a channel to be used for EHT measurements. The ESA\nMission Scientist will resolve this problem.\n\n3.\n\nASSESS Nission HanageITlen t will in terf ace wi th ground si tes in real\ntime during the mission to assure full coordination and realignnlent\nif and when schedules may change. PIs can and probably will interact\nwith the sites as required for planning and data interchange. MSFC\nwill solidify and coordinate the real time flight interaction.\n\n4.\n\nSome changes \\\\lere given during the meeting for developing the flight\ntrack planning for the analytical integration phase and jt was agreed\nthat as a result of the baseline requirements in exjstence as a result\nof the IWG meeting and the specific action items on this subject, MSFC\nwill perform one more iteration of flight planning to refine the\nflight tracks.\n\n5.\n\nThe ESA Mission Scientist specifically requested that the NASA\nHission Scientist attend the ESA pre-integration activity in Harch\nin Porz-Hnhn and particlpate in an ESA I\\~G to be held at that time\nto fully resolve ESA/US interactive experiment problems.\n\n6.\n\nAll experiment support equipment except some cryogenics will be\nassembled for loading prior to the mission flight. There will be\nno exceptions. However, mission management may decide not to carry\nall tapes and reels aboard the aircraft during specific flights if\nthe specific flight is weight critical and some data taking impairment \\~ould result, but the tapes and reels will be held in bonded\nstorage as if they wer~ on the aircraft.\n\n7.\n\nConcerns \\\'1ere expressed that full adherence to requirements of the\nNedical Experiment may interfere with ability of the flight crew\nto fully handle other experiments. Specifically, the attachment of\nelectrodes as an interference to get a full measure of rest was cited\nas an example. The ESA Hission Scientist will work out with the\nNedica1 Experiment PI a proposed set of gUidelines to be applied to\nthis problem during the missionu\n\n8.\n\nIn general, prepared food will be made available to the constrained\nflight cre\\\\I to eliminate encroHchment on their time to attend experiments in order to prepare food.\n\n9.\n\nDFVI.R has offered through SPICE to have a medical doctor available\nthroughout the t"lission to work with Ames to assist in any problem\nwhich may arise. The ARC Nanager \\vill coordinate this offer with\nthe medical office at Ames and notify ESA.\n\n1 \'\n\ni,\n\nI.\n\n10.\n\nSubsequent to the actual meeting, a point came up which indicated\nthat the water vapor meter, to be furnished through Ames as a\ngeneral mission support item, can be quickly reprogranuned from\nwater vapor measurement to ozone measurement. The NASA Mission\nScientist requested that ARC explore this possibility for quick\nchange during flight as it might apply to the solar flights where\nthere is a desire for both measurements.\n\nFollowing workin\xc2\xa3; sessions on the second day of the HIG meeting,\nconclusions and open items \\\xc2\xb7dth actions were summarized by the session leaders\nin the areas of (a) payload configuration - ARC, (b) ground operations - MSFC,\n(c) mission planning and flight operations - ~1SFC, and (d) POCC and data\nhandling - MSFC.\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI,\nI\nAPPENDIX C\n\nI.\n\nExperiment Problems During Flight\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\nII\nI\n\n~_~\'~\'\n\n_ _\nJ!y"lj.":ttJ\n\n*,1Iil li~stZb\n\n....\n\nidd\n\nIe\n\n......\n\n""~\n\nC-l\n\n[I\nJ\nThis appendix lists by experiment and flight the major recognized deviations\nfrom expected experiment operat:i.on including interfaces with the aircraft and\nexperiment support systems.\nLIDAR The LIDAR experiment performed well during the first seven flights\nexcepting flight two when a blown fuse was mistaken for a dead battery. The\nfuse was blown prior to flight two when the pis attempted to charge the battery\npack while the experiment was turned on. All data from that flight were lost.\nThis circuitry should have been tested during the Mission Simulation Test,\nsince daily battery charging was included in the pis timeline. However, it\nwas not tested until after the first aircraft flight which resulted in the\nblown fuse. Unfortunately, the problem was not discovered until preparations\nfor the next flight were fully underway with no time available to solve the\nproblem. During the last two flights, when the laser fired, the experiment\nfrequently did not see any laser light reflected from aerosols in the beam.\nIt was not clear at the close of the mission what caused that problem.\nThe LIDAR experiment was never fully mated to the central data system.\nSerious interfacing problems tv-ere encountered throughout all phases of payload\nintegration, and the problem identification vacillated between the central data\nsystem and the experiment. Just before launch a defective experiment component\nwas identifi.ed. Correction was made, but intermittent data transmission\npersisted during flight. Fortunately, data was r~c~rded on an internal experiment recorder so that no data was lost, but because of the interface difficulty\nwith the central data system, ability to obtq~~ quick-look data during the\nmission was impaired.\nCTM The CTM experiment achieved. good results operating in the night-skybrightness mode, but, because of a serious design deficiency, it did not do\nwell viewing the sun. This basic dlff:l.cuJ ts was due to the fact that the\nexperiment included no positive m~ans of guiding on the sun.\n\nn\n\\,;.}\n\'Ilj\n\n-I\xc2\xb7"\n\n1\';\'\\\n\n. ;i\n.\n\nAt the IWG meeting 1n July 1976 the CTM \'PI in discussion with the IHR\nPI (who used the sun as a light source for ozone detection) conceived a plan\nof mating IHR stablized mirror orientations to the independent CTI1 stabilized\nmirror and thus eliminated need for a CTM sun tracking addition to his experiment. Since the IHR experim~nt did include sun guidance optics, and its mirror\ncould follow lho sun, this idea should have, in theory, put CTIl on the sun\nwhenever the IRR was on the sun. However, the CT~l instrument, which viewed in\nthe far IR, could not "see" the sun from tht. ground so that, although an attempt\nwas made, the two experiments could not be boresighted prior to flight. Thus,\nthe first attempt by CTM to guide on the sun (flight eight) ended in complete\nfailure. Early in flight nine the stabilized mirror operators attempted a\ncrude mirror boresight by se~ting both azimuth and elevation to zero, as indicated by benchmarks on the mirror support structures, and comparing values fo~\nthose parameters as computed by the central data system for both mirrorf.; and\ndisplayed on closed circuit TV. The~e were initial difficulties in i~plement\xc2\xad\ning this unique fix in real-time, but concentrated effort on the part of the\nmirror operators and the central data system operator as the flight progressed\nachieved a satisfactory slaved operation of the CT~1 mirror through th~ computer\n\nC-2\n\njj\n\nI\nf"\n\nu\n\nsystem. The CTM experience demonstrates especially well the imporj:ance of\ncareful mission planning and of carrying out proper preflight testing if such\nproblems are to be avoided in flight.\nA CTM lock-in amplifier failed ea+ly in flight four. The PI was informed\nvia radio link, and, while no spare had been put aboard, management treated the\nsituation as though there had been a spare in stowage and allowed replacement\nof the amplifier instead of having the PIs attempt repairs.\nAWS An earlier single-camera version of the AWS experiment had been\nflown successfully on the CV-990 during ASSESS I without significant problems.\nHowever, during ASSESS II focus and/or sensitivity problems were encountered\non every flight for reasons not identified at the end of the mission. The pIs\nspent considerable time in flight attempting to improve the focus~ but he had\nlittle usable ground time to troubleshoot the problem during the first five\ndays of the mission, since camera operation required low ambient light levels\nat night. Finally, prior to flight six he was able to bring both cameras into\nexcellent focus, but an undiagnosed cause defocussed the right viewing camera\nimmediately after takeoff for the next flight, and during the flight the left\nviewing camera lost IR sensitivity. He was unable to remedy the problem with\neither camera during that flight. The backup pIs brought aboard after flight\nsix (see section 3.5) was considerably less familiar with the AWS experiment,\nand no attempt was made to operate the left viewing camera during flight\nseven. The AWS was not operated during the last two flights, in accordance\nwi th flight plans, since these were daytime flights.\nLAS The LAS experiment had been flown previously with good success at\nrelatIVely low altitudes and in an open port configuration on a small aircraft,\nbut it operated at considerably less than expected sensitivity throughout the\nASSESS II mission o Calibration mode operation during various integration\nphases was satisfactory, but no means were included to make a direct check of\nsensitivity because the experiment relied on forward motion of the aircraft to\nproduce a doppler shift in the laser beams reflected back to the aircraft from\nthe ground. The lack of sensitivity was immediately apparent on the first\nflight. After the second flight, suspecting that the intermediate frequency\nlay outside the experiment pass band, the pIs shimmed the laser packa~e\nso that the transmitted laser beam forward angle was i.ncreased by one\ndegree. This angle, which was directly proportional to the doppler shift of\nthe reflected laser beams, was never accurately determined. The PI originally\nspecified that the angle was to be 3.0 + 0.5 degrees in flight and requested\nverification, but that request for verification was withdrawn. The shift in\nlaser beam angle produced no dramatic improvement, so the pIs (PI), systematically checked out alignment of elements in the LAS optical package during\nflights five, six, and seveno Some minor adjustments were made and by the end\nof flight eight some measurable return was being recorded at or above 31,000\nfeet. However, the rettlrn \'signal never did become as great as expected.\nIHR The IHR experiment was flown on the CV-990 about nine months prior\nto theASSESS II mission. It was found then that the laser frequencies were a\n\nfunction of cabin air pressur~. The PI, by dilige.nt a ttention, could keep the\nfrequencies properly adjusted, but it was recognized that the operation would\nrequire far too much time for a pis to maintain adjustments and handle other\nduties on the ASSESS II mission, soOthe laser package was redesigned. This\nredesigned package produced less reference laser power than was desired, and\nwas the only part of the experiment which continued to perform poorly throughout the flight mission. The pis readjusted parameters controlling the laser\npower on each flight, but could not increase it.\nWhile all data was somewhat degraded as a result of low laser power,\non only two occasions (flights six and eight) did other significant operational problemR occur. On flight six the pollutant las~r ceased to function\nfor a short period for an unknown reason and had to be restarted, and on flight\neight the sun track monitor lost contrast so that sun tracking was degraded.\nIn addition, all data from one flight was lost when an instrument mirror cover\nwas not removed.\nIRA (Heudon/Groningen/MPI) The MeudonlCroningen por\'tion of the IRA\nexperiment had been flown on the CV-990 during the ASSESS I mission in 1975.\nOn that mission the pis was severely overworked to operate the experiment.\nFor ASSESS II, the telescope stabilization systr,tn was much improved and system\nredesign provided more automation. Also, the t-lPI sensor was added to the\nl-leudon/Groningen system for ASSESS II. NFl had had experience flying similar\nequipment, but their ASSESS II instrumentaHop had not been flown before.\nInternal experiment control of the telescope and optical aUgnment difficulties were responsible for most IRA problems. The IRA computer problem\nwas related to software, but was so subtle as to remain partially undiagnosed\nthroughout the mission even though computer manufacturer technicians were\ncalled in during the Level IV integration. A dropout problem was encountered\nduring all phases of integration and during flights one, four, five, and seven.\nThe pIs was usually able to br.ing the computer back up in four to five minutes.\nOn flight four only partial operation was restored, and no recovery was achieved\n011 flights one and seven.\nOn flight five full operation was restored.\nAn optical problem on the IRA was the most serious. Optical alignment of\nthe telescope was checked in the peu during Level IV integration, and was\nfound to be satisfactory. Hm.lever, the collimated source required to check\nalignment was not designed for use on the aircraft after flight integration\nand a final optical check could not be made. A large offset signal was apparent\non the first flight. Exact source of the problem was not determined, but\nasymmetry in motion of the secondary mirror seemed likely. The large offset\nsignal had to be subtracted out, and unfortunately it was of much greater\nmagnitude than the small signal of interest. Amplitude of the offset signal\nat the Groningen detector could be reduced by moving~the detector in the plane\nof the proper telescope focus, but this diminished the IR signal of interest.\nThe MPI detet\\tor could not be moved. During flight two, the pIs, on his own\ninitiative, managed to almost eliminate the offset signal, but in doing so, he\nreduced amplitude of the detected IR from the astronomical targets by a factor\nof two to three. A judgment was then reached with the PI to compromise in\n~educing the size of the offset signal only to a point where the signal did\n\nC-4\n\nD\n\nnot saturate the lock-in amplifier. The pis spent as long as 15 to 20 minutes\nduring each of the next two flights adjusting the position of the Groningen\ndetector to obtain an optimum combination of offset signal and IR astronomical\nsignals.\nAEES The AEES experiment had operational diffic~ties throughout the\nmission because of an antenna grounding problem which was not discovered until\nafter the actual Spacelab simulation period when the PI could personally inspect\nthe equipment without violating mission guidelines. The installation drawings\ndid not show that the mounting plate on which the 121.5 MHz antenna was mounted\nwas to be grounded to the frame of the aircraft. As a result, the plate was not\ngrounded, and static electric charges built up on the antenna during flight.\nThe resulting intermittent discharges, sometimes as often as every 20 seconds,\nproduced noise bursts on the 121.5 MHz signal channel. They were also picked\nup on the adjacent 243 MHz antenna, and interfered with aircraft radio signals.\nThe problem had little serious effect on experiment data return, but was a\ncontinuous source of annoyance and lost time to the pis who tried to identify\nthe problem by looking for interference from other electrical systems. This\nseemed logical at the time.\nA more serious AEES problem was instability of the noise generator used\nto calibrate all four receivers. Fortunately, the PI had included sufficient\nspares and instructions so that the pIs was able to keep the instrument in\noperation.\n\nMLS The MLS operational problems were minor and by themselves produced\nlittle-Ioss of data. However, the low level of instrument sensitivity associated\nwith the more automated mode of operation designed for ASSESS II was a serious\nproblem and resulted in very limited data return overall. There apparently\nwas insufficient time and manpower available to thoroughly develop the automated\nsystem, and it was not until after the constrained "Spacelab" flight that\nthe PI, using a more complex operational mode, accomplished sensitivity improvement.\nSAR The SAR had been operated successfully many times aboard the CV-990.\nIt wa;-taken directly from a previous CV-990 program to the peu for Level IV\nintegration, and was modified only to the exten.t of introducing pIs centralized\ncontrol. This only involved regrouping of experiment components and rewiring.\nInstallation drawings were not complete, and two independent dc power sources\nwere used to supply different parts of the experiment because the two sources\nwere convenient. The power sources were of reversed polarity and bucked each\nother, which resulted in insufficient voltage to drive the experiment data\nrecorders. Operational checkout after flight vehicle integration was satisfactory, because, unlike the flight conditions, only one recorder was operated\nat a time using independent power sources. Neither in the FCU, nor after\ninstallation in the aircraft was the whole experment operated as it was to be\noperated in flight with both recorders operating simultaneously.\nAfter the recorder problem surfaced on the first flight, efforts were\nmade to identify the difficulty, but the SAR remained inoperative through\n\n~\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7ttiB\xc2\xb7\n\nflights three and four. Finally, prior to flight five, the experiment was\ndeclared a failure by Spacelab standards. Flight mission rules were relaxed\nand the senior SAR technician went aboard and found the problem. One power\nsupply was bypassed and a cable was added between the Spacelab control rack\nand experiment racks to feed both recorders from the same dc power source.\nMission guidelines were relaxed on two other occassions for SAR, a circuit\ndiagram was up linked in an attempt to help solve the recorder problem, and,\nwhen an integrated circuit in the SAR failed, a replacement was carried aboard.\nMEDICAL The medical experiment performed satisfactorily. In two cases\ndischarged batteries were replaced from storage during flight, and a mechanical tape recorder problem was resolved by simply exchanging the bad tape\nrecorder for a spare in stowage. One pIs forgot to turn on his encephalograph\nfor five hours between flights two and three. Subsequently, the pISs each\nreceived reminders from the MIs just before going to bed.\n\ntl\'w.w~.\n\nu"\n\\\n\nul\n\nl\n\nU\n\nU\n\n1\n\nU\\\n\nU\nn!\nru\nru\nJJ\n\n'
