THe methods used to simulate and animate three-dimensional surfaces from two-dimensional imagery and digital elevation models are explained. A brief historic look at JPL's efforts in this field and several examples of animations, illustrating the evolution of these techniques from 1985, are shown. JPL's current research in this area is discussed along with examples of technology transfer and potential commercial application. The software is part of the VICAR (Video Image Communication and Retrieval) image processing system which was developed at the Multimission Image Processing Laboratory of JPL.", "title": "Three-dimensional perspective visualization", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T14:31:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19910013725, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Hussey, Kevin"}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Pasadena, CA, United States"}}, "id": "e7bcad8ae9e04e7c9e30e4112732a535"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19910013725, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19910013725, "id": "cc0ea191d236430eb1b119dac511b0d2", "publicationName": "National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Technology 2000, Volume 1", "publicationDate": "1991-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19910013725.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19910013725/downloads/19910013725.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19910013725/downloads/19910013725.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19910013725/downloads/19910013725.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
