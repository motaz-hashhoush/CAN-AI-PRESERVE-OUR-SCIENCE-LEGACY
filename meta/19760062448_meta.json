A market survey was conducted in which 35 civil applications of RPVs were identified. For a number of these uses, vehicle and system concepts were defined, benefit and cost comparisons were made with present methods, and the influence of safety and environmental implications was assessed. The results suggest a sizable potential demand for the use of RPVs in the civil sector, and some of the applications show promising cost savings over established methods. A focussed technology effort could provide the safety assurances needed for routine civilian operation of RPVs.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19760062448, "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics"}}, "meetingId": "727e7a1ec08f4a9580bdb004e8522d6a", "id": "826de52d44af48f4a8fc789889047b7c"}], "name": "Aircraft Systems and Technology Meeting", "location": "Dallas, TX", "id": "727e7a1ec08f4a9580bdb004e8522d6a"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19760062448, "id": "28957d55e9434aa3a088c85f2d9f8d30", "publicationDate": "1976-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
