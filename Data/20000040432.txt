active structural acoustic control system has been demonstrated\non a Raytheon Aircraft Company 1900D turboprop airliner. Both single\nfrequency\nand multi-frequency\ncontrol of the blade passage frequency\nand its harmonics\nwas accomplished.\nThe control algorithm\nwas a\nvariant of the popular filtered-x\nLMS implemented\nin the principal\ncomponent domain. The control system consisted of 21 inertial actuators\nand 32 microphones.\nThe actuators were mounted to the aircraft\'s ring\nframes.\nThe microphones\nwere distributed\nuniformly throughout\nthe\ninterior at head height, both seated and standing.\nActuator locations\nwere selected using a combinatorial\nsearch optimization algorithm.\nThe\ncontrol system achieved a 14 dB noise reduction of the blade passage\nfrequency\nduring single frequency\ntests. Multi-frequency\ncontrol of the\nfirst 1st, 2 "_ and 3 \'_ harmonics resulted in 10.2 dB, 3.3 dB and 1.6 dB\nnoise reductions respectively.\nThese results fall short of the predictions\nwhich were produced by the optimization algorithm (13.5 dB, 8.6 dB and\n6.3 dB).\nThe optimization\nwas based on actuator transfer functions\ntaken on the ground and it is postulated\nthat cabin pressurization\nat\nflight altitude was a factor in this discrepancy.\n\nIntroduction\nAn active structural acoustic control (ASAC) system has been demonstrated\non a Raytheon Aircraft\nCompany 1900D turboprop airliner.\nThe ASAC approach has been in development\nfor several years\n[1,2,3,4,5,6] and has been demonstrated\npreviously in at least one other test [34]. ASAC differs from the\nmore common active noise control (ANC) [35,36,37,7,8,9]\napproach in actuation method; ANC using\nloudspeakers\nversus ASAC\'s structural actuators.\nFor this flight test, inertial actuators were employed\nwhich were mounted directly to the 1900D frame.\nThe ASAC approach has been pursued with the\nexpectation\nthat a mature design will be more cost effective than an ANC system of comparable\nperformance.\nImprovements\nare expected in installation\ncosts, channel count and channel power\nrequirements.\nTwo new technologies\nwere tested in the ASAC design. The filtered-x LMS [10,11,12] controller was\nimplemented\nin the principal component\ndomain [13].\nThis uncoupled\narchitecture\nmakes possible\nprocessing efficiencies and controller stability beyond that of conventional\ncontrollers.\nAlso, the actuator\nlocations were optimized using combinatorial\nsearch techniques that were directed by predictions of noise\nreduction and control force [ 14,15]. Proper positioning of ASAC actuators has been shown to be critical\nin achieving good noise control [5,6,16].\nThe flight test objectives were to demonstrate stable noise control of the first 3 harmonics\npassage frequency,\nbpf, verifying controller performance\nand validating the optimization\nBoth single frequency and multi-frequency\ncontrol were accomplished.\n\nof the blade\npredictions.\n\nThe following sections present a description\nof the principal component\ncontroller, the optimization\nprocedure, the 1990D and the test configuration.\nResults are presented and discussed, and concluding\nremarks offered.\n\n3_\n\nPrincipal\n\nComponent\n\nController\n\nA principal\ncomponent\nleast mean squares (PC-LMS)\nalgorithm\nwas used as the adaptive\ncontrol\nalgorithm for these flight tests.\nThis algorithm is a transform domain version of the muki-channel\nfiltered-x LMS algorithm [7,12], and is described in detail elsewhere [13]. In PC-LMS the controller\nparameters (filter weights) are adapted in a transformed coordinate system that decouples the feedforward\ncontrol system at a single frequency.\nEach control channel is independent\nof every other channel.\nIn\ncontrast, the filter weights for the filtered-x algorithm are adapted in a coordinate system defined by the\ncontrol actuators, which are not usually independent of one another and can often show high degrees of\ninter-channel\ncoupling when many actuators are used. By decoupling the control channels, convergence\nrates and control effort penalties can be set for each channel independently.\nA block\n\ndiagram\n\nof a feedforward\n\ncontroller\n\nFigure 1.

The\n(mxl)\nvector d holds the error sensor responses to the primary noise field, and is called the primary\nresponse.\nincoming\n\nThe matrix I_I(z) is an estimate of the error path transfer function\nreference signal as part of the multiple error LMS algorithm [12].\n\nmatrix\n\nH(z),\n\nand filters the\n\nEach term in ( 1 ) depends on frequency\nco, and this dependence\nis implicitly understood in subsequent\nequations.\nThe frequency domain representation\nin ( 1 ) describes the controller operating at steady state,\nwith no transients, and should not be used to analyze the effect of delays in the error path transfer\nfunctions on the controller [7,11].\nThe PC-LMS algorithm is obtained\n( 1 ). The SVD of H is written\n\nby substituting\n\nthe singular\n\nvalue\n\ndecomposition\n\nH = USV u\n\n(SVD)\n\nof H into\n\n(2)\n\nwhere ()H denotes the complex conjugate transpose.\nThe (mxm) matrix U and (rxr) matrix V contain\nthe eigenvectors of HH H and H_H, respectively.\nThe (mxr) matrix S contains the square roots of the\neigenvalues, or singular values, of H_H.\nwhere si is the i\'h singular value.\n\nThe singular\n\nvalues are decreasing,\n\nsuch that\n\nsI > s2 > ...> sr ,\n\nSubstituting\ntheSVDof H into( 1 ) yields\ne=USVUw+d\n\n(3)\n\nUUe = SVUw + UUd\n\n_\'e =Sv\n\nThe columns\n\nof U and V are used to transform\n\n(4)\n\n+p\n\n(5)\n\nsensor inputs and actuator\n\nresponses,\n\nrespectively,\n\ninto the\n\nprincipal coordinates, or principal components\n(PCs), of the control system [13,17]. The vector _ = UHe\ndenotes the mapping of the sensor responses onto the PCs, and v = VHw denotes the mapping of the\nactuator inputs onto the PCs. The vector p = UHd is the mapping of the primary field onto the PCs.\nExpanding the transformed\n\nsystem given by ( 5 ) term by term produces\n\n_i - I sy_ + p_\n-[p_\n\n(6)\n\nfori=l,...,r\nfori=r+l,...,m\n\nassuming there are more error sensors than control actuators.\nEach PC error term, _i, thus depends only\non the corresponding\nPC control input, vi, and the mapping of the primary response onto the i\'h PC. The\nlast (r+l) through m PCs are not controllable, and constitute the residual field after control is applied.\nFigure 2 contains a schematic of a feedforward control system implemented\nusing the PC-LMS algorithm.\nThe filter weights, v, are adapted in terms of the PCs of the controller, and then transformed using V into\nactuator coordinates. The sensor responses are likewise transformed\ninto PC coordinates using U H and\nused in the recursive updates of the filter weights in PC coordinates.\nA recursive update for the PC control inputs, vi, is easily derived from the weight update expression used\nin the multiple error LMS algorithm. The adaptive algorithm for the i\'hPC weight, v i , is written [13]\n\n+\nCombining\n\n(7)\n\nthe step size, gi, and singular value, s,, into a single value yields a generalized\n\nupdate,\n\n(8)\n\nv,(n+O:v,(n)-a,\xc2\xa2,(n)\n\nwhere c_ is the step size parameter\ni\n\nfor the\n\nIt is often necessary\n\nthe control\n\nto constrain\n\ni th\n\nprincipal\noutputs\n\ncomponent.\nso they do not exceed\n\nphysical\n\nlimitations\n\nof the\n\ncontrolactuators. hiscanbedone two wayswith thePC-LMSalgorithm:1) disable\nT\nin\n(\nthehighorder\nPCchannelsssociated\na\nwithhigh controlforces[13,17,18], zeroing\nby\nthestepsizes,0q,or (2) applya\ncontroleffortpenalty limit themaximum\nto\nvalueof eachPCcontrolinput.

If sensor location is optimized\nfor greatest noise reduction, inevitably the optimum sensor topology would be one in which the sensors\nare not uniformly distributed throughout the cabin interior. Because the ultimate metric of noise control\nin aircraft interiors is the comfort of the passengers seated throughout the cabin, it was decided that a nonoptimized, uniform sensor array was the best approach. Using a uniform array also provides a measure of\nthe global control obtained by the system. Thus it is necessary to optimize actuator locations.\nSeveral\ndifferent methods have been applied to this problem [16,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26].\nA combinatorial\n\nsearch\nmethodwaschosen\nbased its simplicityandpastsuccess its application the actuator\non\nin\nto\noptimization roblem\np\n[15,27].\nCombinatorial\n\nSearch\n\nA combinatorial\nsearch systematically\nexamines all subsets of a large set of candidates, retaining those\nthat best meet some goal or performance\ncriterion.\nFor the purpose of optimizing actuator locations for\nmaximum\nnoise reduction,\na database of actuator responses\nat each candidate\nlocation must be\nconstructed\nand a procedure\nfor predicting\nthe noise reduction for any subset of actuators must be\nestablished.\nThere are pitfalls to implementing\na combinatorial\nsearch which can be avoided through proper choice of\ntechnique.\nOne problem is the size of the search space that must be traversed to locate the optimal subset.\nAs an example, consider an exhaustive search for a 25 element actuator array given 100 possible locations\nfor the actuators on the aircraft.\nThe number of trials that must be done is given by the combination\noperator:\n\n(13)\n\nwhere N a is the number of possible locations (100) and N is then size of the actuator array (25). This\nyields over 2.4x1023 possible combinations.\nAn alternative to exhaustive search is a goal directed search\nin which the optimal set is continually refined in the direction of ever increasing noise reduction through\nselective substitution.\nThis method has the drawback that it might settle into a local minimum that is far\nremoved from the global optimum.\nAttempts to climb out of the local minimum are complicated by the\ntendency for the search to eventually slide back into the same minimum, thus introducing cycling.\nTabu Search\nThe tabu search method avoids the pitfalls mentioned above and has been used successfully to construct\noptimum arrays of actuators and sensors [15,27]. Tabu search maintains a list of past configurations\n(the\ntabu list) which are checked regularly\nto prevent the cycling problem.\nTable I contains a list of\ncomponents that will be used in the following description of the tabu search algorithm.\n1)\n2)\n\nSelect an arbitrary state as Current\nState.\nLoop for N_ Iterations\na) Put Current\nState on Tabu List\nb) If Cost Function is minimum, save Current\nState.\nc) Evaluate Cost Function of all States in Neighborhood.\nd) Move to new Current State not on Tabu List which either\ni) Reduces the Cost Function the most, OR,\nii) Increases the Cost Function the least\n\nUsing this algorithm, the search will climb out of a local minimum and not cycle back. A drawback of\nthe tabu search algorithm is that it is not guaranteed to find the global minimum for any fixed number of\niterations less than those required for an exhaustive search. However, experience has shown that, for the\nactuator location problem, good solutions are found quickly.\nTaking again the example of finding the\n\nbest 5actuatorocations utof a possible each\n2\nl\no\n100,\niteration\nofthetabusearch\nalgorithm require75\nwill\nevaluations thecostfunction(thesizeof theNeighborhood). hetabusearch\nof\nT\nalgorithm typically\nwill\nfinda goodsolution lessthan100iterations\nin\n(atotalnumber f 7,500\no\nevaluations trials).\nor\nTheeffectiveness thetabusearch\nof\nalgorithm\nhinges\nontheaccuracyf thecostfunction(predictedoise\no\nn\nreduction)\nandthecoveragef the candidateool.

Although representative\nof what the actual control system\nwould do, such an approach greatly increases the computation required because a penalty factor must be\niteratively derived for every actuator in each new actuator set constructed\nduring optimization.\nIt has\nbeen demonstrated\n[15], that a uniform penalty matrix, i.e., one in which the values of R are equal, is\nadequate for purpose of finding an optimal actuator set as long as all calculated actuator forces are below\nthe constraint limit. A uniform penalty value, r., can be approximated\nusing an expression derived by\nRossetti [18].\n\nru = Sm, x\n\nSmin\n\n( 20 )\n\nWN13x\n\nIn ( 20 ) Sin=and sn_ are the maximum and minimum singular values of the transfer function matrix, H,\nn\nrespectively.\nThe force constraint limit is w ..... . It has been observed that ( 20 ) produces a conservative\nvalue for r,, that is, one in which the resultant forces are well below w,a x. However, this doesn\'t seem to\nperturb the search from the optimal solution and once the optimum actuator set is found, the constrained\nminimization procedure can be used to arrive at a better prediction of the actual noise reduction, ignoring,\nof course, coherence effects.\nCoherence\n\nin the Noise Prediction\n\nSolution\n\nFor given coherence, 7_, between the control\nlimited, noise reduction is given by [7,29].\n\nsignal and the primary\n\nAd B =lOlOglo(l-_\n\nsource,\n\nthe maximum,\n\n\'2)\n\n(21)\n\nThis solution ignores force limits.

This relationship\nwas further clouded given that, for the flight test, the actuators would\nbe installed in pairs, one on either side of the ring frame, both acting in phase to increase in-plane force\nand to reduce tortional forces acting on the frame. A preliminary test was performed to validate the use of\nthe single clamped actuator for the survey. These results are discussed in the section titled Actuator\nAuthority, page 13.\nThe actuator is shown in Figure 3 mounted in the clamp. The clamp was able to be fitted to 82 locations\non the 1900D frame as shown in Figure 4. Thirty two microphones\nwere mounted as described in the\nsection on Test Configuration.\nTransfer functions were obtained at the bpf and 4 higher harmonics.\n\nPressurization\n\nThe\n\nEffects\n\nactuator\n\nlocation\n\npressurization\nmight\n\nwere\n\noccur\n\ninvalidate\n\nas the\nthe\n\nsurvey\ncabin\n\nactuator\n\nchanges\n\ncan have\n\ncontrol\n\npredictions\n\nunpressurized\n\nwill\n\nin the\n\npressurized\n\nMulti-Frequency\n\nThe\n\nThe\n\nlocation\n\nwork\n\nin-flight,\n\noptimization,\n\ntransfer\nloss\n\nthat\n\nIn [30] noise\nsection\n\nfor\n\nobtained\n\nfunctions\n\nat the higher\n\ncould\n\npressurization\n\nfuselage\n\nwith\n\nthat\n\nthey\n\nsystem.\n\nof control\n\nof cabin\n\nfunctions\n\nin\n\ncapability\n\nall become\n\nset optimized\n\nbe necessary\n\neffects\n\nsignificant,\n\naircraft\n\nhowever,\n\nespecially\n\nit may\n\nan\n\nsome\n\nharmonics,\n\nan actuator\n\nwere\n\ndemonstrated\n\nuse\n\nexhibits\n\nThe\ntransfer\n\nof an ASAC\nof\n\nconditions\n\nhigher\n\nthat\n\nhas\n\nmodel\n\n1S\' harmonic\n\nonce\n\n[30]\n\nelement\n\n2 na and\n\nchanges\n\nand stability\n\nBoth\n\nindication\n\ncabin.\nactuator\n\nwith\n\nunstable\n\nground-based\n\nharmonics.\n\nTo\n\nto acquire\n\nthe\n\ntotal\n\nand\n\ntransfer\n\nreduction\n\nincrease\n\ncandidate\n\ntransfer\n\nor even in flight.\n\nOptimization\n\nMulti-frequency\n\nactuator\n\nthe weighted\n\na finite\n\nII.\n\nas predicted\n\nactuator\n\nRecent\n\nconditions.\n\nstable.\n\nconditions,\n\nIf these\n\non the performance\n\nsee Table\n\nnot perform\n\npressurization.\n\nusing\n\nis a strong\n\nin an unpressurized\n\nin the structural/acoustic\n\noptimization.\neffect\n\nobtained\n\nremains\n\nThis\n\non the ground\n\nunder\n\npressurized\n\nbut\n\nconfidence\nunder\n\nlocation\nwere\n\nuncontrollable.\nfunctions\n\nstiffened\n\nconditions,\n\npressurization,\n\ntaken\n\ndue to the changes\n\na pronounced\n\nand\n\nunpressurized\n\nwas\n\na concern\n\nlocation\n\noptimization\n\nsum over the frequencies\n\nwas\n\naccomplished\n\nof interest\n\nJ,o,\n\nusing\n\nas the search\n\nnoise\n\nas given\n\naZJi\n\n= Z\n\ncost\n\nby\n\nfunction.\n\n( 26 )\n\ni=1\n\nThe parameters,\nevaluated:\nwas\n\nai, are defined\n\nlinear,\n\noriginally\n\nharmonics.\n\ndBA\n\nand\n\nintended\nLoudness\n\naccording\n\nloudness\n\nto design\nlevel\n\nto the weighting\n\nlevel\nthe\n\nweighting\n\nas shown\n\ncontrol\n\nsystem\n\nindicated\n\nmethod\n\nin Figure\n\nthere\n\nfor the\nwould\n\nused..\n\nThree\n\n5, Figure\nblade\n\n6, and\npassage\n\nweighting\nFigure\n\nmethods\n\nfrequency\n\nbe no subjective\n\nbenefit\n\nand\n\nfrom\n\ncontribute\n\nperformed\n\nusing\n\nPC\n\nto over half the noise\n\nboth the linear\n\n(unweighted),\n\nalgorithm\n\nis implemented\n\nFor these\n\nand A-weighted\n\nreasons\n\nthe optimization\n\nIt\nfirst\n\n4\nthe\n\nThe A2 na and 3 ra\n\nand control\n\nwas\n\ncost functions.\n\nOptimization\n\nThe\n\nnoise\n\ncontrol\n\nsection,\n\nPrincipal\n\nstability\n\nand performance\n\nare associated\nby using\n\nComponent\n\nvalue\n\nfunction)\nalternative\n\nmaximum\npower\n\nsingular\n\nnoise\n\ncost function.\n\ndecomposition\n\n(cost\n\nController.\n\nof each\n\nHowever,\ncandidate\n\nprincipal\n\nof the\n\nand higher\nequations\n\ncontrol\n\na great\n\nset must\n\nof the\n\nthe higher\n\nas given\n\nthis adds\nactuator\n\ncomponent\n\nfeatures\n\nby not controlling\n\nvalues\n\nprediction\n\nin the\nOne\n\ncan be achieved\n\nwith smaller\n\nthe PC domain\n\nthe optimization\n\nAn\n\nreduction.\n\nits\n\ncontrolling\n\nhigher harmonics.\nThe linear (unweighted)\nresults are similarly\ndominated\nby the fundamental.\nweighted\ncurve shows\nthat the 4 \'h and 5 \'h harmonic\nmay not be worth controlling,\nbut the\nharmonics\n\nwere\n\n7 respectively.\n\ndomain\nPC\n\norder\n\nforces.\n\nprincipal\n\nis that\n\n( 10 ) through\n\ndeal of computational\nbefore\n\nin the\nincreased\n\ncomponents\n\nThis functionality\n\nby equations\nbe taken\n\nas described\n\ncontroller\n\nwhich\n\ncan be simulated\n( 12 ) to compute\n\noverhead\n\nthe associated\n\nas the singular\nnoise\n\nreduction\n\nis computed.\napproach\n\nforce\n\nin the low\n\nto bias\norder,\n\nhas been\n\nused\n\nthe optimization\nmost\n\nefficient\n\nwhereby\nprocedure\nprincipal\n\nthe actuator\ntowards\ncomponents\n\nforce\n\nconstraints\n\nconcentrating\nas possible.\n\nare purposely\n\nas much\n\nset below\n\nof the primary\n\nAs an example\n\nconsider\n\nsource\na 12\n\nactuator, 32 microphone\ncontrol system.\nSelecting a random set of actuators from the database of 82\npossible locations results in singular values as shown in Figure 8. This shape for the singular values is\ntypical, regardless\nof optimization.\nThe larger, low order, singular values have greater capacity for\ncontrolling the acoustic power that is mapped into their respective domains.\nThe fraction of the total\nprimary source acoustic power in the principal components\nfor the random actuator set are shown in\nFigure 9. This system will not achieve good noise reduction because too much acoustic power is\nconcentrated\nin the higher order PCs which are either uncontrollable\nor difficult to control (due to small\nsingular values). A set of actuators optimized using nominal constraints improves the design by shifting\nmore acoustic power into the 12 controllable PCs, Figure 10. Further improvement\ncan be achieved by\noverly constraining the maximum actuator force as shown in Figure 11. Here the majority of the acoustic\npower is concentrated\ninto the first few PCs, matching the authority available through the larger singular\nvalues.\nOptimization\n\nResults\n\nThe optimization results are presented in three sections.\nThe first section describes a sensitivity analysis\nwhich evaluates the consistency of the actuator survey data. The second section discusses the relationship\nbetween the number of actuators and noise reduction.\nFinally, the third section describes the process by\nwhich the optimized actuator set was derived.\nSensitivity\n\nAnalysis\n\nIt has been observed during previous tests on NASA\'s Composite Cylinder [5,31] that the performance\nof\nan optimized actuator set can vary widely with small changes in the actuator transfer functions. Figure 12\nshows the sensitivity of the predicted noise reduction obtained with an optimum set of actuators on the\nComposite Cylinder when the magnitude and phase of the actuator transfer functions are varied + 5% for\n500 trials. Notice that the mean of the distribution is about 6 dB below the noise reduction predicted for\nthis set of actuators with the bulk of the distribution spreading over several dB. This indicates that small\nerrors or anomalies in acquiring the actuator transfer functions can have a large impact on optimization\nresults and thus lower the confidence\nthat the predicted noise reduction of an optimized set will be\nachieved.\nThe 1900D actuator set has been found to be insensitive to transfer function variation, see Figure 13.\nHere, the noise reduction for the optimum set is -14.2 dB, just 0.5 dB from the mean of the distribution\nwith most of the distribution lying within 1 dB. It is thus highly likely that the optimum set will perform\nas predicted (ignoring pressurization\neffects as discussed earlier).\nNumber\n\nof Actuators\n\nvs. Noise Reduction.\n\nThe number of actuators required for the control system was roughly estimated to be 24 actuator pairs\n(see section, Actuator Authority, page 13). Once the actuator transfer functions became available, a better\nestimate was made by constructing\nand evaluating\noptimum sets of several sizes.\nFigure 14 shows\npredicted noise reduction for optimized actuator sets of 1 to 24 actuator-pairs.\nIt can be seen from the\nfigure that the noise reduction obtained per added actuator-pair decreases after 12 actuators.\nOver 12 dB\nof attenuation is achieved with 12 actuator pairs and just over 14 dB at 24 actuator-pairs.\nThe 12 channel\nsystem delivers 85% of the noise reduction with 50% of the actuators and may be considered a preferred\ndesign. The 12 channel system is also a better test of the optimization procedure\'s capability in that the\ndesign leaves less room for error compared to the added redundancy of the 24 channel system.\nDuring\nthe flight test, 2 configurations\nwere tested, a full configuration\nusing all (21) available actuator channels\n\n10\n\nanda reduced\nconfiguration ith 12channels.\nw\nFinal Design\nThe actuator set used in the noise control flight tests was selected using an overly constrained\noptimization\n(see section, PC Optimization)\nover the first 3 harmonics.\nBoth 21 actuator-pair\nand 12\nactuator-pair configurations\nwere derived for the planned flight tests. The 12 actuator-pair configuration\nwas modified slightly so that it was a subset of the 21 actuator-pair set. Table III contains the frame-bay\nlocations for both the 21 actuator-pairs\nand the 12 actuator-pairs.\nFigure 15 shows the numbering of the\nbays on the 1900D as viewed facing forward in the cabin. Figure 16 shows all 21 locations in a view\nwhere the frames are unwrapped with bay #1 on the port or left side. The 1S\'frame is closest to the\ncockpit, just behind the door, and is placed at the top of the figure.\nThe predicted noise reduction is listed in Table IV for linear and A-weighted\ncases.\nAlthough the Aweighting produces a smaller overall noise reduction figure, the value of the 1S\' harmonic reduction is\nidentical to the linear case and the values of the 2na and 3ra harmonics increase only slightly.\nThis is\nfurther evidence of the dominance of the 1_\'harmonic.\nThe actuator forces and primary source principal component distributions\nfor the three harmonics are\nplotted in Figure 17 through Figure 22. Actuator force is presented in terms of the voltage applied to the\nactuator. During preliminary testing, it was found that a single actuator would tend to produce distortion\nif operated much above 7.5 Vrms. To model an actuator pair, the total force summed across the three\nharmonics was limited to 15 Vrms. The highest component of force for an actuator-pair\nwas 11.6 Vrms\nin the 2na harmonic, versus 9.1 Vrms in the 1_ and 8.5 Vrms in the 3ra. The total force is taken as the\nsquare root of the sum of the squares of the forces across the 3 frequencies\nas it is desired to limit the\npower dissipated in the actuator.\nThe total force for the actuator-pairs\nis shown in Figure 23. The\nmaximum actuator force is 14.7 Vrms.\nThe noise controller used only the first 18 principal components due to processing limitations in the DSP\ncontroller.\nBecause of this, it was important to concentrate as much of the primary source in the first 18\nprincipal components\nas possible.\nThe principal components of the first harmonic are well constructed.\nThe 2 naharmonic PCs are good, while the 3ra harmonic PCs are only fair. The poor fit in the higher\nharmonics may be due to the placement of the microphones.\nAlthough the singular value decomposition\ncreates an orthogonal coordinate system, the system is not guaranteed to relate to physical modes of the\nstructural acoustic system, especially if the mode structure is not sampled adequately.\nIf the physical\nmodes are not present in the primary source PCs, then it can be expected that the actuator responses may\nnot map well. The section on Interior Noise Field will look more closely at this problem.\n\nThe\n\nRaytheon\n\n1900D\n\nThe Raytheon/Beech\n1990D, Figure 24, is one of the most widely used turboprop airliners in the industry.\nThe aircraft can carry 19 passengers 2900 km at a maximum cruise speed of 533 kph. The interior cabin\nis shown in Figure 25. Other aircraft specifications\nare listed in Table V. The 1900D has a 4 blade\npropeller with a blade passage frequency (bpf) of ~103 Hz.

The noise\nfloor is below 70 dB thus providing a range of 40 dB for possible reduction of the 1_\'harmonic.\nHowever,\nmaximum noise reduction is limited by the coherence between the noise field and the reference used by\nthe controller.\nAn estimate of the maximum obtainable noise reduction can be made using the coherence\nof the primary field with the synchrophase\nsignal that was used as a reference in the controller.\nFigure 33\nshows the coherence of the microphone with the synchropase signal over the frequency range of 50 to 550\nHz.\nTable VI lists the harmonic frequencies with associated coherence and maximum noise reduction\npossible.\nIt can be seen that if the controller maintains perfect synchrony with the engines, then a\nmaximum of 20 dB noise reduction is possible on the 1_\'harmonic.\nTest\n\nConfiguration\n\nA list of the flight test equipment is given in Table VII and a block diagram of the system is shown in\nFigure 34. The control system used 32 microphones\nand 21 actuator-pairs.\nThe controller, conditioners,\namplifiers and digital tape recorder were arranged in 2 racks as shown in Figure 35 and Figure 36. The\ntrim panels and seats were not installed in the aircraft.\nController\nThe controller consisted\nof a rack-mounted\ncomputer with digital signal processor\n(DSP), I/O and\nsynchrophase\ninterface.\nThe DSP board held two TMS320C40\nprocessors.\nThe DSP processors\ncommunicated\nover a proprietary bus to the 3 I/O boards.\nEach I/O board had 16 input and 8 output\nchannels.\nThe synchrophase\ninterface converted the propeller shaft synchrophase\nsignal into a TTL\ncompatible\nsignal which was then routed into a DSP interrupt.\nIn the DSP, an internal timer was\n\n12\n\nsynchronized theinterrupt ignalby a software\nto\ns\nphase-locked\nloopalgorithm.ThePLL settheinternal\ntimerto operate mukipleof 48 times the interrupt rate to establish a sampling rate of approximately\nata\n1238 Hz that would be directly proportional\nI/O boards were set to 723 Hz and provided\n\nto the propeller shaft speed (~25.8 rps).\n-18 dB roll-off per octave.\n\nFikers\n\non-board\n\nthe\n\nAcquisition\nThe microphones\nwere Modal Shop 130B10 with 130Pll preamplifier.\nMicrophone\nspecifications\nare\nshown in Table VIII and typical calibration\ncurves for the 130B10 are shown in Figure 37.\nThe\nmicrophones\nwere clamped to the ring frames and protruded into the cabin about 20 cm from the skin as\nshown in Figure 38. The microphones\nwere uniformly distributed, 4 mics on a ring frame (as shown in\nFigure 39) with the lower and upper microphones\nroughly corresponding\nto seated and standing head\nheights, respectively.\nThe 8 frames closest to seat locations were instrumented.\nTwelve accelerometers\nwhere installed on the 1900D ring frame adjacent to the actuators to sample frame vibration during\ntesting. The accelerometers\nwere of type PCB A352B65 with approximately\n105 mV/g sensitivity.\nThe\nmicrophones\nand accelerometers\nwere connected to PCB 584 signal conditioners.\nThe 584 provides 16\nchannels of ICP \xc2\xaepower and conditioning.\nNo fikering or gain ranging was done in the 584. All sensors\nplus the master and slave synchrophase\nsignals were recorder on a Metrum RSR 512 digital tape recorder.\nActuation\nThe actuators were of type Motran IFX 15-100.\nThese are inertial actuators made especially\nfor\ninstallation on an aircraft ring frame. A sketch of the IFX 15 is shown in Figure 40 and specifications\nfor\nthe actuator are summarized in Table IX. Typical response curves are shown in Figure 41 and Figure 42.\nThe compact size and high force was achieved by the use of Tungsten for the mass.\nThis greatly\nincreases actuator cost, but, as will be shown later, these high forces may not be necessary in practice,\nthus opening the door for cheaper designs.\nThe actuator\n\nresonant\n\nfrequency\n\n(95 hz) was tuned to be just below the 1900D blade pass frequency\n\n(103\n\nHz) to avoid the steep phase change that occurs around resonance.\nThe coil resistance (7.5 f2) was chosen\nto be compatible\nwith the Rane MA 6S multi-channel\naudio amplifiers that were used to power the\nactuators.\nActuator\n\nA uthority\n\nTo provide a basis for\npreliminary evaluation\nThree versions of the\n1900D\'s ring frame in\ninterior (5 microphones\nThe actuators\nsingle versus\nharmonics of\nactuator pair\nbolted versus\n\nestimating the number of actuators that would be needed in the control system, a\nof the actuator\'s noise control authority was made on the 1900D in a ground test.\nactuator with resonant frequencies\nof 95, 180 and 267 Hz were installed on the\nthe prop plane.

The synchrophaser\nwas not working during the morning flight, which greatly reduced the\ncoherence between the synchrophase\nsignal from the port engine and the interior noise field. As a result,\nthe noise reduction levels obtained during this flight were disappointing.\nFortunately, the synchrophaser\nwas repaired before the afternoon flight, and good noise reduction results were obtained on that flight.\nMost of the discussion here will focus on the second flight, although data from the first flight will be\nmentioned briefly to illustrate the impact of low coherence on control system performance.\nThe section begins with a description of the test procedure.\nThe measured data\nincluding: coherence data for the control system, properties of the transfer function\nreduction results for various test configurations.\nTest\n\nare discussed next,\nmatrices, and noise\n\nProcedure\n\nThe two flights followed similar flight profiles with different test points obtained during each flight. The\nfirst flight was originally intended to verify stable operation of the control system while controlling\nindividual harmonics of the bpf. Assuming all went well on that flight, the controller would then be used\nfor simultaneous\ncontrol of multiple harmonics during the second flight. Unfortunately\nthe results from\nthe first flight were quite disappointing\nbecause of the inoperable\nsynchrophaser,\nbut nonetheless\nthe\nbasic plan for the two flights was followed.\nThe approximate flight profile for both flights is illustrated in Figure 46. The flight began with a climb to\na cruising altitude of 15000 feet, at which point the pilot reduced the engine speed from the nominal\nengine speed of 1550 rpm to 1440 rpm.\nThis shifted the propeller blade passage frequency\nand its\nharmonics away from their normal operating frequencies, thereby allowing the control system to measure\nthe transfer functions between actuators and error sensors at the normal operating frequencies.\nThe\ntransfer functions\nwere measured by exciting an individual actuator pair with one of the first three\nharmonics of the normal bpf while recording the microphone responses.\nOnce the system identification\nwas completed, the pilot restored the engines to their normal operating\nspeed and the noise reduction tests were started. The test points obtained during the two flights are listed\nin Table X. The first column in the table gives the mn number for the test points; these numbers will be\nused in the subsequent discussion of the results. The next two columns contain a description of each test\npoint and the approximate\nlength in minutes of each test.

Experimentally\nmeasured values of the coherence\nare discussed here, including comparisons for synchronized\nversus unsynchronized\npropellers, and single\nengine versus two engine flight conditions.\nThe reference signal was generated on the DSP synchronously\nwith the synchrophase\nsignal taken from\nthe port engine.\nOne would therefore expect relatively good coherence between the reference and the\nnoise field created by the portside propeller.\nBecause the interior noise field contains contributions from\nthe port and starboard propellers,\nthe coherence\nmay be reduced, dependent on the precision of the\naircraft\'s synchrophaser.\nAnother factor contributing\nto reduced coherence may be the presence\nof\nuncorrelated effects such as aerodynamic\nbuffeting.\nFor these measurements,\nthe path from the internal reference to the response of each microphone\nwas\ntreated as a single input/single output system. Denoting the reference signal input by the symbol x, and\nthe response of a single microphone by y, the coherence at the discrete frequency fk was computed as\nd_y (fk 12\n\n;2y\n(fk):\n\n( 27 )\n\n(fk)dyy\n(fk)\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nwhere Gxy_) is the estimated cross-spectral\ndensity, and G_)\nand G_)\nestimates. The density functions were estimated using the procedures described\nof [33].\n\nare auto-spectral\ndensity\nin Sections 11.5 and 11.6\n\nThe primary noise field in the aircraft is not necessarily stationary, which complicates accurate estimation\nof spectral density functions.\nLong records of time domain data are useful for reducing variance in the\nestimate due to random noise, but if the characteristics\nof the signal change over the course of the record,\nthe resulting estimate will be biased. As a compromise between variance and stationarity considerations,\nthe spectral density functions were estimated by averaging\n15 data records of 1200 points each. The\nrecords were nearly consecutive\nin the time domain, but the time required to upload each 1200 point\nrecord from the DSP to the computer prevented continuous records from being accumulated.\nAs a result,\nno overlap was used between adjacent records when computing the spectral density estimates.\nAssuming\na nominal engine rate of 25.8 rps, the sample rate was\n\n1238.4 Hz = (25.8 rps) * (48 samples/revolution).\n\n3_5\n\nA 1200point datarecordcontained underone second data,while the ensemble records\njust\nof\nof\ncontained\napproximately\n15secof data,includingthe very smalltime intervalsfor uploading.

The x-axis denotes the microphone channel ranging from\n1 to 32, except for channel 7 which was inoperable during the tests and therefore is not plotted.\nThe\ncoherence is shown at the first three harmonics of the blade passage frequency, which are denoted as bpf,\n2bpf, and 3bpf.\nThe coherence\nvalues are generally high, and show a slight drop with increasing\nharmonic number.\nOne would expect to see greater microphone\nto microphone\nvariation at the higher\nfrequencies where the wavelengths are shorter.\nThe relatively\n\nhigh coherence\n\nvalues\n\nshown in Figure 47 can be contrasted\n\nwith those in Figure 48, which\n\nwere measured during the first flight when the synchrophaser\nwas inoperable. During this first flight, the\ntwo propellers were essentially acting as independent noise sources at the blade passage frequency and its\nharmonics.\nBecause the reference signal was only synchronized\nto one of the engines, the primary\nresponse due to the other engine acted as an incoherent noise source, greatly reducing the overall\ncoherence values.\nThe coherence was also measured with one engine running at a reduced speed, thereby removing its\ncontribution\nto the primary noise field at the first several harmonics\nof the normal blade passage\nfrequency.\nThese data were measured\nduring a preliminary\nflight test in May of 1998, and were\ncomputed using the procedure described above.\nThe coherence\nwith only one engine running at the\nnormal operating speed is shown in Figure 49, while the coherence with both engines running at the\nnormal speed is shown in Figure 50. There is a slight drop in coherence when the second engine is added,\nbut the change is very small, and is certainly within the range of experimental\nerror. Note that the data in\nFigure 47 and Figure 50 were measured several months apart but represent the same operating conditions,\nand therefore indicate some of the variability in the primary noise field.\nSystem\n\nIdentification\n\nA feedforward control system requires a model of the transfer functions between control actuator outputs\nand error sensor inputs to correctly update the control filter weights.\nThese transfer functions can be\nmeasured in a number of ways, either on-line while the controller is running or off-line, as was done for\nthe current flight test. The conditioning\nof the transfer function matrices at the three bpf harmonics\nis\ndiscussed here.\nThe transfer functions were computed in-flight\noperating at a reduced rpm. The measurements\ntime to maximize the coherence from the actuator\nhistory of the input to the i*hactuator is denoted\n(i,j) *helement of the transfer function matrix was\n\nbefore the controller was tumed on, with the engines\nwere done with one actuator and at one frequency at a\ninput to each microphone response. Assuming the time\nby x and the response of the j,h microphone is y, the\ncomputed as\n\n3_6\n\n(28)\nA\n\nA\n\nThe quantities\nG xy_) and\nG x_)\nare cross-spectral\nand auto-spectral\ndensity function estimates,\nrespectively.\nThe density functions were measured using the same data record length and bin spacing that\nwere used for the coherence measurements\ndescribed above.\nThe condition number of the transfer function matrix at each frequency from ground test and the morning\nand afternoon flights, is listed in Table XI. The condition number is the ratio of the largest to the\nsmallest singular value of the matrix and indicates the degree of ill-conditioning\nin the matrix.\nThe\ncondition number at the first harmonic in both flights is very high, and indicates some ill-conditioning\nin\nthe transfer function matrix. The ground based condition number is much lower. From the theory of\nfeedforward adaptive control algorithms [11,17], a high condition number means the convergence\ntimes\nfor the last PC will be much greater than for the first PC. Depending\non the primary noise field, this\ncould also mean the last few PCs will require much greater control efforts than the first PCs.\nThe\ncondition numbers at the second and third harmonics of the bpf are not as high, and as a result there\nshouldn\'t exist such a wide discrepancy between the convergence\ntimes of the first and last PCs at this\nfrequency.\nIt should\nharmonic\nPC-LMS\nsizes for\naccelerate\n\nbe noted than in a normal filtered-x LMS controller, the high condition number at the first\nwould have a negative impact on the convergence\nof the control system, but its effect on the\nalgorithm is not as pronounced.\nThe PC-LMS algorithm provides a means to set different step\neach PC, and thus PCs with very long convergence\ntimes can be given larger step sizes to\ntheir convergence.\n\nTable XII lists the infinity norms of the transfer function matrices, where the infinity norm is defined as\nthe maximum singular value of the matrix.\nThis number gives a rough indication of the gain of the\ncontrol system at each frequency, since the transfer function matrix describes the microphone responses\nwhen a unit amplitude sine wave is input to a control actuator. As with the condition numbers there is a\ngeneral similarity between the infinity norms measured during the morning and afternoon flights. This is\na very crude metric indicating the properties of the transfer function matrices did not change excessively\nbetween the two flights. However, the difference between the in-flight and ground-based\ninfinity norms\nsuggests a significant change in conditions.\nThe in-flight values in Table XII indicate the gain of the control system was at least three times greater at\nthe first harmonic than at the higher harmonics.\nThis indicates the reduced authority of the control system\nat the higher harmonics, and is likely a result of the mechanical properties of the control actuators.\nThe\nnatural frequency of the actuators was designed to be 95 Hz, which is close to the norminal bpf of\n103 Hz, and thus the response of the actuator would be expected to drop off significantly\nat 203 and\n309 Hz, the frequencies of the second and third harmonics.\nFirst\n\nHarmonic\n\nResults\n\nWe begin the discussion of noise reduction results with measured reductions of the first harmonic of the\nblade passage frequency, at approximately\n103 Hz. As in all of the noise reduction tests, the control\nsystem was operated very conservatively;\nconstraints were set high initially, and were slowly reduced\nafter the control system appeared to be stable. This resulted in long convergence\ntimes, which were\nacceptable for these tests since it was more important to demonstrate predictable, consistent operation of\n\n17\n\nthecontrolsystem\nthanrapidconvergence.\nTheaverageound\ns\npressure\nlevel(SPL)\noverthemicrophonerraybefore\na\ncontrolwasapplied shown\nis\nin\nFigure 51.

The measured reduction closely matches the prediction that\nfactored in both the coherence and the control effort constraints, indicated by the dashed line in the Figure\n52. The SPL decreased in a consistent fashion during the test, and appeared to be leveling off towards the\nend of the test.\nTime histories of the peak voltage inputs to the 21 control channels are shown in Figure 54. These\nvoltages were computed on the DSP and therefore represent the outputs of the digital to analog (D/A)\nconverters before amplification.\nThe D/A\'s had a maximum output of _+10 Volts, and the control system\nwas programmed\nto automatically\nshutdown when an actuator control signal exceeded this level. The\nvoltage traces in the figure indicate an actuator control signal exceeded the limit, which ended the noise\nreduction test.\nA comparison of microphone\nresponses before and after control is shown in Figure 55 and Figure 56.\nThe microphones\nare located at intersections\nof the lines in the figure; a level for the malfunctioning\nmicrophone was computed by interpolating\nbetween neighboring\nmicrophones.\nComparing the levels in\nthe before and after plots illustrates that significant noise reduction was produced throughout the aircraft\ninterior.\nFurther evidence of the predictable\nperformance\nof the control system is provided by plotting the\nestimated versus the measured control inputs, in terms of the principal components\nof the control system.\nThe control inputs were computed in terms of the PCs of the control system and were then transformed\ninto actuator inputs. Time histories of the predicted versus the actual inputs to the first four PCs are\nshown in Figure 57.The predictions were computed using ( 11 ) and are indicated by the dashed lines. The\npredicted and measured values show good agreement, although the predictions are slightly low for PCs\ntwo and three. The curves indicate these PC inputs had fully converged by ~ 4 minutes into the test.\nAlthough the afternoon flight produced more significant noise reduction than the morning flight, it is still\nuseful to examine resuks from one of the morning tests. The first harmonic of the bpf was controlled\nduring run 1.1a. As previously discussed, the coherence between the internal reference signal and the\nprimary noise field was very low during the first flight because the port and starboard propellers were not\n\n3_8\n\nexactlysynchronized oneanother.A timehistoryof thereduction thebpf is shown Figure58.\nwith\nin\nin\nAsin Figure52,thedashed shows\nline\nthepredicted\nnoise\nreduction,\nincluding\nbotheffortconstraints\nand\nmeasured\ncoherence,\nwhilethedottedlineassumes\nunitycoherence.\nThemeasured\nreduction\ncontains n\na\noscillatorycomponent ue to beatingbetweennoise generated the unsynchronized\nd\nby\npropellers.\nApproximately .5minutes\n5\nafterthecontrollerwasturnedon, therewasa pronounced\nreduction the\nin\namplitude thebeating, hentheconvergence\nof\nw\nrate,/,t,wasincreased. hisillustrates\nT\ntheability of the\ncontrolsystem\ntotrackcycle-to-cycleariations theprimarynoise\nv\nin\nfield.\nTheimportancef high coherence indicated thelargedifference\no\nis\nby\nbetween\nthetwo noisereduction\npredictions.If the coherence\nhadbeenunity between reference ndeachmicrophone, primary\nthe\na\nthe\nwouldhavebeen\nreduced over20dB,but thetruecoherence\nby\nlimitedthereduction\ntojust under5 dB.\nThemismatch\nbetween two predictions\nthe\nalsoserves emphasize importance includingthe\nto\nthe\nof\ncoherence anyofflineprediction\nin\nofthenoise\nreduction\nperformance a controlsystem.\nof\nSecond\n\nHarmonic\n\nResults\n\nThe second harmonic of the blade passage frequency was controlled during mn 2.6a of the afternoon\nflight. The reductions were much smaller than for the first harmonic, and the results indicate this was due\nto a limitation of the actuator authority, not due to low coherence.\nThe time history showing\n\nthe measured\n\nreduction\n\nin the SPL of the second harmonic\n\nof the bpf is plotted\n\nin Figure 59. The maximum reduction was slightly over 4 dB. There is relatively little difference\nbetween the predicted noise reduction computed with and without the measured coherence, as indicated\nby the dashed and dotted lines, respectively.\nAs with the results from run 2.1a during the afternoon flight,\nthere is generally good agreement between the dashed line and the measured noise reduction, after the\ncontrol system had converged.\nThe similarity between the two predicted noise reduction curves indicates\nthat the coherence was not a limiting factor during this test.\nThe maximum voltage inputs to the control actuators are shown in Figure 60. A single actuator exceeded\nthe _+10 Volt limit, stopping the control system 3.25 minutes into the test. It should be noted that the\ncontrol effort constraints\nwere all reduced to zero during this test in an attempt to improve the noise\nreduction performance.\nThe predicted and measured control inputs\npredictions are indicated by the dashed lines.\nthe actual performance\nof the control system\nfour PCs appeared to have converged to their\nSince neither\n\nthe coherence\n\nto the first four PCs are shown in Figure 61 where the\nAs with control of the bpf, there is good agreement between\nand the predicted performance,\nand the inputs to the first\nfinal values during the test.\n\nnor the effort constraints\n\nwere limiting\n\nthe noise reduction\n\nperformance,\n\nbecause the control system appeared to be doing exactly what the predictions\nsaid it would do,\nconclude that the coupling of the actuator array to the primary noise field must have been insufficient\nthis frequency to produce good noise reduction.\nPoor coupling could be due to poor placement of\nactuators and/or the microphones.\nThese factors become more important at higher frequencies where\nwavelengths are shorter. Lack of actuator authority could also have been due to the reduced output of\ncontrol actuators, which were tuned to 95 Hz, well away from the 206 Hz nominal frequency of\nsecond bpf harmonic.\n\n3_9\n\nand\nwe\nat\nthe\nthe\nthe\nthe\n\nMulti-Frequency\n\nResults\n\nWe next discuss the results of two tests, conducted during the afternoon flight, in which the first three\nharmonics\nwere controlled\nsimultaneously.\nThe goal of the first test (run 2.1b in Table X) was to\nminimize a linear summation of the levels of the three harmonics.\nFrom the uncontrolled harmonic levels\nshown in Figure 51, this amounted to reducing the bpf first, then the second harmonic, and then applying\nany remaining control authority to the third harmonic.\nThe goal of the second test (run 2.3a in Table X)\nwas to minimize an A-weighted\nsummation of the harmonic levels. This amounted to reducing the third\nharmonic, followed by the second, and then the bpf. Because of the controller\'s low authority at the\nsecond and third harmonics, the end result of these two tests was similar; small reductions were obtained\nat the two higher harmonics, because most of the control energy was spent where it was most efficient, on\nthe bpf.\nThe results of each test are summarized\nin five plots here. Three of the plots show time histories of\nmeasured and predicted reductions\nat the three harmonics; one plot shows actuator input voltages; and\none plot shows the convergence\nof a cost function consisting of either a linear or A-weighted summation\nof the SPL at the three harmonics.\nLinear\n\nCost Function\n\nMeasured and predicted reductions of the first three harmonics, from mn 2. lb, are shown in Figure 62\nthrough Figure 64. The test was approximately\nsix minutes long, and produced noise reductions at the\nfirst three harmonics of 10.2 dB, 3.3 dB, and 1.6 dB, respectively.\nThe measured noise reductions at the\nthree frequencies agree well with predicted reductions.\nTime histories showing the reduction in a linear\nand an A-weighted\nsummation of the three harmonics\nare plotted in Figure 65. The linear cost was\nreduced by slightly more than 8 dB during the test.\nThe actuator input voltages\nlimits of the D/A converters\nA-weighted\n\nare shown in Figure\nat the end of the test.\n\n66. The inputs to two actuators\n\nexceeded\n\nthe voltage\n\nCost Function\n\nFigure 67 through Figure 69 show reductions in the first three harmonics when the cost function consisted\nof an A-weighted summation of the harmonic levels. Due to the inability of the control system to achieve\ngood noise reduction in the higher harmonics, there are few differences between these results and those\nobtained from run 2.1b described in the preceding\nsection.\nMeasured\nreductions\nin the first three\nharmonics of 9.9 dB, 2.3 dB, and 2.6 dB, respectively, were obtained.\nCompared to the results from run\n2. lb, there was an improvement\nat the third harmonic, from 1.6 dB to 2.6 dB of reduction, but this came\nat the expense of the second harmonic, which was only reduced by 2.3 dB in this test.\nA time history of the cost function reduction is plotted in Figure 70. The A-weighted reduction of the\nthree harmonics was just over 4 dB, which is nearly identical to the reduction that was obtained in mn\n2. lb. The linear reductions were also nearly equal for the two tests. Note that approximately\n5.5 minutes\ninto the test it became clear that no appreciable\nreduction could be obtained at the second and third\nharmonics, so the effort constraints on the first harmonic were relaxed. This is the reason for the sudden\nincrease\n\nin the reduction\n\nof the blade passage\n\nfrequency\n\nevident in Figure 70.\n\nThe time histories of the maximum actuator input voltages are shown in Figure\nactuator exceeded the limit, shutting down the control system at ~ 6.5 minutes.\n\n20\n\n71.\n\nThe input to one\n\nControl\n\nDuring\n\nDescent\n\nIn mn 2.7a, a multi-frequency\ncontrol test was performed\nduring descent through landing to study the\nrobustness of the control system to altitude changes. It is well known that the stability of a filtered-x type\nof controller,\nupon which the PC-LMS algorithm is based, depends on the accuracy of the transfer\nfunction matrix between actuators and sensors.\nThis matrix was measured in-flight at cruising altitude\nwhere the aircraft cabin was pressurized.\nAs a result this test provided a simple means to assess whether\nor not these transfer functions were sufficiently accurate for the control system to remain stable on the\nground when the aircraft was unpressurized.\nThe test lasted 17 minutes, the first 8 of which took place at normal cruising altitude at normal engine\ntorque levels. After 8 minutes, the pilot throttled back the engines, which greatly reduced the primary\nnoise field. In an attempt to re-establish a 0 dB reference point for the control system the control filter\nweights were reset to zero, and this reset operation will be apparent in the plots discussed here.\nReductions in the first three harmonics are shown in Figure 72 through Figure 74. It is important to note\nthat the noise reductions were computed relative to the primary noise field at 0 minutes and are, therefore,\nincorrect when the engine torque is reduced (thereby reducing the primary noise field). Nonetheless,\nthe\nvalues indicate the control system remained\nstable for the duration of the test. The large variation\napparent near the end of the test was caused by the feathering of the propeller blades, which temporarily\nincreased the interior noise levels. The predicted noise reductions are also plotted, and generally agree\nwell with the measured values for the first eight minutes.\nThe time histories of the maximum actuator input voltages are shown in Figure 75. The effect of resetting\nthe weights eight minutes into the test is apparent in this plot. Note that just before the eight minute\nmark, the weights were maintained\nclose to but still below the limits of the D/A hardware.\nThis\ndemonstrates\nthe effectiveness\nof the control effort constraints for maintaining\nsteady operation of the\ncontrol system.\nReduced\n\nConfiguration\n\nThe optimization results indicated that the potential existed for a reduced\n85% of the noise reduction of the full-up system.

There is no indication of global control, the sound field being\nreduced for the most part only at the 8 controlled microphones.\nAt the 8 controlled microphones\nthe noise\nreduction was approximately\n10 dB.\nThe optimization procedure predictions are compared with those actually achieved in Table XIII. Clearly\nthe system did not perform as expected for all 3 harmonics.\nThis is further indication of the effect of\ncabin pressurization\non the structural acoustic system.\nAs mentioned earlier, the reduced configuration\nhas little margin for error and is thus a good benchmark for the optimization\nprocedures\npredictions.\nThese results emphasize the need for good noise reduction predictions if optimization\nis to be used to\ndesign lower cost control systems.\n\n23_\n\nDiscussion\nThe PC-LMS controller performed extremely well. The PC domain perspective of the control system is\nboth informative and instructive.\nThe ability to adjust the convergence\nrate and effort penalty for each\nprincipal component in each frequency provides comprehensive\nversatility.\nThe only drawback to this\nkind of implementation\nis the difficulty in defining the correct settings for all the parameters\n(the 3\nfrequency, 18 PC controller had 108 parameters).\nDuring the flight test a human operator slowly relaxed\nthe effort penalties until maximum noise reduction and drive force were reached.\nIn practice these terms\nwould either be computed ahead of time or set adaptively in real time. For example, an outer loop\ncontroller, possibly in fuzzy logic, could be implemented to accomplish this task.\nAt first glance, the optimization procedure seems to have done a fair job of predicting the controller\'s\nperformance\nduring the multi-frequency,\nfull-up test, runs 2. lb and 2.3a, see Table XIV. The predicted\noverall linear reduction is 12.9 dB while that achieved is 8.1 dB. However, the poor performance\nin the\nsecond and third harmonics becomes evident in the A-weighted\nnumbers with a predicted reduction of\n10.8 dB and an achieved of 4.4 dB.\nA factor contributing\nto the loss of performance\nwas that the in-flight transfer functions had changed\nenough so that the primary source principal components\nhad shifted. Figure 79 and Figure 80 are the\nprimary source principal components\nfor the bpf for ground and flight transfer functions.\nNote how the\nacoustic power is shifted to the higher order PCs where actuator authority is reduced.\nThe overall effect\nmight best be appreciated by viewing Figure 81 and Figure 82 which are plots of potential noise control\nfor each PC in dB versus the fraction of maximum control power necessary for both the ground and flight\ncases. The potential noise control is derived by cumulatively summing the primary source PCs.\n\ni\n\nZP_\nNC i = 101ogl0\n\n1.0\n\n= 1...18}\n\nj=l\n18\n\n( 29)\n\nj=l\n\nWhere NC i is the potential noise reduction in dB for the i th PC.

Notice that, for the ground case, the fundamental\'s\n13.5 dB reduction is\nachieved at 25% power. For the in-flight case, the 10.2 dB figure is not reached until close to 50% of the\navailable actuator power is consumed.\nIn multi-frequency\ncontrol, the loss of authority\nsnowballs\nbecause if more power is used to reduce one frequency,\nless is available at another, where loss of\nauthority has already taken a toll.\n\n22\n\nDespite\nthelossof controlauthority,he controlsystem\nt\nachieved\ngoodnoisereduction\natrelativelylow\npower\nlevels.In Figure52,thebpf is shown bereduced\nto\nabout12dB at4 minutes\nintothetest.

Both single frequency and multi-frequency\ncontrol of the blade passage frequency and its\nharmonics was accomplished.\nThe control algorithm was a variant of the popular filtered-x LMS implemented\nin the principal component domain. The control system consisted of 21 inertial actuators and 32 microphones.\nThe actuators were mounted to the aircraft\'s ring frames. The microphones\nwere distributed uniformly\nthroughout the interior at head height, both seated and standing. Actuator locations were selected using a\ncombinatorial\nsearch optimization\nalgorithm.\nThe control system achieved a 14 dB noise reduction of the blade\npassage frequency during single frequency tests. Multi-frequency\ncontrol of the first 1st, 2nd and 3rd harmonics\nresulted in 10.2 dB, 3.3 dB and 1.6 dB noise reductions respectively.\nThese results fall short of the predictions\nwhich were produced by the optimization\nalgorithm (13.5 dB, 8.6 dB and 6.3 dB). The optimization\nwas based\non actuator transfer functions taken on the ground and it is postulated that cabin pressurization\nat flight altitude\nwas a factor in this discrepancy.\n\n14.\n\nSUBJECT\n\nTERMS\n\nActive Noise\nPrincipal\n\n15.
