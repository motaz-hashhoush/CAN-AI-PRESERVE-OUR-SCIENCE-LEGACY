The\n*. *\n\norbital stations with changeable crews--man\'s trunk\'Une into space. In the Soviet\nUnion reliable, constantly improving stations in the series "Salyut" have been\nmade. Highly efficient methods and means of making observations from space have\nbeen developed. In numerous flights the base spacecraft "Soyuz" has been finished\noff and comprehensively tested as a means of supplying crews to the station. Twice,\nin flights of "Salyut-3" and "Salyut-5" the results of the orbital work were sent\nto earth by an automatic re-entry apparatus. The fulfillment of loading operations in space--the next step on this path..\nThe creation of a freight transport craft to guarantee the operation of\norbital stations is an objective need. From year to year man\'s activity in space\nis activated. The duration of the active existence of orbital stations is increasing\n("Salyut-4" for example, operated in space over\'two years). In the process of\noperation of the stations the cosmonauts consume the supplies of produce, water,\nprotein, bed linens, means of personal hygiene, and oxygen that have been supplied\non board. The changeable elements in the system of life support are consumed:\ncartridges of air regeneration, all possible filters, absorbers, elements of electrical equipment, and communication. The supplies of movie and photo film are\nexhausted. The quantity of fuel for the sustainer is decreased, which periodically\nis engaged to maintain the altitude of the station\'s flight, for numerous small\nengines that implement its orientation and stabilization.\n\nGradually the pres-\n\nsure drops in the compartments as a result of sluicing of wastes and discharges\nof the crew into open space. Certain equipment exhausts its operating life and\nrequires replacement.\n\nDuring the operation of the orbital station everyday 20-30 kilograms of\ndifferent substances are consumed.\n\nIt is not difficult to calculate what enor-\n\nmous supplies the operation of the station requires, say during a year. Without\nfilling of the on-board supplies during the flight its operation is practically\nimpossible.\nIn addition in the flight a need can develop to conduct some studies and\nobservations not planned for by the assignment.\n\nAnd this requires new equipment\n\nand subjects of study.\nThus the creation of a loading transport craft capable of supplying in\norbit equipment to replace that which is no longer in service or has exhausted\nits operating life, of filling up consumed supplies of produce and fuel, has\nbeen dictated by the urgent need, and striving to increase the economic efficiency\nof orbital stations, and the flexibility of observations made in space.\nThe craft "Progress" is unmanned. This means that the part of the payload\nthat is set aside for cosmonauts can now be given to freight. On board the craft\nchairs are not needed, control panels for the craft, complicated, and what is\nmost important--heavy equipment of the life support system. In addition the\ndesigners decided to make it nonreturnable.\n\nThis made it possible to make an\n\neven greater increase in the load capacity of the craft due to the heat-protecting\nscreen, parachute systems, soft landing engines, and systems of controlling the\ndescent.\n"Progress" has been created on the basis of "Soyuz." In order to save\nresources and reduce the periods of development many systems of "Soyuz" have\nbeen used that prove to be good in operation and that meet the tasks of the new\ncraft. The traditional arrangement of the craft has been kept.\nconsists of three compartments:\n\n"Progress" also\n\ninstrument-aggregate; fuel, located where\n\npreviously the re-entry apparatus was located; and freight, that occupies the\nplace of the living compartment on "Soyuz" (fig. 1).\n\nFigure 1.

The freight compartment has a docking\nassembly with a manhole for access into the craft of the crew of the orbital\nstation.\n\nIn contrast to the "Soyuz" the docking assembly of "Progress" has\n\nadditional automatic hydraulic connectors designed to hermetically connect the\nfuel lines of "Progress" and "Salyut" during the docking. The freight compartment is 6.6 m^1 \' ) in volume and is equipped with shelves for dry cargo in\npackages and containers. Up to 1300 kg of different cargo can be put into orbit\nin It--instruments, scientific apparatus, containers with products and tanks with\nwater, changeable components of the life support system. The system of fastening\nof the cargo provides for preservation of the necessary center-of-gravity position\nof the craft, and makes it possible to rapidly release certain containers during\nunloading. Here rapidly opening locks and bolts were used which free the cargo\nby a turning of the head only a quarter of a turn. The normal atmospheric pressure is maintained in the compartment and the required temperature is kept\n(from +3 to +30\xc2\xb0 C).\nOn the outer surface of the freight compartment are located antennas of the\nradio engineering system of convergence, television cameras of external survey\n(of them one looks forward to the station, and the second--to earth), one of\nthree light indices by which the crew of the station judges the correctness of\nthe mutual position of the apparatus during docking (the two others are located\non the fuel compartment). On the outside are also located fuel lines and oxidizer\nlines from the fuel compartment of the craft to the hydraulic connectors of the\ndocking device.\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\nr\n\nNevertheless the main concetti of designers became the fuel compartment.\nIf the operations of supplying dry cargo do not have any principal innovation,\nthen the transfer of fuel from one apparatus to another in orbit is a completely\nnew task. Here it was necessary to guarantee the reliable hermetic sealing of\nthe hydraulic connections of the craft and the station, to develop technology\nof transporting fuel components on connected lines, that excludes the falling of\ngas inclusions into the engine unit of "Salyut", and to provide for long-rangeautomatic control of all the operations in light of the high aggressiveness and\ntoxicity of the fuel, control of the process of refueling, and much more.\nDesign-wise the compartment was made in the form of two truncated cones\nconnected to each other by large bases. Within the compartment * on special\nframes spherical tanks are located with the fuel component--two with fuel and\ntwo with oxidizer--of total weight about 1000 kg, and gas cylinders with nitrogen\n(or air) used to displace the fuel components during transfer, as well as to fill\nthe expended supplies of air on the station. Control of temperature and pressure\nhas been stipulated in the fuel tanks and in the gas cylinders during storage and\nrefueling, the hermetic sealing of connected lines, as well as the blowing through\nof the lines before unlinking of the apparatus. The refueling of the station is\ncontrolled by a command radio line with earth or with the crew of the station\nwith the help of a special panel and graphic panel located in the region of the\ncentral post of the station.\nThe operation to transfer components requires preparation for it not only\nof a refueling system of "Progress", but also of the fuel system of "Salyut."\nA simplified scheme of refueling is shown in figure 2. The system of fuel\nsupply to the engine unit of "Salyut-6" is forced. This means that fuel from\nthe tanks is forced into the line by compressed gas under high pressure. In\n\nr\n\norder for the liquid and gas not to mix the tank is divided into liquid and\ngas cavities by a corrosion-resistant elastic membrane (bellows). During\nloading on earth this membrane is squeezed by the pressure of the fuel towards\nthe opposite wall of the tank, and the liquid thus fills the entire tank. In\nits gas cavity there is a connecting pipe along which the compressed nitrogen\npasses from the high pressure cylinders (about 200 atmospheres) through" the\nreducer.\n\nBy acting on the flexible membrane the nitrogen is also precisely a\n\nsource of energy that guarantees the entrance of the components into the combustion chamber.\nThus in the gas cavities of the "Salyut" tanks there is always pressure\n(on the order 20 atmospheres) which does not make it possible to immediately\nbegin transfer of components from the fuel compartment of "Progress." In order\nto eliminate this resistance the designers placed on the station a fairly solid\n(by space measures, naturally) compressor with engine power 1 kilowatt.\n\nNitrogen\n\nfrom the fuel tanks of "Salyut" is pumped out by this compressor and returned\nto the cylinders.\n\nAnd since the compressor is fed from a buffer battery that\n\nrequires periodic recharging from solar batteries the process of preparation for\nrefueling occupies considerable time.\nThe actual transfer of fuel components lasts for a much shorter time. For\nthis it is sufficient to open the necessary valves on the connected fuel line\n(fuel or oxidizer) and feed the compressed nitrogen into the tanks of "Progress"\n(in principal analogous to the tanks of "Salyut"). The refueling ends with the\nremoval (blowing through, evacuation) of the fuel component from the lines to\nprevent the aggressive liquid falling on the structural part of the station and\nthe craft during unlinking.\n\n!6\n\nFigure 2.

Connecting pipe for filling\nhigh pressure cylinder\n\nAt the end of the joint work with station the craft "Progress" can be used\nto lift "Salyut" to a higher orbit, that is to fulfill the function of a tow.\nHere not only the engine unit of "Progress" is used, but also its system of\norientation to control the spatial position of the entire complex.\nAnd finally> the new craft has yet another duty--to help the crew of the\nstation to get rid of the clutter on the station. In the freed freight compartment of the craft the cosmonauts place used equipment., cartridges of the\n\nr\n\nregeneration system, empty water containers, all possible containers--everything that is no longer needed on the station and at the same time does not\nrequire return to earth. This reduces the consumption of air in the station\nduring sluicing of wastes.\n"Progress" having unlinked from the station engages the deceleration\nengine, and without separating enters the dense layers of the atmosphere where\nit ends its existence.\n\nThe creation of the automatic freight craft "Progress"\n\nto service lengthy operating orbital stations is a major contribution of Soviet\nscience to domestic and world astronautics.\n\nCopyright: Aviatsiya; Kosmonautika, 1978\n\n'
