THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN\n\n104600-10-L\n\nSkylab Support\nProgress Report, April 1973-February 1974\n\nThe following report serves to report progress for the period\nApril 1973 through February 1974 on Subcontract #1 of contract\nNAS9-13332. The financial reports for this contract are being\nsubmitted under separate cover.\nThe objective of this subcontract is to support the Skylab\n1) performing standard\nEREP effort of Michigan State University by:\nrecognition processing and producing recognition maps and area counts,\n2) assisting in the analysis and interpretation of the recognition\nmaps and other extracted information, 3) further developing and\nproportions\nadapting, for use on Skylab EREP data, methods for estimating\nand 4) applying proportion estimation techniques\nof unresolved objects,\nto one frame of EREP data to determine to what extent the accuracy\nof crop acreage estimates is improved.\nDuring this report period no technical progress has been made due to\nunexpected and unforeseen delays in the availability of EREP/S-192 digital\ndata. Some assistance, however, has been provided during this period in\nestablishing the specifications for S-192 computer compatible tapes (CCT\'s)\nto be ordered for this project.\nDue to the expected lengthy delay in the receipt of S-192 CCT\'s, there\nis a need to conserve project funds. As a result project activity is now\nat a low level and will continue at a low level for the next several months.\nPrepared by:\n\n(.\n\n/\n\nS\n\n7\n\nRichard F.
