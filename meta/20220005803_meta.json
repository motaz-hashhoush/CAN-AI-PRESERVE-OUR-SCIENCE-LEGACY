The mission spacecraft will journey to (16) Psyche: a metallic asteroid believed to be the exposed core of an early planetesimal. Despite the unique nature of the target asteroid and the mission\u2019s novel science goals, a significant portion of the project\u2019s science planning needs may be met through the use of legacy tools. In particular, the adoption of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory\u2019s (JPL) Science Opportunity Analyzer (SOA) promises to satisfy mission requirements with minimal development effort. Originally developed as a multi-mission science planning tool, SOA can design and visualize observations, perform geometric flight rule checking, model physical phenomena, and much more. The software has been used by the mission since its proposal phase and is expected to continue providing valuable capabilities throughout operations.", "title": "Psyche Science Planning with the Science Opportunity Analyzer", "stiType": "PREPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20220005803, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Elkins-Tanton, Linda T."}}, "id": "fe569ffe151648acb3ac8578d8980cd2"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20220005803, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Dailis, Matthew"}}, "id": "9cb6c8657ba440fe9e5048db7b3ef29c"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20220005803, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Alonge, Eleanor K."}}, "id": "60f0a46075d84815ba294500959efec2"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20220005803, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Lawler, Christopher R."}}, "id": "da80a8bfa6914f7493a2269019fcf46a"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20220005803, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Rosemurgy, Paul"}}, "id": "2eb5ddded9d2444a85c573f3eebbd0fc"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20220005803, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Llopis, Marcel"}}, "id": "d2828064ffdd4fc697743df447ee2f8b"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20220005803, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Polanskey, Carol A."}}, "id": "2082d58561f740ceb03c3041341d487e"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20220005803, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Ortega, Carolyn A"}}, "id": "0bafb9a43f8642fabc4144aca68aa720"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Preprint (Draft being sent to journal)", "technicalReviewType": "NOT_SET", "modified": "2022-09-30T06:02:51.3523970+00:00", "id": 20220005803, "sourceIdentifiers": [{"number": "2014/54564", "type": "HANDLE"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20220005803, "publisher": "Pasadena, CA: Jet Propulsion Laboratory, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 2021", "id": "75143049d3854ba094c1ef5ee79a2f4f", "publicationDate": "2021-05-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
