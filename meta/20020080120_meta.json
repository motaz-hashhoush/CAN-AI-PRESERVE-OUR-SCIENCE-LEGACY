Vanguard Enforcer was delivered in 1991 to Johnson Space Center and has been protecting systems and critical data there ever since. In August of 1999, NASA granted Vanguard exclusive rights to commercialize the Enforcer system for the private sector. In return, Vanguard continues to supply NASA with ongoing research, development, and support of Enforcer. The Vanguard Enforcer 4.2 is one of several surveillance technologies that make up the Vanguard Security Solutions line of products. Using a mainframe environment, Enforcer 4.2 achieves previously unattainable levels of automated security management.", "title": "Security in Full-Force", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T12:52:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020080120, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020080120, "isbn": "0-16-067542-1", "id": "1d7b452bdc63458085946c076b15c730", "publicationName": "Spinoff 2002", "publicationDate": "2002-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020080120.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020080120/downloads/20020080120.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020080120/downloads/20020080120.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020080120/downloads/20020080120.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
