SSTO vehicle studies have indicated that increases in the propulsion system operating range can save significant weight and cost at the vehicle level. This test program demonstrated the ability of the SSME to accommodate a wide variation in safe operating ranges and therefore its applicability to the SSTO mission. A total of eight tests were completed with four at Marshall Space Flight Center's Advanced Engine Test Facility and four at the Stennis Space Center (SSC) A-2 attitude test stand. Key demonstration objectives were: 1) Mainstage operation at 5.4 to 6.9 mixture ratio; 2) Nominal engine start with significantly reduced engine inlet pressures of 50 psia LOX and 38 psia fuel; and 3) Low power level operation at 17%, 22%, 27%, 40%, 45%, and 50% of Rated Power Level. Use of the highly instrumented TTB engine for this test series has afforded the opportunity to study in great detail engine system operation not possible with a standard SSME and has significantly contributed to a greater understanding of the capabilities of the SSME and liquid rocket engines in general.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 19970028376, "endDate": "1997-07-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.", "location": "New York, NY United States"}}, "meetingId": "dc78c195866c40afb11bcac09284aab0", "id": "8507ef4a17f444448a25f987bce01214"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Society for Electrical Engineers", "location": "United States"}}, "meetingId": "dc78c195866c40afb11bcac09284aab0", "id": "09afcda388fb4dafadfc3588c22a7a8e"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "New York, NY United States"}}, "meetingId": "dc78c195866c40afb11bcac09284aab0", "id": "1e82bd1a95df4b9ca1dfdb64f6925545"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Society of Mechanical Engineers", "location": "New York, NY United States"}}, "meetingId": "dc78c195866c40afb11bcac09284aab0", "id": "410c0e01406a416e9bb98562705a2ebb"}], "name": "Joint Propulsion", "location": "Seattle, WA", "id": "dc78c195866c40afb11bcac09284aab0", "startDate": "1997-07-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19970028376, "publisher": "American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "id": "190ee01cb0ba4e6a95baa58960ede65b", "publicationDate": "1997-07-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19970028376.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19970028376/downloads/19970028376.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19970028376/downloads/19970028376.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19970028376/downloads/19970028376.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
