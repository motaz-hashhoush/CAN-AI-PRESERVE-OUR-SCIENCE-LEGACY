We generally accept the data from these measurements as \"valid.\" One reason we can accept the data is the \"legal metrology\" requirements established and regulated by the government in matters of commerce. The measurement data used by NASA, other government agencies, and industry can be critical to decisions which affect everything from economic viability, to mission success, to the security of the nation. Measurement data can even affect life and death decisions. Metrology requirements must adequately provide for risks associated with these decisions. To do this, metrology must be integrated into all aspects of an industry including research, design, testing, and product acceptance. Metrology, the science of measurement, has traditionally focused on the calibration of instruments, and although instrument calibration is vital, it is only a part of the process that assures quality in measurement data. For example, measurements made in research can influence the fundamental premises that establish the design parameters, which then flow down to the manufacturing processes, and eventually impact the final product. Because a breakdown can occur anywhere within this cycle, measurement quality assurance has to be integrated into every part of the life-cycle process starting with the basic research and ending with the final product inspection process. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the role of metrology in the various phases of a product's life-cycle. For simplicity, the cycle will be divided in four broad phases, with discussions centering on metrology within NASA. .", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20130012069, "endDate": "2008-03-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "2008 Measurement Science Conference", "location": "Anaheim, CA", "id": "f7dd1bd204014ad8bfa503fcf8ce094e", "startDate": "2008-03-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20130012069, "id": "2922f0377f254ef6a696e05ba46f7e7e", "publicationDate": "2008-03-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20130012069.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20130012069/downloads/20130012069.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20130012069/downloads/20130012069.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20130012069/downloads/20130012069.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
