First of all, the operator must\nbe able to feel the forces he is generating in-cell to operate efficiently. A\n"high quality" system would accurately reflect the forces being generated in\nthe cell, be highly responsive and stable, and have a low force reflection\nthreshold. The last characteristic is particularly important as it determines\nthe sensitivity of the teleoperator system. Present systems\' sensitivities\nare about 0.5 to I kg, but with their different capacities this ranges from\n1 to 10_ of maximum lift. The goal for this system is 0.5 kg (2_), which has\nbeen verified on a single-degree-of-freedom test stand.\nOther features of the control system are indexing, force scaling, and\nposition scaling. When indexing, the control system servos the slave about\nits present position and frees the master. The operator then moves the master\nto any position desired and restores M/S operations.\nThe system then\ncontinues as before, but with the offset between the Joints. The force\nscaling feature allows the operator to select the percentage of the force\ngenerated in-cell that is reflected back to him.\nPresently the ratios\navailable are I:I, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, and 8:1. For small delicate tasks i:i would\nbe used to maximize sensitivity. For heavy tasks 8:1 would be selected to\nminimize fatigue. Another useful feature is position scaling. This allows\nthe operator to move the slave only half the distance of the master. This is\nvery useful for delicate tasks and complex motions, such as aligning and\ninserting a multipin electrical connector. These options are selected from a\nCRT menu display. The cursor for the menu is controlled from the handle, and\nonce the choice has been selected it is executed by a push-button on the\nhandle.\nKINEMATICS\nThe most basic criterion for designing a manipulator is the kinematic\narrangement. The Joint relationships and the length of the links can greatly\ninfluence the performance and dexterity.\nThese factors were studied in\ndetail,3 and master kinematics were recommended that were similar to the ASM\nslave. The kinematics were investigated from a variety of viewpoints, _t the\noverall objective was to maximize the dexterity and transparency to the\noperator.\nIf this objective is met, it will maximize the operator\'s\nperformance and efficiency by providing human-like flexibility and by\nminimizing fatigue and frustration. The master must be capable of motions\ncomparable to a human and should not interfere with the operator\'s body.\nSince several kinematic arrangements can achieve this objective, other\ncriteria were established to evaluate these arrangements more closely. One\nsuch additional criterion was implementation complexity.\nSome of the\narrangements, though geometrically similar, were not kinematlcally identical\nand therefore were difficult to implement. Geometric similarity consists of\nidentical link lengths and joint orientations. Kinematic similarity includes\nthis, but goes further than the structural linkages to include identical force\nand torque transmission. This also means that the entire manner in which\nforces are transmitted through\nthe master, including Joint interrelations,\nmust be the same as in the slave.\n\n236\ni\nL\n\n}\n\nThe difficulty\nof implementation\nthat arises\nwhen one tries to use a\ngeometricvlly\nsimilarly\n(not kinematically\nidentical)\narrangement\nis in the\ntype of control loop that must be used.\nA ,osition-position\ncontrol loop is\ncurrently employed in the ASM control system. 1\nThis loop is very simple if\nthe master is a kinematic replica of the slave, but becomes very complicated\nif a nonrspllca master is chosen.\nWith identical kinematics,\nthe positions of\nthe individual Joints in both the master and the slave are sensed _nd compared\ndirectly.\nIf a position difference\n(error) exists, a command is derived from\nthe control algorithm and is given to the master/slsve\npair to eliminate the\ndiflerence.\nWith\nnonreplica\nkinematics\nthe\nposition\ndifference\nmust\nbe\nderived\nsince the individual\njoint positions\ncannot\nbe compared\ndirectly.\nSuch\na derivation\nrequires\nmotor/joint\ntransformations\nwith\nsignificant\ncalculations.\nOnce\nthe\nposition\ndifferences\nare\ndetermined,\na\nsimilar\ntransformation\nprocedure\nis\nnecessary\nto\nobtain\nthe\ncommand\nfor\neach\ncorresponding\nJoint.\nSince this method is theoretically\nfeasible, an analysis\nwas performed to determine if such a control loop could be closed fast enough\nto De stable.\nThe analysis indicated that the loop could be i_plemented,\nbut\nwould require development of complex software.\nSince the nonreplica kinematic\narrangement\noffered little advantage\nover the replica\narrangement\nand since\nthe nonreplica\noption\ncarried\nwith\nit the\nneed\nfor\nincreased\nsoftware\ncomplexity, a kinematic replica master was Chosen.\nHANDLES\nTo properly design the handle for the m_ster,\nthe kinematic arrangement\nmust be consldered_\nMany handle\ndesigns\nwere conceptualized.3\nOnce the\nkinematics\nwere chosen, several possibilities\nwere eliminated.\nFour handle\ntypes were evaluated for the replica master kinematics.\nThe criteria for this\nevaluation\nwere primarily\nconcerned with the human factors that affect\nthe\nperformance of the operator.\nThe handle must be comfortable and nonfatiguing,\nand must provide the operator with a transparent man/machine\ninterface to the\nmaster.\nFrom previous\nstudies 4 it was shown that an operator\noften uses\neither hand on either handle,\nso the design must be also be ambidextrous.\nAfter a new tong-actuator\ncontrcl concept was selected, the pistol-type handle\n(Figures 2, 3, and 4) looked most favorable.\nThe initial tong control concept\nwas a backdrlveable\nelectromechanical\ngear train the same as the rest of the\nJoints.\nHoweverl for this application,\nit was decided to control\nthe tong\nwith a new concept that employs a trigger with a position sensor (see section\non\ndesign\nconcept).\nThis\ncontrol\ncan\nbe\neasily\nimplemented\nwith\nthe\nplstol-type\nhand!e.\nThis\nhandle\nalso\nprovides\na good\nlocation\nfor the\noperator to reach the remaining control switches.\nA prototype of the chosen\nhandle was built and the human factors were thoroughly studied to design the\nfinal version for the master.\nCROSS COUPLING\nIn the slave, all the wrist motors are located above the shoulder on the\ngear pod, and the forces required for the wrist a_\ntransmitted\nthrough the\nelbow, which results in elbow/wrist\ncross-couplin_.\nA cross-couple_\njcint is\none in which the torque in that Joint is a function of the load in that Joint\n\n237\n&\n\nand the load in another Joint.\nFor example, the summation\nof torque_ about\nthe elbow Joint is equal to the torque supplied by the elbow motor, plus an\namount proportional\nto the torques supplied by the wrist motors.\nAnother way\nto look at it is that the torque required from the elbow motor to support the\nelbow depends on how the wrist is being loaded.\nSo the force reflected to the\noperator in the elbow of the master would be changed as the load in the slave\nwrist changed.\nThe implications\nof this coupled relationship\n(as well as the\ncoupling itself) are subtle, but it results in reduced controllability\nand\ninaccurate\nforce re_lection\nunless\nit is properly\nhandled.\nIn the first\nmaster design study, _ a concept was recommended\nfor the master controller.\nThis design was light, with low inertia and almost no backlash, but the wrist\nmotors were located behind the elbow attached to the forearm.\nThis completely\neliminated the elbow/wrlst\ncross-coupling\nin the master.\nIn most manipulator\nsystems,\nthis would be an advantageous\nfeature,\nbut in actuality\nit was\ndetrimental\nto the performance\nof this master/slave\nsystem.\nSince the slave\nwould\nbe coupled\nbut the master\nwould\nbe uncoupled,\nthis unsymmetrical\ncoupling would give the operator\nof the master a very confusing\nforce and\npositional response.\n\n,\n}\n_!\n\nThe only was to account for this coupled-uncoupled\nrelationship\nwould be\nto employ motor/joint\ntransformations.\nThis would also require development\nof\nthe transformation\nsoftware.\nTherefore, a new concept was developed based on\nthe knowledge that was gained through the conceptual\ndesign efforts on the\nmaster and the slave.\nThis new concept is coupled in an identical manner as\nthe slave.\nThe coupling\neffects\nwill then be reproduced\nin the opposite\ndirection and cancelled out by the position-posltion\nloop.\nThis will give the\noperator an accurate\nforce and positional response\nbecause all the coupling\neffects have been effectively\n"eliminated."\nAs electronic\nadvances continue,\nsuch motor-joint\ntransformations\nthat are now avoided\nmay be come routine\nenough to reconsider\nan uncoupled\nmaster.\nIf this transformation\noption is\nchosen, then the other kinematic arrangements should also be reconsidered.\n\n:i\ni\n\nMOTORS\n\ni\ni\n\nThe\n\nmotors\n\nused\n\non\n\nthe\n\nmaster\n\nare\n\nthe\n\nsame\n\nas\n\nthose\n\nused\n\nfor\n\nthe\n\nslave. 2\nThese\nmotors\nhave\nthe\nhighest\ncontinuous-torque/friction-torque\nrat_v of any available motor.\nThis is their most important\nfeature, since\nthey will obtain the lowest static friction possible for the master.\nThis is\nvery desirable in order to offset the increased friction in the slave.\nThe\ngear ratio required with these motors ranges from 2:1 to 12:1.\nThe only\ndisadvantage\nis\nthat\nthe weight\ncf the\nmotors\nis\napproximately\n50_ of the\nestimated\ntotal\nmaster\nweight.\nThis\nhigh\nweight\ncontribution\nis\nbecause\nthe master\nis of much lighter\nconstruction\nthan the slave.\nThis is an\nunusually\nhigh\ncontribution,\nbut\nit\nis warranted\nby the\nlow overall\nfriction\nof\nthe\nmotor.\nA smaller\nmotor\n(less\nweight)\nwith\na higher\ngear\nratio\nwas\nconsidered\nin order\nto reduce\nthe high\nweight\ncontribution.\nThis was not done\nbecause\nfriction\nwould\nactually\nbe _noreased,\nsince\nthe absolute\nvalue\nof the\nmotor\nfriction\ntorque\n(42\nN.mm) is\nthe\nsame\nin\nboth\nthe\nsmaller\nand\nthe\nlarger\nyields\n\n_tor.\na lower\n\nAlso,\nsince\nthe smaller\ncontinuous-torque/friction-torque\n\n238\n\nmotor\n\nhas\n\nlower\nratio,\n\ncontinuous\ntorque,\nwhich\nincreases\n\nit\nthe\n\n:\n\nstatic\nfriction\nand therefore\ndegrades the force\nreflection.\nThe present\nslave motor then provide_\nthe minimum static\nfriction\nand, therefore,\nthe\nminimum force-reflection\nthreshold.\nIn essence, the motor development effort\nfor the slave system identified a nearly optimal servomotor in terms of\ncapacity and friction characteristics. Using this motor on both the slave and\nthe master will assist in producing the best force reflection possible.\nFORCE TRANSMISSION\nA variety of techniques and hardware are available for Zransmitting forces\nfrom the centralized motors to their respective Joints. The most likely\npossibilities that were considered\nwere metal tapes,\ncables,\nand polyurethane\ncable chains.\nCable chains are relatively\nnew compared to the metal tapes or\ncables.\nThey are available\ncoueroially\nand have been successfully\nused in\nman$ critical applications.5\nCable\nchains\nwere\ninitially\nselected\nbecause\nperformance\nrequirements\nand were very inexpensive.\ndetermine\nhow the backdrive\nfriction\ntorque\nvaries\naircraft\ncable is also being tested\nfor comparison.\n\nthey\nappeared\nto\nmeet\nTesting\nis under way to\nwith preload.\nStandard\n\nDESIGN OBJECTIVES\nAS stated\nearlier,\nthe objective\nof the master\ndesign\nwas to provide\na\nsystem that was best suited\nfor the gear-driven\nslave.\nTherefore,\nthe master\nwas designed\nto minimize\nf_lction\nand inertia\nwith\nzero\nbacklash\nwhile\nenhancing\nthe man/machine\ninterface.\nAll of these\nfeatures\ncan be grouped\nunder\nthe\nsingle\ncategory\nof\nimproving\nthe\noperator\'s\nperformance.\nConsequently,\nit\nalso\nimportant\nto achieve\na very\nclean\nand aesthetically\nappealing\nmaster\nthat\nis comfortable\nto operate.\nIn addition,\nthe design\noptions\nfor the master\nconsidered\nsimplicity\nand low cost\nas high priorities\nto balance\nthe cost of the slave.\nDESIGN CONCEPT\nThe conceptual\ndesign\nfor\nthe dual arm aaster\ncontroller\nis\nshown in\nFigure 5.\nThe easter\nhas a capacity\nof 6 kg, approximately\none-fourth\nthe\ncapeoity\nof the ASH slave.\nIt has 7

gear-drlven\nas in the slave.\nSince the capacity of the master is much less than that of the slave, the gear\ntrains are smaller\nand simpler.\nPrecision\ngears, with weight and inertia\nminzmized, and precision bearings are used throughout.\nThis results in a gear\ntrain with very low backlash and low inertia.\nThe elbow\nis partially\ngear-driven\nand ues the 4-bar\ncounterbalance\nlinkage to also transmit the drive forces to the lower arm structure in the\nelbow Joint.\nThis yields a very clean, compact design which is much easier to\nimplement than a bevel gear/drive shaft arranKement.\n\ngears to translate s_d rotate the torque from the motor at the edge of the\nwrist motions\n(pitch,\nby\ngear The three the sheave assembly in yaw, center of are drivenbox. i:i ratio\nbox to\nthe ano roll) the gear\nFrom the\n_heave assembly\nto the wrist,\nthe forces are transmitted\nusing commercial\naircraft cable.\nOne cable transmits forces from the sheave assembly to the\nelbow, and a second cable continues the transmission\nfrom the elbow to wrist\ngearing.\nIn the wrist itself, the tradition_l\ndifferential\nis used to drive\npitch and yaw motions, and a partial second differential\nis nested inside this\nto drive\nthe roll\nmotion.\nThe\nroll\nforces\nare\ntran_altted\nfrom\nits\ndifferential\nthrough\nthe L-housing,\nwith a special\nthree-dlmensional\ncable\narrangement,\nto turn the corner and transmit the wrist roll forces to the\nhandle interface.\nAnother unique featurJ is the "unilateral\nloop" that is used to control\nthe slave tong.\nTraditionally,\nthe slave tong is controlled similarly to the\nother Joints, with a bilateral force-reflecting\ndrive train.\nWith this method\nthe force-reflection\nthreshold for the tong would be on the order of 1.0 kg.\nSince this threshold level is so high, a new idea was pursued that was much\nsimpler and more reliable.\nThe new tong actuator is electromechanical,\nbut it\nis not a backdriveable gear train.\nInstead, it incorporates a position sensor\nwith a spring to give the operator an artificial force reflection.\nThe slave\ntong is driven by sensing the position of the tong actuator\n(triuer)\nand\nusing this information to calculate a current nommand to the tong motor.\nThe\ncontrol system then servos the tong about this resulting\nforce.\nSince the\nposition of the tong actuator is related (through the spring constant of the\nactuator spring) to the force applied by the operator to the trigger, this is\nactually a force-force loop.\nThis control method is very flexible since the\ngains can be changed in the softwac_ to make the tong very sensitive to the\ntong actuator force for fragile Jobs, or insensitive\nfor heavy tasks.\nThe\nspring in the handle itself can also be changed\nfor various\ntasks or for\nindividual operators.\nOverall, this method is deemed very acceptable for the\nfunction it is to perform, but it will be thoroughly\nevaluated\nduring the\ntesting of the master.\n\nI\n\n2_10\n\nt\n\nPRELIMINARY\n\nTEST RESULTS\n\nMuch testing of this new teleoperator system has been done with one-degree\nof freedom test stands:\ntwo gear-drlven\nstands (Figure 6), one representing\nthe\nslave\nand one representing\nthe master,\nand\none cable-drlven\nstand\n(Figure 7) representing\nthe master.\nAll of the stands simulate the wrist roll\njoint, which has the most gear meshes,\nlargest\nlength, and most friction.\nThis Joint was chosen because it is obviously the most difficult.\nSince the\nmost important criterion\nfor the system\nis force-reflectlon\nthreshold,\nthe\nperformance of these test stands was quantified by this parameter in Table i.\n\n241\nJ\n\nSUMMARY\nAs can be seen from Table I, the results\nare very en\n_raglng.\nThe\nresults are well within the predictions and confirm that the present design is\nquite satisfactory.\nThe dual arm master controller\ntherefore should achieve\nall of the objectives\nof\' a low friction,\ninertia,\nand\nbacklash\nsystem.\nFabrication\nof the arms is scheduled\nto be completed\nin June 1985, and\nassembly completed\nin July.\nOverall,\nthe master\nrepresents\na significant\nengineering\nachievement.\nIt provides\na major\nperformance\nimprovement\nby\nemploying high-achievement.\nIt provides a major performance\nimprovement\nby\nemploying\nhigh-performance\ncommercial\ncomponents\nand\nhuman\n_actors\nengineering.\nThis will result in an ASM master/slave\nsystem that provides\nincreased\nperformance\nand capabilities\nthat are competitive\nwith existing\nservomanlpulator\nsystems.\nREFERENCES\ni.\n\nH.
