Tests were made at both the engine and vehicle levels. Detailed investigations were made on cold-start emissions devices, exhaust gas recirculation systems, and air injection reactor systems. Based on the results of engine tests, an alternative emission control system and modified control strategy were implemented and tested in the vehicle. With the same fuel economy and NOx emissions as the stock vehicle, the modified vehicle reduced HC and CO emissions by about 20 percent. By removing the NOx emissions constraint, the modified vehicle demonstrated about 12 percent better fuel economy than the stock vehicle.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19780024483, "id": "8e095ad6837d40e18d9aafc62bcbf800", "publicationDate": "1978-06-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19780024483.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19780024483/downloads/19780024483.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19780024483/downloads/19780024483.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19780024483/downloads/19780024483.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
