A. Madigan and R. W. Earhart\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\n\nNASA\'s Office of Space and Terrestrial Applications (OSTA) is currently\n\n\nassessing approaches to transferring NASA technology to both the public and\n\n\nprivate sectors.\n\nAs part of this assessment, NASA is evaluating the effective\xc2\xad\n\n\nness of an ongoing program in remote sensing technology transfer conducted by\n\n\n20 university contractors/grantees, each supported totally or partially by\n\n\nNASA funds.\n\nThe University-Space Applications program within NASA\'s Office\n\n\n\nof Space and Terrestrial Applications has as its objective the demonstration of\n\n\npractical benefits from the use of remote sensing technology to a broad spec\xc2\xad\n\ntrum of new users, principally in state and local governments.\n\n\nTo evaluate the University-Space Applications program, NASA has a\n\n\nnear-term requirement for data on each university effort including total\n\n\nfunding, funding sources, length of program, program description, and effec\xc2\xad\n\ntiveness measures.\n\nSpecifically, NASA requested Battelle to collect and\n\n\n\norganize the following information for each of the 20 university programs:\n\n\n(1) \tA description of the program including unique character\xc2\xad\n\nistics or capabilities which have been developed\n\n\n(2) \tProgram duration\n\n\n(3) \tFunding from NASA and non-NASA sources since 1974\n\n\n(4) \tMeasures of success such as the number and types of users\n\n\nof the facilities, data, and services, to the extent that\n\n\nsuch data are available.\n\n\nIt was recognized at the outset that a complete evaluation of effec\xc2\xad\n\ntiveness of the University Grants program is a complex undertaking well beyond\n\n\nthe time and resources alloted to this study.\n\nSuch an evaluation would require\n\n\n\ncollection and analysis of data on the significance and relative efficiency of\n\n\napplications of Landsat data which have been instituted at the state and local\n\n\nlevel and an assessment of the degree to which such applications were instituted\n\n\nsolely as a result of the grant program.\n\nIn order to provide preliminary inputs\n\n\n\nto such an assessment, secondary indications of program success were collected,\n\n\nalong with Program Manager\'s assessments of program effectiveness.\n\nThese are\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nindicators only, and should not be interpreted as a complete or objective\n\n\nevaluation of the effectiveness of the University Grants program.\n\n\n\nSTUDY METHODOLOGY\n\n\n\nSurvey Format\n\n\n\nA telephone survey was selected as the primary information gathering\n \n\nmechanism because of the short time requirement (NASA needed the data within\n\n\n3 weeks), and because of possible misinterpretation of specific questions such\n\n\nas funding sources, which were easily clarified by conversation.\n \n\nTo facilitate and organize the data collection task, the form shown\n\n\nin Figure 1 was developed as a survey guide.\n \n\n\nData Collection for NASA Review of University Programs in Remote\n\n\nSensing as a Part of a Review of Technology Transfer Activities\n\n\nUniversity:\nLaboratory:\n\nProgram Manager:\n\n\nTelephone:\n\n\n\nBackground\n\n\n1. \tDuration/program inception date\n\n\n2. \tProgram manager\'s overview/description of program\n\n\n3. \tSpecific technologies within remote sensing\n\n\n4. \tUnique or unusual capabilities\n \n\nLevel of Effort Measures\n\n\n1. \tNumber of people at university associated with remote\n\n\nsensing\n\n\n2. \tFunding by year from all sources since 1974\n\n\n1974\n\n1975\n\n1976\n\n1977\n\n\n\nNASA\n\n\nNon-NASA\n\n\nEffectiveness Measures\n\n\n1. \tCapabilities/relationships developed\n\n\n2. \tTypes of users\n\n\n3. \tUniversity courses/classes/degrees offered\n\n\nProgram Manager\'s Assessment\n \n\nFIGURE 1.\n\nSURVEY GUIDE\n\n\n\n3\nData Collection\n\n\n\nSpecific contacts at each university are given in Table 1.\n\n\nThe manager of each university program was contacted, and the required\n\n\ninformation collected by telephone.\n\nAs follow-up, some managers supplied\n\n\n\nwritten materials such as program reports and project descriptions.\n\nThe\n\n\n\ndata were organized from these sources into a standard format for each\n\n\nprogram. \t Summary sheets on each university are presented in this report\n\n\nin the section entitled Survey Findings-.\n\n\n\nTABLE 1. \t UNIVERSITY SPACE APPLICATIONS PROGRAM\n\n\nPRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS CONTACTED\n\n\n\nUniversity \t\nAlaska\n\nContact \n\n\nTelephone\n\n\n\nDr. John M.

Miller, Geophysical Institute\n\n\n\nTELEPHONE - 907-479-7363\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nThe institute was founded in 1947 to study the solid Earth and its\n\n\nupper atmosphere. The interest and background in remote sensing\n \n\nwas derived from the sensors used to study the upper atmosphere\n\n\nand applied to research for state and local public needs under the\n\n\nNASA Grant.\n\n\nMost applications addressed in remote sensing work at the institute\n\n\nare directed toward land use planning/Earth resources surveys and\n\n\nmanagement.\n\n\nTechnologies Used\n\n\nTechnologies used are predominately conventional image interpretation\n\n\nusing a combination of high altitude (U-2) photography and Landsat\n\n\nimagery. The scale of the imagery is usually adequate to the task.\n\n\nApplications\n\n\nUses to date include application of Landsat imagery to 40 million\n\n\nacres of Alaska so that 4 to 10 million acres could be selected\n\n\nby the tribes under the Native Claims Settlement Act and to river\n\n\nice problems. Landsat imagery was used to determine ice buildup\n\n\non the rivers so that coal dust could be dumped by aircraft to encourage\n\n\nselective melting and thereby prevent floods. Because of the length\n\n\nof the rivers, this must be planned to achieve the maximum benefit\n\n\nfrom available aircraft time. The application of Landsat data to\n\n\nforest fire control was also demonstrated in the recent major fires\n\n\nto the extent that the State is in the process of getting an Alaskan\n\n\nLandsat processing capability. This appears to be the only program\n\n\nwhich has generated enough interest in near-real-time Landsat data\n\n\nuse to get the state involved. This has occurred primarily because\n\n\nAlaska has such a large amount of sparsely populated land that remote\n\n\nsensing via Landsat is the only way of accomplishing tasks for which\n\n\nalternatives are available elsewhere.\n\n\nDuration\n\n\nThe institute was founded in 1947-48; work in a formal remote sensing\n\n\nprogram started in 1972.\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n\nLEVEL OF EFFORT\n\n\nPeople at University\n\n\nThere are approximately 120 to 130 people involved in the Institute,\n\n\nbut only 6 people involved on a part-time basis in remote sensing\n\n\nwork under the grant.\n\n\nOther Support\n\n\nSome contacts with the NASA Fairbanks center are supportive in nature\n\n\nand considerable intangible support is received from the state\n\n\ngovernment. Quantified estimates of the support are not made.\n\n\nFunding\n\n\nAll funding has come from governmental units with Federal funds\n\n\ncomprising approximately 85 percent of the total. The state has\n\n\ncontributed approximately 7 percent and the boroughs also approxi\xc2\xad\n\nmately 7 percent...Many of the boroughs are as large as most of the\n\n\nother 49 states.\n\n\nThousands of Current Dollars\n\n\n1974\n1975\n1976\n1977\n\nNASA Grant\n\n1-\xc2\xad\n00\n\n100\n\n\nOther\nPrivate\nTOTAL\n\n200\n\n\n195\n\n5\n\n-\n\n00\n\n100\n\n400\n\n\n\nEFFECTIVENESS\n\n\nUsers\n\n\nUsers have been largely governmental units with most of the funding\n\n\ncoming from the Federal government. Because much of the land is\n\n\nrelatively unexplored, any work in remote sensing by any unit of\n\n\ngovernment is of interest to others. Most of the work has been\n\n\naccomplished under the auspices of the U.S. Bureaus of Land Manage\xc2\xad\n\nment and Indian Affairs. Because Alaska is a relatively new state\n\n\nand a large land area which would normally be under state ownership\n\n\nis still under Federal control until allocations are made, the state\n\n\nis not interested in funding Earth resources surveys. The program\n\n\nhas generated enthusiasm in several state agencies, but until the\n\n\nstate controls the land, little funding is likely to be forthcoming.\n\n\nExceptions to this occur in land which is under state ownership, and\n\n\nthe Federal government charges for management services such as fire\n\n\ncontrol.\n\n\nA historical review of Landsat data on the recent major forest fires\n\n\nindicated a major advantage could have been achieved if Landsat\n\n\nimagery had been available within a few hours of satellite passage.\n\n\nBecause of this demonstrated advantage in this and other applications\n\n\nsuch as flood planning and control, the state is considering appro\xc2\xad\n\npriating $500,000 per year for a Landsat ground terminal. \'\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n\nCourses\n\n\nNo degree is offered in remote sensing, as it is viewed as a tool\n\n\nwithin other disciplines. Photographic interpretation is taught\n\n\nin the geology department (15-20 students per year) and the biology\n\n\ndepartment (60-70 students per year).\nIt is expected that similar\n\n\ninstruction will be offered in the agricultural school, with\n\n\npotentially another 30 or 40 students per year.\n\n\n\nPROCRAM MANAGER\'S ASSESSMENT\n\n\nThe state is currently deficient in spending on remote sensing because\n\n\nland selection for state ownership is frozen. The situation appears to\n\n\nbe improving even under this freeze since Landsat data are valuable for\n\n\nnear-real-time management purposes. Major problems in Landsat data\n\n\navailability from NASA apparently will be reduced in the near future.\n\n\nThe only other major problem now apparent is that non-federally sponsored\n\n\nU-2 flights have become too expensive for ready justification to the\n\n\nstate government and the program must ride along on federally sponsored\n\n\nhigh altitude imagery.\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n\nUNIVERSITY - Arizona\n\n\n\nPROGRAM MANAGER - Dr. Ken Foster, Office of Arid Land Studies\n\n\n\nTELEPHONE - 602-884-1955\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nThe program concentrates on remote sensing for arid environments,\n\n\nparticularly in desertification problems and in resource management,\n\n\nspecifically ground water inventory and flash flood hazard inventory\n\n\nefforts. In addition, the program has backed the performance of\n\n\nconsiderable land use planning. Related to the program in remote\n\n\nsensing applications is a program in sensor design conducted by the\n\n\nUniversity\'s Optical Sciences Department which includes under\xc2\xad\n\ngraduate courses as well as research and development.\n\n\nSpecific Technologies\n\n\nThe remote sensing program conducts an applications program usually\n\n\nbased on traditional photointerpretation techniques. The program has\n\n\navailable to it a large variety of equipment and capabilities which\n\n\nmight not be available if there were no interaction with the sensor\n\n\ndevelopment program. Among the equipment is a spot densitometer\n\n\nobtained from JPL. The program has also implemented the LARSYS\n\n\nprogram from Purdu4.\nOverall, the facilities are considered to be\n\n\nabove average, but not unique. Because of the scale at which they are\n\n\nable to operate in a low population density state, the program is able\n\n\nto make more use of Landsat and U-2 imagery than are programs in states\n\n\nwith higher population densities.\n\n\nDuration\n\n\nThe overall program in remote sensing applications was established in\n\n\n1970 and NASA grant work was started in 1972. Approximately 30 projects\n\n\nhave been undertaken.\n \n\n\nLEVEL OF EFFORT\n\n\nPeople at University\n\n\nApproximately 10 people on a full-time equivalent basis work on remote\n\n\nsensing applications. The number of people involved on a part-time\n\n\nbasis is substantially larger and includes an eight person university\n \n\nremote sensing committee representing eight different disciplines.\n\n\n\n9\n\nOther Support comes from JPL and Ames and is estimated to be about one\n\n\nman-month per year. The state government provides some cooperative\n\n\nsupport in investigations but a firm estimate is not available.\n\n\nFunding\n\n\nThousands of Current Dollars\n\n\n1977\n\n\n1976\n1975\n1974\nNASA Grant\n\n75\n\n125\n\n100\n\n100\n\n\n\nNon-NASA Funding\n \n\n(Fed., State, Local,\nPrivate)\n\n\n\n-\n\n50\n\n75\n\n150\n\n\n\nIndian Tribes\n\n-\n\n-\n\n50\n\n50\n\n\n\n75\n\n175\n\n225\n\n300\n\n\n\nTotal\n\nEFFECTIVENESS\n\n\nUsers\n\n\nFederal government users of the program include the Bureaus of Indian\n\n\nAffairs, Reclamation and Land Management, and the Park and Soil\n\n\nConservation Services. Federal interests in applications in Arizona\n\n\nalso support the activities of the state agencies.\n \n\nActively assisted state agencies include the Water Commission, Oil\n\n\nand Gas Conservation, Fish and Game Commissions as well as the Land\n\n\nDepartment and Planning Department. The program has also assisted the\n\n\nNatural Resources Committee of the State Senate. Local government\n\n\nusers include about three-fourths of the counties and two councils of\n\n\ncity governments: Tucson and Scottsdale. The program has also assisted\n\n\nthe Salt River Project to provide increased water supplies. Involve\xc2\xad\n\nment in this project is both governmental and private since the\n\n\nimplications of the water supply are so great.\n\n\nPrivate sector involvement (providing some small funding) includes con\xc2\xad\n\nservation groups (Nature Conservancy) and also geologists (consultants)\n\n\nwho use the photographic files. The involvement on a contractual basis\n\n\nwith two Indian tribes is considered to be approximately equivalent to a\n\n\nlocal government involvement in land inventory and land use planning.\n\n\nCourses\n\n\nThe University offers 23 courses in remote sensing topics; about half of\n\n\nthese courses cover remote sensing technology while the other half are\n\n\noriented toward applications. The number of students per course is\n\n\nestimated at 15 or about 350 students per year. A Ph.D. minor or speciali\xc2\xad\n\nzation in remote sensing is offered.\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\nPROGRAM MANAGER\'S ASSESSMENT\n\n\nThe program is very strong in conventional photointerpretation and map\n\n\nmaking. Because of costs and associated lack of demand, the program is\n\n\nnot as strong as it would like to be in image processing. The manager\n\n\nfeels that closer ties to avoid duplication are needed with the Arizona\n\n\nResources Information System in the state government.\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n\nUNIVERSITY - California (Berkeley, Davis, Riverside and Santa Barbara)\n\n\n\nPROGRAM MANAGER - Dr. Robert N. Colwell, School of Forestry and Conservation\n\n\n\nTELEPHONE - 415-642-5170\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nThe program started about 1947 using aerial photo technology and has had\n\n\na long history in Earth resources, predominantly directed toward forestry\n\n\nand water management. Water management efforts include snow-cover and\n\n\nevapotranspiration studies for optimum water utilization in entire water\xc2\xad\n\nsheds and for all requirements including agriculture. Recent work during\n\n\nthe two-year dry period has attracted national attention to the potential\n\n\nof using remote sensing for water management. Work under the NASA grant\n\n\nbegan in 1970 and is carried out at four campuses of the University of\n\n\nCalifornia system: Berkeley, Davis, Riverside and Santa Barbara. In\n\n\naddition to water studies, remote\'sensing has been applied to fuel\n\n\nmapping of brush and timberland, fuel moisture estimation, cotton mapping\n\n\nfrom Landsat data, a citrus tree census, desert wilderness area selection,\n\n\nand assistance to state and county planners in brush management, highway\n\n\nand geothermal energy considerations, usually through land use mapping\n\n\ntechniques.\n\n\nTechnologies\n\n\nMuch of the work in applications areas is conducted using conventional\n\n\nphotointerpretation of Landsat and high-altitude imagery. The program\n\n\nhas the capability of processing its own data tapes.\n\n\nDuration\n\n\nProgram inception, 1947; NASA Grant, 1970.\n\n\n\nLEVEL OF EFFORT\n\n\nPeople at University\n\n\nApproximately 60 people are involved on four different campuses.\n\n\nOther Support\n\n\nState agencies are currently providing about five man-years per year\n\n\nof employee time on cooperative projects; if a direct man-year including\n\n\ntravel, per diem and, direct fringe benefits is costed at $20,000, this\n\n\nrepresents approximately $100,000 per year. In addition, there is federal\n\n\nsupport which is not well quantified, but is estimated at one or two\n\n\nman-years per year.\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n\nFunding\n\n\nMost of the project\'s funding comes from NASA and other Federal agencies,\n\n\nprincipally the Bureau of Land Management. In the past there has been\n\n\nsome direct state funding, but not at the present time. All projects\n\n\nhave been carried out for some level of government and there has been\n\n\nno involvement with the private sector. The closest activity to private\n\n\nsector involvement was the construction of an image enhancement\n\n\naparatus for the Mexican Government.\n\n\nThousands of Current Dollars\n\n\n1974\n\n1975\n\n1976\n\n1977\n\n\n\nNASA Grant\n\n-\n\n-\n\nOther NASA\n\n500\n\n550\n\n655\n\n471\n\n\n\nOther Federal*\n\n250\n\n250\n\n150\n\n150\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n750\n\n800\n\n895\n\n866\n\n\n\n90\n\n245\n\n* U.S. Bureau of Land Management.\n\nEFFECTIVENESS\n\n\nUsers\n\n\nAll work has been directed toward potential government users of remote\n\n\nsensing. The principal current state work is for the California Department\n\n\nof Water Resources where the application is highly significant since 85\n\n\npercent of California agriculture is irrigation dependent and California\n\n\nis one of the top agriculture states. The major Federal user of remote\n\n\nsensing applications is the U.S. Bureau of Land Management in California.\n\n\nSome work is also directed toward county and city planning.\n\n\nCourses\n\n\nNo degree is offered in remote sensing work. Twelve to sixteen credit\n\n\nhours are offered in undergraduate schools and formal graduate course\n\n\nwork is limited to 6 to 8 credit hours. Individualized study and/or\n \n\nresearch courses dre also available. Students per year at the four\n\n\ncampuses are estimated at 300, or about 75 per campus.\n\n\n\nPROGRAM MANAGERTS ASSESSMENT\n\n\nThe problems which might be expected from a multi-campus program have not\n\n\nmaterialized and, in fact, the spirit of cooperation appears strong. The\n\n\neducation and training is also strong and is focused on preparing students\n\n\nfor the real world and moving them out without delay. The major problems\n\n\noccur in uncertainty and delays in awards, grants and contracts rather\n\n\nthan in the level of funding. Most of these uncertainties are not technical\n\n\nbut administrative; one example is a hold on Federal awards to U.C.-Berkeley\n\n\nfrom HEW associated with minority hiring.\n\n\n\n13\n\n\n\nUNIVERSITY - Colorado\n\n\n\nPROGRAM MANAGER - Dr. Jack D. Ives, Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research\n\n\n\nTELEPHONE - 303-492-7909\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nGrant activities have been concentrated in three areas:\n\n\n(1) \tHazard mapping for avalanches and landslides in the Rocky\n\n\nMountains\n\n\n(2) \tSpinoffs from this activity, specifically analyses of recurrence\n\n\nintervals for the hazard analysis\n\n\n(3) \t\nAn environmental atlas for the Colorado front range for land\n \n\nuse policy decisions.\n\n\nOther work undertaken by the institute is more reflective of their\n\n\ntitle and about 5,0 percent of the effort is directed toward the U.S.\n\n\nand Canadian arctic, where applications tend to be concentrated in\n\n\nAlaska and theoretical studies are concentrated in Canada. Examples\n\n\nof the Alaskan applications studies are a Landsat mosaic of Petroleum\n\n\nReserve No. 4 for the pipeline haul road impact assessment and remote\n\n\nsensing of sea ice for traffic studies. An example of a theoretical\n\n\nstudy in Canada is the determination that the unusually light colored\n\n\nrock visible in aerial and satellite photography is due to the death\n\n\nof rock lichen during the little ice age in the 17th Century. The\n\n\ndistribution of this phenomenon has been used to model growth and\n \n\ndecline of glacation.\n\n\nEfforts in alpine research include remote sensing and other studies\n \n\nin high mountains around the world, including the Alps, the Himalayas\n\n\nand Andes Mountains.\n\n\nSpecific Technologies\n\n\nThe program uses color enhancement of remote sensing imagery for\n\n\ndetailed mapping, but has no unique or unusual capabilities. The\n\n\nprogram\'s expertise lies in its extensive mountain field experience\n\n\nand applying its research to needs of society.\n\n\nProgram Duration\n\n\nThe institute was founded in 1950 and remained a small operation\n\n\nuntil 1967 when a new director was obtained under the condition that\n\n\nthe program would be expanded. NASA grant activity was initiated in\n\n\nlate 1970.\n\n\n\n14\n\n\n\nLEVEL OF EFFORT\n\n\nPeople at University\n\n\nThe grant supports approximately six people on a full-time equivalent\n \n\nbasis plus a small part of the institute director\'s time. The institute\n\n\nas a whole has approximately 65 people involved on either a full- or\n\n\npart-time basis. Seven faculty members spend 5 to 10 percent of their\n\n\ntime on institute affairs and there are 5 post-doctoral students and\n\n\n12 technicians.\n\n\nSupport from Other Institutions is relatively minor and consists of\n\n\ncollaborative input from the state Division of Natural Resources\n \n\nand the state Geological Survey.\n\n\nFunding by year for the entire institute is approximately $1.8 million\n\n\nfor 1977. Direct state funding is relatively small, $64,000 per year\n \n\nfor their mountain research station; direct county/local government\n\n\nfunding averages about $2,000 per year and has totaled $12,000 over\n \n\nthe life of the program. Most of the rest of the funding comes from\n\n\nFederal and/or international agencies.\n \n\nThousands of Current Dollars\n \n\n1974\n1975\n1976\n1977\n\n\nNASA Grant \t\n\n75\n\n125\n\n100\n\n100\n\n\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n64\n66\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n400\n1,170*\n\n75\n\n125\n\n100\n\n1,800\n\n\n\nMountain Res.

Some minor county funding has been obtained. Federal funding\n\n\nof remote sensing activities tends to come from the U.S. Forest Service,\n\n\nboth from operational offices and from the USFS Rocky Mountain Research\n\n\nCenter at Fort Collins. Formal private sector involvment has been\n\n\nrelatively limited as the institute prefers to avoid the type of work\n\n\nrequested by the private sector; some of the students/associates,\n\n\nhowever, consult for private sector firms or work for private consultants.\n\n\nThe program has, nevertheless, received two private sector contracts,\n\n\n\n15\n\n\n\none for $12,000 and another for $50,000 with Vail Associates to perform\n\n\nski area hazard assessments. Foreign funding is chiefly provided by\n\n\nthe United Nations University.\n\n\nCapabilities/Relationships\n\n\nIn addition to developing expertise in mountain and glacial research,\n\n\nthe institute has concentrated on translating imagery information for\n\n\nuse of planning agencies.\n\n\nCourses and Students\n\n\nThe institute is part of the graduate school but does not offer a\n\n\ndegree; all degrees are offered in traditional disciplines. Approxi\xc2\xad\n\nmately six formal courses are offered in remote sensing to approximately\n\n\n100 to 125 students per year.\n\n\n\nPROGRAM MANAGER\'S ASSESSMENT\n\n\nThe program\'s intended strength is in natural hazard work of all types\n\n\nand is considered successful in that specific area. The major defficency\n \n\nin the program is that they do not have a faculty member with a strong\n\n\nbackground in remote sensing technology.\n\n\n\n16\n\n\n\nUNIVERSITY - Cornell\n\n\n\nPROGRAM MANAGERS - Dr. Ta Liang, College of Engineering - 607-256-3438\nDr. Warren Philipson - 607-256-4330\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nCornell\'s NASA grant activities were started in 1972 as a continuation\n\n\nand extension of the photogrammetry work which had been underway for\n\n\napproximately 30 years. The entire program concentrates on projects\n\n\nwhich potentially provide tangible benefits, do not compete with\n\n\nexisting industry or commercial firms, and are not of a repetitious\n\n\nnature. Because data bases tend to be already available for state\xc2\xad\n\nwide surveys, the program has emphasized to a considerable extent\n\n\nwork at the county and town level.\n\n\nSpecific Technologies\n\n\nThe program concentrates on photographic techniques and interpre\xc2\xad\n\ntation.

The program has\n\n\nalso concentrated on interpretation techniques which give reliable\n\n\nindications of subsurface conditions from remote sensing data,\n\n\nespecially for soils. A typical county study provided data dis\xc2\xad\n\ntinguishing active from non-active agricultural areas for a rezoning\n\n\nstudy. This type of activity also llustrates the emphasis of the\n \n\nprogram on work which can be shown to produce a specific action or\n\n\nbenefit. The program also has performed studies for the State\n\n\nDepartments of Health (Mosquito Control for Eastern Equine Encephalitis)\n\n\nand Environmental Conservation (pheasant range model to replace an\n\n\ninadequate 1970 study).\n\n\nCourses\n\n\nThe University offers a variety of courses centered around photo\xc2\xad\n\ninterpretation and has approximately 100 students in these courses.\n\n\nThe advanced degree program includes doctorates in photogrammetric\n\n\nand geodetic engineering and also aerial photogrammetric studies\n\n\nand remote sensing. There is a seminar which features speakers from\n\n\ngovernment and industry as well as other universities.\n\n\nTypes of Users\n\n\nWork under the grant has concentrated on county and town governments,\n\n\nbut has also included projects for state, Federal and industrial\n\n\nusers of remote sensing. The principal private sector user has been\n\n\nthe Taylor Wine Company for which a vineyard survey was performed.\n\n\nThe NASA grant efforts are currently concentrated on localized projects.\n\n\n\n18\n\n\n\nPROGRAM MANAGER\'S ASSESSMENT\n\n\nThe program has succeeded in demonstrating the benefits of remote\n\n\nsensing to decision makers in work under the grant, but much work\n\n\nfor which remote sensing is appropriate cannot demonstrate this direct\n\n\nbenefit. The program has also strengthengd coursework at the University\n\n\nand is also strengthened in return by the seminar and newsletter on\n\n\nremote sensing activities. The grant has greatly assisted in the\n \n\ndevelopment of staff expertise. Little use has been made of Landsat\n\n\ndata as it is not a problem-solving tool at the level in which the\n\n\nprogram works.\n\n\n\n19\n\n\n\nUNIVERSITY - Florida\n\n\n\nPROGRAM MANAGER - Dr. H. K. Brooks, Department of Geology\n\n\n\nTELEPHONE - 904-392-2284 (Ext. 2231)\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nNASA grant funding of the University of Florida remote sensing program\n\n\nbegan in 1976, though the University has had some activity in remote\n\n\nsensing as early as 1958. The program has been involved in two major\n\n\nareas of remote sensing; soil moisture and hydrology, and coastal\n\n\nengineering.\n\n\nThe program has developed an expertise in spectral shift correction\n\n\nfor haze, used in studying evaporative processes of vegetation asso\xc2\xad\n\nciated with water management. The procedures developed have been\n\n\nadapted by NASA for use at KSC.\n\n\n\nLEVEL OF EFFORT\n\n\nUniversity Involvement\n\n\nThere are 12 faculty members involved in the project, which includes\n\n\nfive or six different departments in the colleges of Arts and Science,\n\n\nEngineering, and the Institute of Food and Agricultural Science.\n\n\nSupporting staff consists of a full-time engineering technician\n\n\nand five graduate student research assistants.\n\n\nFunding\n\n\nFunding since 1976 is as follows:\n\n\nThousands of\n\n\nCurrent Dollars\n\n\n1977\n\n\n1976\n100\n\n\n\nNASA Grant\n\n200\n\nOther NASA\n\n*\n\n*\n\nUniversity\n\n20\n\n20\n\n\n\nTOTAL\n\n220\n\n120\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Other NASA contributions include time on the Image 100 machine at\n\n\nKSC plus other services and facilities. The University contribution\n\n\nis primarily staff salary. Also, state agencies have provided some\n\n\nfunding in kind. For example, the St. John Water Management District\n\n\nemploys a man full-time for the project.\n\n\n\n20\n\n\n\nEFFECTIVENESS\n\n\nUsers/Relationships Developed\n\n\nThough grant funds have only recently been initiated, a number of\n\n\nprojects have been undertaken with state and local agencies. Some\n\n\nof these have resulted in recommendations on which decisions were\n\n\nbased.\n\n\n"\n\nA project was undertaken to delineate water recharge areas\nfor Daytona Beach (Volusia County). The goal of the project\nwas to identify hydrologic characteristics of the Daytona Beach\nwater and sewer supply. The city of Daytona has accepted the\nproject recommendations and has asked the county to institute\na $10 million water project based on the results. Using vege\xc2\xad\ntation as an indicator, the survey contradicted previous geo\xc2\xad\nlogical interpretations of location of key water sources.\n\n"\n\nRecommendations were made on harbor improvement in Clearwater,\nFlorida, based on a water inlet analysis.\n\n"\n\nA project is currently underway with Captiva Island to study\nerosion of the island area. This is a long-term analysis\ninvolving Lee County, the Army Corps of Engineers, and a\nprivate consultant hired by the County Erosion Control Board.\n\n*\n\nA project undertaken with the St. John Water Management District\n\n\nwill develop evaporative maps for water management decisions.\n\n\nThough 52 in. of rain per year fall on the area, 42 in. evapor\xc2\xad\n\nates back into the atmosphere through plants, with a resultant\n\n\nimpact on water management.\n\n\n\nCourses and Students\n\n\nThe University offers four courses in remote sensing. Two courses\n\n\nare offered in civil engineering, while one course each is offered\n\n\nin geography and geology. Thirty-six graduate students and 41 under\xc2\xad\n\ngraduate students are enrolled in remote sensing courses each year,\n\n\nwhile another 61 undergraduates are taking remote sensing segments\n\n\nas part of other course work such as geology.\n\n\n\nPROGRAM MANAGER\'S ASSESSMENT\n\n\nThough grant funding was only initiated in 1976, at least one project\n\n\nwith Daytona Beach has provided results on which significant decisions\n\n\nwere made in the location of water sources. The program is becoming\n\n\ninvolved in areas that are likely to have high utilization, such as the\n\n\ndevelopment of evaporative maps for water management, erosion control\n\n\nmeasures based on remote sensing monitoring, and recommendations to\n\n\nstate and local agencies on issues such as harbor improvement.\n\n\n\n21\n\n\n\nUNIVERSITY - Kansas, Center for Research, Incorporated\n\n\n\nPROGRAM MANAGER - B.

Three main areas of concentration are wildlife\n\n\nhabitat and environment, urban and regional planning, and agricultural\n\n\nand rural development. The program emphasizes decision-making projects\n\n\nwith Kansas state and local agencies, based on the application of\n\n\nremote sensing to current problems. Most of the imagery used to date\n\n\nhas been low and high altitude color and infrared, with some Landsat\n\n\ndata as applicable. Almost no computerized Land~at data have been used.\n\n\nThere have been eight to 10 projects per year with state agencies, and\n\n\n41 out of 100 counties in the state have been involved since the program\n\n\nstarted. Several workshops and seminars have been held with state\n\n\nagencies and regional planning groups, in addition to a governor\'s\n\n\nconference in 1972 and 1974.\n\n\n\nLEVEL OF EFFORT\n\n\nUniversity Involvement\n\n\nThree faculty members are involved in the program (1 full-time,\n\n\n2 part-time) as well as two additional faculty contributing to the\n\n\nprogram as part of their own research efforts.

An additional 150 contacts\n\n\ncan be drawn upon as needed. Several letters of support have come\n\n\nfrom state agencies, resulting in a bill in the Kansas legislature\n \n\nto provide state funds for the program (initially $35,000/year).\n\n\nProjects have ranged from wildlife management to rerouting garbage\n\n\ncollection routes. As an example, one project involved the release\n\n\nof wildlife into new areas on the basis of ground cover assessment.\n\n\nOther projects included an endangered species assessment, and an\n\n\nirrigation study. Since 1972, 48 projects have been completed.\n\n\nIt was noted that NASA support for demonstration projects is essential,\n\n\nsince the state will not support demonstration activities. States\n\n\nwill, however, participate in demonstration programs backed by\n\n\nFederal funds, and will adopt applications that prove useful.\n \n\nThis program is viewed by Kansas as an excellent outreach program\n\n\nwhich has resulted in good state/university interaction. The state\n\n\nhad usually regarded the University as too "research oriented", but\n\n\nwith the KARS program, several products turned out have been used\n\n\nby state agencies.\n \n\nThe KARS program maintains a specific procedure for state involve\xc2\xad\n\nment consisting of the following steps:\n\n\n(a) Make initial contact with agency\n\n\n(bY Discuss agency problem\n\n\n(c) Discuss available remote sensing inputs\n\n\n\'(d) Review how inputs will help problem\n\n\n(e) Propose a joint undertaking.\n\n\nIn several cases, agency personnel were brought to the University\n\n\nto work on the project. Considerable effort is placed on follow-up\n\n\nafter the product (e.g., map, data, report) is produced. Follow-up\n\n\nwith the actual decision-making process is then pursued.\n\n\nFederal\n\n\nIn addition to state and local participation, the following Federal\n\n\nagencies have been involved in the program to varying degrees:\n\n\n-\n\nU.S. Army Corp of Engineers\n\n\nFish and Wildlife\n\n\n\n-\n\nU.S. Department of Agriculture\n\n\n\n-\n\nSoil Conservation Service\n\n\nForestry\n\n\n\n-\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency\n\n\n\n-\n\nU.S. Geological Survey.\n\n\n\n23\n\n\n\nPrivate\n\n\nA number of so-called "service contacts" are made with the KARS\n\n\nprogram by private organizations and individuals. These calls\n\n\naverage about 20 per month, and consist primarily of questions\n\n\nrelated to the availability and interpretation of EROS Data Center\n\n\nimagery. Typical questions are:\n\n\n1. \tWhere can information be obtained on remote sensing?\n\n\n2. \tDoes imagery over a specific area exist and how can\n\n\nit be obtained?\n\n\n3. \tWe have ordered a satellite image from EROS.\nyou help us interpret it?\n\n\n\nCan\n\n\n\nMany of these calls result from the broad exposure maintained by\n\n\nthe program through a quarterly newsletter which has a circulation\n\n\nof 800 persons.\n\n\nCourses and Students\n\n\nThree courses in remote sensing are taught at the University.\n\n\nThese include two geography courses and a continuing education\n\n\ncourse designed for high school teachers who want to incorporate\n\n\nremote sensing into coursework. Some one-time courses such as\n\n\nair-photointerpretation and terrain analysis are also taught.\n\n\nAbout 75 students were enrolled in remote sensing courses during\n\n\n1977.\n\n\nWithin the KARS program, over 17 different university departments\n\n\nhave been involved in the various projects undertaken since 1972.\n\n\n\nPROGRAM MANAGER\'S ASSESSMENT\n\n\nThe program has been valuable in promoting state/university interaction\n\n\nand has formed the basis of an excellent outreach activity. Forty-eight\n\n\nprojects have been accomplished with state and local agencies, giving\n\n\nvisible results. Before the program, the state viewed university efforts\n\n\nas largely research rather than applications oriented. Many agencies have\n\n\nsent letters to the state legislature praising the program.

Shepperd, Space Science Center\n\n\n\nTELEPHONE - 612-373-5479\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nThe Space Science Center was founded in 1968 to undertake a variety\n\n\nof work in space science and technology related thereto. Work in\n\n\nremote sensing was started in July 1972. Current work in remote\n\n\nsensing is directed in three areas: a study of peatlands for the\n\n\nMinnesota Geological Survey; a study of causes of pollution in Lake\n\n\nSuperior; and a soils survey. Work in forestry is no longer active,\n\n\nbut produced good technical results while active.\n\n\nTechnology Used\n\n\nTechnology used is predominately Landsat and aircraft imagery from\n\n\nthe EROS Center. Emphasis is on interpretation of Landsat\n\n\nimagery.\n\n\n\nLEVEL OF EFFORT\n\n\nPeople at University\n\n\nApproximately 23 people, including graduate students, are involved in\n\n\nremote sensing. There are three co-principal investigators with five\n\n\ngraduate students and 15 or 16 undergraduates organized in three groups,\n\n\nwith one of the groups at the Duluth campus.\n\n\nOther Support\n\n\nOther support comes from the EROS Center and from the U.S. Army Corps\n\n\nof Engineers (Lake Superior Studies) as well as from the Minnesota\n\n\nDNR and Planning Agency. The support is intangible assistance and\n\n\ndifficult to quantify.\n\n\nFunding\n\n\nFunding for the institute runs to approximately $2 million per year,\n\n\nthe majority from NASA. Funding for other remote sensing activities\n \n\nwas approximately $270 million in 1977 with 50 percent coming from NASA.\n\n\n\n32\n\n\n\nThousands of Current Dollars\n\n\n1977\n1976\n1975\n1974\nNASA Grant\nOther Remote Sensing\nOther Institute Funding\nTOTAL\n\n70\n\n60\n\n60\n\n90\n270 (50% NASA)\n1640 (Primarily NASA)\n\n70\n\n60\n\n60\n\n2000\n\nEFFECTIVENESS\n\n\nUsers\n\n\nThe remote sensing program has developed a wide range of both govern\xc2\xad\n\nmental and commercial users. The program has also been assisted by\n\n\nthe fact that Minnesota Geological Survey is a part of the University\n\n\nand the program is cooperating with the MGS in a study of peatlands\n\n\nand also the use of wet lands for energy production through the growing\n\n\nof cattails. Cattails produce more usable energy per acre per year\n\n\nthan does timber. The group at Duluth is studying the sources of\n\n\nLake Superior pollution for the State EPA and the U.S. Corps of\n\n\nEngineers. The Lake Superior study also investigates beach nourishment\n\n\nand lake currents as part of an overall lake modeling effort. The\n\n\nthird active group is conducting a soils survey for the State Agricul\xc2\xad\n\nture Department as well as draught stress areas with a view toward crop\n\n\nmanagement and crop prediction improvement. Another group, no longer\n\n\nactive under the grant, did work in pine plantation management (aerial\n\n\nsurveys for thinning) as well as disease and parasite detection.\n\n\nVertical photography was found to be good for oak wilt detection but\n\n\noblique photography was found to be necessary for Dutch elm disease\n\n\ndetection. The Minnesota Geological Survey, not funded by the grant,\n\n\nuses Landsat data to study the effects and evidence of glacial over\xc2\xad\n\ndraft and plate/crustal faults for mineralization detection. Sub\xc2\xad\n\nsurface evidence of faulting with associated mineralization has been\n\n\ndemonstrated with Landsat imagery and subsurface water was located in\n\n\nsoutheast Minnesota during the drought.\n\n\nThe program has had considerable contact with commercial interests,\n\n\nchiefly through the forestry group. Nine organizations including one\n\n\ntrade association were involved in the forestry project.\n\n\nCourses\n\n\nCourses are departmentally organized, with the forestry department\n\n\nhaving the most students. Photogrammetry is taught in civil engineering\n\n\nand pattern recognition in the computer sciences department. A high\xc2\xad\n\nlight of physics course with about 25% remote sensing content is taught\n\n\nto about 80 students per year. The number of students per year is\n\n\nestimated at about 300, with approximately 200 of them in the forestry\n\n\ncourses where remote sensing applications are emphasized.\n\n\n\n33\n\n\n\nPROGRAM MANAGER\'S ASSESSMENT\n\n\nWhile the remote sensing program has made a large number and variety\n\n\nof contacts, the greatest success has been with the State Geological\n\n\nSurvey and its work in remote sensing for resources and their management.\n\n\nThe major perceived weakness in the program is the lack of a side looking\n\n\nradar capability. There is also a problem obtaining newly collected\n\n\nimagery and other data while it is still timely.\n\n\n\n34\n\n\n\nUNIVERSITY - Mississippi State\n\n\n\nPROGRAM MANAGER - Dr. W.

The environmental quality efforts have been conducted\n\n\nwith the State Department of Environmental Quality and have been\n \n\ndirected at pollution regulation. The program has also performed\n\n\nstudies for county government; examples are land use studies for\n\n\ncounty planning agencies and tax assessors. Projects performed\n\n\nfor state and local governments tend to be short, typically 6 to 18\n\n\nmonths in duration.\n\n\nSpecific Technologies\n\n\nThe program uses Landsat and U-2 imagery for most of its projects.\n\n\nLittle use is made of Landsat computer-compatible tapes (CCTs) in work for\n\n\nthe state and local governments since those agencies cannot afford\n \n\nthem unless Federal funding is also available for the project.\n\n\n\nUnique or Unusual Capabilities\n \n\nThe program has a capability to reproduce relatively large numbers\n\n\nof maps and photos for field use at economical costs. The products\n\n\ncan be scaled and annotated with symbols.\n\n\nDuration\n\n\nProgram inception, 1968; NASA grant, 1972.\n\n\n\nLEVEL OF EFFORT\n\n\nPersonnel\n\n\nEleven people work in the laboratory, with an equivalent of eight\n\n\nfull-time positions. Additionally, five faculty members are strongly\n\n\nassociated with the research activities of the lab, and represent\n\n\n\n40\n\n\n\napproximately one full-time equivalent researcher. The state and\n\n\nFederal government agencies also provide some cooperative assistance\n\n\nin areas of interest to those agencies; the level of assistance\n\n\nis estimated to total slightly less than two full-time equivalent\n\n\npositions.\n\n\nFunding\n\n\nThe funding for the program comes from a variety of sources in\n\n\naddition to the NASA grant.

The\n\n\nwork performed for the Federal government is generally useful to state\n\n\nand local governments in the area under study. State users of the\n\n\nprogram include the forestry, fish and wildlife, environmental quality,\n\n\nand land conservation and development agencies. Work has also been\n\n\nperformed for county tax assessors in verifying changes from dry to\n\n\nirrigated farming and for state tax assessors in verifying timber\n\n\nseverence taxes.\n\n\nThe major agricultural application has been in monitoring tansy\n\n\nragwort infestation of grass and rangeland. This is particularly\n\n\nsignificant in Oregon since the state is a major producer of grass\n\n\nseed in addition to use of grassland for hay and forage. Individual\n\n\nconsultants also have made use of the imagery files.\n\n\nCapabilities/Relationships\n\n\nThe scale of operations in Oregon is sufficiently large that Landsat\n\n\nimagery is very useful and the program has used Landsat imagery extensively.\n\n\n\n41\n\n\n\nNon-Federal sponsors, however, cannot afford digital processing and\n\n\nthis aspect of Landsat use has not developed to any significant\n\n\nextent. State relationships are good, but funding from state agencies\n\n\nfor research projects strongly depends upon Federal pass-through funds.\n\n\nCourses\n\n\nNo advanced degrees are offered in remote sensing, but there are\n\n\nseveral cooperative programs in geography and range management. A\n\n\ncooperative program in forestry has not been formally implemented.\n\n\nThere is also a short-course program with 20 to 24 students per year.\n\n\nThere are remote sensing courses totaling 28 to 34 credit hours,\n\n\nwith a typical course having 4 credit hours. The number of students\n\n\nper year is estimated to be between 200 to 300.\n\n\n\nPROGRAM MANAGER\'S ASSESSMENT\n\n\nContact between the remote sensing study manager and the resource\n\n\nmanagement as formalized in a small number of individuals is essential\n\n\nand the program has emphasized these working relationships. This\n\n\nrelationship is particularly important in some studies which involve\n\n\n300-400 individual tasks.\n\n\nProjects meeting a time filter (6 to 18 months) imposed by the nature of\n\n\nthe grant are relatively difficult to acquire and are typically planning\n\n\nstudies. Resource management efforts typically require 3 to 5 years\n\n\nto achieve a steady pattern of actions which can be demonstrated from\n\n\nremote sensing inputs.\n\n\n\n42\n\n\n\nUNIVERSITY - Purdue\n\n\n\nPROGRAM MANAGER\n\nt\n\nDr. David A. Landgrebe, Laboratory for Applications of Remote\nSensing (LARS)\n\nTELEPHONE - 317-749-2052\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nOverview\n\n\n\nThe program was initiated in 1966 as part of a four--university group\n\n\nto initiate research in remote sensing. Purdue/LARS specialized\n\n\nwithin the group in the areas of agriculture and machine processing\n\n\nof data.\n\n\nSpecific Technologies and Unusual Capabilities center around the\n\n\ndevelopment of software (LARSYS) for an IBM 370-148 computer for pro\xc2\xad\n\ncessing of digital data and the development of terminals and terminal\n\n\nsoftware for displaying and manipulating the data. A capability of\n\n\nmaking detailed spectral measurements from ground sites has also been\n\n\ndeveloped for base line and ground truth work.\n\n\nDuration\n\n\nThe program was started in January 1966, with four or five people.\n\n\nWork under the NASA grant was started in 1971.\n\n\n\nLEVEL OF EFFORT\n\n\nNumber of People\n\n\nApproximately 40 faculty members from 15 departments at the University\n\n\nare involved. The program currently has 50 graduate students and\n\n\n60 undergraduates for a total of approximately 150 people in the\n\n\nprogram on a full- or part-time basis.\n\n\nOther Support\n\n\nThere is no large support from other institutions or agencies. The\n\n\nU.S. Soil Conservation Service has one person stationed with the\n\n\nprogram to assist in a soil mapping project.\n\n\nFunding\n\n\nThousands of Current Dollars\n\n\n1974\n1975\n1976\n1977\n\n\nNASA Grant\nOther NASA\nNon-NASA\n\n200\n\n200\n\n200\n\n200\n\n\n1200\n\n\n480\n\n\n\nTOTAL\n\n200\n\n200\n\n200\n\n1880\n\n\n\n43\n\n\n\nThe program has run at a total effort of about $2 million over the\n\n\npast several years. State funding in 1977 was $86,000 for research\n\n\nand $80,000 for administration.\n\n\n\nEFFECTIVENESS\n\n\nCapabilities and Users developed over the life of the program include\n\n\na strong local base in research in the technology of using remote\n\n\nsensing (e.g., the LARSYS program for processing data) and applying\n\n\nthese capabilities to the needs of other organizations such as the\n\n\nState Departments of National Resources and Agriculture. They also\n\n\nwork with foreign governments with 10 to 20 percent of the effort\n\n\nperformed in conjunction with the U.S. Agency for International\n\n\nDevelopment. Approximately one-third of the total program activity\n\n\nis for agencies other than NASA. There is also some private sector\n\n\ninvolvement with the St. Regis Paper Company which is performing an\n\n\nApplications Systems Verification and Transfer (ASVT) project in\n\n\nconjunction with LARS.\n\n\nCourses\n\n\nThe University offers approximately 15 three-credit-hour courses\n\n\nwhich are taken by approximately 300 students per year. Monthly\n\n\ncourses of one-week duration are offered to about 10 participants;\n\n\nabout one-third of the participants are from NASA or other Federal\n\n\nagencies.\n\n\n\nPROGRAM MANAGER\'S ASSESSMENT\n\n\nThe use of a step-funded grant as opposed to a one-time grant has\n\n\nprovided a measure of stability that is lacking in some of the other\n\n\nwork undertaken. The step-funding has permitted projects of a long\xc2\xad\n\nterm nature to be undertaken. The major problem with the grant is that\n\n\nthe program is limited to one state and this inhibits joint programs\n\n\nwith neighboring states.\n\n\n\n44\n\n\n\nUNIVERSITY - South Dakota State University\n\n\n\nPROGRAM MANAGER - Dr. Victor I. Myers, Remote Sensing Institute\n\n\n\nTELEPHONE - 605-688-4184\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nThe program concentrates on Earth resources remote sensing: agriculture\n\n\n(except forestry), geology, hydrology, and water resources. The program\n\n\nalso made the first energy conservation aircraft flight, in which heat\n\n\nor energy losses from residential and commercial buildings are detected\n\n\nand recorded. These records are then examined to provide planning\n\n\ninformation to attack the worst energy losses first.\n \n\nThe Earth resources applications are well-rounded, as is evidenced by\n\n\napplications such as the energy conservation flights. Other applications\n\n\nare typically addressed to more traditional uses of satellite and high\n\n\naltitude photography in areas such as soils assessments both for soil\n \n\nqualities and surface indications of subsurface water.\n\n\nOther than the initial adaption of the aircraft infrared sensor for\n\n\nthe energy conservation flights, no unusual or unique capabilities in\n\n\nremote sensing are used by the program.\n\n\nDuration\n\n\nThe institute was founded in 1969 and NASA grant work started in 1972.\n\n\n\nLEVEL OF iEFFORT\n\n\n/\n\nPeople atibniversity\n\n\n/\n\nApproximately 25 people are involved in the program.\nprofessionals and/or facility members use the program\nmajor/base for their research, and there are eight to\nThe program also supports three graduate students and\nundergraduates.\n\n\n\nTen to twelve\n\n\nas part of or a.\n\n\nten technicians.\n\n\neight to ten\n \n\n\nOther Support\n \n\nApproximately one person on a full-time equivalent from the U.S. State\n\n\nDepartment is involved in agricultural/Earth resources projects.

Among these adaptions was a survey of soil quality for a tax\n\n\nassessment survey. The tax assessments for agricultural land were\n\n\nadjusted on the basis of soil quality.\n\n\nThe program also has received support from the Federal government for\n\n\nits resources work for the USGS in surface indications of subsurface\n\n\nwater in the U.S. and in related work for foreign governments in\n\n\ndesertification problems. (Egypt and the Sudan via the U.N. Food and\n\n\nAgricultural Organizations.)\nThe program also has attracted a wide\n\n\ninterest with a soil moisture workshop.\n\n\nCourses\n\n\nThere is no structural remote sensing program and no degree is offered.\n\n\nSpecialization within departments of geography, civil engineering,\n\n\nelectrical engineering, agricultural engineering as well as plant\n\n\nscience and soils science is encouraged. Approximately 200 students\n\n\nper year take remote sensing courses. Approximately 8 to 14 people\n\n\nfrom industry and government per year receive training in remote sensing\n\n\ntechniques. The training periods range from 4 months to one year.\n \n\n\nPROGRAM MANAGER\'S ASSESSMENT\n\n\nThe Earth resources remote sensing group finds reasonable outside business\n\n\nin that most of its proposals are accepted. The major problems are not\n\n\nunique to this institution:\nthere is a lack of support at all government\n\n\nlevels for use of remote sensing as opposed to developments; the desire\n\n\nexists, but not the funding. When use funding is available, it tends to\n\n\ngo into easy tasks, which is regretable since many applications could get\n\n\nimmediate congressional attention and thus potentially higher funding.\n\n\nThere is also an institutional problem within NASA in that its programs\n\n\ntend to be oriented toward specific sensors or platforms rather than the\n\n\nspectrum of uses for instruments. Accordingly, user requirements are\n\n\nsacrificed to technical and fiscal constraints.\n\n\n\n46\n\n\n\nUNIVERSITY - Texas A&M\n\n\n\nPROGRAM MANAGER - Dr. B. J.

The Center concentrates on the development\n\n\nand utilization of remote sensing technology over a broad range of\n\n\napplications. The Center has been funded under the space applications\n\n\ngrant since 1971. Grant funds have primarily been used as seed money\n\n\nto conduct demonstration efforts in the disciplines of engineering,\n\n\nagriculture, oceanography, and geology. Research activities related\n\n\nto these disciplines include:\n\n\n*\n\nEngineering\n\n\n-\n\n"\n\nDevelopment of sensor technology\n\n\n\n-\n\nMapping of aquatic plants\n \n\n\nAgriculture\n\n\n-\n\nMonitoring plant diseases\n \n\n\n*\n\nDevelopment of soil moisture and plant monitoring systems\n\n\n(including soil water modeling capabilities)\n\n\nRangeland monitoring including biomass condition and brush\n \n\ncontrol\n\n\n\nOceanography\n\n\n-\n\n"\n\nCoastal zone studies\n\n\n-\n\n"\n\nStudies of wave height related to wind direction and speed\n\n\n\nEPA grant to develop indicies of pollution in coastal areas.\nThe research is related to timber clearcutting and the changing\nnutrition load as a function of tannic acid runoff.

A particular expertise\n\n\nof the Center is sensor development and microwave systems and measurement.\n\n\nAn X-band radar system has been developed, which can be mounted in a\n\n\ntruck. The Space Shuttle Imaging Radar (SIR) microwave sensor experiment\n\n\nfor Orbital Flight Two (OFT-2) has been developed by the Center. This\n\n\nwill be a Seasat-type\'L-band at wide angles using single polarization\n\n\n\n47\n\n\n\nfor geological applications (SIR-A). The Center is currently seeking\n\n\nfunding ($50 million) for SIR-B which would be a double polarized\n \n\nsystem in X- and L-bands. The like and cross images in each frequency\n\n\nwill relate to soil moisture and surface condition, primarily agri\xc2\xad\n\ncultural applications.\n\n\n\nLEVEL OF EFFORT\n\n\nUniversity Involvement\n \n\nThere are 11 professionals involved at the Center at the current time,\n\n\n5 full-time and 6 half-time. Additionally there are 8 undergraduates,\n\n\n7 masters, and 8 Ph.D. students as research assistants. The half-time\n\n\nprofessionals share joint appointments as professors in various\n\n\ndepartments. This approach is designed as an aid to the educational\n\n\nprocess which goes beyond developing remote sensing technology and\n\n\napplications. Additionally, a number of professors work with the\n\n\nCenter, but are noe supported by the Center.

These funds provide essential seed money\n\n\nto develop demonstration programs for applications of remote sensing to\n\n\nspecial disciplines. Over the course of the NASA grant, a number of\n\n\nprojects have been undertaken with state and local governments and in\n\n\nsome cases also involving private organizations. The results of these\n\n\nprojects have been well received. There are also other Federal agencies\n\n\nsuch as FPA currently funding research in remote sensing at the university.\n\n\nIn addition to developing new users of remote sensing, an objective of the\n\n\nprogram is to benefit the educational process, particularly at the graduate\n\n\nlevel.\n\n\n\n50\n\n\n\nUNIVERSITY - Utah\n\n\n\nPROGRAM MANAGER - Dr. Merrill K. Ridd, Department of Geography\n\n\n\nTELEPHONE - 801-581-8218\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nThe University of Utah began to receive grant funds under the University\n\n\nSpace Applications Program in 1976. Utah has been active in remote\n\n\nsensing since 1973. Currently there are three projects under NASA\n\n\ngrant funding. The first, the Price River study area, is a multi\xc2\xad\n\ndisciplinary project involving:\n\n\n1. \tVegetation and soil mapping with regard to land and resource\n\n\ncontrol\n\n\n2. \tRangeland productivity\n \n\n3. \tImpact of,development on wildlife resources\n\n\nproject is oriented toward decision-making on road closures, oil\n\n\nThe \t\nand gas leases, and watershed erosion control. Color and infrared\n\n\nphotography are used, and CCTs are utilized. The second project,\n\n\na study of the Wasatch foothills, is designed to influence regulations\n\n\nand ordinances surrounding land development. The project is supplying\n\n\nlocal government with maps of faulting, flooding, and instability\n\n\nareas. The third project is a Landsat study of snowpack runoff. This\n\n\nwill involve the state division of wildlife resources, state weather\n\n\nmodification operations (a $1 million per year cloud seeding operation),\n\n\nlocal water masters, and the Soil Conservation Service and River\n\n\nForecast Center.\n\n\nThe University of Utah has developed an expertise in computer software\n\n\ntechniques. Two current areas of research are signature extension\n\n\nbeyond the known ground truth region, and mosaicing classified land use\n\n\ndata into a quadrangle format (not a satellite format).\n\n\nOther remote sensing work by the University extends to the foreign\n\n\nsector. Utah has been performing a land use map of Korea for the\n\n\nRepublic of Korea, using Landsat CCTs. Utah performs modifications to\n\n\nthe CCTs, and a contractor, Seiscom Delta, produces the maps from the\n\n\nmodified CCT.\n\n\nAnother program at thd University of Utah has been the development of\n\n\na high-school level teaching program in remote sensing under NASA\n \n\neducational funds. The program, in six segments, can be taught as an\n\n\nentire course, or integrated into other courses. The segments include:\n\n\n1. \tIntroduction to Remote Sensing\n\n\n2. \tLand Formation and Geology\n\n\n\n51\n\n\n\n3.\n\nWater\n\n\n\n4.\n\nAgriculture\n\n\n\n5.\n\nUrban Areas\n\n\n\n6.\n\nTransportation\n\n\n\nLEVEL OF EFFORT\n\n\nUniversity Involvement\n\n\nThree faculty members are prime consultants on the remote sensing\n\n\nprogram and there are two additional part-time investigators.

If the application proves successful,\n\n\nthe state will adapt and eventually may fund the application. The state\n\n\nwould be unlikely to become involved on its own funds in a demonstration\n\n\neffort.\n\n\n\n53\n\n\n\nUNIVERSITY - Virginia Institute of Marine Science\n\n\n\nPROGRAM MANAGER - Dr. John Munday\n\n\n\nTELEPHONE - 804-642-2111 Ext. 254\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nThe institute is a graduate research facility of the State Universities\n\n\nof Virginia and formally part of the College of William and Mary. The\n\n\nareas of interest are estuarine and eastern shore inlets and their\n\n\necology and geology. Specific studies include circulation, shoreline\n\n\nerosion, sewage dispersal, dredging effects and wetlands protection\n\n\nand monitoring.\n\n\nBecause of a variety of problems, including the departure of the\n \n\ngrant manager and the delays in getting the grant effort directed\n\n\nin suitable channels, the grant is being phased out. Remaining\n\n\neffort under the grant is being directed toward assisting the state\n\n\ngovernment in establishing a state-wide information system. A bill\n\n\nto establish that system is in the legislature.\n\n\nTechnologies\n\n\nThe VIMS remote sensing program technology is directed primarily\n\n\ntoward sensing in very small areas, occasionally as small as one or\n\n\ntwo acres. For this type of work Hasselblad cameras in aircraft are\n\n\nemployed. Some use has been made of coarser resolution products\n\n\nfrom NASA programs, but in general they lack the resolution needed\n\n\nfor the scale at which their efforts are concentrated.\n\n\nUnique or Unusual Capabilities are concentrated in the area of small\n\n\nscale studies where they can respond rapidly to unusual phenomena in\n\n\nthe institute\'s aircraft. In circulation or other water studies,\n\n\nthey have made use of technology such as dye marking and buoys.\n\n\nProgram Duration\n\n\nVIMS started a program in remote sensing in 1969 with funding from NASA\n\n\nWallops Island and started on the grant program in 1972.\n \n\n\nLEVEL OF EFFORT\n\n\n\nPeople\n\n\nDirectly associated with the grant are two investigators, one graduate\n\n\nstudent, and a clerk typist.

Some minor funding has been received from the state for\n\n\nmapping ($10,000) the information system ($10,000) and approximately\n\n\n$15,000 from private sector users of remote sensing capabilities.\n\n\nCourses\n\n\nThe institute offers one course at the graduate level on Remote Sensing\n\n\nof the Environment with four or five students. Other information on\n\n\ncourses was not readily available.\n\n\nResearch Output of the remote sensing effort; 56 papers published since\n\n\n1969 has been the major strong point of the program.\n\n\n\n55\n\n\n\nPROGRAM MANAGER\'S ASSESSMENT\n\n\nThe state infrastructure and the NASA program have not meshed well in\n\n\nthe past. Part of the difficulty is attributed to the fact that Virginia\n\n\nhas traditionally been a low budget state and another part is attributed\n\n\nto grant management problems at VIMS. The current program manager went\n\n\nto Canada to pursue some research in water quality at about the time the\n\n\ngrant activity started. This effort was the later basis for the major\n\n\nuse the institute has been able to make of Landsat imagery, but when\n\n\nthe manager returned, the level of dissatisfaction with accomplishments\n \n\nunder the grant was not repairable.\n \n\n\n56\n\n\n\nUNIVERSITY - Wisconsin\n\n\n\nPROGRAM MANAGER - Dr. James L.

That portion of the program which deals with remote\n\n\nsensing of point sources of water pollution is relatively mature.\n\n\nRecent efforts have been directed toward sensing and measuring non\xc2\xad\n\npoint sources, e.g., agricultural runoff. The program also has a wide\n\n\nvariety of general remote sensing and interpretive programs; only\n\n\none-third of the overall program is directly concerned with remote\n\n\nsensing. Much of the remainder is directed toward other types of\n\n\nenvironmental studies.\n\n\nSpecific Technologies within remote sensing used involve multispectral\n\n\naerial scanning and thermal scanning using a themal scanner on a\n\n\nState Department of Natural Resources DC-3. The institute also uses\n \n\nLandsat imagery.\n\n\nUnusual Capabilities are limited to the thermal scanner on the DNR\n\n\naircraft, which is operated cooperatively.\n\n\nUnusual Circumstances at the inception of the program were limited\n\n\nto the passage of the Wisconsin law establishing the state EPA and\n\n\nproviding strict limits on point sources of pollution.\n\n\nDuration\n\n\nThe program was initiated in 1969 or 1970 with $10,000 of local money to\n\n\nsupply information and educational services to the University and\n\n\nstate on environmental problems.\n\n\n\nLEVEL OF EFFORT\n\n\n\nPeople\n\n\nThere are 12 faculty members involved on a part-time basis within\n\n\nthe overall program and 3 full-time post-doctoral fellows as well\n\n\nas a full-time secretary. There are also about 20 graduate students\n\n\nand 6 undergraduates with part-time support.\n\n\nOther Organizational Support is provided by the DNR at a level of about\n\n\n3 full-time equivalent employees.\n \n\n\n57\n\n\n\nFunding\n\n\nThousands of Current Dollars\n\n\n1974\n1975\n1976\n1977\n\n\nNASA Grant\nNon-NASA\nTOTAL\n\n160\n\n210\n\n192\n\n185\n\n\n1800\n\n\n\n160\n\n210\n\n192\n\n1985\n\n\n\nThe current total funding is about $2 million per year including\n\n\nthe NASA grant and various support in kind. An example of in kind\n\n\nsupport is about 50 hours per year of DC-3 time (for only the price of\n\n\ngasoline). The University also has purchased about 50 hours per\n\n\nyear of Cessna-180 time and flown cooperatively with the state on\n\n\nstate projects about 50 hours per year.\n \n\n\nEFFECTIVENESS\n\n\nCapabilities/Relationships developed over the course of the program\n\n\nare primarily the ability to serve the state government as a research\n\n\nand training center. The relationship with the state government and\n\n\nparticularly with the state\'s DNR and EPA is very strong and cooperative.\n\n\nOther Users include the state\'s Department of Transportation (highway\n\n\nstudy) as well as the Department of Agriculture for which they performed\n\n\na survey of spruce hardworm infestation. In conjunction with the DNR\n\n\nand the utilities they have also performed a thermal plume survey.\n\n\nCourses\n\n\nThe University offers both M.S. and Ph.D. programs in environmental\n\n\nmonitoring. Specific courses are offered in analytical photogrammetry\n \n\nand automated mapping. Specific course offerings total 30 credit hours,\n\n\nwhich are jointly supervised and/or funded by the departments and the\n\n\ninstitute.\n\n\n\nPROGRAM MANAGER\'S ASSESSMENT\n\n\nRemote sensing is a tool of decision through staff members in the\n \n\nUniversity and state government. They have provided a useful tool.\n\n\nTheir major porhlem is that the area of remote sensing is inherently\n\n\ninterdisciplinary and they live in a discipline-oriented institution\n\n\nwhere tenure problems can arise with young faculty members.\n\n\n\n58\n\n\n\nMAJOR OBSERVATIONS\n\n\n\nAt NASA\'s request, a set of summary Vugraphs was prepared to\n\n\nbe used by NASA in presenting the survey findings to management.\n\nThe\n\n\n\nVugraphs are presented in the following order:\n\n\n" \tSurvey Conclusions\n\n\n*\n\nUniversity Programs - Sources of Funding.1974-1977\n\n\n\n"\n\nUniversity Programs Funding - Percent by Source 1974-1977\n\n\n\n* \t1977 Grant, Other NASA, and Non-NASA Funding, by University\n\n\n* \tStudents and Courses in University Remote Sensing Programs\n\n\n* \tFaculty and Research Assistants in University Remote Sensing\n\n\nPrograms\n\n\n* \tUniversity Programs - Major Applications of Remote Sensing\n\n\n* \tUniversity Programs - Non-Federal Involvement.\n\n\n\nSURVEY CONCLUSIONS\n* ALL OF THE PROGRAMS SURVEYED HAVE ATTAINED SOME LEVEL OF STATE/LOCAL INVOLVEMENT,\nONE PROGRAM HAS WORKED ON PROJECTS WITH 39 STATE AGENCIES, MAINTAINS REGULAR\nCONTACT WITH 74 OTHERS, AND HAS 150 OTHER CONTACTS THAT CAN BE DRAWN UPON AS NEEDED.\nSUCH INVOLVEMENT DEPENDS ON SEED MONEY TO DEMONSTRATE APPLICATIONS BEFORE STATE/LOCAL\nAGENCIES WILL PROVIDE FUNDING,\nI\n\nNASA GRANT FUNDING HAS REDUCED THE TIME WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE BE EXPECTED FOR STATE/\nLOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO BECOME OPERATIONAL USERS OF REMOTE SENSING. NASA GRANTS ARE THE\nBASE WHICH ASSISTS AND SUPPORTS UNIVERSITY PROGRAMS TO DEMONSTRATE PROVEN APPLICATIONS\nTO FIRST TIME USERS. THE STATES WILL GENERALLY NOT SUPPORT DEVELOPMENTAL/DEMONSTRATION\nPROGRAMS,\n\n0 STATE GOVERNMENTS ARE BEGINNING TO USE REMOTE SENSING TECHNOLOGY AND CAPABILITIES IN\nOPERATIONAL AREAS. CAPABILITIES HAVE, IN GENERAL, NOT BEEN INSTITUTIONALIZED IN THE\nSENSE THAT MANY PROGRAMS WOULD NOT CONTINUE IF NASA SEED SUPPORT WERE WITHDRAWN,\n* ABOUT 9 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL FUNDING IN 1977 WAS FROM STATE & LOCAL SOURCES. ESTIMATES\nFOR PRIOR YEARS INDICATE THAT STATE FUNDING IS ACCELERATING AS REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS ARE BEGINNING TO BE APPLIED IN STATE & LOCAL PROGRAMS, IN MANY PROGRAMS,\nSIGNIFICANT NON-FINANCIAL SUPPORT IS CONTRIBUTED BY THE UNIVERSITY (FACULTY AND GRADUATE\nRESEARCH ASSISTANTS), AND BY STATE/LOCAL AGENCIES WORKING WITH THE UNIVERSITY,\n\nSURVEY CONCLUSIONS\n\n(CONTINUED)\n\n\n\n* \t TOTAL FUNDING FOR THE UNIVERSITY PROGRAMS SURVEYED HAS GROWN APPROXIMATELY 50 PERCENT\nSINCE 1974. A LARGE PART OF NON-NASA FUNDING COMES FROM FEDERAL SOURCES TO DEVELOP\nAPPLICATIONS WHICH ALSO INTEREST STATE, LOCAL AND PRIVATE USERS, NASA GRANT FUNDS\n\n\nHAVE BEEN AN IMPORTANT STIMULUS TO ATTRACTING NON-NASA FEDERAL FUNDS,\n* \t THE PROGRAMS ARE ADAPTIVE TO THE EXPRESSED INTERESTS OF STATE/LOCAL GOVERNMENTS,\n\nTHE\n\nDISTRIBUTION OF APPLICATION AREAS AND SPECIFIC EXPERTISE DEVELOPED REFLECTS STATE/LOCAL\nINTERESTS AND FUNDING PATFERNS, STATE/LOCAL PARTICIPATION IS DEPENDENT ON THE APPLICABILITY OF REMOTE SENSING TO NEAR TERM PROBLEMS,\n\n\n* \t\nUNIVERSITY PARTICIPATION IN REMOTE SENSING IS LARGE AND GROWING.
