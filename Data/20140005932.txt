Additive manufacturing, or\nthree-dimensional (3-D) printing, is a rapidly\nmaturing technology wherein components are\nbuilt by selectively adding feedstock material at\nlocations specified by a computer model. The\nmajority of these technologies use thermally\ndriven phase change mechanisms to convert\nthe feedstock into functioning material. As the\nmolten material cools and solidifies, the component is subjected to significant thermal gradients, generating significant internal stresses\nthroughout the part (Fig. 2).\nAs layers are added, inherent residual\nstresses cause warping and distortions that lead\nto geometrical differences between the final part\nand the original computer generated design.\nThis effect also limits geometries that can be fabricated using AM, such as thin-walled, high-aspect-ratio, and overhanging structures.\nDistortion may be minimized by intelligent toolpath planning or strategic placement of support\nstructures, but these approaches are not well understood and often \xe2\x80\x9cEdisonian\xe2\x80\x9d in nature.\nResidual stresses can also impact component performance during operation. For example, in a thermally cycled environment such as\na high-pressure turbine engine, residual\nstresses can cause components to distort unpredictably. Different thermal treatments on\nas-fabricated AM components have been used\nto minimize residual stress, but components\nstill retain a nonhomogeneous stress state\nand/or demonstrate a relaxation-derived geometric distortion.\n\nFig. 1 \xe2\x80\x94 (left) Spallation Neutron Source (SNS); (right) High Flux Isotope\nReactor (HFIR) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Tenn.\n\nFig. 2 \xe2\x80\x94 Thermal image of a layered additive\nmanufacturing process shows significant\ntemperature gradients near the deposition zone[1].\n\nIndustry, federal laboratory, and university\ncollaboration is needed to address these challenges and enable the U.S. to compete in the\nglobal market. Work is currently being conducted on AM technologies at the ORNL Manufacturing Demonstration Facility (MDF)\nsponsored by the DOE\xe2\x80\x99s Advanced Manufacturing Office. The MDF is focusing on R&D of both\nmetal and polymer AM pertaining to in-situ\nprocess monitoring and closed-loop controls; implementation of advanced materials in AM technologies; and demonstration, characterization,\nand optimization of next-generation technologies. ORNL is working directly with industry\npartners to leverage world-leading facilities in\nfields such as high performance computing, advanced materials characterization, and neutron\nsciences to solve fundamental challenges in advanced manufacturing. Specifically, MDF is\nleveraging two of the world\xe2\x80\x99s most advanced neutron facilities, the HFIR and SNS, to characterize\nadditive manufactured components.\nWhy neutrons?\nNeutron techniques might be less familiar\nthan x-ray methods to materials scientists and\nengineers, but are similar in many ways. For example, x-ray and neutron diffraction both use\nBragg\xe2\x80\x99s Law to describe scattering from single\ncrystals, powders, and polycrystalline solids.\nHowever, one important difference is that neutrons are much more penetrating than x-rays in\nmost materials. X-ray scattering occurs within\na few microns (with lab sources) to a few millimeters (using high-energy synchrotron radiation) of the surface, whereas neutrons often\npenetrate several centimeters. Therefore, neutrons serve as a nondestructive probe of the\nbulk microstructure in engineering solids. Another difference is that x-ray scattering inten-\n\nADVANCED MATERIALS & PROCESSES \xe2\x80\xa2 MARCH 2013\n\n23\n\nNeutron computed tomography\n(nCT) reconstructs a 3-D image of\nthe contrast due to attenuation of\nneutrons inside an object by transforming multiple 2-D radiographs of\nthe object as it is rotated around its\naxis.

A series of turbine\nblades were fabricated from Inconel 718 using DLMS technology. The blades have a wall thickness down to 1 mm\nand curved internal cooling passages (see Fig. 3). Three\nblades were analyzed at VULCAN together with a strainfree reference powder (Fig. 5).

The electron beam freeform fabrication process (EBF3) uses a high-power electron beam with\nwire feedstock to fabricate large structural aerospace components. These components often exceed a meter in length\nand require many kilograms of deposited material. The incremental nature of the additive process combined with\nthe large scale of EBF3 fabricated components results in\nhigh levels of distortion and/or residual stress. Understanding how these residual stresses evolve is critical in developing effective mitigation strategies.\nTwo applications of primary interest for the EBF3 platform are terrestrial-based manufacturing of aerospace\nstructures and remote, space-based fabrication of hardware. For the former, knowledge of residual stress accumulation helps develop fixturing, path planning, and\nintermediate heat treatment strategies minimize throughput time and out-of-tolerance distortion. For the latter,\nknowledge of the residual stresses helps predict final bulk\nproperties, as heat treatment may not be available for\nstructures fabricated extraterrestrially.\nNASA recently initiated neutron diffraction measurements on EBF3-deposited aluminum samples using the\nVulcan Engineering diffractometer at SNS. Initial measurements evaluated the impact of an intermediate thermal\nanneal treatment on residual stress. The stress relief heat\ntreatment shifted the residual stresses from the substrate\ninto the deposited material. This is important for the EBF3\nprocess where the substrate plate is usually incorporated\ninto the final part and often accounts for the bulk of out-ofplane distortion. These data were used to develop basic\nmodels using commercially available finite element modeling software. Additional trials at SNS scheduled for early\n2013 will help validate the early models and provide a predictive capability to minimize residual stress and distortion in large-scale additive structures.\n\nIncident slits\n\nIncident beam\n\nbeam path, it is not recorded because these neutrons are\nblocked by the receiving slits.

In general, residual strains in the\nas-built sample become more tensile (or less compressive)\nas the dovetail base is approached. At the base, residual\nstrains return to being more compressive.

The combination of\nneutron tomography and residual strain measurement is a\ncritical approach for examining complicated components\nthat can be built using additive manufacturing.\nHFIR residual stress mapping\nPreliminary experiments are underway at the HFIR\xe2\x80\x99s\nNRSF2 beamline (HB-2B, Fig. 7) to map stress distributions in complex parts produced by additive manufacturing. Whereas the VULCAN beamline allows for\nsimultaneous acquisition of strains from multiple crystallographic planes, HB-2B selects a single diffraction\npeak as the strain sensor. Peak data are recorded for a series of sample locations and orientations to produce a\nresidual stress map throughout the structure. Diffraction\npeak shifts are a measure of changes in atom-to-atom\nspacing, and may be related to tensile or compressive\nstrains in the sample. Peak intensity changes may indicate preferred orientation, or changes in sample composition, and peak width may be related to crystallite size,\ndislocation density, and other microstructural features.\nThe facility is being used to measure residual stress in\nsimple prismatic shapes fabricated using various AM\ntechniques to gain a fundamental understanding of\nprocess parameters on stress evolution. This information\nwill be used to verify process models and stress mitigation strategies currently under development.\nSummary\nThe use of neutrons to characterize additive manufactured components is a unique, valuable technique for\nimaging and measuring residual stress. Neutron and xray techniques can be used in a complementary fashion,\nproviding information about the bulk and surface of a\ncomponent, respectively. Neutrons are useful to characterize complex components, such as those fabricated\nusing additive manufacturing techniques.
