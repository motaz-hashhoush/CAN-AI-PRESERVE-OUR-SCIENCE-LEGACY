The SAM instrument suite, which houses over fifty percent of the science payload, is located on-board the Mars exploration rover. The mission objective of the Mars Science Laboratory Rover is to determine the past, present, and future habitability of Mars. It will serve as a robot geologist, traveling the Mars surface for a period of one Martian year (equivalent to two earth years). The microvalves were designed as a conduit to control the flow of Martian gas to the science instruments. If exposed to particle sizes greater than half a micron, both the science instruments and science equipment, including forty-seven microvalves, could experience performance degradation. As a result, filters were used at various gas inlets to protect flight hardware from particulate degradation. Additionally, the filters serve as the only interface between the Martian environment and the mechanisms within SAM. The MDS operates at 7 Torr (0.135 psi) with a gas flow rate of 0 to 20 m/s. Iron (III) Oxide was the only dust particle specimen used, although several others were initially considered (i.e. JSC-Mars-1, Corundum Powder (Al2O3), Hydrated Sulfate, and Belville (Basalt)). The overarching goal of the MDS is to demonstrate that the Mars exploration program is adequately designed and prepared for the Martian mission environment.", "title": "Martian Dust Simulator", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-24T17:43:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20090015878, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Zuray, Monica"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD, United States"}}, "id": "33d8a679cebe4e598773af66df301e54"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20090015878, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Houston, Karrie"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD, United States"}}, "id": "d31142364ff846988a2d65312fce1d1a"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 20090015878, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Lorentson, Chris"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD, United States"}}, "id": "b9f7c736d58f4351abccfc9b100a9c89"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2012-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20090015878, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20090015878, "id": "4e0f45b6a5394777bc1d4396fba66a36", "publicationName": "25th Space Simulation Conference.
