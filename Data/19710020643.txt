They occur in clusters o r a s isolated c r a t e r doublets. Results of\nprobability calculations and a Monte Carlo cratering simulation model show conclusively that many of the Mars c r a t e r s could not have resulted from rmdeom\nsingle body impact, However, clusters and doublets could be caused by meteoroid\nbreakup resulting from s t r e s s e s induced in the meteoroid by the gravitational\nfield of Mars. Caledations a r e provided that show the required r e l a t i o n s ~ p s\nbetween m a s s , entry angle, impact velocity, and tensile strength of the meteoroid,\nand the separation distance between the centers of the resulting c r a t e r s relative\nto c r a t e r sizes. It is concluded that under certain conditions, doublets should be\nproduced on M a r s as a direct result of breakup of an impacting meteoroid. The\nimpact process can yield nonrandom c r a t e r distributions that should be observed\nin different degrees of development on different planetary surfaces. Thus, distributions of large c r a t e r s on1 different planetary bodies cannot be compared\ndirectly for interpretations of the geologic history of one p l m e t a r y surface\nrelative to mother.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nExamination of Mariner 6 and 7 photographs has revealed a large number of\ncraters on Mars that are tangential o r nearly tangential to one another. The\nhypothesis that all craters were formed by random single-body impact was tested\nthrough examination of the results of a series of Monte Carlo computer simulations of random impact cratering and through an independent probabilitgi computation. Both the Monte Carlo simulation and the probability calculation show that I t i a\nprobable that most of the Mars doublets have not been produced by a random process.\nThe only endogenous mechanism for doublet crater production that seems\npossible is the formation of calderas. However, terrestrial calderas are not as\nlarge as most of the Mardim craters, and terrestrial volcano-tectonic depres-.\nsions, representative of the largest calderas, are rnarkedIy noncircu8ar. I the\nn\npast, it usually was assumed that impact of cosmic debris on any planetary body\nshould produce random crater patterns. However, recent studies of probable\nimpact craters on Earth contradict this assumption. The Cleamater Lakes\ncraters (Figure 1) in Canada, consist of one 32-km diameter crater which is\nalmost perfectly tmgential to a 22.5-km crater. Both craters a r e generally\naccepted as impact craters because basement rocks have features characteristic\nof those produced by high-pressure shock waves [ Dence, 19651. m e r e appears\nto be little doubt that two meteoroids impacted simultaneously to produce the\nClearwater Lakes craters. Only the mechanism leading to the presence of two\nseparate impacting bodies above the impact site at the same time is in question.\nSekiguchi [1970] has recently proposed a theory, which as cpualified and\nsupplemented i this study, accounts for the s p l i t t u of an impacting meteoroid\nn\n\nFig, I\n\na s i t approaches a planet o r satellite. He concludes that gravitational forces\nacting on an inqpacting meteoroid may cause internal s t r e s s e s that exceed the\nmeteoroid\'s tensile strength, causing i t to split into bodies of approarimatelg\nequal size. This type of calculation can be compared to the well-knsm calculation of the Roche limit, the critical altitude for which the difference in gravitational attraction between the planet and a very large body approaching the planet\ni s greater than the mutual attraction of the m a s s elements of the impacting body.\nThe Roche limit calculation assumes that the bodies a r e cohesionless. It is clear\nthat bodies pro&cing the Mars c r a t e r s , with diameters between m e t e r s and\nkilometers must have had a finite tensile strength.\nThe plausibility of tidal splitting and separation a s a means of Mars doublet\nformation will be examined in t e r m s of the required relationships between mass,\ntensile stren@h, entry velocity, and entry angle of the meteoroid, and the crater\nseparation distances and diameters.\n\nOBSERVATIONS\nMariner 6 and 7 photographs of cratered terrain in Meridiani Sinus, Deuealeonus\nRegio, and Hel1espont;us (Figure 2) were studied. Nonrandom effects were fir&\n\nFig. 2\n\nnoticed for four c r a t e r pairs, labeled 1 through 4 in Figure 3. The ordefing of\n\nFig. 3\n\nc r a t e r arrangement e d i b i t e d by these c r a t e r p a i r s was particularly striMng\nbecause each c r a t e r i s nearly perfectly tangential to, and of about the same\napparent age a s its neighbor, and c r a t e r s of a given doublet a r e nearly equal\nin size. It seems higMy unlikely that doublets with these characteristies could\n\nhave been formed by random impact of single bodies. Other isolated crater\npairs a r e labeled 5 through 8 in Figure 3; crater doublets occurring in groups\n\nI\nof more than two craters a r e shown in crater clusters labeled 9 through 13, \'f\na doublet is defined a s any two craters that overlap o r a r e separated by no more\nthan 12.5 km, i t can be shown that there a r e 461 crater doublets present i\nn\nphotographs 6N17, -19, -21, - 2 3 , and 7N25; this is a very large number when it\ni s considered that there a r e only 906 craters larger than 4 km in the area.\nphotographed.\nFigures 4a and b show the size distribution of these craters and the distribution of overlap o r separation for the 461 doublets. The ratio of the r;e&us of\nthe largest crater\n\nto the radius of the smallest c r a t e r ( h i , ) of each\n\nMartian doublet has been determined and the number of Martian doublets as a\nfmc~on\nof\n\n&,,/sin 4c.\nis shown in Figure -\n\nInspection d the Figure 4c and\n-.\n\nthe photographs suggests an ordering of crater size for members of doublets\nthat i s unlikely if all the craters were produced by bodies having equal probability\nof impacting a t any position on the surface of Mars. Members of doublets are\noften of similar size. The distribution of Figure 4c is later compared to similar\n&stributions resulting from the Monte Carla simulations.\n\nMONTE CARLO BMULATION MODEL OF MARTIAN CRATERING\nThe Monte Carlo model of Martian cratering involves the draMng, at random, of\ncraters from the crater size frequency ePistribution of Fighare 4a. Next, random eo.ordinates a r e selected for each of the craters d r a m from the distribution and these\na r e used do deternine whether a @ven crater is close enough to any olhher crater\n\nto form a doublet. h n d o r n numbers between 0 and 1 a r e produced by one of two\npseudorandom number generators of a class b o w n and described a s multipIicative\n\nFig. 4\n\ncongruent generators [Fassone, et al., 19681. That i s , the generators a r e defined\nby the recurrence relationships, - +1 = a m o d ( 2 3 1 ) where the parameter a is\nUi\ndefined a s Ei9 [Marsaglia, 19681 and (216 + 3) ( IBM 360 Scientific Subroutine\nPackage) for the respective generators.\nThe selection of a given crater diameter from the size frequency distribution\nof Martian c r a t e r s (Figure 4a) is accomplished by first drawing a unifoma random\nnumber - Then, inverse iPlLerpolation i s performed until the crater diameter D\nu.\n\nis obtained at which the cumulative d i s t ~ b u t i o n diameter lengths equal u.\nof\nCrater diameters given in Figure 4a a r e actually slightly larger than true values\nbecause the photographs show slightly oblique views of the surface. However,\nthe effect of overestimates of crater diameter is to produce maximum piassiMle\nnumbers of doublets in the cratering simulation. An independent calculation\nshows that this leads to overestimates of the number of doublets of l e s s than\n10 percent. S l e c t i o n of random x,y coor&nates f o r the crates is accomplished\nby generating two numbers between 0 and 1 and multiplying each by the square\nroot of the a r e a being cratered (1843.1 h . The roles of the two generators used\nf\nfor s e l e e ~ o n & m e t e r s and coor&nates a r e also reversed in the cratering\nof\nmodel for checks on randomness.\nThe next step in the Monte Garlo simulation is to determine whether a given\ncrater, drawn a t random, and assigned random coordinates, forms a doublet w i t h\nany of the previous craters. This occurs when any of the following i n q u d i t i e a\ni s satisfied:\n\nwhere\n\nxi is the radius of\n-\n\ncrater,\n\nt h e i t h c r a t e r drawn and -1 . is the radius of the r\njth\n-\n\nx; and -x- a r e the random x coordinates of the a h c r a t e r and - crater,\njth\n3-\n\nand -1 and - a r e the random - coordinates of the&h c r a t e r and the - crater;\ny.\nyj\ny\njth\nA is the overlap o r separation allowed for the particular c r a t e r pair in questioa,\n\nThis value is selected at random from the distribution of A for doublets observed\non Mars in the same way a s crater radius is selected, Each Monte Carlo cratering simulation involves - - - separate solutions of inequality (1)for each of the\nj\nP\nc r a t e r s - All doublets resulting from satisfactory solutions of these inequalities\nj.\nwere totaled and recorded by c r a t e r number, radius, and coordinates of each memb e r of the doublet. F o r all doublets, the maximum radius was divided by the minimum radius and doublets were grouped according to classes of\n\nBmax/Rmin.\n\nThe\n\nuse of all 906 c r a t e r s in the computation completes one simulation of Ma&ian\ncratering.\nSimulation of the 906 cratering events was repeated 150 times; the resultie~g\nvariation in nurnbers of doublets was as ewected if the M a ~ i a n\ncratering were\nrandom and accomplished 150 times. The statistical characteristics of this distribution and the number of doublets by\n\nRm,/Zmin\n\nclasses were computed,\n\nThey were then compared to the corresponding Martim data to determine whether\nthe cratering is nonrandom and to locate the classes of Malrtim doublets that con-tain most of the doublets produced by the nonrandom process,\n\nRESULTS O F MONTE CPkRLgb CRATERING MODEL\n\nThe results of the Monte Garlo simulation a r e shown in Figures 5g and\n\nh,\n\nFigure 5a shows the distribution of the number of doublets that resulted, The\n-\n\nFig, 5\n\n-8\n\n-\n\naverage number of doublets that occurred was 137 and two standard devisatiocs\nwere 2 6 2 . Thus, there is only 0.3 percent probability that the number of. doublets\nshould be l e s s than 1 1 o r g r e a t e r than 163 if c r a t e r s of doublets a r i s e only from\n1\nrandom single-body impact. The fact that 461 doublets a r e observed on the\nMartian surface suggests that most c r a t e r s a r e not produced by random singlebody impact.\nThe Monte Carlo result is further substantiated by a separate, anallytic\nderivation showing the expected number of doublets produced by random single\nbody impact a s 141, this quantity is derived as follows: a pair of c r a t e r s of\nradius gl, g2 whose centers are specified on some reference surface by the\ncartesian coordinates\n\n(3,\nXI),\n\n( z 2 , _Y2) f o r m a doublet if the relationship:\n\nis satisfied where LA denotes the allowable overlap o r separation of c r a t e r rims,\n\nThis relationship is schematically shown in Figure 6. The a r e a denoted by A@\nin the figure defines the region within which the center of c r a t e r 2 must lie in\n\no r d e r to form a doublet with c r a t e r 1 and is given by:\n\nIt is c l e a r that f o r given values of I,\n+\n\nG,and\n\nA , the probability of two rmdomly\n\ndistributed c r a t e r s forming a dohlblet is given by\n\nFig, 6\n\n-3where _Ar is given as 3.397 x 106 iim. From a probabilistic standpoint, ta-h\nc r a t e r radius is between 2.0 km and 125.25 km characteristic of the 906 craters\nused i n this study. On the average, however, two randomly chosen craters; are\nexpected to have radii equal to the mean radius, denoted here by - - of the 9%\nE(R),\nc r a t e r s . Similarly, A may assume any value between 0 km and 12.5 km charaeteristic of the 461 c r a t e r p a i r s whose ernpiric separation o r overlap i s less than\no r equal to 12.5 km. Thus, again on the average, it is expected that a r m d s m v\nchosen B is expected to have a value equal lo the mean A, denoted by LdM, of\n\nthe 461 c r a t e r pairs. Substituting _E(R) f o r g1 and\n\nx2 and\n\n.AM for A in equation\n\n(4) then gives :\n\nthe probability that a.n arbitrarily chosen pair of randomly distributed craters\nf o r m a doublet. Moreover, since t h e r e a r e\n\n4906) possible c r a t e r p a i r s , the ex-2\n\npected nwnber of doublets among 906 randomly distributed c r a t e r s is @wen by\n\n- "- Estimates of\n\nE(R)\n\nand AM, respectively, may be obtained from values of ;he\n\narithmetic mean radius of 10.25 km exhibited by the 906 c r a t e r s used in thas\nstudy and the mean A of 4 . 5 3 km exhibited by the 461 c r a t e r p a i r s .\n\nSub--\n\nstitution of these values for E(R) and A M into equations (6) and (7) jields\nE(D) = 140.8. This result agrees well with the mean number of doublets\n(137) produced by the 150 Monte Carlo simulations and i s evidence that\nmany of the observed 461 doublets have been produced by a nonrandom process,\nFigure 5 b shows the number of M a r s doublets and the average and stzendasd\ndeviations of the numbers of Monte Carlo doublets a s a function of ratio of largest\ndoublet member radius to smallest doublet member radius. The elistrih~utio~~\nof\nMartian doublet ratios differs most from the Monte Carlo distributions for\n\n~ m a x / ~ m iintervals nearest 1. Examination of doublets characterized by these\nn\nvalues of\n\nR,,/gmi,\n\nshould reveal the greatest number of douSlets whose\n\nindividual members w e r e produced by the nonrandom cratering process. Study\nof all doublets with these ratios show that many of the c r a t e r s of a given doublet\na r e of the s a m e fresluless, a result that is unlikely if the individual c r a t e r s were\nproduced by separate impact, Another unique characteristic of these c r a t e r s\n\n1s\n\nthat when overlap occurs one c r a t e r wall is seldom breached by the other, Instead,\nthe c r a t e r s s e e m to s h a r e a common wall, which appears many times to be str&ght\na s for c r a t e r doublets 1, 2 , 4, and 5,\n\nWhen\n\ngnn,/Rmin\n\ngiven value of\n\nvalues a r e large, the distribution of Martian ds&lets with a\n\nRmax/Rmin\n\nmay also &ffer f r o m that observed with the Monte Carlo\n\nsimulation. These Martj.an doublets a r e typically combined with other doublets such,\n\n- il f\nthat the large member is often common to many of the doublets. Because o the\ngreat difference in crater diameter for these doublets, and therefore a variation\nin weathering rates, it is impossible to judge the relative age of doublet members\nThe unique characteristic of this group of doublets is that they often have the\nsame common larger central member; that i s , satellite craters occur on the rim\nof a large central crater. An example is c r a t e r 13, which has many satellite\ncraters (Figure 2).\n\nORIGIN OF NONRANDOM DOUBLET CRATERS AND CRATER CLUSTERS\nMartian Calderas\nThe origin of \'large terrestrial and lunar c r a t e r s has usually been attributed\nto volcanic o r impact processes. Of the volcanic processes, often promsed as\nthe cause of nonrandom c r a t e r distributions, the only mechanism that seems\nlikely to produce craters even comparable in size to the Martian doublet craters\n\nis engulfment of roofs of large m a p a chambers. This can occur follodng eruption o r withdrawal of large quantities of magma.\n\nSuch esvption can be massive\n\nm d rapid from a central conduit a s i t was for Krakatoa, o r it can occur less\n\nrapidly from lateral fissures as in the Valles type caldera [Williams, 19681.\nCollapse of large crustal blocks can even occur coincident with lateral intmsion\n\nas exemplified by the Glencoe type caldera [Williams, 19681. However, craters\nresulting from such volcanic activity usually a r e not circular because they are\nproducts of collapse and thus reflect local rock i;nk.lomogeneities.\n\nOne prcspedy\n\nof calderas is that the r i m s a r e often scalloped due to collapse of lateral pockets\n\nf\nof m a p a . Other irregularities exist such as radial grabens. Neither s these\n\n-\n\n12\n\n-\n\nfeatures has been observed for the hllartian c r a t e r s . Furthermore, and most\nimportant, small calderas a r e not usually circular, and t e r r e s t r i a l calderas equal\nto the median size of the Mars c r a t e r s a r e usually volcano-tectonic depressions;\nmany do not even resemble Mars c r a t e r s , for their shapes a r e controllied by preexisting basement structures and they a r e often irregular oblong o r even rectangular depressions [Williams, 19681.\nFrom various circularity indexes of t e r r e s t r i a l impact c r a t e r s and cdderas\nand lunar c r a t e r s Murray [I9691 concluded that many lunar c r a t e r s a r e of impact\norigin. One circularity index used by Murray is the ratio of largest diameter t\no\nsmallest diameter measured through the c r a t e r center of gravity. This index\nwas obtained here for Mars c r a t e r s ; isolated c r a t e r s were measured a s well as\nseparated members of doublets and clusters. Overlapping c r a t e r s were not\nincluded because they would not be circular even if they were produced by the\nimpact process. Results of these measurements a r e shown in Figure 7. Data\nf r o m t e r r e s t r i a l calderas (closed circles) were taken from Murray [8969]; data\nfor Martian c r a t e r s a r e shown a s solid circles. Even with distortion present on\nMartian photographs, which results in overestirriates of the circularity index, the\nr n e m values for Martian c r a t e r s a r e considerably l e s s than those for terrestrial\ncalderas. The difference is greatest for large c r a t e r s because for t e r r e s t r i d\ncalderas departure from circularity increases with c r a t e r size. These results\nsuggest that the Martian doublets and c r a t e r clusters a r e not calderas--mless\n\nrock properties a r e much different on Mars than on Earth, which seems mlikeiy,\n\nFig. 7\n\nCrater Doublets Produced by Tidal Splitting of Meteoroids\nThe plausibility of tidal splitting and separation as a means of Mars doublet\nformation was examined in t e r m s of the meteoroid mass, tensile slreng%h, entry\nvelocity, and entry angle required to produce a crater doublet with crater d i m e t e r s Ill and\n\ng2.\n\nSekigucE [I9701 shows that tidal forces may split a large meteoroid into two\nfragments of approximately equal size. The fragmentation altitude\n\nk\n\ni n terms of\n\nthe meteoroid radius - and tensile strength - i s shown for impact on Mars in\na\nT\nFigure 8 and is given by:\n\nFig, 8\n\nwhere p = 3.95 gm/cc is the mean density of Mars and R o = 3393.4 Alarrr is the\nplanet radius; - is the meteoroid radius and - is the gravitational constant,\na\nf\nInspection of Figure 8 shows that if meteoroids have tensile strength characteristic of hand samples of silicate rocks\n\n(g\n\nlo8\n\ndynes/cm2) then most of the bodies of\n\nthe size r e q ~ r e d forming the Martian doublets 4< 20 km diameter) wi11 not be\nfor\nsplit by tidal forces. However, it is probable that large meteoroids a r e characterized by tensile strength much l e s s than PO* dynes/cm2. Even hand samples of\nsome meteoroids such as carbonaceous chondrites a r e very friable a d would\npossess tensile strength of less than about 107 dynes/cm2. However, the s t s e a e h\ns f large meteoroids should be si&ficmtly\n\nreduced from this value due to the\n\npresence of large defects o r cracks. These would certainly be present if\n\n- 14 meteoroids have resulted from breakup of a parent body caused by collision\n[Mason, 19701. Even i f the large meteoroids formed a s separate bodies, large\ncracks should be present. Differential thermal contraction of different rock forming\nminerals produces s t r e s s e s which commonly fractures new rock formation on\nearth.\nAccording to Griffith 119211, there is a basic relationship between compressive o r tensile strength and the length of cracks in any brittle material. The\ncraek length can be of atomic dimensions o r longer. The theory has been used\nto explain the observed reduction of material strength with increasing size for\nsamples small enough to be measured in the laboratory [Brace, 19611; it appears\nto be valid for large-scale applications as well. Brace has shown that\n\nat\n\nmodifica-\n\ntion of the Griffith theory is eqdvalent to the Coulomb ]law of failure, which i the\ns\nbasis of the Anderson theory of geologic faulting. According to Brace [1961],the\napplied tensile s t r e s s a t fracture can be calculated from:\n\nwhere - is Young\'s modulus (dyzes/cm2), - is specific surface e n e r m of the\nE\nS\nmaterial in ergs/cm2 m d - is the half c r a c k length of the Griffith crack in emary,\na\nF o r simplicity, we compute the dependence of tensile strength of rateks as a\n\nBrace I19611,\nfmction of the hmothetical crack length from equation (9). F o l l o ~ n g\nwe assume a value of 103 ergs/cm2 for - of most rocks and a value of 1012\nS\ndynes/cm 2 for Young\'s modulus. Figure 9 shows the calculated relationships\nthat result. Note that the calculated tensile strength f o r crack length equal to the\n\nFig. 9\n\ngrain size of most rocks (without large-scale cracks) is in basic agreemert with\ntypical observed values of - s 108 dynes/cm2 for hand samples. Meteoroids with\nT\nthis tensile strength of the size required to form doublets\n\n( 5 20\n\nkm) would r-aeYier\n\nbe split by the gravitational field of Mars. However, any cracks present of the\norder of 10 meters in length (1/100 o r l e s s the size of the body) can reduce the\ntensile strength of the meteoroid to 105 to 106 dynes/cm2. A meteoroid\n\n- P t L\ni\n2 1- 4 < r n -\n\ndiameter with this tensile strength will fail at high aItiLudes above Mars (Figure 81,\nThus, Sekiguchi\'s model f o r meteoroid breakup [q. predicts reascanable P.-alues\n(8)l\nof breakup altitude a s a function of meteoroid radius and tensile strenglh f o r\nmeteoroids impacting Mars-providing large cracks a r e present in meteoroids,\n\nIt may be that i f cracks a r e large enough, - approaches O and the dutitPlde of breakT\nup would be more accurately approximated by the Roche limit.

S ~ e t l speakmng a two body system should have been\ny\ndeveloped for the fission model. This model would field Mgher b r e h p alakdee and\ngreater n m b e r s of doublets than that reported here.\nCertain conditions of impact velocity and impact angle a r e required for separation of the fission products and formation of c r a t e r s of the eorreet diameters for\np r o b c t i s n of nearly tangential craters. From the equations of motion of the fiasiasn\np r o h e t s , Sek$r~eE\nshows that the distance of separation of the impact points, Ax,\non the planebry surface is given by:\n\nA 5 = A 2 cosli (ytJ tan\n\ns\n\nwhere :\n\n8 = impact angle from Mars surface normal\n\nM\n- = 6.455 x\n\ngm\n\n= mass of Mars\n\nR\n-\n\n= 3,393.4 km = radius of Mars\n\nF\n-\n\n= 6.664 x\n\ndyne cm2 gm-2 = gravitational eonstant\n\nA - = parent impacting body radius\nz\n\nt\n-=\n\ntime of flight (sec) from breakup to impact\n\nThis equation is not the same a s that given by Sekiguchi but i t is correct,\nSekiguchi\'s eq. 5.3 results from a typographical e r r o r in the solution for the\ndifferential equation of motion of the fission products.

There is evidence that the energy of formation of cr&tering\nis given by the product of the cosine of the impact angle measured from the sur-\n\nface normal and the projectile kinetic energy [Moore, 19711; we modify equation\n(12) to take account of impact angle and equate energy of formation to the product\nof cosine of impact angle and projectile kinetic energy to yield meteoroid mass M:\nM\n~ ~ 6\n- = 11.18 x 108 D ~ * - cos ~ ) / ( v ~\n\n(\'B 9)\n\nwhere - is impact velocity and 8 is impact angle from the Mars surface n o r ~ n d ,\nV\nThis expression and the assumption of spheroidal shape and p of meteo:roid\n\n=\n.\n\n3 -4\n\ngm/cc for the parent body em be used to yield a relationship between pared body\nradius\n\n- and do&let c r a t e r d i m e t e r s\n\n4 2\n\n1\n\nand\n\ng2 that would be produced from\n\nthe fission products of breakup of a parent body of radius B z :\n-\n\nSuE3stitution for A - in equation (10) yields Ax, the separation distance of centers\nz\n\nof the craters in terms of\n\nDl,Q2,\n\nx,8 , M\n-9\n\nR and flight time\n-\n\n3\n\nAx =\n\n4.32 x\n\nl o 2 (-\n\nD\n\n1/3\n~ + g2 Q ~ cosh~(y3\n~ 3.045)\n~\n\nv2/3 cos1/3 8 cot 8\n\nFinally, division of both sides of this equation by (Dl\n-\n\n+D2)/2, the average crater\n\nd i m e t e r , yields a separation ratio - the ratio of distance between c r a t e s centers\ny,\nto average c r a t e r diameter:\n\nAx\n\nY =\n\nCol\n\n+\n\n-\n\n8.64 x\n\n%)/2 -\n\nl o 2 (_Dl3.045 + 2\nv2j3\n6 cot\n- cos\n\n3a045)1/3 cosh ( y 2\nP\n\n6 (Dl\n-\n\n+ _D2)\n\n($6)\n\nEquation (16) can be used to determine the relationship between impact angle\nof the parent body and ratio of separation between c r a t e r centers to average crater\ndiameter for c r a t e r s produced a t the same impact velocity from the fission products of breakup a t a given altitude. This is accomplished by f i r s t measuring Dl\nand - of c r a t e r s forming a given doublet.

Examination of this figure shows that doublet formation (y E 1)\n-\n\nFig, 10\n\n-\n\n15 -\n\noccurs primarily for high entry angles, 0. Similar solutions have also been cbblai.r;,ned\nfor doublets with smaller average diameters and for different assumed ratios of\ndefect length to meteoroid diameter. The fact that doublet formation is restricted\nto bodies impacting at high angles to the surface normal seems at first consider-ation incompatible with the observation that of the total of 906 c r a t e r s there are\n461 doublets. However, many doublets occur in the same crater cluster and could\nhave resulted from breakup of a single body. To more accurately approximate the\nnumber of impacting bodies that could have been broken up, doublets and clusters\nhave been counted a s single breakup events. If isolated craters a r e also counted\na s single impact events, we find that as small a fraction a s 3/10 of the impacting\nbodies could have broken before impact. This result is in better agreement with\nthe theoretical results of Figure 1 0 , but it is still higher than expected, Some of\nthe doublets o r clusters counted a s single events could have been produced by a\nnumber of separate impacts. Also, the theoretical model does not consider the\neffect of s t r e s s energy stored in the meteoroid o r meteoroid rotation. Bath effects\nwould yield greater separation between fission products and more doeiblets. Thus\nthe observed n m b e r of doublets and clusters seems to be in fair agreenlent with\nthe theoretical predictions of the fission model.\nEstimates of the possible aerodynaanic lifting forces were made and included\nin the calculation of tidal separation. In obtaining an estimate of the mmimum\nseparation due to aerodynamic lift, we ignore drag forces m d make the simplifying assumptions that the velocity\n\nand trajectory angle 0 a s measured lo the\n\nnormal a r e constant. According to Berman 119611, the lifting force normal to the\ntrajectory is:\n\nwhere p is the atmospheric density, - d is the lift coefficient, and - is the\nC\nS\nfrontal cross section of the body. Then, we make the approximation\n\n-=\nh\n\nh0 -\n\neos 8 - o r - = -dh/v cos 0, where\nt\ndt\n--\n\nflight time, and\n\n&\n\naltitude, - is the\nt\n\ndenotes the altitude at - = 0. Moreover, approxima~ting\nt\nthe\n\nrelationship between p and\n\nwhere p = 9.86 x\n\n6\n- denotes the\n\nh\n\n[Berman, 19611 by\n\nand p o = 1.33 x\n\ngm/cc [Levin et al., 19681, and\n\nperforming a double integration, we obtain the displacement on the surface for a\nbody a s\n\nM\nS\n+\nwhere - = meteoroid mass, - = meteoroid c r o s s seedion, and h = altitude of\n\nbreakup, W e then estimate the m a x i m m separation between two ~neteoroids\nas\n2%.\n\nSeparation due to tidal splittirmg and aerodynamic lift is s h o w as a solid line\n\nfor each veloeiw i F i g w e 10. Aerodybamic lift has little effect on separation due\nn\nto the tenuous Martian atmosphere,\n\nDISCUSSION\nIt is highly prob&le that a nonrmdom cratering effect has contributed to the\nproduction of the cratered terr&nz on the planet Mars. It is conceivable that some\n\n- 2%. of the isolated nonrandomly produced doublets could have been produced by\nsimultaneous impact of gravitationally coupled asteroids. T a m e r 119631 has\nshown that such coupled bodies could remain stable as they impact the Earth,\nSince it has been shown in this study that meteoroids approaching Mars could\nproduce the observed doublets, if meteoroids a r e large enough, meteoroid fission\ndue to s t r e s s e s induced by the gravitational field of Mars is favored a t this time\nfor the nonrandom production of doublets o r c r a t e r clusters.\n\nI the Mars doublets have been produced by simultaneous impact of meteoroids,\nf\nit is reasonable to expect the development of unusual features due to close proximity of formation of one c r a t e r relative to the other. Doublet c r a t e r s have been\nproduced in sand targets in the laboratory both by separate and simultmeous\nimpact of two halves of a cylinder that has been partially severed before launch,\nComplete severing and separation of the cylinder halves occurs as a result of\n\ns p i d n g induced by rifling in the gun b a r r e l , F o r doublets produced by simultaneous impact, both pieces of the cylinder a r e allowed to impact. F o r do&le&s,\nproduced by separate impact, one-half of the cylinder is captured and one crater\n\nis produced. Then, on the next firing the other half is caught and the other doublet\nmember is produced. Degree of overlap is specified by the ratio of the separation\nbetween c r a t e r centers to diameter sf either member c r a t e r @/ID). F i p s e 11\nshows six doublets produced experimentally; three were fosrned a t the s p e c i f i d values\n\nof spe by simuldaneous impact of hdf cylinders and three were fsrmedbg separak impact.\nAll doublets were produced a t about the same impact velocity of 2-3 I;m/sec.\n\nOne\n\ninteresthg result is that the c r a t e r w d l of one member of a doublet is breached\n\nBy the other member only for those doublets whose members ]have been formed\ns\n\nPig, 11\n\n- 22 separately, This is illustrated by the doublets formed simultaneously and\nseparately a t nearly equal values of - - = 0.81 and 0.72, respectively. The last\nS/D\nc r a t e r to form the doublet produced by separate impact partially destroyed m d\ndistorted the r i m of the f i r s t c r a t e r . However, the c r a t e r r i m s of members of\nthe doublet produced by simultaneous impact a r e equally developed. Another\ninteresting feature of doublets produced by simultaneous impact (S/D = 0-81)\n-is\nthat the common c r a t e r wall is straight and very high. A continuation of this wall\nprojects onto the target surface s o that t h e r e is a ridge perpendicular to the\nbilateral axis of symmetry of the doublet. Observations of growing c r a t e r s sliaows\nthat this is the product of focusing of the ejecta and extreme target deformation,\nF o r the doublet where the members a r e widely separated\n\n(g/D =\n\n1.3), the ridge\n\noccurs a s a delicate subdued structure exactly midway between the separated\nmembers. Although exact modeling of the v e r y large M a r s doublets is not as sumed o r expected, the observations of resulting structures applied to M a r s\nc r a t e r s may support the theory of impact origin. Most isolated Mars doublets\na r e characterized by c r a t e r s that a r e equally developed, and the common wallis\ns f m a y doublets a r e straight and raised, a s i n doublets 4 and 5 in Figure 2, This\nmay be of special significance because r i m s of isolated c r a t e r s usually are not\nwell developed on M a r s , s u g g e s t h g strong erosive processes. Focused sees~~dairy\nc r a t e r fields and ridges a r e present perpen&cular to the bilateral axis of symmetry\nof the d o d l e t s produced in the I a o r a t o r y , but these have not been observed for\nMars doublets, However, foeused secondary c r a t e r fields and ridges may have\nbeen subdued by erosion, It may be possible to observe remnants of such ridges\nand focused ejecta fields on higher resolution photographs that will soon be available,\n\n- 23 The results of this study a r e of considerable importance to currejilt and r e cent interpretaiions of the geologic history of Mars and the Moon based on. o b ~ a r vation of Mars cratering density compared to that of the Moon. It has been\nassumed [Murray, 19711 that Mars craters a r e the results of random single-hady\nimpact, contrary to the results presented here. On the basis of this assuy$ion\nand the observed smaller ratio of large Martian c r a t e r s to small c r a t e r s on Mars\n\nas compared to the Moon, Murray concludes that the smaller bodies impacting the\nMoon could be from a different population than those impacting Mars and that the\npaucity of large fresh c r a t e r s could be the result of an unusually efficient erosive\nprocess. Both hypotheses may not be true. The observations might be explahed\nby the fact that fission of meteoroids appears to be common for impact on Mars,\nand this effect would certainly be less pronounced for impact on the Moon because\nof its smaller gravitational field, Thus, the observed deficiency of large fresh\nMars c r a t e r s compared to the Moon could be easily explained by the fact that\nmore large bodies may be broken up to produce small c r a t e r s on Mars than are\nbroken up for impact on the Moon. Tnterpretations based on crater frequency\nalone a r e only valid when the craier distributions a r e random and when impact\nmechanisms a r e the same.\n\nIf the occurrence of nonrmdom crater doublets on the surfee of Mars is explainable by the fission model, a new and unexpected aspect of the m e e h a ~ i c s\nof\nplmetary impact c r a t e r b g has been revealed by the Mariner photographs,\nMeteoroids larger than some limiting diameter, dependent on the amplitude of\nthe gravitational field of the planet m d meteoroid tensile strength, might be\nbroken up before impact. Thus, conditions on one plmet may be more favorable\nto dolPrslet and c r a t e r cluster development than on other planets. Other factors such\n\n- /* a s the role of aerodynamic effects may also influence the number of doublets\nproduced.\nThere a r e at least three possible t e r r e s t r i a l doublets that may have been\nproduced by splitting due to s t r e s s e s induced in impacting meteoroids by the\ngravitational field of the Earth. The Clearwater Lakes c r a t e r s have already been\ndescribed. The Wieskessel and the Steinheim Basin may be members of another\nd o ~ l i e that a r e more widely separated than the members of the Clearwater La1 2s\nt\ncraters. The Odessa and Meteor c r a t e r s may constitute another widely separated\npair,\nFinally, we can tentatively suggest that the puzzling concentration of large\nm a r e impact basins on the Earth-facing side of the Moon, a pronomeed largescale example of a nonrandom effect, might in fact be the product of breakup of\ncontain defects largc\na large impacting body. Such a large body would c e r t ~ d y\nenough to reduce the tensile strength to a point where the body is essentially\ncohesionless. In that case, breakup would occur near the Woche limit (2.44 times\nthe Moon\'s radius), AlternatP~ely,the body may have passed d o s e enough to tile\nEarth to have been ruptured by the earth\'s gravitational field. The products of\n\nbreakup might well be a cluster of large impact basins with slight age differences\nthat appear greater due do the domination in growth of one basin over others\n\nREFERENCES\n\nI.\n\nBaldwin, R.
