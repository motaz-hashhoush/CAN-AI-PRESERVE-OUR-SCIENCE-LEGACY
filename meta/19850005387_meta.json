The current logistics in accessing the AVGR, some of the past and ongoing experimental programs and their relevance, and the future role of this facility in planetary studies are reviewed. Publications resulting from experiments with the gun (1979 to 1984) are listed as well as the researchers and subjects studied.", "title": "NASA-Ames vertical gun", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T13:31:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19850005387, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Schultz, P.
