For more detail on the project - or to ubmit technology olution\n- vi it the project web ite at www.\nrti.org/ technology/wh eelchairs.\nBattery Monitoring Technologies\nPower wheelchair users need accurate knowledge of a battery\' state of\ncharge. An ideal battery monitor mu t\nbe compatible with wet or gel electrolyte, lead-acid battery technology,\nand provide an accurate, in tantaneous\nmeasure of residual power - similar to\na fuel gauge. It hould track battery\ndegradation rate; tran late battery\npower into a percentage of capacity,\ntime, or distance remaining; and provide replacement alerts. The monitor\nmust compile the charge/discharge/\n\nrecharge hi tory to develop an energy\nconsumption profile for the u er while\nnot interfering with wheelchair controller function.\nTransmission Technologies\nPower wheelchair use direct and indirect transfer drivetrain composed of\ngears, belts, chain, and other mechanical elements that reduce motor peed\nwhile proportionally increa ing motor\ntorque.\nAn ideal transmission hould deliver\nhigh torque under high load, and provide safe, reliable steering and acceleration through coordinated transmi sion\ngear shifting for both wheel.

The\nubject\' body volume equals the volume\nof di placed water. Although generally\naccurate, thi technique requires complete submersion of the person and maximal expul ion of air from h i lungs.\nSuch submersion may be impossible\nbecau e of the patient\'s condition. Thi\nteam propo e a oft- ided bag equipped\nwith an air injector, a pressure transducer, and a recording device. The subject is\nplaced in the bag, and it is sealed and\npre oozed using the air injector to an\ninitial pre sure level. One end of the bag\nis compre ed by rolling it up, and the\npres ure in ide is determined at that\nposition. The bag is further compressed\nto a econd po ition and the pressure\nagain determined. As the bag is compressed, the volume inside reduces, and\nthe pressure, which increases, is indicative of the total volume in the tiag.\n\nDetector for Particle Surface\nContamination\n(u.s.

It\' al 0 used to lubricate hard\ndrives and magnetic disks.\nThi revolutionary product is Pennzane- X2000 synthesized hydrocarbon\nfluid developed by Pennzoil-Quaker\nState, Houston, TX. Last year, the company introduced Pennzoil- ynthetic, a\nnew line of full synthetic motor oil\nformulated with Pennzane. The fluid is\nthe result of Pennzoil\'s decade-long investment in the research, development,\nand te ting of synthetic lubricants\nthat meet the extreme conditions\nfound in pace.\n\nY\n\nThe Road to Outer Space\nIn the mid-1980s, scientists and engineers at Pennzoil\'s Woodlands Technology Center began basic research on\na sophisticated family of synthetic\nlubricants. "I was interested in making\nnew ynthetic fluids, and the manufacturing division needed to upgrade a byproduct stream," explained Dr. Clifford Venier, one of the developers of\nPennzane. "The stream contained significant quantities of cyclopentadiene,\na very unusual chemical. It\'s a hydrocarbon, yet it\'s a weak acid, so it easily\nundergoes condensation reactions to\nmake bigger molecules."\n\nScientists take fairly mall, ordinary\nmolecule and string them together to\nmake bigger molecules, according to\nVenier. "That\'s how the main commercial synthetic fluids the polyalphaolefins - are made. So it looked\nlike a good place to start. We got\nstarted looking at orne reactions that\nput 0 th e r h yd roca rbo n groups on\nthe cyclope ntadiene, " said Venier.\n20\n\n"It\' a very small molecule, with only five carbon, and quite volatile.\nWe put up to ix groups\non it to make it heavier\nand less volatile. We\nmade a whole series of\nthese, called mu ltiplyalkylated cyclopentanes,\nor MACs, that can be\nused for any kind of lubrication application. ~\nOne of those MACs became X2000.\nPenn zane was conceived, developed, and\nproduced in only two\nyears. But even after\nsmall batches were produced, the developers Venier and fellow scientist Dr. Edward Casserly weren\'t sure of its commercial potential. That\nis, until Pennzoil participated in a conference in\n1985 in which members\nof the aerospace community identified a need for\na lubricant that would be Dr. Clifford Venier (right) and Dr. Edward Casserly. co-invenstable under extreme tors of Pennzane X2000 synthesized hydrocarbon f luid.\ntemperatures and provide excellent lubricating qualitie .\nhave to go in and run the reactions and\nThe aerospace experts needed a lupurify it," Venier explained.

"In the catathat, we could get the properties and\nlogue of things we\'d done," said Vedetermine if it will be useful."\nAs far as Pennzane was concerned, Pennzoil could "make\nit once and have enough for a\nlong time," said Venier. "One of\nthe advantages Penn zane had for\ninitial commercialization is that\nit\'s a very high value product. The\nmaterial sells for about 1,000 per\nkilogram or 450 per pound. Part of\nthe reason for that is the small volume required. You don \'t have to build\na plant to proces it. You can start out\nnier, "there was this one that looked\nsmall.

Leviton: Optical encoder measure mechanical position\nand report it to a computer as a number. For example, a rotary encoder\nmounted on a large telescope\'s support\nbearings tells you the telescope\'s pointing angle. In a milling machine or a\nlathe, linear encoders mounted on the\nmachine\'s slides tell you the position of\nthe cutting tool with respect to the part\nbeing machined. Some encoders are\nincrementaJ , which means that if you\ntum the power off and tum it back on ,\nthe encoder gets lost because its reference is 10 t. With an absolute encoder,\nyou can turn power off and back on,\nand when the encoder wakes up, it still\nknows exactly where it is.

Instead\nof reading out individual bits, my abolute encoder takes digital picture of\na different kind of pattern and interpret them through oftware to get po-\n\nwww.nasatecb .com\n\nsition with much higher resolution.\nThe pattern resembles coarsely paced\npickets in a fence . Each picket has a little bar code that uniquely identifie it.\nThe camera ees two or three pickets\nat a time . Since only one position is\nbeing measured, each one of tho e\npickets gives the same answer. This\nmeans that a pretty vast area on the\ncale can be damaged and the encoder\nstill works fine .\nNTB: What was NASA\'s first application for the new encoder?\nLeviton: The very first application\nwas in 1998 for a system we built to calibrate flight prisms for the HST Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS).\nThat system was essentially a vacuum\nUV version of the classical, prism refractometer for measuring refractive\nindex of transmissive optical materials.\nWe needed a cheap rotary encoder in\nvacuum with sub-arcsecond accuracy in\na hurry, 0 we engineered a special version of the new encoder in just a few\nweeks for less than $1,000. Meanwhile,\nwe ended up enhancing the world \'s\ndatabase of far UV optical material\nproperties with data of unprecedented\naccuracy and spectral coverage. The\nmaterials we measured are crucial to\nother NASA UV science missions and\nare being used increasingly in optical\ndesigns of wafer teppers for advanced\nsemiconductor production.\nNTB: What are some potential commercial applications for your invention?\nLeviton: Any mechanism requiring\nab olute encoders more sensitive and\ncompact than existing encoders can\ntake advantage of this new technology.\nOne example would be linear positioning platforms for microlithography\nsteppers.

The\ndifference signal is either multiplied by, or detected synchronously with respect to, the sum signal.\n\nThi is the first of four articles that\naddress various issues concerning the\ngeneration and utilization of electronic\nsignals in the operation of micromachined planar vibratory microgyroscopes\nand other sen ory devices that include\nelectrostatically actuated, capacitively\nsensed mechanical resonators. The ubject of this article is that part of the overall electronic circuitry of a planar vibratory gyroscope that generates a signal\nproportional to the rate of rotation.\nSome background information is prerequisite to a de cription of this circuitry\nand to the descriptions of the circuits\ndescribed in the following three articles.\nVarious aspects of micromachined planar vibratory microgyroscope have been\ndescribed in a number of previous articles in NASA Tech Briefs. The basic principle of operation is as follows: Four planar\nsilicon plate are connected together by\nsilicon springs in a symmetrical pattern\nre embling a clover leaf. The silicon\nsprings lie at the center of the pattern.\nWhen in equilibrium (not vibrating), all\nplates lie in the same plane.\nTogether, the plates and springs con titute a mechanical resonator characterized by t:\\Vo orthogonal degenerate modes\nof vibration. Two of the plates are driven\n\nelectrostatically to generate oscillations in\none of these modes, denoted the driven\nmode. The 0 cillatory di placements or\nvelocities of all four plates are measured\nby use of capacitive sen ors.\nOne eeks to measure rotation about\nthe axis perpendicular to the equilibrium plane of the resonator plates. The\nCoriolis force associated with this rotation couples energy from the driven\nmode to the other mode, denoted the\nensing mode, in which there i a difference between the velocities of the two\nplates that are not driven electrostatically (the sensing plates). This difference\nbetween velocities gives rise to a corresponding difference between the outputs of the capacitive sensors for the\nsensing plate. The difference signal,\ncalled the "Coriolis signal," is proportional to (1) the amplitude of oscillation\nof the driven plates; (2) the rate of rotation, .a; and (3) the resonance quality\nfactor, Q, which is inversely proportional\nto the rate of damping of vibration.\nThe circuitry in que tion i de igned to\ngenerate a signal proportional to the\nCoriolis ignal and thus to Q . This circuitry is part of the overall circuit hown in the\nfigure. As explained in more detail in the\nfollowing article, the inputs to the trans-\n\nconductance amplifiers are the raw velocity signals from the sensing-plate capacitors. Thus, the difference between the outputs of the two tran conductance amplifiers contains the desired information.\nBecause of common-mode rejection,\nthe sum of transconductance-amplifier\noutputs, which is proportional to the driven-mode velocity signal, contains no\ninformation on Q. If the magnitude of\noscillation is held con tant as de cribed in\nthe following article, then the sum ignal\nhas a constant magnitude. In any event,\nthe sum signal is used as a reference for\nphase-sensitive detection of the difference signal. In one version of this circuitry, the difference ~ignal is multiplied by a\n90 o -phase-shifted replica of the sum signal. In another version, the difference signal is synchronously detected, u ing the\nphase-shifted sum signal as the timing reference. In either version, the time-averaged output signal is proportional to QQ.\nThis work was done by Christopher Stell,\nVatche Vorperian, Roman Gutierrez, and\nTony Tang of Caltech for NASA\'s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

The gain of the VCA is continually adjusted to regulate the magnitude of the capacitively sensed mechanical oscillations.\n\nthe resonator vibrates, the voltage across\nthe sensing capacitor thus remains constant, although its capacitance varies at a\nrate proportional to the vibrational\nvelocity. By the fundamental relationship among capacitance, voltage, and\ncharge, a current proportional to the\nvibrational velocity must therefore flow\nbetween the sensing plate and the "-"\ninput of the transconductance amplifier.\nAs a result, the transconductance amplifier puts out a voltage proportional to\nthe vibrational velocity.\nThe output of the transconductance\namplifier is fed to the signal-input term i-\n\nnal of the voltage-controlled amplifier\n(VCA) and to the input terminal of the\nfull-wave peak detector. The integrating\namplifier produces an error signal that is\nthe integral of the difference between\n(1) the peak-detector output (which is\nproportional to the magnitude of the\nvibrational velocity) and (2) the reference voltage, which represents a desired\nmagnitude of vibration. The error signal\nis fed to the control-input terminal of\nthe VCA. The output of the VCA is proportional to the velocity and is fed back\nto the fixed drive plate.

Unfortunately, the\npreparation of single cry tals of Tb-Dy alloys is difficult and\nco tly, and will likely remain so.

Since polycrystal are much simpler to prepare\nand are less costly, textured polycrystalline materials are being\ndeveloped as alternative to single cry tals, as discus ed in\n"Polycrystalline Tb/ Dy Alloy for Magnetostrictive Actuators"\n(NPO-20273), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 23, 0.8, (August 1999),\npage 44. Continued efforts to reduce tile cost of magnetostrictive polycrystals have led to the use of lower-cost commercial\ngrade (total purity 99.7 percent) Tb-Dy material [as opposed to\nexpensive high-purity (99.94 percent) material required for\nthe growth of single crystals].\nIn general, a material containing many individual crystals\nwith random orientation will not have a large bulk magnetostriction. Crystallographic texture describes the average orientation of the individual crystallites in the material. It i possible to achieve a preferred texture by various materials-proce ing method, but one of the simplest is deformation processing. The Tb-Dy alloy was arc-melted and drop-cast into a\nchilled copper mold. Since the as-cast ingot shows strong crystallographic texture, the material wa first cold rolled to a 35percent reduction in thickness and heat treated for].5 h at 950\n\xc2\xb0C to induce recrystallization. This step was intended to provide a random initial orientation of spherical grains, although\nour bulk thermal expansion measurements indicate that significant texture remained after this step. The pecimen was\nthen plane-rolled by 55 percent and annealed at 350 D to\nC\nrelieve train. This rolling and annealing combination was performed once or repeated a number of time . It can be seen in\nthe figure that the commercial pecimen exhibits 2,400 ppm\nmagneto triction , while the high-purity pecimen exhibits only\n1,750 ppm magnetostriction.

At\ntl1e heart of the assembly operation is Canada\'s Mobile\nSenicing System (MSS), a complex manipulator that includes\nrobot "arms\xc2\xb7 that can pick up and manipulate everything from\ndelicate objects to large payloads. Being built and tested at the\nCanadian Space Agency (CSA) facilities in Saint-Hubert,\nQuebec, the MSS will be used to unload equipment from the\nspace shuttle, move heavy o~ects, help assemble the space station, and then maintain it afterwards.\nThe MSS includes a main ann (the Space tation Remote\nManipulator System, or SSRMS). a smaller manipulator with two\narms (the Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator, or SPDM),\nand the Mobile Remote Sen~cer Base System (MRSBS). The\nSSRMS is a 15-meter long, seven degrees-of-freedom manipulator with flexible joints and booms. The smaller arm has two 3.5meter long ann that allow very fine motion for deHcate tasks.\nEach ann has seven acmators, and the entire assembly has 22\nligid degrees of freedom and more than 30 flexible ones.\nAt the end of each of the SPDM an11S is an Orbital Tool\nChange-Out Mechanism, which include a gripper, a camera and\ntwo Hghts, a socket drive mechanism, and a force moment sensor. In a typical task, the SSRMS will move the SPDM to a location where maintenance needs to be perfonned. One arm of the\nSPDM will grasp a stabilization point, creating a closed kinematic loop. The other ann will delicately remove and replace a part\non the space tation - a !.ask involving contact dynamics.\nTe ting such a task could be a nightmare, but the CSA has had\na great deal of experience with manipulators ever ince it built a\nrobot ann for the first space shuttle. "Over the past 20 years, CSA\nhas de\\\'eloped modeling and simulation tools for off-Hne and\nreal-time simulation of space manipulators," said Dr.Jean-Claude\nPiedboeuf, manager of robotics at the CSA. For the MSS,\nPiedboeuf\'s group has to verify that every operation will work.\n"The actual hardware is so Hght that it cannot support its own\nweight here on Earth. So we have to simulate and emulate everything in software," Piedboeuf explained.\nTo verify contact dynamics actious, CSA is building tl1e SPDM\nTask Verification Facility that uses an earth-bound robot modified to perform similar dynamic behavior to the SPDM. The simulation is performed using the dynamic engine of a real-time\n1\\Iobile ervicing system Operation and Training Simulator\n(MOTS). The simulator\'s design is based on CSA\' SYMOFROS\nsoftware for flexibJe dynamic modeling. Used in conjunction\n26\n\nThe SSRMS during its development at Spar Aerospace in\nBrampton. Ontario.

It is based on Maple for symbolic model generation, and MATLAB and Simulink for real-time imulation.\nFirst, every mechanism in tlle manipulator must be defined as\nan object, \\vith information describing all tI1e forces associated\nwitl1 the object\'S motion or tasks. This includes rotation and position matrices, center of mass, inertia, external torque and forces\nacting on it, gyroscopic effects, beam deformations, internal\ndamping, motor torque, and elastic torque.\neXl, an operator must construct a graphical model, using a\nMATLAB-Simulink program to describe the robot system\'s\ntopology. The operator drags and drops object blocks from a\nlibrary, links them togetl1er, and then downloads the result to\nthe Maple engine.\nThe dynamics equations are built followingJourdain\'s principle, which is a variational method in which constraint forces are\neliminated. The Maple part of SYMOFROS obtains kinematics\nand dynamic recursively and models the flexible beams using\nEuler-Bernoulli approximations. By consistently eliminating\nhigh order term, it generates equations of motion that are exact\nto the first order.\nWhen the Maple software completes its symbolic linearization\nof the model and generates tile C functions that will be needed\nfor simulation and control, it then optimizes the C code. The\ngenerated code can now be compiled and loaded into MATLAB\nand Simulink systems for execution.\nMeasUJing the benefits of the software is very difficult, mainly\nbecause tI1e !.ask could not have been done any other way.\nFortunatel \', now that the SYMOFROS system is running, the\nR&D department of CSA can use it for a wide variety of tests.\nThe SR..\\1S was deHvered to J ASA last year and is now being\ntested at Kennedy Space Center\' Space Station Processing\nFacility in Florida_\nFor More Information on Waterloo M ap le Circle No. 744\nFor More Information on The MathWorks Circle No. 745\n\nwww.nasatcch.com\n\nI\n\nASA Tech Briefs,June 2000\n\nTha(s right: we\'ve take portable data acquisition to a\nwhole nevv level.

This program enables the efficient analysis of composite\nstructures subjected to complex thermomechanical load historie. MAC/ GMC\nwon second place in tile 1997 NASA Software of the Year competition and has\nbeen applied in industrial, government,\nand academic setting to such diverse\ncomposite-material structures as turbine\nparts, tires, and even brain tissues.\nThe predictive capability of MAC/\nGMC rests on the mathematical model\nknown as the generalized method of\ncells (GMC) - a continuum-based\nmodel of micromechanics that provide\nclosed-form expression for the macroscopic re pon e of a composite material\nin term of the properties, sizes, shape ,\nand re ponses of the individual contituents or phases that make up the material. The visco plastic and fatigue-life\ncharacteristic of the constituents or\nphases, are in tum, represented by advanced, physics-based mathematical ubmodels.\n38\n\nThe GMC also incorporates expressions that relate stress and strain fields\nwithin individual constituents to macroscopically applied stresses and strains via\nstress-concentration factor. These expressions make possible the investigation of failure processes at tile microscopic level at each step of applied-load\nhistory. The GMC also affords a capability for studying the influence of the\nstrengths of bonds of fiber/ matrix interfaces; this is an important capability because the strengths of these bonds\nstrongly influence the progression of\ndamage.\nMAC/ GMC enhance the basic capabilitie of the GMC by providing a modular software framework wherein one\ncan take advantage of any or all of tile\nfollowing options:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Various tIlermal, mechanical (stress or\nstrain), and thermomechanical load\nhistories can be impo ed.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Different integration algoritllms can\nbe elected.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Any of a variety of constitutive submodel for constituent materials can\nbe elected from a library of such models or implemented via a subroutine\ndefined by the user.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Any of a variety of fiber architectures\n(unidirectional, laminate, and woven)\ncan be selected from a library of reprewww.nasatech.com\n\nsentative volume elements or be defined by user.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 A postproce sing ubprogram for\ngraphical display of microscopic and\nmacroscopic field quantities is available (MACPOST).\nThe most outstanding feature of\nMAC/ GMC is its ability to accurately\nmodel composites with laminated and\nwoven fiber architectures at minimal\ncost and with minimal input by me user.\nMAC/ GMC can be executed in conjunction with standard linear and nonlinear\nfinite-element analysis programs for\ncost-effective design and analysis of large\nstructure , including fully time-dependent deformation behavior of constituents. It is also possible to model\nporosity, damage, interfacial regions\naround inclusions, and deterioration of\ninterfaces. Multiaxial states of stress or\nstrain can be applied and predicted accurately, regardles of the orientations of\nfibers.\nOne advantage of the use of constitutive ubmodels i m.at any type of\nsimple or combined loading (e.g.,\nmultiaxial stress) can be applied, irrespective of ymmetry or asymmetry,\nand without resorting to different\nboundary-condition application strategies .

The availability of the vapor\ncorrosion cell is also expected to encourage the testing and development\nof alloy that will prove resistant to corrosion. Moreover, by detecting corrosives at an early tage, the vapor corrosion cell can help to reduce costs, save\ntime, and increa e afety margin . This\ndevice is expected to be vital not only\nin the space program but aloin the\nmilitary, in activities and institutions\nthat focus on the environment, in the\naviation industry, and in any other indu tries, institutions, and activities in\nwhich there are risks that chemical\nproce ses will produce corrosive byproducts. Initial testing has shown that the\nvapor corrosion cell is highly sensitive to\ncorrosives and that the cell can be reversed and rejuvenated to enable multiple measurements. Hence, the vapor\ncorrosion cell is a significant step toward redressing the imbalance caused\nby the release of corrosives into the atmosphere through chemical processes.\nIn an atmosphere filled with chemically reactive gases and water vapor,\nsuch as are present at liftoff on a launch\npad, the vapor corrosion cell is the only\ndevice capable of gauging the atmospheric corrosion potential. The cell\n(see figure) contains strips of alternating, dis imilar, electrically conductive\nmaterials - elemental metals or alloys\n- separated by thin strips of an electrically nonconductive material. 10 the\nexample of the figure, the dissimilar\nelectrically conductive materials are\naluminum and titanium.

By controlling all but one\nof these parameters, one can operate\nthe vapor corrosion cell in such a manner as to use it to measure the remaining parameters.\nAll the strips of each of the two electrically conductive materials are electrically connected in parallel.

Mu ltiple nailboard were created for large jobs.\nOnce built, harnesses were tested for\ncrosstalk between power and data lines,\nand then rebuilt if problems occurred.\nT h i cycle often went on for several\nrenditions of a single harness. If nail-\n\nI\n\nboard were not used, as -in the case of\ncustom or emi-custom orders, a more\ncomplex wiringjob often turned into a\n"bucket of worms," according to one\nengineer.

EMbassy wiring harness software, from Linius Technologie ,\nwas prototyped in 1998. Through a concerted effort to increase the functionality\nof the software to meet the changing\nneeds of the wiring-harne engineer,\nLinius has produced several revisions to\nEMbassy in less than two years.\nAccording to one engineer working\non an aero pace sy tern, "Additional features in Version 2.5 have allowed us to\n\nEMbassy is being used to develop the wiring system in space vehicles.

Using EMbassy, it is easy to\ndouble-check bend radii, signal eparation, and redundancy separation. As cable\nsize increa es, bends and turn in the harness can create stress and strain on the\nwiring in ide the harne s as well as at the\ncable connector. Because EMbassy uses\n3D model, wire location inside the cable\nis considered when wire-length reports\n\nare printed. "Coming up with a\nhoner than needed wire can be\nquite a time<on uming situation. Furthermore, wire\nthat are cut too long are\nwasteful of material.\nBoth these ituation\nare alleviated with the\nuse of EMbassy,"\nsaid an engineer in\nan interview.\nAt ilfisk-Advance, a\nmanufacturer of floor maintenance equipment for commercial and indu trial application , EMbassy has removed a timecon uming tep in the de ign of vacuum\ncleaners, scrubber, and sweeper.\nAccording to Wayne Lorenz, an electrical\nengineer, "We no longer need to create a\nphysical model of the machine we\'re\ndesigning." Engineers at Nilfisk-Advance\nused to make a nonworking model of their\nlatest design and then take measurements\nfor the cable design.\now we bring in a\nProl E model and layout the harne in the\n3D model itself. We can actually see where\nthe cable will go without the need for tile\nphysical model." In this way, harnesses can\nbe created as the job is being designed.\nChanges can be made quickly as well.\nLorenz says that he will typically design\nup to four harnesses for each piece of\n\nequipment Some of the harne\ncarry\nup to 100 wire. When asked what pecificall made his job easier, he re ponded,\n"What I reall like about EMbassy i that it\nautomatically figures out the wire lengths\nand create a complete bill of material. I\nno longer have to manuall add up this\nbill.

EMbassy automatically\nchecks company-specific design rules,\nensures proper shielding between power\nand data wires, and generates accurate\ndocumentation for manufacturing.\nFmally, size and weight of every component inside a tem has become an important issue design engineers must address.\nFor aero pace systems alone, weight directly affects launch costs, which can be in\nthe tens-of-thousands of dollars range.\nToday\'s market requires that most equipment be tightly packed inside an enclosure.

The new encoders\nrely on a combination of high-accuracy\nmicrolithography, optical projection,\ncharge-coupled-device (CCD) array\nimage detection , and image processing.\nCompared to conventional absolute\nencoders, the new encoders allow practically unlimited travel at exceptionally\nhigh resolution and are far less susceptible to scale damage or contamination.\nFigure 1 is a block diagram of this type\nof encoder for measuring either linear\nposition along an axis perpendicular to\nthe page or rotary motion about a vertical axis in the page. The encoder\nincludes a scale (as described below)\nthat encodes linear or angular position\nand is attached to an object of interest\nwhich moves with respect to the remaining ftxed parts of the encoder. The position encoding pattern on the scale comprises transparent marks on an opaque\nbackground such as clear areas in\nopaque chrome on a glass scale or a perforated metal tape. A printed pattern of\nlight marks on a dark background could\nalso be used in reflection.\nA light source illuminates the scale\nfrom underneath in the figure, and a lens\nprojects an image of the moving scale\nonto a CCD array in the camera head.\nThe output of the CCD is processed\nthough an analog-to-digital converter\n(ADC); the resulting digital image data\nare stored in an image memory. An\nimage-data processing computer ("image\nprocessor" for short) analyzes the image\ndata using pattern recognition algorithms, utilizing the known positions of\nthe pixels in the image, to determine the\nabsolute linear or rotary position of the\nscale pattern in the reference frame of\nthe stationary parts of the encoder.\nThe upper part of Figure 2 shows an\nexample of part of the pattern on a linear encoder scale (the pattern on a\nrotary scale is similar but fanned). In\nthis case, the scale is for measuring position along a horizontal axis in the page.\nThe pattern includes ftducials, smaller\nmarks denoting code bits, and hodzontal pattern registration marks. Together,\na fiducial and its associated code bits\nand registration mark form a code\ngroup. The pattern of successive ftducials is strictly periodic in the direction\nof motion.

A Typical Scale Pattern contains subpatterns of several different kinds of marks. The marks\nprovide information that the image processor uses to compute the absolute position of the scale to\nhigh resolution.\nwlvw.nasatech.com\n\nElectronics Tech Briefs,june 2000\n\nuniquely identify each fiducial. The bit\npattern could be chosen to represent any\nconvenient binary code; in this example,\nthree rows of four bits each define a 12position grid, so that each code group\nidentifies one of 212 or 4,096 fiducials.\nThe image processor utilizes the information in the image of the scale to\ndetermine the position of the scale\nalong the axis of motion. For this purpose, one of the axes of the CCD array\nis aligned along the axis of motion so\nthat the pixel pattern can readily be\nused as a reference frame. In effect, the\nbinary codes themselves provide lowresolution, absolute position information by identifying which fiducial(s) is\n(are) imaged on the CCD at any particular time. The absolute position is\ndetermined to high resolution by finding the horizontal position of the\nimage of each fiducial in the pixel\ncoordinate frame. This could be done\nby any of such well-known image processing techniques as edge detection,\npeak detection, differentiation, or centroiding. However, because optically\nthe centroid of each fiducial image\nmoves linearly across the CCD with\nscale motion, the preferred technique\nis centroiding; that is, computing the\none-dimensional centroid of the fiducial along the axis of motion in the\npixel coordinate system.\nFor a given encoder geometry and\nCCD configuration, there is a scale pattern that is optimum in the sense that it\nyields the most reliable outcome with\nthe highest sensitivity and accuracy with\nrespect to true position. The use of a\nlarger, more sophisticated CCD array\nenables the simultaneous acquisition of\nimages of several code groups. Posi tion\ndata become more accurate if independent position determinations can be\nmade for multiple code groups. It i\ndesirable to select the scale pattern,\noptical magnification, and detector\ngeometry to provide the image of al\nleast two and ometimes three (depending on position) code groups on the\nCCD array. If more than one code group\nis in view at all times and if there are any\nvariations in magnification, then those\nvarIation can easily be corrected\nbecause the true spacing of groups on\nthe scale i known and the answer for\neach group must match as there is only\none po ition being measured.\nThe arbitrary, multi-bit coding\nscheme make it simple to extend the\nrange of linear motion without acrificing resolution. In a representative example, 12 code bits for fiducial bars spaced\nby 100 11m would make it possible to\nencode motion over a range of 409 mm\nwith a sensitivity of 10 nm. A IS-bit patElectronics Tech Briefs,June 2000\n\ntern would, in principle, eXlend this\nrange to nearly 3.3 m at the same resolution. A rotary version of the encoder\nwith a I 25-mm-diameter code disk using\n12 code bits has a sensitivity of about\n0.02 arcsecond. These parameters indicate both a sensitivity and a range considerably greater than prior encoders,\neven though the scale pattern is very\nmuch coarser. The coarser pattern can\nbe manufactured at less cost with higher\nyield and makes the encoder less sensitive to damage of the scale . The fact that\nthe encoder can produce a correct\nanswer based on an image of a single\n\nfiducial also makes the encoder less sensitive to damage of the scale.\nThis wum was done by D()Ugias B.

Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio\nCarbon nanotubes (al 0 known as\n"bucky tubes") have shown promise for use\nas anode materials in rechargeable lithium-ion power cells. In comparison with\ngraphite and other forms of carbon used\nunder identical condition, bucky tubes\nexhibit greater specific discharge capacity\nand greater specific energy; this increase\nhas been attributed to the greater electronegativity ofbud.. tubes and the conseJ\'\nquent ability of bucky tube to accommodate more lithium ion per unit of carbon.\nThe success achieved thus far in the development of bucky-tube anode with high\nreversible (charge/ discharge) lithium-ion\ncapacities is a re ult of advance in (1) the\nproduction of single- and multi-walled\nbucJ<y tubes by both arc and non-arc techniques, (2) techniques for purification, (3)\ntechniques for opening the ends of the\ntubes to admit lithium ions for intercalation, and (4) techniques for fabricating\nelectrodes from bucky tubes.\nA recent experimental investigation\nundertaken as part of this development\nemphasized the electrochemical perfor-\n\nmances of open-ended single- and multiwall bucky-tube anodes in half-cell tests. (In\npractical full cells, bucJ<y tubes as anode\nmaterials would be used .in cOrYunction\n,\nwith LiNi02 LiMn02, or LiCo02 as cathode materials.) In the tests, anodes made\nfrom open-ended ingle-wall bucky tubes\nexhibited specific discharge capacities as\nhigh as 640 rnAh/ g, and anodes made\nfrom open-ended multi-wall bucky tubes\nexhibited discharge capacities of about 385\nmAh/ g. In contrast, the theoretical limit of\ncapacity of graphite is only 372 rnAh/ g.\nThis work was done IYy R O. Loutfy, S.\nHossain, and M.

Resonant Crackwire Circuits would be bonded to the surfaces of turbine blades. In this example, the\ncrackwire circuits on all the blades would resonate at the same frequency, so that each one would be expected to respond with a pulse when it passed by a transmitting/receiving antenna operating at that frequency.\nIf the circuit on a passing blade were not to respond, a crack alarm for that blade would be triggered.\n\nwww.nasalech.com\n\nElectronics Tech Briefs,June 2000\n\nConductor (e.g., PdlCr Alloy)\n\n./---1-.\nDielectric (e.g.,\nluminum Oxide)\n\nBASIC STRIP LINE CONDUCTOR\n\nSTRfPLINE ANTENNA PATCH\nFigure 2.

The use\nof wireless resonant crack-wires could also reduce the costs of\nin pecring engines for fatigue cracks: Often, cracking occurs in\nengine parts that are accessible only through disassembly of\nengines. In many cases, the costs of disassembly and reassembly\nfar exceed the costs of inspection, and the disassembly and\nreassembly processes can cause new damage.\nThe term "wireless resonant crackwire" is not oxymoronic, though it may appear so at flfSl. "Wireless\xc2\xbb as used here\nrepresents the absence of wire connections with external\nequipment and the use of radio signals to interrogate the\ncrackwires.\nThe principle of operation of wireless resonant crackwires\nwould be an extension of that of radio-frequency (RF) security tags attached to merchandise in some department stores.\nThese tags contain circuits that re onate at frequencies in the\nvicinity of 9 MHz. pon leaving a tore, a customer must pass\nby a large loop antenna thal emits a ignal swept in frequency\nover a range that include the resonance frequencies of the\nsecurity tags. If a security tag has not been deactivated, then it\nresponds to the incident RF ignal by ringing and reradiating\nat its resonance frequency. A second antenna picks up the\nreradiated ignal, and the antenna output triggers an alarm.\nTo enable the cu tomer to carry the merchandise out of the\nstore without triggering the alarm, a clerk deactivates the tag.\nDeactivation is accomplished at the store checkout counter by\nplacing the tag on a mall antenna that expose the tag to an\noverload-level replica of the exit signal in order to burn out a\nfusible link in the tag circuit. The removal of the link either\nmakes the circuit nonre onant or el e moves the resonance to\na frequency outside the range of the security equipment.\nRe onant crack-wires would be bonded to the urfaces of\nsuch critical jet-engine components as turbine blades (see\nFigure 1). Like department-store ecurity tag, resonant crackwires would include links designed to be broken to alter RF resonance . However, these links would not be broken by overload signals; instead, they would be broken by the developElectronics Tech Briefs,June 2000\n\nment of cracks and/or plastic deformation in the engine components to which they were bonded. Thus, if a resonant crackwire monitored by use of a suitable transmitter, antennas, and\nreceiver were to stop re onating at its "insta1led~ resonance frequency, a crack alarm would be triggered.\nOf course, because of the unique characteristics of the jetengine environment (especiaUy high temperature and the\nmetallic nature of the components to be monitored), the\ndesign and fabrication of resonant crackwire would differ\nmarkedly from those of department-store RF security tags.\nResonant crackwire circuits would likely be fabricated by use of\ntechniques developed previously for strain gauges for monitoring engine parts at high temperature ; this would involve\nthe deposition, on the engine parts to be monitored, of thin\noxide films as dielectrics and patterned thin films of high-temperature alloys as inductors, electrodes for capacitors, and\nantennas. The resonance frequencies of these circuits would\nrange upward from several hundred megahertz and possibly\ninto the gigahertz re\'gion. In many cases that would involve\nmonitoring of metal components it may prove necessary to\nresort to stripline circuit designs, utilizing the underlying monitored components as the ground planes of suipline antennas\nand resonators (see Figure 2).\nThis work was done by Bruce McKee, Scott Dahl, and Kathy\nShkarl\xc2\xa3t of Innovative Dynamics, Inc., for Glenn Research Center.\nFor further information, access the Technical Support Package (TSP)\nfree on-line at www.nasatech.com under the Electronic Components\nand Systems category.\nInquiries concerning rights for the commercial use of this invention\nshould be addressed to NASA Glenn Resea1"C1i Center, Commercial\nTechnology Offue, Attn: Steve Fedar; Mail Stop 4-8, 2 I 000 Brookpark\nRoad, Cleveland, Ohio 44135.

The method involves,\nmore pecifically, utilization of selected\nfeatures of the 1394 bus architecture and\nof the stack tree-topology ( ee Figure 1),\nwhich is a pecial case of the general tree\ntopology and which complies with the\n1394 standard. Of particular significance\nin the method is a specific type of stack\ntree denoted as Complete tack Tree\n(CST) of n stem nodes.\nTaken by itself, the stack-tree topology\nis not fault tolerant: failure of any link partitions a stack tree into two segments,\nwhile failure of a stem node can partition\nthe tree into two or three segments, depending on the specific design. Moreover,\nthe 1394 standard does not permit loops,\nwhich would be formed if, for example,\none were to connect the leaf nodes of a\n\n6\n\n5\n\n8\n\n9\n\nEQUIVALENT REPRESENTATIONS OF CST R FOR\n\nn = 16\n\n1.0\n0.9\n0.8\n\n~\n\n:0\n.!!l\n\na;\n\n0.7\n\na:\n~\n0\n\n0.6\n\nz\n\n0.5\n\n~\nQ)\nIII\n:J\n\nIn\n\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n10-9\n\n10-\n\n10-8\n\n7\n\n10-6\n\nNode Failure Rate\n\nCALCULATED BUS NETWORK RELIABILITIES FOR n = 16\nFigure 2.

Stack Trees are constructed from\nthree-port nodes. A leaf node is one that is connected to one other node denoted a stem node.\nEach stem node is connected to at most three\nother nodes, of which no more than two are\nstem nodes. A complete stack tree (CST) is one\nin which each stem node is connected to at least\none leaf node.\n\n64\n\nCST with spare links. However, the 1394\nstandard provides a "port disable" feature,\nwhich can be utilized to make any pare\nlinks "invisible" to the rest of the network.\nIn the initial configuration of the network, the ports connected to the spare\nlinks are disabled, thereby disabling the\nspare links and preventing the formation\nof loop . In the event of failure of one or\nmore nodes or a link of the initial network\nconfiguration, messages can be rerouted\naround the failed parts by enabling the\nappropriate ports to activate the appropriate spare links.\nThe upper part of Figure 2 schematically depicts a complete tack tree without\nspare links [denoted a "simplex complete\nstack tree" (CSTs)) and a complete stack\ntree with a pare link constructed to obtain a configuration called "CSTR" (where\n"R" refers to the fuet that the resulting network topology is ringlike).
