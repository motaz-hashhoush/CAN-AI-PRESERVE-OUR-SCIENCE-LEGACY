Subsequently, the thesis research was successfully completed and Gordon Erlebacher joined t\'1e Computational\nMethods Branch at NASA Langley Research Center. The alternating\ndirection code was also established on the NASA Langley computer\nsystem and is available for use there.\nThe development of the alternating direction code was\nbased upon a theoretical study initiated under AFOSR sponsorship\n(AFOSR-82-0176) and continued under this NASA grant. The basic\ntheory along with some modest applications were presented at\nthe AIAA Computational Fluid Dynamics Conference in Danver< MA\nin June,1983 as AIAA paper 1937 on pages 339-348 of the proceedings [1]. The paper has also been accepted for publication\nin the AIAA Journal, pending some modest revisions.\nIn essence, grid points are moved on an "abstract surface"\nabove physical space by means of alternating coordinate directions.\nThe abstract surface is formed with the salient solution properties if they can be extracted by a priori physical reasoning;\nor otherwise, in the absence of such reasoning, by the use of\nerror estimates in some chosen norm. Upon formulation, all\nimportant driving properties for adaptive purposes are consolidated into one object - the abstract surface. At a basic level,\na uniform distribution of surface points is equivalent to\ngradient resolution. This arises from a projection back down\ninto physical space. At a higher level, a more accurate view\nof the abstract surface is obtained when changes in surface\ndirection are also resolved. The appropriate measure for direction changes is normal curvature. It is defined as the rate\nof change of surface tangent planes as a surface coordinate curve\nis transversed in uniform increments of arc length. Such\nvariations in surface tangents clearly pick up the desired\ndireciton changes which can become extremely tilted about the\n\n1\n\n2.\n\nspecific coordinate curve employed. \t Should only curve information be used, the tilting effect of the tangent planes would\nbe discarded, resulting in a severe loss in the detection of\nsurface direction changes.\t The curves used in the algorithm\nare coordinate curves on the surface. \t Taken one at a time,\nthe points on each are redistributed in cycles which sweep\nthrough each direction in succession. \t This alternation of\ndirections and splitting into one dimensional pieces is similar\nin spirit to that of ADI numerical schemes.\nThe alternating direction algorithm represents a substantial synthesis of the generalization beyond previous methods.\nIn one- dimension, White (2) and Ablow and Schecter t3) used\nthe arc length of the actual solution by deriving an auxiliary differential equation for movement which subsequently\nwas simultaneously solved by implicit methods. \t The differential equations added complexity particularly in the case of\nAblow and Schecter when curvature was used. \t Even in onedimension, the use of an abstract surface and the explicit\ndecoupling of movement is advantageous. \t Not only does the\nabstract surface allow a greater freedom of choice to simplify\nthe movement process, but also it can be smoothed independently of the solution. \t In cases where the actual solution\ncontains discontinuities, the computation of curvature would be\ngreatly in error; thereby, rendering it useless as a clustering property.\t To smooth the actual solution in order to\nretrieve curvature clustering would be a cure which could\nkill the solution.\t By contrast, smoothing the abstract surface\ngives the desired movement while retaining the solution.\t In\nmultidimensional problems, to my knowledge, there have been no\nprior studies that use a solution surface formulation. \t If the\nabstract surface, however, is trivially taken to correspond\nwith physical space, then the alternating direction method\nreduces to that of Gnoffo [41 when gradient clustering is\nused as a property in the weight function. \t Rhen further\nspecialization is given by restricting movement to just one\ndirection, the method of Dwyer et al.\t (51 is obtained where\n\na\n\nr\t\n\nI\t\n\n1\n\n.\t\n\nis\n\n3\t\n\nunlike Gnoffo, second derivatives of the solution are also\nused in the weight function. Since the second derivatives use\nonly curve information, the critical tilting measurements of\ntangent planes are lost.\nReturning to the use of general abstract solution generated\nsurfaces, the alternating direction development served as the basis\nfor the development of the adaptive triangular mesh algorithm\nwith Gordon Erlebacher for his thesis(61. In his thesis, Dr.\nErlebacher formed an abstract surface for a plasma equilibrium\nstudy in a toroidally symmetric tokamak configuration. Over\nthe tokamak cross section, he prescribed the abstract surface as\na linear combination of toroidal current and inverse flux\ngradient squared. The current part resolved the plasma boundary\nwhich could be taken as a free boundary. The flux gradient part\nresolved the magnetic axis. By contrast, the solution itself,\nwhich for historical reasons was a first try, had failed to\nresolve any of the desired properties. The mesh movement on\nthe abstract surface was accomplished with a geometrically\nconstructed molecule which was used in a point iterative sense.\nDue to the use of a general connectivity triangular mesh, curvature was mor6 conveniently represented with an approximation of\nmean curvature as a Laplacian suitably normalized with the\nmagnitude of the gradient, rather than by the direct use of\nnormal curvatures. The finite difference representation of\ngradient and Laplacian as exemplified by Fritts and Boris (7) was\nalso improved upon and analyzed in the sense of local truncation\nerrors.\nIn the alternating direction algorithm, the effect of\nnormal curvature was examined through a sequence of test cases.\nIn the first instance, a circular bump was examined with a\nconflicting rectalinear mesh topology. The use of normal\ncurvature was seen there to cause coordinate curves to wrap\naround the base and top rim of the bump in correspondence with\nthe regions where direction changes occurred. Upon projection,\nthe curvature regions were added on to both sides of the\ngradient regions; thereby, giving a broader band of resolution.\n\nF. aR\n\nr\n\n4.\n\nr\t\n\nSince the use of normal curvature caused coordinate curves to \t\n\t\nfollow along surface folds as in the case of the bump, it seemed\nreasonable that it could also be used to automatically push\ncoordinate curves into alignment with disturbances such as\nshock waves. As a second sequence of test cases, the alignment\nissue was examined with an artifically prescribed moving bow\nwave in front of a biconvex airfoil. The motion was from a\nvectical position to one which bent over and extended downsti`am\nfrom the ai-foil. Grid movement with and without normal curvature was then examined for the same evolutionary abstract\nsurface. In comparison between these two cases, grid alignment appeared only with curvature and there it appeared quite\nwell; substantiating our claim.\nWhen a nontrivial boundary in physical space must be\nresolved, a lifted form of it appears in the abstract solution\ngenerated surface as a boundary. Since normal curvature measures direction changes of surface tangent planes, changes\nwithin such planes are undetected and are those which belong\nto direction changes of curves within the surface. These latter\nchanges, however, are measured by geodesic curvature. In particular, geodesic curvature is required to detect the above\nmentioned surface boundary. An initial examination was begun\non the combined effect of both normal and geodesic curvature.\nThe primary properties of each were observed in the case of a\ndisturbance over an airfoil with an O,type grid. However, the\ncorrect balancing between the two has yet to be established in\nthat case. With rectalinear topologies, by contrast, the\nbalance is readily done.\n\n- _ -- --\t\n\n-\t\n\n__\n\ni\nf\n\n...\n5.\n\nREFERENCES\nIll\n\nEiseman, P.R.\t (1983) AIAA CFD Conf., Danvers, MA, 339-3\n\n[2)\n\nWhite, A.B.,\t (1982)\t SIAM J.
