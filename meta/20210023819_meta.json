Minimizing a cost function that penalizes the variance of the error in achieving commanded forces and moments on the vehicle resulted in a special case of the weighted pseudo-inverse allocator.  Rather than an engineer designing the weighting matrix, it is computed from the covariances of the control effectiveness parameters.  This minimum-variance allocator balances the effectiveness of the control inputs against the corresponding levels of uncertainty.  The approach was demonstrated using simulations of aircraft with realistic uncertainty levels operating in open-loop and closed-loop configurations.  Results showed that when model uncertainty is known, significant, and unevenly distributed amongst the controls, the minimum-variance allocator more often achieves the intended forces and moments on the vehicle in comparison to other allocators, which can lead to increased performance, reliability, and safety during flight tests.  The cost for this robustness is a diminished achievable moment space for the vehicle.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "cui": {"isCui": false}, "meetings": [{"country": "US", "submissionId": 20210023819, "endDate": "2022-01-07T05:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"organizationId": "71fb4af96d4a59b5a0a2084db7b4ce35", "meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "Reston, Virginia, United States"}}, "meetingId": "b7806a06d9834fb3a640bafb51d031b2", "id": "e9e755bc67a74dd0aaefd9d42148fa63"}], "name": "2022 AIAA SciTech Forum", "location": "San Diego, CA", "id": "b7806a06d9834fb3a640bafb51d031b2", "url": "https://www.aiaa.org/SciTech", "startDate": "2022-01-03T05:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "mvca_v3.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20210023819/downloads/mvca_v3.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20210023819/downloads/mvca_v3.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20210023819/downloads/mvca_v3.pdf.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
