The methods use an aerodynamic model of the aircraft that is being identified in real-time onboard the aircraft to adjust the control parameters. One method employs adaptive nonlinear dynamic inversion, whereas the other consists of a classical autopilot structure. E ects from the interaction between the realtime modeling and the developed control laws are discussed. The Learn-to-Fly concept has been deemed feasible based on successful flights of both a stable and unstable aircraft.
