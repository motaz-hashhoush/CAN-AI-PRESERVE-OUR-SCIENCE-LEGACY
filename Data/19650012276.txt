This change\nwas apparently associated with a transition from a region of\n4\nm\ntV9&magnetosphere where the magnetic field lines cavitate with\n\nthe\n\n_ "\n\nthe Earth\n@-.a to a region where the Earth\'s field lines are swept\nA\n-\n\nback into the magnetic wake.\n\nThis transition was observed\n\nearlier by satellite particle detectors a few thousand miles\ncloser to Earth.\n-more-\n\n-3\n\n-\n\nThe average l o c a t i o n of a l l three t r a n s i t i o n s , when com-\n\npared with earlier measurements, i s c o n s i s t e n t w i t h an out-\n\nward expansion of the magnetosphere, presumably a s s o c i a t e d\nw i t h a l e s s e n i n g i n the s t r e n g t h of the s o l a r wind.\n\nThe\n\nmagnetic data a l s o suggest that the l o c a t i o n of the boundaries\ncan vary r a p i d l y w i t h time and may pass a s p a c e c r a f t s e v e r a l\n\ntimes as t h e s p a c e c r a f t t r a v e l s away from .the Earth.\nAlso c o n s i s t e n t w i t h previous data--Mariner\n\nI1 measure-\n\nment i n 1962--are t h e following l a r g e - s c a l e f e a t u r e s of the\ninterplanetary field:\nThe f i e l d s a r e s t r o n g l y disordered, probably caused by\n\ni r r e g u l a r plasma-field emissions a t the Sun, i n t e r a c t i n g\nclouds of slowly moving and r a p i d l y moving plasma i n space\nand i n s t a b i l i t i e s that develop i n the expanding s o l a r wind.\nThe i n t e r p l a n e t a r y f i e l d t e n d s t o l i e i n , o r near, a\n\np l a n e parallel t o t h e s o l a r e q u a t o r i a l plane on t h e average,\nb u t has a high p r o b a b i l i t y of l y i n g o u t of t h i s a a n e d u r i n g\nany given measurement.\n\n(The Earth\'s s o l a r o r b i t and t h e\n\nMariner IV t r a j e c t o r y both a r e roughly parallel t o t h i s p l a n e . )\nThe f i e l d t e n d s t o be s p i r a l l e d i n p l a n e s p a r a l l e l t o these\nby s o l a r r o t a t i o n .\n\n-more\n\n-\n\n& - - )\n\n. *\n\n-4There a r e f e a t u r e s i n t h e i n t e r p l a n e t a r y f i e l d t h a t reoccur a t periodic i n t e r v a l s of approximately 27 days, t h e\nperiod of t h e Sun\'s r o t a t i o n .\n\nThese f e a t u r e s t h a t p e r s i s t\n\nfor s e v e r a l s o l a r r o t a t i o n s are probably a s s o c i a t e d w i t h per-\n\ns i s t e n t a c t i v e regions on t h e Sun.\n\nHELIUM VECTOR MAGNETOMETER INSTRUMENT\nThe magnetometer i s based on t h e p r i n c i p l e that t h e\n\namount of l i g h t t h a t can pas8 through helium gas, t h a t has been\ne x c i t e d t o a higher than normal energy l e v e l , i s dependent on\nt h e a n g l e between t h e l i g h t a x i s and t h e d i r e c t i o n of t h e s u r -\n\nrounding magnetic f i e l d .\n\nMeasuring t h e amount of l i g h t passed\n\nthrough the helium g i v e s a measurement of the magnetic f i e l d\ni n magnitude and d i r e c t i o n .\nThe l i g h t source i s a helium lamp i n t h e magnetometer.\nThe l i g h t , collimated and c i r c u l a r l y p o l a r i z e d , passes through\n\na c e l l containing t h e e x c i t e d helium g a s and t h e n impinges on\n\nan i n f r a r e d d e t e c t o r t h a t measures t h e amount of l i g h t passed\nthrough the helium gas.\nThe magnetometer is l o c a t e d on t h e low g a i n antenna mast\n\nt o minimize t h e e f f e c t of t h e s p a c e c r a f t \' s magnetic f i e l d s .\n\nE l e c t r o n i c s supporting the experiment are l o c a t e d i n a compartment on t h e s p a c e c r a f t .\n\nThe magnetometer weighs 1.25 pounds.\n\nThe e l e c t r o n i c s weighs s i x pounds.\n\nseven watts of power.\n-End-\n\nThe experiment o p e r a t e s on\n\nT\n\n'
