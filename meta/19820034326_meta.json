The effects of carrying a sling load on the vehicle dynamics is predicted by considering a coupled model of the two bodies. Inherent stability characteristics of the vehicle are analyzed and compared with those of a helicopter and an airship in free flight. Typical operational conditions that could lead to vehicle instability are described in the flight envelope of interest.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19820034326, "endDate": "1982-01-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics"}}, "meetingId": "23b49f4cad3644a18e04d2337dad4280", "id": "b397e96b582d4cae9d1c42bc2444c81f"}], "name": "Aerospace Sciences Meeting", "location": "Orlando, FL", "id": "23b49f4cad3644a18e04d2337dad4280", "startDate": "1982-01-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19820034326, "id": "87d5006d1c254c92ba810e19a91c88ee", "publicationDate": "1982-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
