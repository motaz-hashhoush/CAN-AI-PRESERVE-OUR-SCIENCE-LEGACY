b'Flow visualization of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s six-passenger quadcopter concept for urban air mobility (UAM), in edgewise flight (front-oblique\nview). The vehicle design reduces rotor-rotor interactions between the front and rear rotors, while keeping an efficient,\ncompact configuration. The background shows pressure oscillations (white is high, black is low). This image reveals the\ncomplexity of the flow for a multi-rotor configuration, where many rotors interact with each other and the different\ncomponents. Patricia Ventura Diaz, NASA/Ames\n\nUrban Air Mobility (UAM) is envisioned to be the future air transportation system over populated areas, where everything from\nsmall package delivery drones to passenger-carrying air taxis\nare able to interact safely and efficiently. The capacity of\nmulti-rotor vehicles to perform vertical takeoff and landing\n(VTOL), together with their great maneuverability, make them an\nexcellent choice for UAM aircraft. The accurate prediction of multirotor vehicles performance and acoustics is very challenging\ndue to the unsteady and complex flows, as well as the aerodynamic interactions. By running high-fidelity computational fluid\ndynamics simulations on NASA supercomputers, researchers\nmodel the complex aerodynamics of multi-rotor flows, getting\nus closer to making UAM a reality.\n\nS AERONAUTICS\n\nTowards Urban Air Mobility:\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Quadcopter Air Taxi\nConcept\n\nNASA\n\nPatricia Ventura Diaz, NASA Ames Research Center\nSeokkwan Yoon, NASA Ames Research Center\n\nHigh-fidelity computational fluid dynamics flow visualization of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s six-passenger quadcopter concept for urban air mobility,\nin edgewise flight (front-oblique view). The vehicle surface pressure is shown in blue (low) and red (high). Line contours show\nthe vorticity magnitude (blue is low, magenta is high) at four vertical planes: one at the front rotors; two downstream of the\nfront rotors; and one at the rear rotors. Rotor-rotor interactions are reduced by moving the rear rotors above the wake from the\nfront rotors, shown as vorticity contours at the rear rotors\xe2\x80\x99 plane.
