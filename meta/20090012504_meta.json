We here consider a soccer match as an experiment to assess which of two teams is superior and examine the probability that the outcome of the experiment (match) truly represents the relative abilities of the two teams. Given a final score it is possible by using a Bayesian approach to quantify the probability that it was or was not the case that the best team won. For typical scores, the probability of a misleading result is significant. Modifying the rules of the game to increase thc typical number of goals scored would improve the situation, but a level of confidence that would normally be regarded as satisfactory could not be obtained unless the character of the game were radically changed.", "title": "Soccer Matches as Experiments - How Often Does the 'Best' Team Win?", "stiType": "PREPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-24T17:26:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20090012504, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Skinner, Gerald K."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD, United States"}}, "id": "bd8c217dae57474fbb1a5b7694826468"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20090012504, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Freeman, G.
