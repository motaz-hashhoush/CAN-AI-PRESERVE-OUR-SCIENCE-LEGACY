The strength of the paradigm is its generality and simplicity. The definition of delay is applicable to RC meshes with potential resistive attenuating paths to ground. The algorithms can also be applied to undriven circuits (static charge sharing) and circuits with initial charge. To compute the delays, each node in the network is explored locally to derive a system of sparse linear equations. The solutions of the system are delay values based on the Elmore time constant at each point in the circuit.", "title": "Computation of signal delays in RC networks", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T18:56:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19940016629, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Hidalgo, Juan Carlos"}, "organization": {"name": "State Univ. of New York", "location": "Albany, NY, United States"}}, "id": "5e753a1dc05f44c7bf8a92949a6cb4a2"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19940016629, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Narendran, Paliath"}, "organization": {"name": "State Univ. of New York", "location": "Albany, NY, United States"}}, "id": "f18f13875b4d499f883b81378f672bf5"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19940016629, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Chaiken, Seth"}, "organization": {"name": "State Univ. of New York", "location": "Albany, NY, United States"}}, "id": "b67c96a64c3841b493353c2826dbb975"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19940016629, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19940016629, "id": "1d627bb5769348b3b1cb28275ef33250", "publicationName": "New Mexico Univ., The Fifth NASA Symposium on VLSI Design", "publicationDate": "1993-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19940016163, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Twenty-Fourth Lunar and Planetary Science Conference.
