The signal/noise was improved compared to prior spectra obtained in this laboratory by including a filter wheel limiting the band-pass of each spectrum to several hundred per cm. We have measured positions of lines in several weak bands not previously resolved in laboratory spectra. Using our positions and assignments of lines of the Qbranch of the 31103-00001 vibrational band at 4591/cm, we have redetermined the rotational constants for the 31103f levels. Q-branch lines of this band were previously observed, but misassigned, in Venus spectra by Mandin. The current HITRAN values of the rotational constants for this level are incorrect due to the Q-branch misassignments. Our prior measurements of the 21122-00001 vibrational band at 7901/cm were limited to Q-and R-branch lines; with the improved signal/noise of these new spectra we have now measured lines in the weaker P branch. The 21122 (Gv = 790148/cm) levels are known to be perturbed by the 32211 (G(sub v) = 789757/cm) levels; new DND calculations predict that high-J lines of the forbidden 32211-00001 vibrational band 'borrow' intensity from the corresponding transitions of the 21122-00001 band. We have identified such Q- and R-branch transitions of the 32211-00001 band from 26 < J\" < 44, based on our position measurements of lines in the 32211-02201 band at 6562/cm.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20020051354, "endDate": "1998-06-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Ohio State Univ.", "location": "Columbus, OH United States"}}, "meetingId": "854084be184b46f08dcaa6f061c65d1d", "id": "7cd6b4f176764e2786fd65ab17ede7d8"}], "name": "53rd Ohio State Univ.
