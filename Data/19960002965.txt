Annual Meeting, 1992.\nOpen Mind, the Association for the achievement of diversity in higher education, met in\nconference in Albuquerque, New Mexico, between October 16 and 18, 1992. The meeting was\nattended by approximately 80 delegates, representing all ethnic groups, areas and levels of academia\nfrom graduate students through university presidents. There was significant representation from\nevery geographic region of the nation and from professional associations as well as academic\ninsitutions.\nThe meeting included several "working group" sessions and a business meeting of the\nassociation. Reports of the working group sessions and the draft minutes of the business meeting\nare attached.\n\n2. Board Meeting.\n<Hk\n\nFollowing the annual meeting, a meeting of the Board of Directors of Open Mind was held\nin New Orleans, Louisiana, on February 5 and 6,1993. The draft minutes of the Board Meeting are\nappended to this report.\n\n3. Conference Follow-Up Activities.\nA number of follow-up activities have been initiated. These include the publication of a\nnewsletter (example attached), the publication of a research paper series, and the production of a\nvideocassette on the achievement of the pluralistic campus. At the time of writing, all of these\nactivities are under way.\n\n4. Annual Meeting, 1993.\nOpen Mind, met again in New Orleans, Louisiana, between September 16 and 19,1993. The\nmeeting was attended by approximately 100 delegates, again representing all ethnic groups, areas\nand levels of academia from graduate students through university presidents. There was significant\nrepresentation from every geographic region of the nation and from professional associations as well\nas academic insitutions. The agenda of the meeting is attached, as is a letter delivered by graduate\nstudent delegates to the board of Open Mind, at the meeting. Stemming from the meeting, Open\nMind began sponsoring the distribution of scholarly works on the subject of diversity, an example\nof which is enclosed.\n\n5. Inventions, etc.\nThere were no inventions, patentable or otherwise, stemming from this project.\n\nAPPENDIX 1\nWORKING GROUP REPORTS\nAlbuquerque Meeting\n\nDRAFT\nSummary of Work Group Reports From OpenMind Meeting on October 16 -18,\n1992\nColleagues:\nFollowing is a summary of the reports from the work groups. We used the format of\nlooking at responses to Myrna\'s questions. We believe that the responses taken\ntogether could form the basis for a short report if some of the ideas are explained and\namplified. I am in the process of trying to do just that and would welcome your\nsuggestions. Call or write.\nTrevor\n\nThe task for the work groups was set forth by Myrna\'in three questions with subsets.\nNot all questions were addressed by every group and some questions were given more\nconsideration in the reports than other questions.\n1. Evaluate our progress, including our policies, practices, procedures and\norganizational structure. (The following answers are a compilation.)\nFirst, and most importantly, we believe the need for OpenMind remains, and is\nperhaps even greater than when it was founded.\nWhat has the organization done? Organized and structured the organization;\nmaintained a workable size; established a newsletter, established a membership\nroster, organized national meetings, established by-laws for the organization;\ndeveloped a mission statement with goals and policy action groups; maintained ongoing meetings; presented at other conferences and national meetings and\nmaintained its ability to be inclusive.\nThe organization has been effective in providing a forum for us to dialogue, share\nexperiences and attempt to build an agenda for action while maintaining a respect\nand regard of the diversity of the groups involved. It has also affirmed our individual\ncommitment and efforts and provided a support system.\nThe early work of OpenMind, which was characterized as both "beautiful and\nimportant," has not yet been transformed into an organizational structure adequate\nto meet its objectives. Its small very busy membership has been unable to do the\nextra work that is essential to the development of the association.\nOpenMind\'s early publication, ... made a substantial internal impact ..., but the fact\nthat no further publications have been prepared in the last two years is a matter of\nconcern, ....\nThe By-laws were found to be quite clear and pertinent in regard to the duties and\nresponsibilities of PAGs and conveners.\n\nThe circumstances within which OpenMind is working are undergoing important\nchanges, not only due to the conflicts that arise between different ethnic groups,\nwhich perceive themselves to be in competition, but also due to immigration and the\nbeginning of NAFTA....\nA review of the brochure indicates that the present purposes and concerns of\nOpenMind remain vital ....\n\xe2\x80\xa2Where are we?\n\nWe have not made as much progress as desired toward developing as an organization\nbecause of the difficulty and complexity of the mission. We need clearly defined\nopportunities to strengthen the internal dialogue .... we identified several\nimpediments to our efforts;\ngoals\n\nthe PAG structure has yet to facilitate an effective structure for achieving the\n\nit is unrealistic to achieve the numbers and range of activities required to meet\nthe goals in the short term\nour work as individuals wasn\'t directly or formally connected to OpenMind as\nan organization ...\nRevisiting and rewriting the goals of OpenMind.\n\xe2\x80\xa2What should we be doing?\n\nGroup I recommends: We see OpenMind as an organization which must "influence\nthe influential" in order to bring about needed changes. By far the overriding group\nof influentials to be targeted is the faculty, and each project we undertake should\nhave this as an important direct or indirect goal!\nA corollary aim is to assist and support graduate students - future faculty particularly those who are in a position to help bring about the pluralistic,\nmulticultural university community we seek.\nOpenMind should institutionalize the idea or principle that one of its reasons for\nexistence is to establish among its members a community.of supportive and caring\nindividuals. This may be accomplished through retreats or similar settings dedicated\nto community building. (The full body of the following recommendations are in the\ngroup report.)\nBuild & disseminate an inventory of successful diversification\nprograms (a clearinghouse for information).\nProvide consulting services for campuses.\nHelp shape government programs initiatives, and priorities;\nand accrediting agencies\' standards and practices.\n\nReach out to, and influence, more faculty, collaborate with\ndisciplinary and other relevant associations, especially their\nethnic and women\'s caucuses.\nBe of assistance to graduate students in their searches for\nacademic positions.\nWe also recommend enhancing the structure of the organization. The PAGs need to\nbe continued. There also needs to be a mechanism for putting into action their ideas\nand advancing our priorities. The following committees are recommended:\nPromotion and Marketing\n-creating visibility for OpenMind, panel presentations, writing articles &\npapers, and aggressive outreach\nPublications\n-early priority would be the production of a Handbook for Campuses, the\nresponsibility for the organization\'s newsletter and all official\npublications\nConsulting\n-match up requests for assistance with resources\nPublic Policy\n-prepare and present the official positions on matters of broad concern.\nGroup II recommends :\nHigh Priority Items;\n-serve as a counter force to the NAS and similar conservative groups;\nserve as an idea exchange\nand repository for pertinent information; foster overall\ninstitution-wide efforts to enhance diversity by encouraging a total campus or\nsystem-wide approach; forge linkages with other major groups to work for diversity,\n...; bring together cadres of scholars, leaders, staff and students who have been\nsuccessful in transforming campuses.\nLower Priority Items;\n-serve as a force to support diversity efforts such as the stand taken by\nMiddle States Accreditation group; define terms and create a common language for\nOpenMind and increase the understanding of OpenMind members, & others, about\nthe political nature of institutions of higher ed.\nAs an Organizational Structure (committees or pags):\n-training & development,\n-support & advocacy,\n-enhancing institutional transformation,\n-providing a forum for scholarship (research, curriculum, ...),\n-facilitating inter- & intra-group organization.\nGroup HI recommends: The organization should, in addition to its national\nmeeting, develop regional meetings. Meeting once a year is not enough time to get\n\nthings done. The need to incorporate regional meetings led into a discussion on\nanalyzing clusters. Clustering would be an effective way of moving the organization\nforward. Go forward with regionalization.\nA formal analysis of the membership should be done indicating geographic and\ndemographic breakdown.\nIt was noted that the original focus of OpenMind was in the role of faculty ... So how\ndo you develop an organizational structure that will involve faculty? ...(It appears\nthat NAS has been effective because of two factors - faculty involvement & campus\nbased - lets take a look at how they did it.)\nThere is a need at some point to develop a scholarly journal for the organization.\nMembers can share their research, a monograph could be developed.\nWhile the preamble, mission and goals of the organization have general agreement\nthey need to be incorporated into a set of principles that transcend particular groups\nand particular individuals.\nWe need to move to the action phase. We need to know who we are and who we want\nto be. All groups in Toyama\'s letter should be included but should not function as\ncaucuses.\nThe by-laws provide the standard committee structure. A membership committee\nneeds to be added and the committees need to be up and functioning. Identify\ncommittee chairs of all committees (add membership).\nGroup IV recommends: three areas to concentrate on;\ngrowth of the organization in developmental stages, ...\ndeveloping and defining a discourse of diversity, ...\npromoting greater collaboration and understanding, ...\nThe structure of OpenMind needs to reflect a different and alternative organizational\nculture in all of its activities and discussions to be consistent and to maintain the\nintegrity of diversity. We recommend both a national and regional focus\nCoalition building is a means to begin developing and defiping the discourse and\npromoting greater understanding and collaboration.\nGroup V recommends:\naccepting and endorsing the mission statement as presently framed,\naccepting the PAG structure as set out in the by-laws, with attention to certain\npriorities, that is to student access and retention, but continuing to affirm the\nvalues of multicultural understanding and practice which defines all\nOpenMind activities,\n\nremaining open to group caucuses on any principle and the freedom of groups\nto articulate their concerns to the full group,\naffirming our concern to serve the great diversity of ethnic groups but without\ndemanding that all members be required to identify themselves with one in\nparticular,\nit was further asked that a new logo be designed based on the circle.\nprovide graduate students with a forum to give expression to their difficulties\nand also provide guidance to such solutions as are presently possible. Press\nfor student access and retention.\nuse our diverse and dispersed membership in offering visitation teams to assist\ninstitutions in their efforts to find workable means to achieve greater diversity.\nFunding is a priority.\nSome attention should be given to the focus of membership and participation\nfor undergraduate students as well as staff other than administrators and\nfaculty.\nGraduate Students recommend:\npromote and support greater recruitment and retention of graduate students\ninvolved in multicultural research as well as greater diversity of peoples within\nthe sciences. ...\nhave OpenMind recognize the diversity of voices and discourse styles within its\nown membership. OpenMind needs to represent the ideas of all and all ideas\nneed to be treated with courtesy and respect.\nwe would like to see OpenMind explore all avenues of possible communication\nto bring about change, whether this be federal officials, administrators, faculty,\npotential students etc. We need to understand everyone\'s language.\nappoint a graduate student to the executive board.\n\xe2\x80\xa2How do we promote ourselves and our work?\n\n\xc2\xbb\nThis question was discussed in the "Media Workshop". Each member can:\n-Get the word out on you and OpenMind. Tell your campus PR person that you\nattended this conference.\n-Let your campus PR office know the issues about which you are an expert.\nLet them know you are available to be interviewed, write or speak on those\nissues.\n-Take positions on national issues and relate the issues to your own campus.\nDo white papers.\n\n-When you write for publication, identify yourself as a member of OpenMind.\n-Op Ed pieces are important. Weekly newspapers are important for influencing\nat a grassroots level ....\n-Although television is hard to break into you can call up your local station and\nsuggest a story. Community or public access cable is sometimes very receptive\nto special programs.\n-Always identify with OpenMind when writing or advocating a position that fits\nin with the goals of the organization.\nThe Association can;\n-Develop a list of writers who write on specific ethnic issues. These writers can\nbe targeted for contact every time a relevant issue arises.\n-Develop a good camera ready promotional ^cochure that can be copied.\nMembers can take brochures to every speaking event, conference, etc. for\ndistribution.\n-Plan PR strategy, include print media, TV and brochures. Identify good\nOp Ed writers, get them to help. Use catchy phrases, e.g., "the next sound you\nhear may be a mind closing," "education cuts don\'t heal," "remember what\nyou are doing comes from the soul."\n-Develop an OpenMind hotline. Identify emerging issues.\nThe following sub-set questions to # 1 , how do we recruit new members? how do we\nincrease participation - especially teaching faculty ...?, were not discussed in the\nwritten reports.\n\xe2\x80\xa2What about Policy/Action Groups?\nThere were several comments made throughout the reports as to the importance of the\nPAGs. Comments on how they are structured and utilized varied. Le.\nGroup I: The PAGs need to be continued. They are performing an invaluable service,\nby laying out the philosophical underpinnings and vision for all of us. There needs to\nbe a mechanism for putting their ideas into action. We recommend a committee\nstructure (see structure under "what should we be doing").\nGroup III: There was general recognition that the PAGs had, in fact, not been\neffective and that the actual effectiveness depended, in large part, on the availability\nof the PAGs consensus. PAGs are more programmatic and the groups are too large.\nIt was suggested that maybe standard committee structures would be more effective.\nPerhaps one of the PAGs should be proposed as a major project for the organization.\nThe PAGs should be prioritized. The PAG priority should be #3 The New Scholarship\nand Curriculum Change.\n6\n\nGroup IV: PAGs are important issue areas but may not be the best structure for\norganizing work. The PAG structure has yet to facilitate an effective structure for\nachieving the goals.\nGroup V: Accept the PAG structure as set out in the by-laws, with attention to\ncertain priorities, i.e., student access and retention, but continuing to affirm the\nvalues of multicultural understanding and practice which defines all OpenMind\nactivities.\n2. Set priorities for achieving current OpenMind goals.\nThis questions was not answered directly but is referenced in the suggestions\nlisted in question #1, under the heading "what should we be doing" they are in priority\norder by group.\n4*\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2What is our special niche in relationship to other organizations with\nsimilar goals?\nOpenMind should institutionalize the idea or principle that one of its reasons\nfor existence is to establish among its members a community of supportive and\ncaring individuals.\nA cursory review of the membership indicates that our group is a\nrepresentative sample of the OpenMind membership: faculty, administrators\nand students.\nThe organization has been effective in providing a forum for us to dialogue,\nshare experiences and attempt to build an agenda for action while maintaining\na respect and regard for the diversity of the groups involved.\n3. Chart our future direction and the activities to be undertaken as the means\nfor reaching the high priority goals.\nThe answers to this part of the question were addressed under question #1.\n\xe2\x80\xa2Should we inaugurate an Institute for the Study of Diversity? Where?\nHow?\nGroup IV: facilitate the discussion of an institute for the study of diversity and\neventual development of such an institute.\nThe following sub-sections of question 3 were not addressed in the written\nreports.. Get down the specifics: Who is to do what, when, how? What will it\ncost? What do we do alone, what do we do in concert with other organizations?\nWhich ones? How do we distribute our videotapes, our research, our reports,\nour ideas?\n\nAPPENDIX 2\nBUSINESS MEETING DRAFT MINUTES\nAlbuquerque Meeting\n\nOPENMIND - Business Meeting, October 18, 1992\nLa Posada, Albuquerque, New Mexico\nMINUTES\nChair Myrna C. Adams called the meeting to order.\nmembers were present.\n\nMore than a quorum of\n\nMinutes of the Annual Meeting of September 28, 1991, were accepted as\ncirculated.\nTreasurer Alexander H. King presented a financial report for the fiscal year\nJuly, 1991-June 1992, showing revenues of $18,007, expenses of $18,375, and a\nclosing balance of $6,264.\nThe Treasurer presented the report of the Ad Hoc Committee on Finance and\nStructure. A motion was made, seconded and passed to accept the new dues\nlevels for Supporting Fellows, Fellows, Affiliates and Graduate Students.\nAfter discussion, it was further moved, seconded and passed that the\ninstitution/organization membership be accepted. (Copy of report is\nattached.)\nSecretary Elizabeth L. Wadsworth, moved suspension of items in the Bylaws of\nOpenMind, to enable the Annual Meeting to transact or defer certain items of\nbusiness in 1992. The motion was seconded and passed unanimously. The items\nsuspended were Articles Three (Sections l,a.,b. and 2,a.), Five (Sec. 2 and\n3), Six (Sec. 2.) and Seven (Sec. 3,b.,c.).\nThe Chair appointed the following members to serve, along with the OpenMind\nofficers, as a one-year interim Board of Directors: Frank Bonilla, Maria\nCanino, Joanne Hecker, Charlotte Heth, Evelyn Hu-DeHart, Rita Joyola, Joyce\nJustus, Jackie Looney, Ann Pruitt, Al Ramirez, Dereck Rovaris, Jean Standness,\nJudy Toyoma, Bill Trent, Natalia Vesey.\nJudy Toyoma read the Nominating Committee report, presenting a single slate of\ncandidates for the offices of President and President Elect for the 1992-1993\nyear: Dr. Trevor L. Chandler, Assistant Vice Chancellor for Campus Diversity\nat the University of California, Davis, and William B. Harvey, Associate\nProfessor in the College of Education and Psychology at North Carolina State\nUniversity. A motion to accept the Nominating Committee report was passed.\nA motion to elect the nominees was made, seconded and carried.\nMyrna Adams became Immediate Past President. Continuing for a second year in\noffice were Alex King, Treasurer and Elizabeth Wadsworth, Secretary.\nNine graduate students submitted a "Statement to Open Mind," recommending\nattention to diversity, to full communication within its meetings and to the\nsuccess of graduate students from "cultural microcosms." The students\nrecommended that a graduate student be a member of the Executive Committee.\nThe meeting accepted the report, agreeing that its concerns should inform\nOpenMind action. The Chair noted the presence of two graduate students on the\nalready-appointed, one-year interim Board of Directors.\nOpenMind officers and directors were urged to seek coalitions with appropriate\norganizations, particularly with the aim of increasing faculty participation\nin work toward OpenMind goals.\nORIGINAL PAGE IS\nOF POOR QUALITY\n\nReport of Ad Hoc Committee on Finance and Structure\nOpenMind Conference, October 17, 1992\nMembers:\n\nAlex King, Chair; Maria Canino, Mimi Coffey, David McDonald, Anne\nMedicine, Marshall Morris, Cedric Page, Bill Thompson, Judy\nToyama, Elizabeth Wadsworth, Janice White.\n\nPolicy: Dues from Open Mind memberships should support the ongoing work of\nthe organization. Projects should be supported from outside sources,\nincluding grants.\nPolicy: Until such time as OpenMind has the financial strength to support a\ncentral office on its own, it will be assumed that the president\'s home\ninstitution will serve as host to the organization. "Hosting" will include\nmailing address, membership response and other sustaining operations.\nNew Dues Structure\nInstitutions, Organizations\nSupporting Fellows\nFellows\nAffiliates\nGraduate Students\n\n$250\n100\n50\n25\n15\n\nProjected Memberships and Income, 1992-1993:\nInstitutions, Organizations\nSupporting Fellows\nFellows\nAffiliates\nGraduate Students\n\n20\n100\n100\n40\n20\n\n@\n@\n@\n@\n@\n\n250\n100\n100\n25\n15\n\n5,000\n10,000\n5,000\n1,000\n300\n21,300\n\nInstitutional Memberships\nAn institution (one campus) or organization accepting membership in OpenMind\nwill be entitled to membership as fellow for the President/Chancellor/Chair or\na designee. Institutional or organizational application for membership will\nbe signed by the President/Chancellor/Chair and will name the designee, if\nappropriate. The application will include a statement of acceptance of the\nmission and goals of OpenMind. (The application will also carry a disclaimer\nof any kind of certification of institutional members by OpenMind with respect\nto diversity.)\nOpenMind Structure\nIt was agreed that the present formal structure of OpenMind allows for all\nactivities currently envisioned, including the development of regional\nactivities. The OpenMind Bylaw provisions for working groups (called Policy\nAction Groups) allow for the creation of structures to support projects.\nMembers of the committee agreed that amendment provisions of the Bylaws allow\nfor future development of formal substructures as needed.\n\nChair Adams reported that occasions arise when it might be appropriate to give\nother organizations a list of OpenMind members. Those present suggested that\nOpenMind obtain general permission for such use from individual members.\nThe incoming President of OpenMind was directed to communicate on behalf of\nOpenMind with the three presidential campaigns and then to communicate with\nthe transition team of the winner. The Secretary was directed to send news of\nthe OpenMind election to the Chronicle of Higher Education.\nAcknowledging the difficulty of action on specific\ngroup has a national membership, OpenMind members,\nagreed to establish ad hoc regional groups for the\ngroup meetings were scheduled to follow the Annual\nidentified as Southeast, Central, West, California\n\nobjectives when the active\ndirectors and officers\n1992-1993 year. Initial\nMeeting. Regions were\nand Northeast.\n\nChair Myrna Adams passed the gavel to incoming President Trevor Chandler. The\nnew President remarked on the continuing exploration that is OpenMind in\naction. The idea of diversity is not clear and fixed, but is developing.\nTrust is crucial for members; as people are added, we learn together. So it\nmust be if we are to do what we want to do.\nThere being no further business, the meeting was adjourned.\n\nRespectfully submitted, Elizabeth Wadsworth, Secretary\n\nAPPENDIX 3\nBOARD OF DIRECTORS DRAFT MINUTES\nNew Orleans Board Meeting\n\nTo: OpenMind Board Members\nFrom: Elizabeth Wadsworth\nDate: March 23, 1993\nHere are extensive notes from our meeting in New Orleans, February 5-6.\nsuggest the following as the best approach:\n- Scan the whole document for the items marked "**."

Can\'t\n"commission" stuff from outside. Have to do it from inside.\nOPEN MIND WAYS OF WORK\n\nGet stuff from people who are doing it. e.g.Evelyn to write policy statement\non Ethnic Studies. Frank to write policy on research centers.\nUse memberships more efficiently. Call on people to work on issues that they\nare already working on. Reconcile OM work and salaried work. Survey members.\nIf we have information on what people are doing, then we can go to persons to\nwork on their already existing specialty.\nMaybe best organization is to break down related,to salaried work. We still\nhave the need to examine these issues.\nHow to set priorities: Combine available interest, expertise, funding.\nIn any given period some PAGs (or other issue groups) would be dormant.\nOthers very active.\nPOLICY - HOST INSTITUTIONAL MEMBERS\n\nMake past OM conference host institutions permanent institutional\nmembers, e.g. SUNY at Stony Brook, Xavier, Universities of Colorado and\nNew Mexico\nPOLICY - LATINO/A\n\nLatino\xe2\x80\x94masculine only; OM will use "Latino/a, Latinos/as."\nPOLICY - MEMBERSHIP FORM\nMembership form: for fiscal year.

We are far apart. We are busy.\nHow best accumulate thoughts? How disseminate (take action)? What actions\nare we able to take? Who will do it? How keep us on the campuses?\nOM contribution brings together people in an ambience of learning,\ncollaboration, sharing.\nPapers in Albuquerque need to be processed. One document to include all.\nDo in collaborative way, among various groups who form our constituency. Make\nprovision for multi-ethnic, multi-cultural collaboration.\n\nOPENMIND Board of Directors Meeting, February 5-6, 1993 - New Orleans\nWhat is OM\'s contribution to influence? Bring groups together, asking them to\nwork beforehand on specific topic? Do we ask campuses to take on issues?\nWhat have we learned about OM\'s strength that we can build on to move forward,\nto build a base of influence? Look at organizations and institutions.\nWell organized opposition - we need to get members to press buttons so Pat\nRobertson is not getting all the air.\nOM situation is better with new the Clinton administration. At Stony Brook,\nthere\'s a surge from the right\xe2\x80\x94and a worrisome complacency on the left.\nMOTION: Retain PAGs. (Because they represent the principle of combining\npolicy\xe2\x80\x94based on information/research--and action, which may be of any\nappropriate kind. Aim was to focus work around significant and continuing\nissues, whatever might be the current form of need and response.)\nHistorically, the structure did not work in action. The action did not get\noff the ground between national meetings. Aimed at autonomy with central\nclearing. But action did not occur autonomously.\nPAG not the only way; not best way.\n\nOM needs other ways. (e.g. regional)\n\nEarly PAGs worked, because there were many meetings. Publication came out.\nCoalition and other meetings took place. When meetings stopped, action\nvirtually stopped. OM sought money for PAGs to keep meetings going.\nAt Albuquerque people asked for continuing work committees.\nWhatever we call PAGs, we have to take on responsibility.\nWhat kind of organizing at Board level can bring about action at campus level?\nNext three years: concentrate on assisting other groups that are having\nmeetings, e.g. On the West Coast, John Slaughter is doing diversity in\na new way that\'s interesting. OM could be additional sponsor. That\nfunction could bring its issues to that conference.\nIn Washington, we could become part of supporting organization and inject OM\'s\nideas and issues. Then we do not have the problem of spending finance\nand time to do national meetings, etc.\nEvaluate accomplishments in three years.\nThere\'s a role for OM specifically. If we don\'t do it, we diffuse our\norganizational effort.\n*\nOM is either an organization where empowerment of underrepresented is the\nissue, or we might as well go be voices of one in other organizations.\nPrincipal cut is our ethnic diversity. National reach is our niche.\nTo do nothing from national meeting to national meeting is a mistake. Using\nmembership and information, can have regional meetings.\n\n10\n\nAPPENDIX 4\nOPEN MIND NEWSLETTER\n\nThe Association for the Achievement of Cultural Diversity in Higher Education\n\nJan 1993 Vol. 1 No. 2\n\nOPENMIND 1993 AND BEYOND.\n\nDear Friends:\nWe would like to extend our\nmost sincere thanks to aH the individus\nok at the University of New Mexico\nwho organized the 1992\nOPENMIND meeting.

There was a feeling\nthat one could see the point where the\nearth meets thesky, and ifyou listened\ncarefully you could hear the silence in\nthe wind. It became clear that whatever our individual traditions, cultures or beliefs, on this earth we all\nbecome one in the circle of hfe. Our\nthanks to all those who came before us\nand for all those yet to come.\nOur thanks and appreciation\nwould not be complete without recognizing the time and energy Myma\nAdams, Immediate Past President,\nput into building OPENMIND.\nThank you. Myma for your unwavering commitment (and incessant\nprodding!) to creating a strong national organization dedicated to\nachieving diversity in higher education.\nTrevor L. Chandler\nPresident, OPENMIND\n\nThe second annual meeting of\nOPENMIND(C>ctDberl5-18)1992)brought\nover 65 members to Albuquerque, New\nMexico for 4 days of work, reflection and\nrejuvenation. The purpose of this year\'s\nmeeting was to clarify and sharpen the role of\nOPENMIND. Fiveworkgroupswereformed\nID evaluate our progress, set priorities for\nachieving our goals, anddevelop strategies to\nachieveand optimize diversity inhighereducation. Each group worked on die same\nquestionsandpresenteda report to rhe membership present at die meeting.\nThough each group approached rhe task\ndifferently, and recommendations about organizational structure, priorities and strategies varied widely, the overall mission and\nlong-range goals were reaffirmed.\n\nMISSION:\nOPENMINDexists to increase rhepresenceandinfluenceofculturallydiversescholars\xe2\x80\x94researchersand educators\xe2\x80\x94incolleges,\nprofessional schools and universities. It also\nstrives to challenge and broaden the canons\nof knowledge, scholarship and pedagogy,\ndirough vision, leadership and action. The\nfocus is on issues of die underrepresented,\nwomen and men, both in institutions and In\ndisciplines, and particularly oh those issues of\nconcern to African Americans, Native\nAmerican Indians, Asian and Pacific Americans, and Latinos.\n\nGOALS:\n1. To increase the numbers and die scholarly accomplishments of culturally diverse graduate and professional students\nand faculty by advocating for, guiding\nand facilitating their entry, retention\nand professional advancementinhigher\neducation.\n2. To explore mentoring and odier means\nby which faculty members can direcdy\nenhance successful scholarly commit-\n\nment and development of culturally diversegraduateandprofessional students.\n3.\n\nTo broaden disciplinary canons by devising strategies for die transformation\nof scholarship to include practice and\nteaching, in addition to discovery, as\nsources of knowledge.\n\n4- To illuminate omissions, errors and biases in die curriculum which distort,\ndiminish or deny die contributions of\npeoples of color to die development of\nknowledge.\n5. To foster research on the obstacles to\nfull participation of culturally diverse\npopulations in institutions of higher\neducation.\n6. To contribute to die development of\npublic policy at local, state and federal\nlevels related to die promotion of cultural diversity and culturally diverse\nscholarship in higher education.\n7. To increase rhe number of culturally\ndiverse decision makers at all levels of\nhigher education.\n8. To use or change die current system of\nincentives and rewards to bring African\nAmerican, American Indian, Asian and\nPacific American, and Latino men and\nwomen\xe2\x80\x94where diey are underrepresented\xe2\x80\x94into scholarly careers.\n9.\n\nTopromoteunderstandingandcollaboration among die groups we seek to\nserve in their quest for equity and justice.\n\n10. To define and realize die culturally diverse campus, one that is free of racist\nand prejudiced behavior diat negatively\naffects individuals and groups.\nThere was clear consensus mat die need\nfor OPENMIND continues to exist. One of\ndiekey strengths of OPENMIND is thefocus\ncontinued on page 2\n\nEducational Relations \xe2\x80\xa2 University of California \xe2\x80\xa2 300 Lakeside Drive \xe2\x80\xa2 Oakland, CA 94612-3550\nJoyce Justus, Editor; Nina Moore, Associate Editor \xe2\x80\xa2 (510) 987-9423 \xe2\x80\xa2 FAX (510) 987-9612\n\nOPEN MIND 1993\ncontinued from front page\non bringing together a multitude of voices,\nfrom many levels \xe2\x80\x94 graduate students, faculty, staff and administrators \xe2\x80\x94 and from\nmany institutions to work towards creating\nnew understandings about what it means to\nbe part of a multicultural society. It provides\na solid network andstrongsupport systemfor\nall those individuals and organizations attempting to affect change at the institutional\nlevel and move the diversity agenda forward.\nOPENMIND has established and continues\nto foster among its members a community of\nsupportive and caring individuals.\nHowever, thediscussionsandwork group\nreports indicated a need for significant structural changes in order to accomplish our\norganizational mission and programmatic\ngoals. The discussion about organizational\nstructure centered around the Policy Action\nGroups (PAGs); and the overriding challenge of maintaining a national organization, responsive to broad national issues,\nwhile simultaneously responding to and affecting real change at the regional, local, and\ncampus levels.\nThe original PAG groups were Access\nand Outreach, Mentoring and the Development of Scholars, The New Scholarship and\nCurriculum Change, Incentives and Reward\nSystems, andCross-CulturalEducation. The\nissues around which these groups were organized remain important in furthering\nOPENMIND\'s diversity agenda. It is not\nclear, however, that the PAG structure is\neffective for action and dissemination of\nwork, or for responding to national and local\nconcerns. If OPENMIND is to "achieve\ncultural diversity in higher education" we\nmust not only be able to act both locally and\nglobally, we must also be able to generate and\ndisseminate scholarly and relevant material\nabout diversity and multiculturalism, provide forums which bring all voices into the\ndiscussion.andprovideactiveleadershipand\nconsultation for institutions of higher education.\nIn an effort to respond to regional concerns within the national network, during\nthe final business meeting we met in loosely\nformulated regional groups to discuss local\nneeds, the feasibility of some kind of regional\nstructure, and how to further the work of\nOPENMIND at all levels. The regionsNortheast, West, South/Southeast, Midwest\xe2\x80\x94were formed based on those areas\n\nrepresented by memberspresentat this meeting. Theregionswerenotintendedtorepresent all the OPENMIND membership, but\nrather to serve as a starting point to begin\norganizing regional discussions. Regional\ncontacts from each of the four areas were\nidentified to facilitate regional discussions\xe2\x80\x94\nNortheast: Deborah Carter(Arnerican Council on Education) and Elizabeth Wadsworth\n(Consultant); West: Evelyn Hu-DeHart\n(University of Colorado, Boulder) and Joyce\nJustus (University of California, Officeof the\nPresident); South/Southeast: WilliamHarvey\n(North Carolina State University) and\nDereck Rovaris (Xavier University); and\nMidwest: Jean Strandness (North Dakota\nState University).\nA number of other issues, very much in\nline with the original goals, emerged from the\ngroup reports and discussions about\nOPENMIND as an organizan\'on, where we\nhave been, and where we are going. An\ninterim board was appointed and charged\nwith the task of analyzing the issues which\nwere raised by the reports submitted by each\nwork group. They will recommend structural\nchanges and develop a plan for future activities. The following is a sample of some of the\ncommon themes which emerged over the\nfour days of our meeting.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThereisaneedformorefacultyinvolvement in the organization. In order to\naffect real change at the campus level\nfaculty must be included in our work.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nActive support for graduate students.\nOPENMIND members can support the\nacademic needs and retention of the\ngraduate students on their campuses.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nConnecting with odier "like-minded"\norganizations. Building coalitions with\nexisting groups toaddresscommonneeds\nis important in furthering the overall\ngoals of OPENMIND and can serve to\nstrengthen responses to national and/or\nregional concerns.\n,\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nDeveloping more effective intra- and\ninter-group communication. It is vitally\nimportant that we foster an environment conducive to sharing ideas and\npromoting understanding within and\namong the groups which make up\nOPENMIND.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nMore frequent interaction. One annual\nmeeting is not sufficient to further the\nOPENMIND agenda.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAssess and disseminate information\nabout current-successful diversity ini-\n\ntiatives. It would be useful to have an\ninventory of work currendy going on.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nDevelopanddisseminatematerialsabout\ndiversity.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nOPENMIND needs a structure and\nmechanism which will allow us to respond to and influence national concerns and issues in an organized political\nvoice.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCreate a new, common language. As an\norganization with diverse voices,\nOPENMIND can help define and develop the discourse on diversity.\n\nParticipantsatthisyear\'smeeting worked\nextremely hard. The work group discussions\nwere rich, sometimes contentious, but always reflected a very real commitment to\nmoving OPENMIND to the forefront of\ndiversity efforts nationwide. In addition, the\nopportunity to come together around a common goal helped each of us refocus our energy, put our individual work in perspective,\nand recognize that we are each part of a larger\nwhole. As Rudy Anaya said in his keynote\naddress, an open mind is the hardest position\nof clarity to reach. He also reminded us to\ndefine our own destinies, to make sure our\nnames are spelled correctly, to share our\ncommunities, and to insure that our voices\nare heard. Though we came from many\ninstitutions and are of many colors, there was\na circle which bound our efforts. We must\ncontinue to use our strength as individuals to\nbuild and promote all that OPENMIND is\nand will be.\n\nFor more information contact:\nGeneral Information:\nTrevor L.

Jojola, Ph.D-\'\nNative American Studies\nUniversity of New Mexico\n\n"Justashow! TheSouthwestisihegreat\nplayground of the white American. The\ndesertisn\'tgoodforanythingelse. Butitdoes\nmake a fine national playground. And the\nIndian, with his long hair and his bits of\npottery and blankets and clumsy home-made\ntrinkets, he\'s a wonderful live toy to play\nwith. More fun than keeping rabbits, and\njustas harmless. Wonderful, really, hopping\nroundwithasnakemhismouth. Lotsoffun!\nOh the wild west is lots of fun: the Land of\nEnchantment. . . " (D.H. Lawrence, Just\nBack from the Snake Dance, Sept. 1924 [m\nWeigk: 1989}).\nWith the adventof leisure and the tour.ing class, New Mexico has always been a\nfocus of the itinerant traveler. See America\nFirst and the Southwest Wonder Land were\ncredos which resounded in a 1925 introductory chapter of Mesa, Canon and Pueblo.\nWritten by an adventurer, Charles Fletcher\nLu mmis, these apdy summarized an epoch of\nearly tourism and image-building in New\nMexico. Paramount in this imagery were the\nnumerous American Indian communities\nthat inhabited the region.\nWhat was rather curious about this period was that there were two distinctive and\noften parallel aspects of this "Indian" imagemaking. One was promulgated by social\nscientists in the fields of anthropology, ethnography, and history. The other was developed by entrepreneurs of the tourism and\nfilm industry. Among social scientists, New\nMexicobecamea"livinglaboratory." Among\nentrepreneurs, New Mexico became a \'living backdrop." In both instances, however,\nthe investigations were dominated by outsiders who were looking for their own affirma. tion of a primitive and exotic humanscape.\nThe common denominators were the\nApache, Navajo and Pueblo peoples, but\neach outside group formulated its own images of what American Indians were. In\n1880, for example, historian and anthrorv^1r,m<;r-ArlnlfRrmdclicr wrote of the Indians\n\nat Santo Domingo Pueblo: "The women are\nsmall, and commonly ugly; the men taller,\nand not very handsome" (Lange 1966: 97).\nSimilarly in 1912, movie directorD.W.\nGriffith, smitten with the Southwest said\nthat "the Isleta pueblo offered some of the\nfinest scenic opportunities ever put into a\npicture..., thebestsettinghehadeverseenfor\nthe enactment of Biblical or western plays,\nespecially Indian plays" (NMSFC 1970:8).\nBoth observations were intended to be\nwide sweeping and all encompassing. In the\nface of the exotic and primitive, tfieoutsider\ndraws on their own preconceptions and experiences to sdectivelyappropriate elements\nof the "Indian." The consequent image may\nbe a sub] ecti ve interpretation, the purpose of\nwhich is to corroborate the outsider\'s viewpoint. This process is called revisionism and\nit, more often than not, entails remaking\nAmerican Indians apart and separate from\ntheir own social and community realities.\nThe dominant Indian image or stereotype, of course, is thewar-bonnet, facepainted\nand buckskin clad "chief." This image was\npopularized by the paintings commissioned\nby the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway in the 1900s and, with the transfer of a\npopular stereotype into the Southwestern\ncontext, a mystification of the local cultures\nwas achieved (Rodriguez 1989: 77). The\nSouthwest Indian myth was invented in order to create an "amusement" landscape.\nNew Mexico suddenly became populated\nwith rattlesnakes, howling coyotes, Indian\nchiefs, and outlaws and the scenery became\nreminiscent of a large outdoor stage bounded\nby railroad trades (Weigle 1989:130).\n*\nThe impact of such revisionism among\nthe American Indians in New Mexico was\nappreciable. Many natives catered exdusively to the "Indian chief\' image and, for\nyears, social scientists voiced their concerns\nover the disappearance of native traditions\nand culture. By the time the U.S. Congress\ninterceded with the creation of the Indian\nArts & Crafts Board in 1935, many native\nartisans were engaged in creating inferior,\ncheap souvenirs or operating stamp-dye machines for the fabricators of mass-marketed\n"Indian made" replicas (Schrader 1983:53).\n\nBut at the same time that the social\nscientists promulgated laws to protect the\nnative craftspeople from commercial exploitation, they also used their scholarship to\ndevelop exacting standards of "authenticity." The movement for authenticity was\ntied into a mission to "preserve" archaic\nmethods and techniques. The ensuing policies, however, were formulated behinddoseddoors without input from the native\ncraftspeople themselves. As a consequence,\nstandards of tribal artistic aesthetics were\nestablished\xe2\x80\x94which often had little to do\nwith the internal standards of the tribal community\xe2\x80\x94and institutions such as the Southwestern Association on Indian Affairs were\nestablished to promote these.1\nIn contrast to the rigidity of these artificial standards, New Mexico, which has a\ncomplex pluralistic human settlement history, is characterized by subde cultural transformations and the constant adaptation of\nnew artistic traditions among distinct communities. Many of these transformations\nhave emerged from the interaction of diverse\nAnglo, Hispanic, and American Indian communities. The ability of people and their\ncommunities to adapt outside traditions has\nbeen ignored as a result of the imposition of\npolicy designed to regulate "genuine" Indian-made items. Recentexperimentsamong\nnative artists to employ genre other than\nturquoise, silver, wool, watercolor, and clay\nhave usually been shunned as "unauthentic."3\nThe Southwest Indian mystique has\nbecome so pervasive that the average tourist\nexpects the word "authentic" to imply that\ndnenativeartisthasusedapick and shovel to\nprocure the raw materials that went into the\nitem. At the same time, there continue to be\nother troublesome aspects concerning the\npromotion of the Southwest Indian mystique. Among these are the inconsistent\nstandards used to determine rheaurhenticity\nof Indian items.

JENKINS\n\nBackground\n\nInstitute Objectives\n\nThe Western Interstate Commission for\nHigher Education (W1CHE) is a public, interstate agency established in 1953 to promote\nresource sharing, collaboration, and planning\namong the western states and their colleges\nand universities. Since theearly 1980s, WICHE\nhas worked with state and educational\npolicymakers to increase the understanding of\nthe West\'s changing demographics and to encourage state and institutional efforts to improve the educational success of\nunderrepresented ethnic minority students.\nWICHE serves 15 states including: Alaska,\nArizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho,\nMontana, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, Soudi Dakota, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming.\n\nThe major emphases of the Institute\non Ethnic Diversity are to:\n\nWICHE recognizes that colleges and universities in die West want and need to do a\nbetter job of recruiting diverse student and\nfaculty populations and graduating more minority students. In response, WICHE has\ndeveloped the Institute on Ethnic Diversity.\nThe Institute on Ethnic Diversity is designed\nto assist colleges and universities through an\ninteractive, participatory, campus-based process to develop and to build strategic diversity\nplans and initiatives.\n\n3) Assist the campus community in creating dialogue and effective communication about diversity;\n\nProject Goal\n\n5) Assist a campus-wide leadership team\nin developing a strategic plan which\nwill define diversity as an institutional\naction priority, address resource allocation, oudine what strategies should\nbe initiated, and establish an implementation schedule; and,\n\nWICHE\'s goal in creating thelnstituteon\nEthnic Diversity is to foster a comprehensive\nstrategic planning process at colleges and universities which will stimulate change in institutional culture and environment. The processdevelops multicultural communitieswhich\nstrengthen and sustain ethnic minority participation and achievement.\nThe Institute isdesigned toinfluenceboth\ntheacademicandadministrativeenvironments\nat institutions and involves representatives\nfrom the entire campus community. The primary participants are presidents and other top\nadministrators; selected faculty, staff and students; and governing board members. The\ncritical role of faculty in ethnic minority student retention and graduation is emphasized\nand addressed.\nBeyond single institutions, the Institute facilitates the joint participation and networking of\nteams of key leaders from several colleges and\nuniversities which share a common governance\nstructure or institutional character within a state.\nPACE 3\n\n1) Help campuses locally define and better understand the conceptof diversity\nas a value that relates to and is a central\nelement of institutional mission; and\nrefine the institution\'s mission, values,,\nand goals in a manner that supports\nstudents, faculty, and staff from diverse ethnic populations;\n2) Prepare the campus community for\naccepting and working with change\nthrough aprocess diatprovides knowledge and understanding, identifies expectations, andimproyes intercultural\nrelations;\n\n4) Define multiculturalism within the institutional context as an essential element to effectively increase the recruitment, retention and graduation\nof underrepresented ethnic minority\nstudents, as well as to attract and hold\nethnic faculty, staff, and administrators;\n\n6) Prepare die campus community to use\nconflict resolution as a learning tool\nand problem solving mechanism as\ndie diversity action plan is developed\nand when intercultural disputes and\nodier controversies arise.\nFor more information on die Institute\non Ethnic Diversity, please contact:\nSuzanne Benally\nDirector, Institute on Edinic Diversity\nWestern Interstate Commission for\nHigher Education (WICHE)\nP.O.

JENKINS was\nnamed as the first Director of die newly\nestablished Office of Senate Fair Employment Practices, effective June 1,1992. In diat\nrole she will administer processes that review\nallegations ofprohibiteddiscriminationpractices; and she will implement programs for\nthe Senate to heighten awareness of employee rights in order to prevent violations\nfrom occurring.\nPrior to being named to die new position, Dr. Jenkins served for 18 years as Assistant Administrator for Equal Opportunity\nPrograms at the National Aeronautics and\nSpace Administration (NASA). In diat\nposition, she was responsible for helping\nNASA integrate its workforce and for ensuring equal opportunity in personnel transactions and in the utilization of NASA\'s resources.\nBefore being appointed by NASA in\n1974, Dr. Jenkins was a consultant to the\nDistrict of Columbia school system for die\nResponse to Educational Needs Project for\nabout 4 months, beginning in late 1973.\nPrior to that, she served for 19 years as a\npublic school educator in Berkeley, CA, entering as a teacher and rising through die\nranks to vice-principal, principal, and Director of Elementary Education before reaching\nthe post of Assistant Superintendent for Instruction in 1971.\nDuring her professional career, Dr.\nJenkins has served as an officer or key member of numerous professional organizations.\nShe has been an expert on matters of integration of schools andon in-service programs for\nteachers.\nShe has been a leading participant in a\nnumber of national conferences and projects\non civil rights, education, human relations\nand public administration. She also has\nserved as an editorial and educational consultant.\nDr. Jenkins has received numerous\nawards, including die Honorary Service\nAward Certificate from die California Congress of Parents and Teachers in Special\nrecognition of outstanding.service to children and youdi and a commendation by die\nCalifornia State Assembly foranoutstanding\nrecord in die field of public education \xe2\x80\x94\ncontinued on page 6\n\nPRECEDING PAGE BLANK NOT FILMED\n\niXICO\nute equally to such revisionism.\nYet in spite of such dire circumstances,\nthe American Indian people and their communitiescontinue to prosper. Partof thiscan\nbe attributed to the maintenance of their\nland base, or Indian reservations. By and\nlarge, however, it has been the maintenance\nof acommunitycontextwithin this land base\nthat has maintained the cultural integrity of\nthe American Indians in the Southwest\nThe propensity of the New Mexico Indian\ncommunities to share the genuine expression of their cultures is what has elevated a\ndemographic minority\xe2\x80\x94134355 American\nIndians inNew Mexico constituting8.9% of\nthe total New Mexico population\xe2\x80\x94into the\neconomic majority (with cultural tourism\ncited as being the largest factor in New\nMexico\'s business economy).4\nThe irony in this situation is that American Indians play an invisible or non-existent\nrole in controlling this industry. Whereas\nnon-Indian communities like Sedona, Arizona, and Santa Fe, New Mexico, procure\nthe bulk of their commerce upon the merchandising of authentic Indian arts, very\nlittle of this marketing-hype is present in the\ntribal communities. Instead, the tribal communities are witness to pockets of poverty\nand their laborforce isprimarily employed by\nthegovemmentsector. Infact,artsandcrafts\nare seen as supplemental income activities.\nItems traditionally produced by native artisans as utilitarian wares are now rarely retained in their own communities for such\npurposes.\nPart of this situation, however, is intentional. The more culturally "conservative"\nthe tribal community, the more apt they are\nto prohibit the commercial marketing of\nIndian items by their own tribal members on\nthe reservation. Although this has less to do\nwith the actual wares themselves, it often\ndoes entail the use of designs and images.\nUnlike the medium, some designs and images do maintain religious and symbolic sig.nificance in the community.5\nSimilarly tribal people have, by in large,\nresented and rejected being the living laboratories and the backdrops for non-Indians.\'\nAmerican Indian communities have been\nPACE 5\n\nhospitable to non-Indians during public ceremonies, but only on the condition that\nvisitors leave only \'footprints." Tribal members are prohibited from divulging knowledge of tribal customs and religion to outsiders, especially anthropologists. In some communities, photography isprohibited entirely.\nIn others, certain sites are restricted from\npublic access and view.7\nThe result of such practices has been the\ntemperament of social norms in the community. Social scientists have attributed this\nphenomenon as an ability of native people to\nco-exist in both a tribal and non-tribal world.\nThis "dualism" has resulted in the reservation becoming a sort of refuge by its native\nresidents from the outside. Hence, in the\nabsence of overt marketing and commercialism, thereservationanditsbounded communities have minimized or isolated themselves\nfrom outside enterprises. In a larger sense,\nthe place becomes "spiritual," and such spiritualism is an integral part of the migration\namenity of living there (Moss 1991:3).\nBy and large, however, practices designed to regulate outside commercialism of\ntribal cultural heritage within the reservations have been largely informal. What\nappears to be the most challenging aspect of\nAmerican Indian issues in New Mexico today is how the tribes themselves will cope\nwith the regulation of their own tourist enterprises, should they so choose. This is a\nrelatively new phenomenon and comes as\nthe result of an attempt by tribal governments to diversify their economies. For\ninstance, both the Pueblos of Zuni and\nPojoaque have begun planning on the development and construction of their own tribal <\nmuseums.8\nThe central question that remains to be\nanswered is whether American Indian communities will defer to the same revisionist\nimages that have been ascribed by the outside. As "insiders," how much cultural information will they be willing to divulge and\nunder what pretext? How will they "revise"\ntheir own image, while at the same time\ncoping with the same issues that confront\nconservators today? Will they allow themselves to continue to be "living museums" or\nwill they choose to stage pageants and reen-\n\nactments designed to shroud their real community presence and deflect tourism away\nfrom their private lives? By addressing these\nand other important questions, they will undoubtedly be able to both demystify the &dian mystique and contribute in the revision\nof the prevailing stereotypes of the Southwest Indian.\n\nNotes\n1\n\nDr. Jojola is Director of Native American Studies and is\nan Associate Professor of Planning in the School of\nArchitecture and Planning, University of New Mexico.\nHe is an enrolled member of the Pueblo of Isleta and\nresides there with his family. This research article was\nprepared for the 1992 Folklife Program, Smithsonian\nInstitution, Washington, D.C.. (Draft 5/26/92)\n\'As seen by a new Congressional Act entitled Expanding\nthe Powers of the Indian Arts and Crafts Board which\ncontains precise regulations pertaining to the certification of American Indian artists, such policies are soil in\nevidence today (P.L. 101-644, 1990). See an article\nentitled Mixing Politics and Art for a brief history of the\nSouthwestern Association on Indian Affairs (Ziba/t 1990).\n\'An Interesting example of this involved Pueblo Indian\nartist, Tony Jojola, whose medium is glass. Apprenticed\nat the Pilcnuck glass foundry he was originally refused a\nshow of his glassware at the All Indian Pueblo Cultural\nCenter. The curators died "unauthenticity*on the basis\nof the medium. Today, his glassware has been acquired\nfor the Cultural Center\'s museum, but only after he\nattained prominence in the Southwest art market (personal correspondence).\n\'1990 Census of Population and Housing, U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census. In 1990,\ntourism was estimated to be a $2.3 billion dollar industry\nIn New Mexico employing 53,000 people in the state\n(Ditmer: 1991).\n\'Recently the tribal council at the Pueblo of Acoma, at\nthe prompting of religious leaders, prohibited its tribal\nmembers from producing carvings or any other arts\ndepicting katchinas. This prohibition has alienated\nsome members of the community who are contesting\nthat this action inhibits their "freedom of artistic expression\' (personal correspondence).\n\'In 1987 (?), the petroglyphs surrounding the community\nof the Pueblo of Acoma became backdrops to the\nswlmsuit dad contestants of the Miss USA Pageant.\nShortly thereafter, the area was hit by a series of severe\nstorms. The elders interpreted this as an omen arising\nfrom the commercial desecration of the petroglyphs\n(personal correspondence).\nThese prohibitions are resurrected annually, usually\nunder the guise of "tourist etiquette." See, for example.\nan extensive editorial of this issue by loseph Suina who.\nhimself, is a member of the Pueblo of Cochiti (Suina\n1991).\n\xe2\x80\xa2Such proposals, though, are notwithout controversy. A\nJoint agreement by the U.S. National Park Service and\nthe Zunl tribe to establish national monuments inside the\nreservation was rejected by a tribal citizen referendum in\n1990. The vote was forced by religious leaders and the\nU.S. Congress subsequently passed other legislation\ngiving Zuni leaders four more years to negotiate another\nagreement (Rosales 1990).\n\nPRECED1NG PAGE\n\n.ued on page 8\n\nWOT\n\nOPENMIND BUSINESS\ncontinued from page 7\n\nAmerican Indian Representations\ncontinued from page 5\n\nMembership\n\nReferences Cited\n\nThe following membership categories\nwere adopted for 1993.\n\nDinner, J., 1991, New Mexico Changing; Inwading Tourists can Sometimes Destroy Area\'s\nHistoric and Cultural Values.

One very practical way to do this is\npromote and support greater recruitment and retentionofgraduatestudents involved in mulncutural\nresearch as well as greater diversity of peoples\nwithin the sciences. Additionally, graduate students in this area need greater support to continue\nand complete their studies. Academic retention\nand propulsion depends on the understanding,\nretention, and promotion of cultural microcosms\nwithin a university. Too many people of color\nwithdraw from school because the cultural macrocosm of "whiteness" is constantly attempting to\ndrown any vestige of cultural microcosms. Open\nMind can help support the lifespan of cultural\nmicrocosm through the support of graduate students and diversity of peoples.\nThe support of graduate students would seem\nto be a practical application of the philosophy\nrepresentedbyOpenMind. If we focus on graduate\nstudent success, from this pool we can recruit faculty and, hence, from this pool of faculty we can\nspawn administrators. Thus, we have growing\nupward mobility, nurtured and harvested in the reeducation of the educational system. We do not\nbelieve the "trickle-down" theory to be as effective.\nMoreover, we would like to see Open Mind\nrecognize die diversity of voices and discourse styles\nwidiin its own membership: That greater understanding only comes through greater communication. OpenMindneedstorepresenttheideasofall.\nTo do this botiS the organization and group meetings needs to operate so that all peoples present\nhave a chance to voice their ideas and that all voices\nare heard. Additionally, the ideas of all need to be\ntreated with courtesy and respect.\nFinally, we would like to see Open Mind\nexplore all avenues of possible communication to\nbring about change, whether this be federal officials, admi nistra tors, facul ty, potential students from\nbarrios, reservations, or inner cities, etc. We need\nto understand everyone\'s language.\nIn order to facilitate the implementation of\noSese ideas, we suggest the appointment of a graduate student to die executive committee. We nominate Fred Martinez, Maria Big Boy, and Natalia\nVasey.\nEDITOR\'S NOTE: The graduate students preserved this letter to themembershipat the 1992 meeting.\nNauJaa Vasey was appointed to the interim board of\ndirectors. It is the intention o/OPENMIND to insure\ncontinued graduate student representation in all organiyuional activities.\nPACE 7\n\nNew Officers\nDuring the 1992 business meeting, therecommendationsof the nominating\ncommittee were accepted for the offices of President and President-elect. The\nTreasurer and Secretary serve for two years. Elections for those two offices will\nbe held at the 1993 annual meeting of OPENMIND.\nDr. Trevor L.

All five programs are funded\nwholly or in part by the Federal Government.\nMAP is a six (6) week summer program\nfor juniors and seniors in high school designed to provide for pre-college preparation and a meaningful work-related experience in a scientific research laboratory. Approximately 50% of the work week is spent\nin classroom-like interaction and the remaining 50% on a research project. Apprentices are paid $4.25/hour for participating in MAP and residence hall room costs\nand meals (Monday-Friday) are paid by die\nprogram. Since the University Food Service is closed on the weekends, students are\nresponsible for their own meals on Saturdays and Sundays. Recreational activities\nare scheduled for several weekends during\nthe six (6) week program. Attheendofthe\nprogram students are expected to give a\nreport on their research project.\nMBRS is a college level program for\nstudents interested in a biomedical/healdi\n\nscience career.

The rapidly changing world in which we live, especially with respect to\nits increasing awareness of its multi-cultural nature and its ethnic composition, is\nrequiring educational institutions to reevaluate their curriculum offerings and\nmake the necessary changes.

One very\npractical way to do this is promote and support greater recruitment\nand retention of graduate students involved in multicutural research\nas well as greater diversity of peoples within the sciences.\nAdditionally, graduate students in this area need greater support to\ncontinue and. complete their studies. Academic retention and\npropulsion depends on the understanding, retention, and promotion of\ncultural microcosms within a university. Too many people of color\nwithdraw from school because the cultural macrocosm of\n"whiteness" is constantly attempting to drown any vestige of\ncultural microcosms. Open Mind can help support the lifespan of\ncultural microcrosm through the support of graduate students and\ndiversity of peoples.\nThe support of graduate students would seem to be a practical\napplication of the philosophy represented by Open Mind. If we focus\non graduate student success, from this pool we can recruit faculty\nand, hence, from this pool of faculty we can spawn administrators.\nThus, we have growing upward mobility, nurtured and harvested in\nthe re-education of the educational system. We do not believe the\n"trickle-down" theory to be as effective.\nMoreover, we would like to see Open Mind recognize the diversity of\nvoices and discourse styles within its own membership: That\ngreater understanding only comes through greater communication.\nOpen Mind needs to represent the ideas of all. To do this both the\norganization and group meetings needs to operate so that all peoples\npresent have a chance to voice their ideas and that all voices are\nheard. Additionally, the ideas of all need to be treated with\ncourtesy and respect.\nFinally, we would like to see Open Mind explore all avenues of\npossible communication to bring about change, whether this be\nfederal officials, administrators, faculty, potential students from\nbarrios, reservations, or inner cities, etc. We need to understand\neveryone\'s language.\n\nIn order to facilitate the implementation of these ideas, we suggest\nthe appointment of a graduate student to the executive committee.\nWe nominate Fred Martinez, Maria Big Boy, and Natalia Vasey.\n\nAPPENDIX 7\nEXAMPLE OF A SPONSORED PUBLICATION\n\nramirez\n\n10/7/92 1:47 PM\n\npage 1\n\nAchieving the Pluralistic University:\nStrategies and Approaches to the\nRecruitment and Retention of Ethnic\nPlurality Faculty\n\nw\n\nAlbert Ramirez\nAssociate Vice Chancellor for Faculty Affairs\nUniversity of Colorado at Boulder\n\nrameriz interior\n\n10/7/92 1:47 PM\n\nPage 1\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis project was partially supported by funds\nprovided by the program "Presidential Funds to\nSupport the Recruitment and Retention of\nMinority and Women Faculty" at the University of\nColorado, as well as by the office of the Vice\nChancellor for Academic Affairs, University of\nColorado at Boulder.\n\n\xc2\xa91992.

The Concept of Pluralism\nBefore a meaningful discussion on the topic of\nthe pluralistic university can be held, it is necessary\nto have some common understanding regarding\nthe meaning and definition of the term "pluralism." The term is used extensively in the social\nsciences and in the field of education. It is used,\nnot infrequently, by politicians and other leaders\nin their affirmations that we live in a pluralistic\nsociety, although rarely do these individuals clearly\nand succinctly define or describe what they mean\nby such a society. It should not be too surprising\nthat such a widely used term as pluralism has a\nvariety of meanings and multiple usages in the\npopular press and among different segments of\nthe population in this country. What is more surprising, however, is that multiple and often vague\nmeanings and definitions also typify much of the\nsocial science treatment of this term.\nThe purpose of this introductory section is to\npresent a conceptual basis for and an operational\ndefinition of pluralism. The model proposed\nutilizes the social psychological principles of\ninterracial group contact and interaction as a\nframework for defining and conceptualizing a\npluralistic system and its antithesis, a monolithic\nsystem. Basically, a pluralistic system is one whose\ncomponents foster positive interracial relationships, while a monolithic system is one whose\ncomponents foster negative interracial relationships.\nResearch in the area of interracial relations has\nshown that:\n1. Interracial contact, by itself, does not necessarily\nlead to positive relations among groups (Triandis,\n1988; Amir, 1969).\n2. Interracial contact, under certain conditions,\ncan lead to positive changes in attitudes and\nbehaviors (Hawley & Smylie, 1988; Amir, 1969;\nPetti grew, 1974).\n\nrameriz interior\n\n10/7/92 1:47 PM\n\nPage 2\n\n3. Interracial contact is most likely to lead to\npositive outcomes when the groups:\na. possess equal status in the interactive setting\nb. share and seek common and superordinate\ngoals\nc. are cooperatively interdependent\nd. interact with each other informally and on a\nmore intimate level\ne. interact with the positive support of authority\nfigures, leaders, laws, or customs\nf. interact under conditions in which there is a\nlow level of authoritarianism and ethnocentrism\n(Allport, 1954; Cook, 1984, 1985; Farley, 1982;\nJohnson and Johnson, 19S5,-Sherif et al., 1961;\nWilliams, 1964; Adorno et al., 1950; Meloen et\nal., 1988)\nBased on the literature on interracial group relations, the model presented here identifies ten\ncomponents that may be utilized to characterize a\nsystem along the monolithic-pluralistic dimension.\n(See Table I.) These components are not meant to\nbe either exhaustive or mutually exclusive. Most,\nin fact, are interrelated. These ten components of\na general system have been described in earlier\nwork (Ramirez, 1990a) and have been analyzed as\nwell with respect to a university system (Ramirez,\n1990b).\nThe model represents an attempt to formulate a\nconceptual and an operational definition of pluralism. It is based on a theoretical framework that is\nderived from an extensive body of social psychological research. It has the potential for the\nanalysis of and application in a number of settings,\nparticularly those that are open to study and that\nare receptive to the development of intervention\nstrategies \xe2\x80\x94 and to possible social change. It is\nhoped that the university is an example of such a\nsetting.\n\nrameriz interior\n\n10/7/92 1:47 PM\n\nPage 3\n\nTable I\nDifferences Between Pluralistic and Monolithic Systems\nPluralistic System\n\nMonolithic System\n\n1.

The Ten Characteristics\nof a Pluralistic University\nWhen the ten components of a pluralistic\nsystem are applied to a university (Ramirez,\n1990b), a pluralistic university can be defined as\none in which \xe2\x80\x94 with respect to its faculty, its staff\nand administrators, and its students \xe2\x80\x94 there is:\n1. A significant representation of the multiple\nethnic, racial, and cultural groups that make up\nour society.\nIn a pluralistic university, you see students from\ndifferent social, ethnic, and cultural backgrounds.\nThe proportion to which these groups are to be\nfound on campus is higher than their proportion\nin the total population. In the university\'s offices,\nlaboratories, and classrooms, you see faculty, staff,\nand administrators who are ethnic pluralities. A\nreview of the university\'s policies and practices\nclearly indicates that the institution is committed\ntoward recruiting faculty, staff, and students from\nthe multiple ethnic and racial groups of our society. These practices are evident in the institution\'s\nadmissions and standards policies, precollegiate\nprograms, student recruitment strategies, and\nfaculty/staff recruitment, retention, and development programs.\n2. Extensive contact and interaction among these\ndifferent ethnic groups on campus.\nIn a pluralistic university, you see students from\nthe multiple ethnic and racial groups interacting\nand associating with one another \xe2\x80\x94 in the student\ncenter, in the recreation center, in the classroom,\nin the dormitories, in the various clubs and student organizations. You see staff and faculty from\ndifferent ethnic and cultural backgrounds interacting with one another as well. An analysis of the\nuniversity\'s policies and practices indieates that\nthe institution has developed and implemented\ninnovative programs that foster meaningful experiences among the various ethnic and racial groups\n\xe2\x80\x94 housing and dormitory policies, curriculum\nplanning and revision, as well as the nature of the\nclassroom experience.\n\nrameriz interior \xe2\x80\xa2 10/7/92 1:47 PM\n\nPage 5\n\n3. Extensive opportunity for the different cultural\ngroups to learn about one another\'s cultures, values, and customs.\nA pluralistic university provides extensive opportunity for different ethnic and racial groups to\nlearn about one another\'s cultures, values, and\ncustoms. The extent to which a university is committed to providing such opportunities can be\nassessed by observing its commitment to ethnic\nstudies programs, multicultural education and\nresearch, curriculum planning and revision focusing on multicultural perspectives, cross-cultural\nawareness workshops, and projects in the classroom and other settings.\n4. An equal power relationship among the\nmultiple groups.\nIn a pluralistic university, members of ethnic\nplurality groups are in positions of student, faculty,\nand administrative leadership: power and leadership patterns are not related to race or ethnicity.\nPlurality faculty and administrators are in an equal\npower position to articulate and to define the\ngoals, values, and mission of the institution,\nincluding what constitutes legitimacy and excellence in research, scholarship, teaching, and\nservice. The multicultural perspectives that ethnic\npluralities bring to the institution are not seen as\nperipheral but rather as central to what the university is about.\n5. A relationship among the multiple cultural\ngroups that is informal and personal and that\nextends over a number of different contexts and\nsettings.\nIn a pluralistic university, members of the academic community are very likely to have friendships\nand close interpersonal relationships with other\nindividuals independent of their race or ethnicity.\nContact and interaction are not limite*d to the\nstructured setting of the office, the classroom, or\nthe committee/departmental meeting but extend\nto the more personal and intimate settings that\ncharacterize friendships and collegiality.\n\nrameriz interior\n\n10/7/92 1:47 PM\n\nPage 6\n\n6. A relationship that is cooperative and collaborative and based on mutually compatible goals.\n\nIn a pluralistic university, ethnic pluralities and\nothers share the same goals and values and recognize that the most effective way to reach these\nsuperordinate goals is by mutual cooperation and\ncollaboration. The different ethnic, racial, and cultural groups are in a positively interdependent\nrelationship \xe2\x80\x94 they can best reach their mutually\nshared goals by each contributing to and helping\nin the total effort.\n7. A hierarchy and stratification within the\nuniversity that is independent of race, ethnicity, or\ncultural group membership.\n\nIn a pluralistic university, tfie- decision-making\nstructure, the allocation of existing resources, and\nall the other indices of power are not stratified or\ndistributed along ethnic and racial dimensions. If\na truly equal-power interracial relationship exists,\nthen the patterns of subordination-domination\nand negative interdependence are minimal or\nnonexistent.\n8. A normative system that is pluralistic (as\ndefined by these ten points) and that is sanctioned\nby institutional supports (policies, customs,\nvalues) and by the institutional leadership and\nauthority structure.\n\nThe policies, practices, and norms of a pluralistic\nuniversity are themselves pluralistic, and they are\narticulated and implemented by the institutional\nleadership and authority structure. It is an easy\ntask for the President or Chancellor to publicly\nstate the university\'s commitment to pluralism and\ncultural diversity. In a pluralistic university, however, these pronouncements are translated into\nspecific and concrete actions, programs, and policies at every level of the university.\n9. A multiple ethnic and cultural perspective\nin the analysis and understanding of the human\nexperience.\n\nIn a pluralistic university, the human condition is\nanalyzed and conceptualized from a variety of eth-\n\nrameriz interior\n\n10/7/92 1:47 PM\n\nPage 7\n\nnic and cultural perspectives. Reality is not defined\nfrom the prescriptions and values of only one ethnic, racial, or cultural group. Ethnic plurality\nfaculty all have the same freedom and are given\nthe same legitimacy to observe, study, and interpret from their own cultural perspectives and\nexperiences. Truth is not the exclusive domain of\nany one ethnic or racial group, and in fact it may\nmore effectively be reached through the analysis of\nmultiple perspectives than through the analysis of\njust one. This freedom and diversity concerning\nmodes of inquiry is found in the classroom, in the\ncurriculum, and in the arenas of research and\nscholarship.\n10. An institutional structure that promotes\nmulticulturalism and cultural diversity.\nA pluralistic university has ethnic studies programs or departments as well as a curriculum and\nresearch agenda that promote multiculturalism\nand cultural diversity. The curriculum, instructional strategies and approaches, and research and\nscholarly agenda of a pluralistic institution are not\nbased on either academic colonialism or cultural\nuniformity. The foundation of such a university is\nethno-diverse, not ethnocentric.\nIt is apparent from this review that the\ncharacteristics of a pluralistic university are closely\ninterrelated and are based on a value-belief\nsystem that is congruent and unidimensional. If\nthe university that exists today in this country is to\nevolve into a pluralistic institution, it must\nembrace and commit itself to the fulfillment of\neach of these characteristics. Objectives that follow\nfrom these defining characteristics, such as those\ndescribed in the next section, must be articulated\nand strategies to achieve these objectives must be\ndeveloped and implemented.\n\nrameriz interior\n\n10/7/92 1:47 PM\n\nPage 8\n\nIII.

Strategies and Approaches to\nthe Recruitment and Retention of Ethnic\nPlurality Faculty\nIn reviewing the ten characteristics of a pluralistic\nuniversity, as well as the specific objectives that follow from these characteristics, it is apparent that\none important and necessary condition in achieving the pluralistic university is the successful\nrecruitment and retention of ethnic plurality faculty. There are a number of programs that can be\nimplemented to accomplish this critical objective.\nThe following is a brief, general description of the\nprograms and activities that have been implemented at the University of Colorado at Boulder to\nmaximize the recruitment, retention, and professional development of ethnic plurality faculty.\nEach is based on and follows from at least one of\nthe ten characteristics of a pluralistic university.\n1. Organizational and Administrative Changes\nin Recruitment Procedures and Policies:\na. Recruitment Authorization \xe2\x80\x94 Permission to\nrecruit faculty now comes from the Vice\nChancellor for Academic Affairs, who utilizes a\nvariety of criteria in determining what academic\nunits will be given authorization to recruit. One\nof these criteria is the ethnic/gender composition of the department. In a significant number\nof cases, a department is given permission to\nbegin a search with the understanding that the\nposition be filled with an ethnic plurality or\nwoman candidate. This approach, known as the\nSpecial Opportunity Program, has been very\nsuccessful(see below).\nb. Search Procedures \xe2\x80\x94 The Office of Faculty\nAffairs, which is a part of the Office of the Vice\nChancellor, has been given the responsibility for\nimplementing faculty affirmative action. No\nposition is filled without the involvement and\nfinal signature of the faculty director of this\noffice \xe2\x80\x94 the Associate Vice Chancellor for\nFaculty Affairs.\n\n10\n\nrameriz interior\n\n10/7/92 1:48 PM\n\nPage 11\n\nIn collaboration with the Office of Affirmative\nAction and Services, the Office of the Associate\nVice Chancellor for Faculty Affairs: (1) develops\npolicies and procedures for appropriately increasing female and ethnic plurality representation on\nthe faculty and ensures that such policies are\nimplemented; (2) reviews all faculty appointments\nand promotions to determine whether they are\nconsistent with the university\'s affirmative action\npolicies and associated procedural guidelines; (3)\nassists search committees in their efforts to broaden the scope of their searches; (4) designs and\nimplements internal audit and reporting systems\nto measure the effectiveness of the programs; (5)\npublishes equal opportunity^policies and procedural guidelines related to faculty hiring and\nreports on progress in faculty affirmative action;\n(6) administers the Special Opportunity Program;\n(7) counsels faculty members who are women,\nmembers of plurality groups,or disabled about professional opportunities; and (8) reviews annual\nreports from Deans and Department Chairs on the\nissue of affirmative action.\nIt should be noted that the Associate Vice\nChancellor has broad responsibility and authority\nin all areas of faculty recruitment, retention, evaluation, and development.\n2. Special Opportunity Program: This program,\nsince its inception, has been extremely successful.\nThrough this mechanism it is possible to set aside\nsome of the available faculty slots and to allocate\nthem as special opportunity hiring in departments\nthat (1) are given permission to identify potential\nethnic plurality candidates or (2) have already\nidenu\'fied outstanding ethnic plurality faculty.\nPrior to the implementation of the Special\nOpportunity Program as well as the other administrative changes in recruitment policies, the annual\nrecruitment pattern for women and ethnic plurality faculty was typically about 30%. Since these\nprogrammatic changes have been implemented,\nthe average annual recruitment pattern for women\nand ethnic plurality faculty has increased to over\n50%. In the AY 1991-92 faculty hiring, for example,\n39 (51%) of the 76 positions were filled by women\n11\n\nrameriz interior\n\n10/7/92 1:48 PM\n\nPage 12\n\nand ethnic plurality faculty; 24 (32%) of the faculty hired were ethnic plurality. In the faculty hiring\nfor AY 1992-93, 60 positions were filled. Of these,\n32 (53%) of the faculty hired are women and ethnic plurality.\n3. Departmental Strategies for Recruiting Plurality\nFaculty: The purpose of this program is to\nprovide incentives and resources to departments\nthat initiate aggressive and innovative recruitment\nstrategies for increasing their plurality faculty.\nAcademic units are encouraged to submit proposals to the Associate Vice Chancellor for Faculty\nAffairs that focus on the development of recruitment strategies for increasing their ethnic plurality\nfaculty. Such strategies might include:\na. Travel funds for attending conferences that\nethnic plurality faculty usually attend.\nb. Visits from ethnic faculty/administrators serving\nas consultants to the academic unit in the area\nof recruitment.\nc. Networking activities (phone calls, correspondence, pamphlets/posters, consortium arrangements, sharing of ethnic plurality graduate\nstudent lists with other institutions, etc.)\ndesigned to increase recruitment effectiveness.\nd. Special visits (not part of the regular recruitment process) by plurality faculty for potential\nrecruitment purposes.\ne. Travel funds for attending special events/workshops focusing on recuitment of plurality\nfaculty.\nf. Sponsoring/hosting events focusing on recruitment of ethnic plurality faculty.\nProposals in which the academic unit provides\nmatching funds are especially encouraged and\nreceive priority.\n4. IMPART (Implementation of Multicultural\nPerspectives and Approaches in Research and\nTeaching) Program: The goal of this program\nis to further develop a campus environment that\nsupports and encourages gender, ethnic, and cultural diversity, particularly in the approaches to\nresearch, scholarship, and teaching.\n12\n\nrameriz interior\n\n10/7/92 1:48 PM\n\nPage 13\n\nThe IMPART program provides support for:\n1) Multiethnic/multicultural research projects\n(these may be projects undertaken by one or\nmore investigators).\n2) Visiting women and ethnic plurality scholars\n(matching proposals are particularly encouraged, where the department contributes to\nthe costs of bringing these scholars to campus).\n3) Fellowships for women and plurality scholars to\nengage in research or scholarly activities that\nhave a multiethnic/multicultural focus (such\nfellowships might be for summer salary, reduction of teaching load, etc.).\n4)Colloquia, conferences, and.workshops having\nan academic, multiethnic, multicultural\ntheme, and involving the active participation of a significant number of women or\nplurality scholars.\nThe IMPART program is administered by the\nOffice of the Associate Vice Chancellor for Faculty\nAffairs, with the consultation of a faculty advisory\ncommittee. The advisory committee makes recommendations as to the funding of the proposals.\nProposals are encouraged that are interdisciplinary and collaborative and that bring together a\ncritical mass of faculty interested in establishing\nprogrammatic research, scholarly, or teaching\nactivities with a multicultural/multiethnic focus.\nThe committee is particularly interested in funding research/scholarly proposals from ethnic\nplurality and women faculty at the Assistant\nProfessor level. Providing support for junior faculty to initiate their own research and scholarly\nprograms is a high priority of IMPART.\nProposals are expected to include: (1) the goals\nand objectives of the project, (2) a detailed\ndescription of the project, (3) a rationale as to\nhow the specific project qualifies for funding\nunder this program and how it will contribute to\nmultiethnic/multicultural research, scholarship,\nor teaching, (4) a detailed budget, and (5) a letter\nof support from the chair of the faculty member\'s\nprimary unit. Most awards do not exceed $4,000.\n13\n\nrameriz interior\n\n10/7/92 1:48 PM\n\nPage 14\n\nThere is no restriction with regard to the minimum amount that may be requested, since it is\npossible that some activities or projects may not\nrequire a large amount of money.\nThe IMPART program, now in its sixth year, is\nfunded annually by the Office of the Vice\nChancellor for Academic Affairs. It continues to be\none of the most successful programs on campus\nand has been instrumental in providing resources\nto ethnic plurality and women faculty to assist\nthem in their scholarly and professional development.\n5. Ethnic Plurality Faculty Mentor-Mentee\nProgram: The purpose of this program is to develop mentor-mentee relations"hips among new\nethnic faculty and the more senior faculty. During\nthe past three years, the Associate Vice Chancellor\nfor Faculty Affairs has met with each of the new\njunior ethnic plurality faculty. Discussions, usually\nat a lunch with a group of two or three faculty and\nhosted by the Associate Vice Chancellor, center on\nthe topic of mentor-mentee relationships. As a\nresult of these and follow-up meetings, about 80%\nof the new faculty currently have or have had\nsenior faculty serving as their mentors.\n6. Ethnic Plurality Faculty Luncheon Series:\nThe luncheon series is hosted by the Associate\nVice Chancellor for Faculty Affairs, with funds\noriginally provided by the President\'s office and\nnow provided by the Vice Chancellor for Academic\nAffairs. The faculty meet for lunch on a regular,\nmonthly basis throughout the academic year. The\nluncheons are structured in such a way that they:\na. Provide an opportunity for new plurality faculty\nto meet and interact with the senior plurality\nfaculty.\nb. Establish a social support system for the plurality\nfaculty.\n*\nc. Develop a social and enjoyable atmosphere that\nalso serves as an informal orientation to the\nuniversity.\nd. Provide an opportunity for senior plurality\nfaculty to share their research and scholarly\n14\n\nrameriz interior\n\n10/7/92 1:48 PM\n\nPage 15\n\nareas of interest with their plurality colleagues,\nparticularly with the new junior plurality faculty,\nand vice versa.\ne. Provide plurality faculty the opportunity to hear\nabout and discuss issues important to their\ndevelopment as faculty with representatives\nfrom the administration.\n7. Expanding the Undergraduate Curriculum in\nthe Area of Ethnic and Gender Diversity: This\nprogram is funded by the Chancellor and administered through the office of the Associate Vice\nChancellor for Faculty Affairs. Requests for proposals are sent to all faculty. The goal of the\nprogram is to further the development of new\ncourses that will expand the~xi\xc2\xabdergraduate curriculum in the area of ethnic and gender diversity.\nThe planning and development costs receive support under this program. Funding under this\nprogram includes:\na. Providing a one-course reduction to a faculty\nmember in order to allow him/her to develop\nthe new course.\nb. Hiring a work study student or a graduate\nstudent (up to .25 FTE) to assist in the development of the new course.\nc. Providing travel expenses that might be related\nto the accumulation and development of materials necessary for such a new course.\nd. Costs of books/copying of journal articles, etc.,\nand other materials and supplies.\nProposals in which the academic unit provides\nsome support are especially encouraged. Proposals\nmust include some indication of support for such\na new course by the Chair or Dean and some indication that the course \xe2\x80\x94 once approved by the\nappropriate channels \xe2\x80\x94 will become part of the\nregular curriculum offerings of the department \xe2\x80\x94\ni.e., that the new course will be offered a minimum\nof once every two years. The proposal must also\ncontain a general description of the proposed\ncourse and a rationale as to how the course will\ncontribute to the undergraduate curriculum in the\n15\n\nrameriz interior\n\n10/7/92 1:48 PM\n\nPage 16\n\narea of ethnic and gender diversity. The proposals\nare reviewed by the IMPART Advisory Committee.\n8. Integrating Ethnic and Gender Perspectives into\nExisting Courses: This program, also funded by\nthe Chancellor, is similar to the previous one\nexcept that the proposals that are solicited are\nones that ensure that the multicultural experience\nbecomes integrated into courses that already are\npart of the curriculum, particularly introductory\nand survey courses. The types of activiu\'es funded\nunder this program are identical to those\ndescribed in the previous program. Proposals in\nwhich the academic unit provides some support\nare especially encouraged. Proposals must contain\na general description of trie-integration activiu\'es\nthat will be implemented and a rationale as to how\nthe revised/integrated course will contribute to\nthe undergraduate curriculum in the area of ethnic and gender diversity. The proposals are\nreviewed by the IMPART Advisory Committee.\n9. Conference on Excellence in Diversity and\nDiversity of Excellence: It is important for the\ncampus and/or university system to address the\nissues of diversity and pluralism in a direct and\npublic manner. With this in mind, in 1990 the\nPresident of the University of Colorado System\nprovided funds for a conference to address these\nissues. Over 150 educators, mostly from the\nUniversity of Colorado system but also from universities across the country, attended the\nconference. As implied in its title, the conference\napproached diversity from two directions \xe2\x80\x94\n"excellence in diversity," indicating the richness\nthat can be gained from a number of perspectives,\nand "diversity of excellence," pointing to the need\nto expand traditional standards of excellence to\ninclude those perspectives. The conference was\nsignificant in a number of important ways. First, it\nrepresented an initial, collaborative effort on the\npart of ethnic pluralities and others to work\ntogether in the development of a conference that\nwas scholarly and academically and educationally\nrelevant. Second, the conference provided the\nopportunity for faculty to present their research\nand discuss their ideas relating to the theme of the\n16\n\nrameriz interior\n\n10/7/92 1:48 PM\n\nPage 17\n\nconference. Third, this was the first time that the\nissues of diversity and excellence were explored\nand critically assessed by the CU academic community using the research and scholarship generated\nby its own faculty as the basis of examination and\nevaluation. Fourth, by funding and providing support for such a conference, the university\ndemonstrated in a public way its recognition that\nthese are legitimate areas of inquiry, research, and\nscholarship.\nSuch conferences \xe2\x80\x94 in order to play a role in\nthe development of a pluralistic university and to\nhave an impact on plurality faculty recruitment\nand retention \xe2\x80\x94 should continue to be supported\nand should be held every two -to three years.\n10. Equity and Excellence Awards Banquet\nand Graduation Ceremony: It is important to provide an opportunity to acknowledge and celebrate\nthe contributions of the ethnic plurality faculty,\nstudents, and staff. For this reason, for the past\nseven years the Boulder campus has annually held\nthis awards banquet and graduation ceremony.\nThe theme of the event is best captured by what\nhas become its opening salute:\nIt is that one day of the year \xe2\x80\x94\nwhen we come together as a community to honor\nourselves and our accomplishments; when we\nsalute ourselves for our efforts, our struggles, our\ndedication to the principle of academic excellence\nand to the pursuit of pluralism and equity at the\nUniversity of Colorado; when we join together,\nshare food and bread, and partake in the spiritual\ncommunion that represents our uniqueness and our\ndiversity; when we choose from among ourselves\nthose brothers and sisters who, through their\ndaily work and in their everyday actions, have\ndemonstrated their commitment to those ideals\nand principles which we honor tonight: Equity and\nExcellence.\nEach year an Equity and Excellence Award is\ngiven to one faculty member, one staff person, two\nundergraduate students, and two graduate students who, through their work at the university\nand in the broader community, best exemplify\n17\n\nrameriz interior\n\n10/7/92 1:48 PM\n\nPage 18\n\ntheir commitment to the principle of equity and\nexcellence. In addition, all ethnic plurality graduating seniors and their parents are invited and\nacknowledged; all the ethnic plurality faculty and\nstaff are also invited, as are the academic administrators, deans, and department chairs. The cost of\nthe banquet is paid for by the Chancellor and the\nVice Chancellor for Academic Affairs. The\nAssociate Vice Chancellor for Faculty Affairs is\nresponsible for administering and coordinating\nthe event.\n\nV. Assessing Pluralistic Systems\nOne feature of the present conceptualization of a\npluralistic system is that it can be measured and\nassessed. An inventory, entitled the \'\'MonolithicPluralistic System Inventory" (MPSI), has been\ndeveloped by the present author to assess the\ndegree to which a system varies along the monolithic-pluralistic continuum. Each of the\ncomponents/characteristics can be evaluated by\nmembers of the system along a 10-point scale, and\nthe data can be analyzed with respect to how the\nsystem (a school, university, organization, etc.)\nfares with respect to each component. Once this\nhas been done, it is possible to identify areas where\nchange in a more pluralistic direction is needed.\nUsing the instrument in this way, it is possible to\ndesign pre- and post-test studies that can assess the\neffects of systematic intervention strategies that\nwere implemented based on the results of the initial administration of the inventory.\nThe following is one form of the MPSI that can\nbe used by a university to assess its level of pluralism. Since not all respondents will be familiar with\nthe terms used to describe a pluralistic system, the\nperson administering the MPSI to a group might\nread the brief statement/descriptor that follows\neach component in Section II of this report so that\nthe respondents will have a general idea of the\nmeaning of each characteristic.\n\n18\n\nrameriz interior\n\n10/7/92 1:48 PM\n\nPage 19\n\nMonolithic-Pluralistic System Inventory\n\n,\n-()-\n\nA university can be viewed from a variety of dimensions and described in a number of\ndifferent ways. We have developed a set of ten characteristics that can be used to look at\na university like the University of\n. What we would like you to do is to think\nabout each characteristic and circle the number on a ten-point scale that best describes\nwhere you think this university is with respect to that characteristic. There are no right or\nwrong answers. What we would like is your frank and honest opinion concerning the\ntype of university the University of\nis with respect to each of these characteristics. If there are any questions you prefer not to answer, you are certainly free to do so.\nYour answers will be completely confidential. Your name will not be written down anywhere on the questionnaire, so your response will be anonymous.\n1.
