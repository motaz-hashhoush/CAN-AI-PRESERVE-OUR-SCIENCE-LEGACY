A survey questionnaire was sent to 513 LaRC engineers and scientists and 600 engineers and scientists from three (3) professional/technical societies. The survey response rates were 74 percent and 85 percent, respectively. The questionnaire contained 14 questions covering 12 survey topics. The results of two of these survey topics - the order in which users read components (Survey Topic 1) and the components reviewed or read to determine whether to read the entire report (Survey Topic 2) - are presented in this paper.", "title": "Survey of usage of technical report components to establish their most effective organization", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-11T16:33:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19830053582, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Pinelli, T.
