Trends show that demand for high-tech solutions is increasing in these sectors, solutions that require higher resolution, greater precision, novel materials, innovative processes, and more sophisticated tools. These are areas where microgravity can offer unique capabilities for innovation. The Emerging Space Office (ESO) has engaged in multiple studies over the past year that have found that microgravity RD is one of the most promising technology areas for contributing to economic growth and to NASAs mission. The focus of these studies was on terrestrial markets rather than NASA applications, applied research rather than basic research, and commercial rather than academic investigators. There have been more success stories than are generally appreciated and there are significant areas of promising future potential. Many of the problems that have limited commercial microgravity development in the past are being solved. Microgravity research and development (RD) requires iteration and learning, as rapidly as possible. New technologies enable high throughput and rapid data collection in increasingly small payloads. The International Space Station is in orbit and provides a laboratory that is available 247 at least until 2024. Frequent flights by commercial space providers to and from the ISS now enable the fast learning cycles needed by high-tech industries. Launch costs are decreasing and the ability to return payloads to Earth is increasing. New commercial space laboratories, such as those being developed by SpaceX and Bigelow Aerospace, are in the final stages of development and testing. This ecosystem for microgravity RD has never been available before. These are game-changer conditions for attracting high-tech industries to space for terrestrial, as well as NASA, applications. However, few know that these capabilities are available or how to use them. In aggregate, the potential value for new applications from microgravity RD over the next ten years could add billions of dollars per year in terrestrial applications to the future economy, create new jobs, and generate a wide range of public benefits in medical advances, while broadening the customer base for the emerging space industry.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20150022148, "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Kentucky Space", "location": "Lexington, KY, United Space"}}, "meetingId": "4163261899854a37989300d4fd58eed5", "id": "df09204eb5da4498aa3b158471e42185"}], "name": "ExoMed Conference 2015", "location": "Swampscott, MA", "id": "4163261899854a37989300d4fd58eed5", "startDate": "2015-05-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20150022148, "id": "66263546e459438db7e7015ce79d637d", "publicationDate": "2015-05-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20150022148.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20150022148/downloads/20150022148.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20150022148/downloads/20150022148.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20150022148/downloads/20150022148.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
