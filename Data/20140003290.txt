b"A Guideline for the Management of Renal Stones in Astronauts\nDavid Reyes, MD, MPH, James Locke, MD, MPH, and Smith Johnston, MD, MPH\n\nIntroduction\nThere are no specific guidelines for the management of renal stones in astronauts.\nGiven the increased risk for bone loss, hypercalcuria, and stone formation due to\nmicrogravity, a clinical practice guideline is needed.\n\nMethods\nAn extensive review of the literature and current aeromedical standards for the\nmanagement of renal stones was done. The NASA Flight Medicine Clinic's electronic\nmedical record and Longitudinal Survey of Astronaut Health were also reviewed. This\ninformation was used to create an algorithm for the management of renal stones in\nastronauts.\n\nResults\nGuidelines are proposed based on accepted standards of care, with consideration to the\nenvironment of spaceflight. In a usual medical setting, asymptomatic, small stones less\nthan 7 mm are often observed over time. Given the constraints of schedule, and the\nrisks to crew health and mission, this approach is too liberal. An upper limit of 3 mm\nstone diameter was adopted before requiring intervention, because this is the largest\nsize that has a significant chance of spontaneous passage on its own. Other specific\nguidelines were also created.\n\nDiscussion\nThe spaceflight environment requires more aggressive treatment than would otherwise\nbe found with the usual practice of medicine. A small stone can become a major\nproblem because it may ultimately require medical evacuation from orbit. Thus renal\nstones are a significant mission threat and should be managed in a systematic way to\nmitigate risks to crew health and mission success.\n\n"
