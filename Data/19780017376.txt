G~~~~\ndelay is defied as the t h e required for\nan information signal to pass through a system and can 2o\nbe measured 8 the phase shift, A+, of the information\nsignal through the system for a given input frequency,\nO. This suggests shifting the input frequency a predetermined amount, Aw, recording the resulting change of\nphase, and repeating the process over the desired range 25\nof frequencies. Alternatively, the input signal may be\namplitude modulated by a lower modulating frequency,\nfm. After the carrier passes through the system, the\namplitude modulation is detected and compared with\nthe phase of the modulating frequency to determine the 3o\ngroup delay, rd, of the carrier as simply\ntd=&\n\nB Using a modulation frequency of2.7778 MHz, Which 35\nY\nis small compared to the test band widths, a direct conversion from degrees of phase to nano-seconds can be\nmade as illustrated in the following example of a phase\nmeasurement of 1" with modulation of 2.7778 MHz;\n\n+\n\ntd =\n\n1"\n(2.7778 X lo6) 360 = 1.0\n\nx\n\nor I n sec.\n\n2\n\ntor, comparing the signal phase of the test path with the\nreference path at the outputs of the detectors, and recording the change in phase diflerence (group delay) as\na function of carrier frequency. The voltage controlled\noscillator is first set for a continuous output at the center\nof the desired test band, and using an oscilloscope connected to a detector without a test system in its path, the\nmodulator is adjusted for maximum detected signal\nwith minimum distortion. Then with the reference path\nand the test path (without a test system) connected to\nthe phase comparator, the reference and test path\nlengths (group delays) are balanced for zero degrees at\nthe output of the phase comparator. Next the system to\nbe tested is connected in series with the detector in the\ntest path, ahead of the detector. With the voltage controlled oscillator still at a continuous frequency at the\nCenter of the desired test path, the sensitivity of a group\ndelay recorder iS adjusted for Sufficientrange to record\ntotal group delay of the device under test. If group\ndelay reSO1UtiOn iS insufficient on the recorder, due to\nthe test system having too large a group delay a sufficiently long (equivalent) cable may be inserted in the\nreference path to permit adjusting the recorder sensitivity to the desired range of group delay. Then prior to\nrecording group delay as a function of carrier frequency, both the system under test and the equivalent\ncable are removed while the output of the phase comparator is again balanced. Now the group delay versus\nfrequency of the test system is recorded at different\ntemperatures or environmental stress levels of the system, such as in different magnetic fields.\nThe novel features that are considered characteristic\nof this invention are set forth with particularity in the\nappended claims. The invention will best be understood\nfrom the following description when read in connection\nwith the accompanying drawings.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\nFIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of the invention.\n40\nFIGS. 2 and 3 are examples of test records made with\nthe present invention.\n\nDESCRIPTION O F PREFERRED\nThe problem with this direct approach is that phase\nEMBODIMENTS\nshifts or group delay effects of the modulator and detec- 45\nReferring to FIG. 1 of the drawings, it shows a test\ntor in the test path are included in the measurement.\nset for recordinggroup delay directly as a function of\nSuch effects can be predetermined and subtracted from\ncarrier frequency while testing a system 10 for changes\nthe measured group delay, but changes in these effects\nin group\nOver an\nOr\nOf interest due to\nas a result of temperature changes, or as the result of\ncarrier frequency changes, may introduce\nsince 50 temperature and/or mechanical stress.
