McQueen,\n\nDoor\n\nAssembly\n\nJr.*\n\nAbstract\nThis paper discusses the design and development\nof the Solar X-ray Imager (SXl)\nvacuum door assembly (VDA). Rationale for the type of mechanism,\nseal, and prime\nmover is covered.\nAn overview of the testing performed is included.\nIntroduction\n\nand\n\nBackground\n\nThe SXl is a satellite-based\nx-ray telescope.\nSXI will monitor solar activities so that\nresultant magnetic disturbances\ncan be forecast for earth sooner and more accurately.\nSXl is launched on an Atlas II vehicle and is mounted on the solar array boom of the\nGeostationary\nOperational\nEnvironmental\nSatellite - M (GOES-M).\nGOES-M is an\nexisting design, so SXI must perform within GOES-M resources.\nThis limits SXl\nseverely in redundancy, size, and mass. These are dominant factors in the design of\nthe vacuum door assembly.\nSXl is a class C instrument.\nNASA applies class C requirements\nto a payload that is\ngenerally of medium priority, and does not involve any possibility of human injury if the\npayload should not function as designed.\nClass C requirements\nleave much to\nengineering judgment, including level of testing and type of testing. As a class C\ninstrument SXl is designated\na protoflight instrument, which means the project has no\ndedicated qualification\nunit. All qualification\nand acceptance testing are done on the\nflight (or protoflight) system.\nSXl requires a vacuum door because of a sensitive camera component\nchannel plate, or MCP). This component can only be operated safely\n1.33o10 -7 kPa (10 .6 torr) or less. The vacuum door contains a window\ntesting of the camera.\nIn this ground testing, ultraviolet light illuminates\ndetermine the charge coupled device health before launch. The door\nduring ground operations to preserve a protective environment\nfor the\nground command opens the vacuum door on orbit after sufficient time\nand satellite outgassing.\n\n(a micro\nat a pressure of\nused in ground\nthe camera to\nremains closed\ncamera MCP. A\nfor instrument\n\nThe operational\nrequirement of the vacuum door is a one time actuation on orbit. The\ndoor\'s purpose is to protect the camera from the ground environment\nand from on-orbit\noutgassing of the instrument.\nThe only requirement for reset exists for ground testing.\nThe mechanism\nis low profile to fit within the space envelope available.\nThe envelope\nis approximately\n50 x 13 x 178 mm (2 x 0.5 x 7 inches). The mass requirement\nis\n0.454 kg (1 Ib). Maximum power available is 10 watts. The window must transmit ultra\nviolet light. The door must seal so that ground support equipment can pump down the\ncamera housing to 1.33 x 10 -7 kPa (10 -6 torr). The design outlined below was chosen\n\n* George C. Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, AL\n\n208\n\nto provide the most simple and lowest cost mechanism\nreliably within the requirements\nstated above.\n\nthat would perform\n\nthe task\n\nThe limitations of the available GOES-M resources and the designation\nof SXl as a\nclass C instrument dictated the design philosophy taken for this mechanism.\nThis\nmechanism\nis a simple, rugged, relatively low cost design.\nNo redundancy was\nincorporated\nother than the redundant heater elements of the paraffin actuator.\nCare\nis taken to use proven and already qualified elements wherever possible.\nThe\nmechanism is tested thoroughly at the component level before system integration.\nBasic\n\nDesign\n\nThe mechanism can be divided into three different areas,: the prime mover, the latch,\nand the carriage.\nEach interacts with the other to successfully\nopen the door. The\nprime mover applies force to the latch. The latch restrains the carriage system when\nthe door is closed, and applies opening force to the carriage system when the prime\nmover is energized.\nThe carriage system for the door/window\nassembly of the\nmechanism\nis a slider-crank mechanism.\nFigure 1 shows an exploded view of the\ndevice.\nThe prime mover applies the opening force to the latch, which applies force to the\ncarriage assembly.\nThe prime mover selected for this application\nis a paraffin actuator.\nA power supply applies voltage to the actuator heaters. The paraffin goes through a\nchange of state (solid to liquid). The paraffin applies hydrostatic pressure to an output\npin. This particular paraffin actuator (or linear motor) outputs 222 N (50 Ib) nominally,\nrequires 10 watts, and is approximately\n56.7 g (0.125 Ib) in mass.\nThe latch of this design performs two functions.\nA cut out in the latch captures a pin in\nthe carriage assembly.\nThe latch restrains the door in the closed position. The latch\nalso transfers the opening force of the prime mover to the carriage assembly (see\nFigure 2). An extension spring provides reset force for the actuator and latch.\nThe slider- crank mechanism was chosen for the carriage system. The profile of\nmovement for this mechanism is low and fits in the required envelope (see Figure 3).\nThe initial movement of the door is normal to the sealing surface; thus the seal loading\nreacts through the carriage system. A torsion spring actuates the carriage after delatch. The torsion spring attaches to ground bracket and the input link. The design\nhas liberal clearances so that no thermal expansion problems are encountered.\nThe VDA uses a gask-o-seal design for the primary seal. The material is viton\n(fluorocarbon).\nThe crown height is 0.38 to 0.51 mm (0.015 to 0.020 in). The VDA\nutilizes the gask-o-seal design for several reasons.\nThe door would have to be reset\non the ground, and if this operation were to be remote the seal would have to be\nreusable (i.e., elastomer).\nThe gask-o-seal\nis molded in place and can be formed in\nvarious shapes. The high contact stress generated when the gask-o-seal\nis\ncompressed\nreduces overall permeability\nof the seal material.\nNASA has a long\nhistory of use and a high confidence level in the gask-o-seal\ndesign.\n\n2o9\n\nDevelopment\n\nTesting\n\nA development\nmodel was fabricated in December of 1993 (see Figure 4). This model\nwas fabricated to test the basic design and to test seal material compatibility.\nThe\ndevelopment\nunit underwent functional, vibration, and thermal vacuum tests. The\nfunctional tests were performed at room temperature\nand ambient pressure.\nThe\ndevice operated a total of 40 cycles. The device was checked for leakage regularly to\ndetermine the effect of seal or mechanism wear. No significant changes in ultimate\nleak rate were recorded during these tests. A random vibration test was performed at\nthe expected flight levels. Functional tests and leak checks were performed before\nand after. No anomalies occurred.\nThe VDA experienced\ntrouble in the thermal vacuum test that resulted in design\nchanges.\nThe actuator and heater arrangement\nfor the development\nmodel proved to\nbe inadequate for this application.\nThe actuator was low cost, low mass, and had high\noutput force. However, the heater arrangement\n(externally mounted) was inefficient\nand the paraffin seals (shaft seals) were inadequate for cleanliness requirements.\nThe\ndesign also lacked adequate instrumentation\nto signal the open position.\nThe lack of\nthese features resulted in long actuation times at cold temperature,\ncontamination\nof\nthe device through paraffin leakage, and damage to the device because of actuator\n"overstroke."\nIn addition to the problems discussed above, the lack of a remote control for door reset\nproved to be troublesome.\nThe lack of a reset system lengthened the down time on\nthermal vacuum testing. The test chamber had to return to ambient temperature\nand\npressure to reset the door by hand. This changed the time between cycles from a few\nminutes to a few hours.\nSeal testing was an important part of development\ntesting.\nSeal testing included\noutgassing/contamination\ntests, ultimate leak rate tests (comparative),\nand\ncompression\neffect on ultimate leak rate. Two different seal materials were tested for\ncontamination\nper MSFC-SPEC-1443.\nMSFC-SPEC-1443\noutlines testing\nprocedures to determine material compatibility with optical systems.\nThe two materials\nof study were a butyl rubber compound and a viton (fluorocarbon)\ncompound.\nThe\nviton was chosen because the leak rate was very similar to the butyl and the viton was\nmuch more compatible with optical systems. A test was conducted to find the effects of\nseal compression\non ultimate leak rate. The results showed a considerable\neffect for\nthe first 0.20 to 0.25 mm (0.008 to 0.010 in) of compression,\nbut not much effect for the\nlast 0.13 to 0.18 mm (0.005 to 0.007 in). From this series of tests come the\ndetermination\nof seal material and nominal compression\nof the seal for minimal loads\nreacted through the assembly.\nEngineering\n\nModel\n\nThe next VDA to be designed and fabricated was the engineering\nmodel (EM). The\nEM design incorporated\nchanges to alleviate some of the problems described in the\nlast section. A new paraffin actuator that fit the design requirements\nmore closely was\n\n210\n\nselected and procured.\nA sensor was added to the VDA to signal door actuation.\nremote reset feature was incorporated\nfor ground operations and testing.\nThe paraffin actuator\ndevelopment\nmodel\nare in direct contact\nhermetically sealed\nthat limits the output\nFigure 5 shows the\n\nA\n\nchosen for the EM showed three improvements\nfrom the\nactuator.\nThe EM actuator heaters are internal to the actuator and\nwith the paraffin. The cavity in which the paraffin resides is\nusing a boot seal. The EM actuator has a shear disk arrangement\nforce to approximately\ntwo times the nominally rated output.\nEM actuator installed on the developmental\nvacuum door.\n\nThe sensor added to the EM vacuum door assembly was a military standard subminiature switch. The switch is hermetically sealed. Exposed surfaces are stainless\nsteel. The sensor is used on orbit to determine when to discontinue\npower to the\nactuator.\nThe remote reset feature was added to aid in ground testing.\nmechanism attaches to the input link of the carrier system. A\nreturn arm. The flexible shaft penetrates the optical bench of\nand connects to a rotational feed through in the test chamber\nEngineering\n\nModel\n\nThe return arm of the\nflexible shaft actuates the\nthe telescope assembly\nwall.\n\nTesting\n\nSome of the same testing was conducted on the development\nmodel and EM vacuum\ndoor assemblies,\nbut with different objectives.\nAs an engineering model, this unit was\nmeant to unofficially qualify the design of the VDA. In the development\nprogram,\nchanges are expected; and the results influence fundamental\ndesign decisions.\nThe EM vacuum door underwent four tests at the subsystem level: random vibration,\nthermal vacuum, thermal cycle, and life cycle tests. The random vibration test was\nconducted to the levels shown in Table 1. A functional test before and after (and leak\nchecks) were the pass/fail criteria for the test. A twenty-four cycle thermal test was\nconducted in conjunction\nwith a thermal vacuum test. These tests proved survivability\nand functionality\nat the expected flight temperatures.\nThe criteria for these tests are\nshown in Table 2. The test program included life cycle testing to prove the ruggedness\nand durability of the design. The EM vacuum door operated approximately\nfour times\nthe expected duty cycle of the flight unit. The life cycle test had a duration of sixty\ncycles. The life cycle count included operations required for other tests.\nThe test program for the EM VDA was very successful.\nHowever, EM testing found one\ndeficiency.\nDuring the thermal vacuum test, the operator left power engaged to the\nparaffin actuator longer than design parameters specified.\nThis error resulted in the\nfail safe of an actuator and damage to the vacuum door. There are two reasons for the\nincident described above. The system level (i.e., the control circuit or operator) should\nhave shut the device down before any damage was done to the mechanism.\nIn the\nevent of a system failure, the paraffin actuator should not have had enough output to\ndamage the latch mechanism.\nOne positive result of this incident is that the actuator\ndid not release contamination\neven after being pushed well beyond design limits. Two\nchanges will be implemented:\n1) an automatic cut-off in the control logic of the SXI\n\n211\n\nsystem, and 2) the de-rating of the paraffin actuator to a 111 N (25 Ib) nominal output\ninstead of the original 222 N (50 Ib) nominal output. Even if the control circuit fails, the\nactuator will fail safe before any harm. This is less important on orbit, since the door\noperates only one time. However, if a failure of this type occurs during testing it is\nnecessary only to replace or refurbish an actuator rather than replace and re-qualify\nthe whole VDA mechanism again. There is also less risk to the camera since the door\ncould be closed again to protect the camera while actuator change out is\naccomplished.\nConclusion\nThe Solar X-ray Imager vacuum door assembly is a simple, low cost, reliable\nmechanism.\nThe basic design is three very familiar mechanisms\nintegrated to one\ndevice; a four-bar mechanism,\nan inclined plane, and a hydraulic actuator.\nEven\nduring a "failure" in testing, the door has never failed to meet the overall objective - to\nopen when commanded\nand provide a high vacuum seal when closed. The test\nanomalies experienced\nwere partially due to deficient test set-ups and procedures.\nHowever, some valuable insight resulted from those failures.\nBecause of this insight,\ndesign changes resulted in a more reliable unit.\n\nTable\n\n1\n\nRandom\n\nVibration\n\nY AND\nFREQUENCY\n20\n100- 160\n200\n2000\nOVERALL\n\n(Hz)\n\n20\n80- 600\n2000\n\nTable\nTEST\nTHERMAL CYCLE\nTHERMAL VACUUM\n\nEnvironment\n\nZ AXIS\nACCELERATION\n\n(Hz)\n\nFREQUENCY\n\nTest\n\n= 8.05\n\nSPECTRAL\n\nDENSITY (G2/Hz)\n0.005\n0.5\n0.05\n0.00158\nGrms\n\nX AXIS\nACCELERATION\nSPECTRAL\nDENSITY (G2/Hz)\n0.008\n0.125\n0.00158\nOVERALL\n= 9.77 Grms\n\n2\n\nThermal\n\nTest\n\nTEMPERA TURE (\xc2\xb0C)\n+36 / -53\n+36 / -53\n\n212\n\nEnvironment\nNO.
