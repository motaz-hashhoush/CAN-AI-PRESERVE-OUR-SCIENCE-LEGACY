Two facets of the group, \"Cranked Arrow Wing Aerodynamic Project International (CAWAPI)\" and \"Vortex Flow Experiment-2 (VFE-2)\", worked closely together. However, because of the different requirements of each part, the CAWAPI facet concluded its work earlier (December 2006) than the VFE-2 facet (December 2007). In this first chapter of the Final Report of the Task Group an overview on its work is given, and the objectives for the Task Group are described.", "title": "Objectives and Overview", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-24T22:34:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20100011930, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Lamar, John E."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Langley Research Center", "location": "Hampton, VA, United States"}}, "id": "b7a6855cc30f4bf9af52cd48a33b5398"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20100011930, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Hummel, Dietrich"}, "organization": {"name": "Technische Univ.", "location": "Brunswick, Germany"}}, "id": "954b1aa69e184b6f834bfeae8b56ad99"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20100011930, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20100011930, "id": "ec82a96348f248b5bca81c73e2516f01", "publicationName": "Understanding and Modeling Vortical Flows to Improve the Technology Readiness Level for Military Aircraft", "publicationDate": "2009-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
