b'DEVELOP National Program\nLangley Research Center\n\nGulf of Mexico Air Quality: CALIPSO Decision Support for Gulf of Mexico Air Quality Relating to\nthe Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill\nStudent Investigators:\nMyNgoc Nguyen, Old Dominion University (project lead)\nStephen LaPointe, American Public University System\nBrittney Jennings, Christopher Newport University\nAngela Zoumplis, Christopher Newport University\nProject Overview\nOn April 20, 2010, an oil platform belonging to BP exploded and leaked a huge volume of oil into the Gulf of\nMexico. In an effort to control the spread of the oil, BP applied dispersants such as Corexit and conducted in-situ\nburnings of the oil. This catastrophe created a complex chain of events that affected not only the fragile water and\nland ecosystems, but the humans who breathe the air every day. Thousands of people were exposed to fumes\nassociated with oil vapors from the spill, burning of the oil, and the toxic mixture of dispersants.\nWhile aiding in clean-up efforts, local fishermen were directly exposure to fumes when working on the Gulf. A\nnotable amount of Gulf Coast residents were also exposed to the oil fumes as seasonal southeasterly winds blew\nvapors toward land. The Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) found in oil vapors include: benzene, toluene, ethyl\nbenzene, xylene, naphthalene, hydrogen sulfide and particulate matter (PM). Increases in water temperature and\nsunlight due to the summer season allow for these VOCs and PM to evaporate into the air more rapidly. Aside\nfrom the VOCs found in oil vapors, the dispersant being used to break up the oil is highly toxic and is thought to be\neven more toxic than the oil itself (EPA website, 2010).\nTo protect human health, the environment, and to make informed policy decisions relevant to the spill, the EPA\nRegion 6 has continuously monitored the affected areas carefully for levels of pollutants in the outdoor air that are\nassociated with petroleum products and the burning of oil along the coast. In an effort to prevent, prepare for, and\nrespond to future oil spills that occur in and around inland waters of the United States, the EPA has been working\nwith local, state, and federal response partners.\nAir quality measurements were collected by the EPA at five active monitoring systems stationed along the coast.\nThere are fixed monitors in Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Florida. However, the EPA does not have any fixed\nmonitoring stations over the water, which makes it extremely difficult to collect data regarding the amount and\nintensity of aerosols over the sea. To assist the EPA Region 6 air quality monitoring efforts, the DEVELOP team\ninvestigated the use of the CALIPSO lidar (CALIOP) level 2 version 3.01 nighttime aerosol products and the HYSPLIT\nmodel to monitor aerosols and dispersants over the ocean resulting from the Horizon Oil Spill. CALIOP is a twowavelength polarization-sensitive lidar that provides high-resolution vertical profiles of aerosols and clouds. Since\nCALIOP has a 5km horizontal resolution and a 16 day orbit, aerosol information from the affected oil spill area can\nbe measured over the ocean. Approximately 2-5 images from CALIOP can be taken of the oil spill area. From\nanalysis of various CALIOP aerosol profiles and extinction coefficients, comparisons between the time periods\nbefore and after the occurrence of the oil spill were conducted. Once dates of significant aerosol activities were\nrecorded and researched for attributable factors, correlations were made with the air quality data offered on the\nEPA website. The CALIOP aerosol profile and extinction coefficients obtained will serve to supplement EPA\nmonitoring and be a tool to help EPA understand the aerosol activity over the ocean.\nThe HYSPLIT model from NOAA was also used to supplement EPA air quality monitoring in the Gulf of Mexico.\nHSYPLIT forward trajectories allow the path of the oil spill smoke plume to be tracked and utilized for mitigation\npurposes. This gives the EPA significantly improved monitoring abilities, and would allow smoke plume projections\nthat continue too far inland to be accounted for with early evacuation processes or air quality warnings for coastal\n\nresidences. The forward trajectories created by the HYSPLIT model also serve as a basis for the project\ncollaborator, the Mobile County Health Department DEVELOP team, to pull public health data for correlation\nanalysis.\nAt the conclusion of the project, EPA Region 6 will be given a methodology describing the use of various NASA EOS\nproducts together to monitor air quality measurements in relation to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. CALIPSO\nLevel 2 Version 3.01 Aerosol Extinction data, MODIS, and the HYSPLIT model will be among the NASA EOS data and\nproducts utilized. The methodology will serve to supplement sparse monitoring stations and to further the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s\nunderstanding of air quality levels at sea.\nUtilizing the air quality issues relating to the BP Horizon Oil Spill as a case study, this project can provide\nmethodologies for future oil spill air quality monitoring in the case of another disastrous event. Other future work\nin this area would also address the water quality issues arising from the spill and the impacts on the coastal\nhabitats as long-term impacts of the oil spill on the water quality of the Gulf of Mexico remains to be seen.\nProject Mentors:\nDr. Richard Ferrare \xe2\x80\x93 NASA Langley Research Center\nDr. Jim Szykman \xe2\x80\x93 NASA Langley Research Center\nBrian Getzewich - NASA Langley Research Center\nFor more information about the DEVELOP National Program and other student projects, please visit\nhttp://develop.larc.nasa.gov.\n\nImage 1: CALIPSO\xe2\x80\x99s CALIOP sensor views the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on May 2, 2010.
