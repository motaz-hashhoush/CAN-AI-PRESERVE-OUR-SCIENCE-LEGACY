Applications, Technology Transfer Division, University Applications Program,\nJoseph A. Vitale, Manager, under NASA grant number NGL 23-004-083.\nThe principals of the MSU-CRS acknowledge, with considerable gratitude,\nthe continuing support of the MSU endeavors in the realm of remote sensing.\nFrom periodic comments brought to our attention, we feel reasonably confident that the cumulative accomplishments over the years realized as a\nresult of the many associations between NASA and MSU, have been, in return,\neffectively supportive to relevant missions of NASA. We are encouraged by\nthe continuing mutual high esteem shared by NASA officers and MSU remote\nsensing scientists, officials and collaborating organizations.\nDuring this reporting year, June 1, 1980 to May 31, 1981, a considerable\nvariety of research studies, contractual services and general service were\ncarried on and completed. The accomplishments of these categories of activities described in the text material which follows were made possible by\nthe cumulative synergism of the multi-disciplinary teamwork of faculty\nscientists, technicians and administrative staff members including personnel\nof collaborating agencies, with the substantial back-up of the NASA University Applications Program and Michigan State University administrative officers.\nThe long-term support of the MSU program continues to be the base-support\nfor cumulative development of technical competence by the personnel of the\nCenter for Remote Sensing and the progressive growth of esteem by the publicserving community of institutions for the achievements and demonstrated\nexpertise of the Center\'s personnel.\nIn the light of the austere :financial straits, operating agencies at\nall levels of business and government are increasingly having to cope with,\n\n1\n\n2\t\n\nORIGINAL PAGE Is\nOF POOR QUALITY\n\nthe continued support of NASA is proving to be an even more indispensable\nbase of support for maintaining vitality and productivity of the MSU\nprogram.\n\nFaculty Investigators\nThe following listing indicates those faculty scientists who were\nactively engaged in the productivity of the year being reported.

No longer\n\n:io a manual/vioual interpretation of imagery followed by manual recording\nand simple quantitative and qualitative analysis anywhere near adequate for\n\nthe increasing widespread demandii for critical information. As these current years unfold, computer-assiated, digital interpretation, plotting and\nanalysis of data from\n\na variety of scanners\n\non board aircraft and spacecraft\n\ncommonly transmitting at frequent, regular intervals have become the minimum\nmeans.....the norm.....for serving informational needs about the condition\nand magnitudes of terrain and the cultural, development upon it.\nThe Michigan State University Center for Remote Sensing principals\nhave been working most diligently to acquire collateral funds to purchase\nthe necessary basic equipment and software to enable this catch-up. As\nhardware equipment components have been acquired, integrated and made operational, faculty and staff have striven to develop capability in utilizing\nthem for the needed effectiveness. In March 1981, the Center acquired the\nbasic component of a micro-computer system with several basic software\npackages. As described in sections "C-2" and "C-3," under "General.\nMissions," the staff through the 1980-81 period began the painstaking labor\nof installing, balancing out, integrating functions and components and otherwise making operational the beginnings of this system.\nIn the face of an intensifying demand for information, the economic\nshortfalls of the times have been progressively curtailing the fiscal\ncapabilities of federal and state agencies, private firms, and the University to supply both direct funds for equipment acquisition and assembly\nand for contractual research which had been a growing, promising source\nfor non-categorical funds which could sustain these kinds of essential\ntasks.\nAt the same time, these economic constraints have been influencing\nthe nature of policies, legislative enactments, court decisions and\nagency/institutional priorities. The introductory commentary of the\nProgress Report submitted for 1979-80 is stall highly apropos to the\nsituation of 1980-81. A selected portion is loosely reiterated at this\n\n4\n\npoint as a summation of the current challen g es And opportunities open to\nremote sensing science:\n"The increasin g severity and austerity emanating from the\ncurrent widespread economic shortfalls Are influencing the naturu\nof policies, legislative enactments and court decisions. Rationalizations are being offered for the lessening of environmental\nmonitoring, controlling and enforcing, E%pediencies are being\nsubstituted for careful deliberation and objective judgements.\nWith such a trend in motion, it is all the more important to\nbe able to counter impulsive, biased ,judgements with current,\nspeedily-derived, accurate, irrefutable evidence of the condition\nof particular situations. Remote sensing, as one major means for\nobtaining such immediate information, should be supported in every\npossible way for continuing the flow of ,needed data and for sustaining further development of expertise.\n"In parallel to this growing trend of lessened monitoring\nand controlling how resources are utilized, is the widespread,\nexpanding capability for quickly detecting more instances and\nmore kinds of environmental abuses and breakdowns. Governmental\njurisdictions at all levels are becoming increasingly knowledgeable\nand capable.....even to sophisticated degrees....,to cope with new\nenvironmental disasters, negative impacts on human alLd wildlife\nhealth and for the ability to determine carrying capacities of\ndifferent resource situations, together with knowledge of how to\nuse technological tools and processes for resolving such issues.\n"On the constructive side o 1 the picture, public and private\nentities are learning to use elements of remote sensing techniques\nto improve husbandry, harvesting and marketing of food and fiber\nproducts; to locate new supplies of fiber and mineral resources; to\nmonitor rates and volumes for harvesting, mining and disposal of\nwaste products; to evaluate features of transportation systems\n(including pipelines and power line transmissions; to detect and\ncalculate energy inefficiencies and to plan energy conservation\nprograms; to monitor conversions of land cover and land use; etc.\nA\n\n"The key factor in staying effecitvely on top of this overall,\ndynamic situation is the growing general capability for deriving\nessential, reliable information on short notice at affordable costs.\n"Since 1971 the Michigan State University Center for Remote\nSensing has been an important agent for advancing such capabilities\nin ooth private firms and public agencies in Michigan. To serve in\nthis manner, the CRS has been a resource for imagery materials,\ntechnical assistance and training. This adjunct service role has\nbeen increasing over the last two years and possibly is becoming\none of the Center\'s more important missions,\n"The activities and achievements within this... reporting\nperiod demonstrate the versatility of the CRS in responding to\n\nORIGINAL PAGE 15\n\n6\t\n\n"`\n\nOF POOR QUALITY\n\na substantial variety o f needs thoughout the state in addressing\nurgent problems and issues as well as broadening the usingcapabilities of Larger numbers of individuals and organizations,\nThe increasing trend for cost-sharingby users on individual\nprojects is another evidence of faith in the Center\'s competencies."\n\nDuring this reporting, year, a considerable variety of research studios,\ncontractual services and informational services and training, equipment\ninstallation and refinement was carried out. \t\n\nAs will be noted, the research\n\nstudies were carried out with most costs incurred reimbursed by the NASA\nGrant budget, but in some instances, collaborating user agencies shared in\nreimbursing related costs.\t\n\nWhat Are labelled this year as, "general\n\nmission" costs were, for the most part, also paid by the NASA Grant budget.\n"Contractual Services" direct costs, as implied by the term, were reimbursed in full by the client agency or firm; however, some indirect costs\ncan be implied, such as those funds spent over the past for developing\nstaff expertise, use of equipment and furnishings, heat, light and general\nadministration,\t\n\nFor these kinds of costs, a combination of NASA Grant and\n\nUniversity funds could be considered as having contributed.\nThe five research studies described in this report under section "A,"\n"Research Applications," were initiated and carried out by faculty scientists from University departments and some were conducted in partnership\nwith various user agencies consisting of federal and state of Michigan\ndepartments and divisions, growers associations and cooperatives and\nUniversity department and research agencies. \t\n\nThe leadership participation\n\nof faculty scientists involved considerable expenditures of their time and\nenemy which was paid for by the respective departmental budgets in terms\nof paying their salaries without any encumbrances on the NASA Grant funds.\nSection "B," "Contractual Services," consisted of four separate\n^t\n\n...;\n\nstudies carried out under contract with the user-client agency/.firm which\npaid for all costs involved.\t\n\nThe synoptic report for each describes the\n\nnature and scope of each and the amount of dollars contributed by the\nuser-client.\nThe activities described under section "C," "General Missions Accomplished," consist of four kinds of engagements described in separate\nsynopses.\t\n\nThese were activities in training programs (short courses), the\n\nstatus quo of the digital processing Micro-computer system with basic\n\n7\t\n\nORIGINAL PAGE IS\nOF POOR QUALITY\n\nsoftware packages and provision of a variety of information functions to\nagencies, students and faculty and the general public. Of these four activities, the participants\' tees in the short courses offset some of the\ndirect coats in training programs.\n\nSection "D" presents an up-date of the "informational summary" of\nquantitative information and is inr;^ ,aded Herein as a supplement to the\nproceeding synopses. This special report contains selected categories of\ninformation originally requested by NASA and initially compiled by the\nCanter principals, titled, \'"Project Information Deport," and submitted\nSeptember, 22, 1978.

Presently,\nforest data are gathered periodically through the cooperative efforts of\nthe MDNR, the U.S, Forest Service and the forest industry in Michigan. The\nmajor forest inventory of the entire ntutce is the Michigan Forest Survey.\nHowever, the survey is conducted only every 10 to 15 years, it is not sitespecific and it id statistically reliable only on a multi-county basis. The\nForest Management Division is interestetr in whether accurate forest information on a count y basis can be derived cost-effectively from Landsat data.\nThis demonstration study assessed the accuracy of mapping and estimating\nCi% area of scattered forestlands in southwestern Michigan from Landsat imagery.\nScattered small forestlands were of interest because the ratio of their perimeter length to areal extent is higher than Chose of extensive contiguous\nforests. In terms of ;tmage interpretation and mapping, an interpreter has\nto identify and delineate many more forest units and boundaries which\n\nincreases\t\n\nthe probability of committing identification and boundary errors.\nThe objectives of this study were: 1) to map forests using different\nLandsat image products from two seasons; 2) identify and map all errors by\ncomparitig the Landsat-derived forest maps iith a detailed forest cover type\nmap; 3) assess the accuracy of interpretation; 4) analyze the factors contributing to error; and 5) evaluate time, cost and image availability considersLions.\n\nBarry County in southwestern Michigan was selected as the study area\nbecause a detailed forest cover type map and recent aerial photography were\navailable. This county contains many scattered forested areas of various\nsizes and shapes within its land area of 144,780 hectares (357,751 acres).\n0ver 26 percent of the county is covered by forests which consist of many of\n\n10\n\n3\n\n11\n\ntha forest cover types found in Michigan, Of these forestlands, 99.2 percent are capable of producing commercial timber and two-thirds of them are\nin private ownership.\nAgriculture is the major land use (55%) in the county and includes\nfarming, livestock, dairy and poultry production. Principal crops are corn,\nwheat, oats, soybeans and dry beans,\nTerrain varies from level in the eastern townships to gently rolling in\nthe west. There are numerous wetlands although well-drained soils (foams and\nsandy loamy) predominate throughout the county.\nIt was decided that the optimal Landsat image may be a cloudless winter\nscene with snow cover on the ground bc,Z not on the trees. Under this condition, the tonal contrast between forested areas and other land cover types is\nvery high.\t\nw\n\nFor comparative purposes, an additional Landsat scene taken\n\nduring the growing season would be used.\nA Landsat scene from February 26, 1979 (E- 30358-15475) and one from\nSeptember 12, 1979 (E-30556-15460) were selected From available scenes produced on the EDIPS (EROS Digital Image Processing System) equipment. \t\n\nEDIPS\n\nimagery was preferred because the system has improved Landsat image quality\nby employing processing routines for radiometric and geometric corrections,\nhaze removal and edge enhancement.\nTwo image products of each Landsat scene were selected forinterpretation:\t\n\na Band 5 positive and a false-color composite of the winter scene, and\n\na false-color composite and a diazo-enhanced color composite of the fall scene.\nAll of the images were 185mm x 185mm (7.3 in. x 7.3 in.) transparencies.\nThe diazo color composite was produced to enhance (contrast stretch)\nforested areas using a density-specified process. \t\n\nFilm exposure for each\n\nband was determined through densitometric analysis of forest areas clearly\ndepicted on all black-and-white band positives and use of characteristic density (sensitometric) curves for each diazo film. \t\nt\ns\n\nThe false-color composite\n\nconsisted of one yellow diazo copy of Band 4, three magenta copies of Band 5\nand one cyan copy of Band 7.\nThe primary source of reference (ground truth) data was a recently\ncompleted forest cover type map of the county. \t\n\nfj\ny\nz\ni\n\nThe map was prepared from\n\nphotointerpretation of 1,1 0,110 scale color infrared (CIR) photography taken\nin 1974.\t\n\nIn cases where discrepancies between the Landsat forest maps and\n\nthig map were found, available 1:24,000 scale CIR photography acquired in\n\nr\n12\n1978 was used to resolve differences.\nSeparate forest maps and area estimates for the county were derived\nfrom visual interpretation of the four Landsat images. \t\n\nForest areas as\n\nsmall as ono hectare (2.5 acres) were delineated from these images onto\n1:50,000 scale county base maps using a precision rear projection system.\nThe interpretation entailed the identification and delineation of the\nboundaries of all forest areas without considering forest type or condition,\nand was performed by one interpreter, \t\n\nPrior to interpretation, the inter-\n\npreter trained himself to recognize the appearances of forestlands on each\nimage through analysis of a test area. \t\n\nTo minimize bias in interpretation\n\ndecisions due to experience gal.ied from a previous interpretation, the sequence of interpretation alternated between winter and fall scenes with a\none-week break between scenes.\t\n\nAn interpretation overlay showing the\n\nboundaries of forestlands was prepared from each Landsat image.\nThe existence of the forest cover type map of the county permitted a\ncomplete assessment of the accuracy of interpretation. \t\n\nAll errors in each\n\nLandsat forest map were iaentified and delineated onto separate overlays\nA.\n\n(fig. S) through comp aring each map superimposed on top of the forest cover\ntype map. \t\n\nRegistration was done on an individual forest tract basis since\n\nthe geometric projections of the Landsat imagery (Hotine Oblique Mercator)\nand the reference map (polyconic) were different.\nOmission errors were classified into forest type, stand size and\ndensity classes and commission errors were divided into seven land cover/use\ncategories (table x). \t\n\nThe omission and commission errors were further sep-\n\narated into boundary or identification errors. \t\n\nL ,aundary errors are areal\n\ndifferences in the perimeter (size and shape) of individual forestlands\nbetween the Landsat maps and reference map. \t\n\nErrors due to misinterpreting\n\nan entire forest tract or identifying a non-forest cover area as forest\nwere considered identification errors. identification errors are the most\nserious because individual parcels of Land of a certain class are absolutely\nlost by assigning them to another class.\nti\t\n\nAnother category was identified but not included in the accuracy as-\n\n^G\n\nsessmont because it did not represent Landsat classification error. This\ncategory consisted of individual forestlands that were corectly interpreted\non the Landsat images but were not shown on the forest type map. These lands,\nverified on recent aerial photography, were considered "overlooked forests"\n\n{\n\n\t\n\nu\n\n13\t\n\nORIGINAL PAGC IS\nOF POOR QUALITY\n\nwee\n0\n\nMq\n^`\':\n\nKd\n\nDa\tNS\n\nxz\n\n\tA\n\nA^\n\nD2\n\nUT\t\n\nA\n\na\t\n\nA \'^\t\n\nOE2\nA\n\n"o\no\ntk\n\na\t\n\ni^.J\t\n\nE\t\n\nA\t\n\n.\'\'\n\nKO\n\nK3\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\t\n\'a\n\nM\t\n\nq^~\'r\t\n\n@.

Forested areas which had been harvested since the\ncompilation of the forest cover type map were also included in this category.\n`i""Ile frequency and areal, extent of each type of error was determined\nfor each Landsat map. Areas were estimated using a cell grid having a 0,25\nhectare (0.625 acre) cell. size. All values were rounded off to one decimal\nplace.\nThree types of agreement or accuracy were calculated: interpretation,\nclassification and mapping. Interpretation agreement expresses the relative\nproportion of the total forest area mapped from Landsat to the total reference (actual) forest area of the county without considering errors of omission\nor commission. This type of accuracy is non-site specific and, therefore, is\nuseful, only if total area estimates are needed. Classification agreement expresses the relative proportion of the actual, forest area that was correctly\na,\t\n\nmapped as forest front Landsat taking into account only the omission errors.\nAs such, it indicates how accurately individual forest tracts were identified\nwithout considering the misinterpretation of non-forested areas :s Forests\n(i.e., commission\n\nerrors).\n\nMapping agreement provides a measure of the loci-\n\ntional or positional accuracy of the interpretation maps. It expresses the\nrelative proportion of the actual,\nforest, taking\n\ninto account\n\nforest area that was correctly\n\nmapped as\n\nboth errors of omission and commission.\n\nThe accuracies achieved with each type of Landsat image are given in\ntable It. Overall, the accuracies ranged from 74.0 to 98.5 percent and were\nhigher for the winter scene than\n\nthe fall\n\nscene. Mapping accuracy (which\n\nhas the greatest valijity) was the highest for the winter false-color composite (88.3 percent), whereas the diazo enhancement of the fall scene improved the mapping accuracy over the fall falser:.olor cAmpo6i,te. Considering\nall types of accuracy, the winter false-color composite image provided the\nmost accurate forest map of the county, although a diazo enhanced image of\nthe winter scene may even further improve accuracy.\nAn investigation was made of the major factors affecting interpretation errors. A summary of the various interpretation errors by type of\nLandsat image is presented in table III. Over 83 percent of all commission\nand omission errors were boundary errors. The accuracy of identifying Individual forest tracts from Landsat imagery (not considering their area) would,\ntherefore, be substantially higher than those presented in table It.\n\nr:\n\n1\n\n16\nNAj_ NAGS IS\nOR\xe2\x96\xbaG\xe2\x96\xba\nOF POOR Q111\\\'-I""\n\nt\nTABLE II,\n\nCLASSIFICATION, INTERPRET.V21011 AND :TAPPING ACREMENT BY TYPE\nOF UNDSAT MWE.\nT Y P\n\n`` *\t\n\nv\n\nw\t\n\n:1ac x-and-White\n\nwinter\n\nAvn"aa:10.1t\n\n:,craage\t\n\nt)\n\nAcroag0\n\n9\t\n\n,.\t\n\nDiaz\':)\n\nColor Winter\n\nColor fall\t\nAcreage\n\na\n\nI M rA C, E\n\nL n !l D 5 A T\t\n\nF\t\n\n4\n\npTotal\n\n^\'a..\t\n\n..orastod\n\xe2\x96\xba\t\n\nAcr0ar4a\n\nR\n\n^\n\njClassification\n\n56879.0\t\n\n95.0\n\n51513..2\n\ni inter-rotation\n\n56161.5\t\n\n89.5\n\n61265.7\n\n82.2\n\n51513.2\n\n92.8\n\n53571.9\n\n39,3\n\n1.1720.5\n\n97.7\t\n\n568".9,0\t\n\n55613.7\n\n86,0\t\n\nAc roaqu\n\n91.E\t ! 60751.9\n\n93.5\t\n\n4..\n\nr\n\nl\n\nMappin7\n\n5599 ,6\n\n_\n\n114.0\n\n561.\',.7\n\nI\t\n\n98.3\n\n$3571.9\n\n79.9\t 1\n\n41\n\nTABLE\n\nM.\n\nO\nEMOR S OF INTERPRETATION PERFORu\'vWCE BY TYPE OF L ANDSAT IMAGE\n\nFOR BARRY COUNTY, MICHIGAN,\nT\nOlACwtmta ; Mhtt\xe2\x80\xa2\nHtnter\n\nAbe.\n\n1\n\n?be,\n\nt N \'I L O A\n\nT\t\n\nrrnquency\n\n6\n\nrregllanvt\n\nAer0a0e\n\nAbe,\n\n4\n\n4bs,\n\nt M A 0 E\n\n41aso Call\n\ncolor Hlnkar\n\nColor tall\n\nAo,eage\n\nrrequcncy\n\n""t\n\ny p Z 0 r\t\n\nt\n\nAbe.\n\n93,11. 442\n\n!\n\nvre\n\nAOrOege\n1\n\nt\n\nt,be.\n\n1 Abe,\n\n17.6\n\n1 264).0\n\n8).8\n\n1127\n\nA,;reaie\n\n^!\n\nlbs.\n\n1\n\n76.1\n\n6957.1\n\n96.9\n\nt\n\n1255\n\n86.A\n\n7916.9\n\nn6,1\n\n1191\n\n92,2\n\n9111.9\n\nIle\n\n11.2\n\n1293.6\n\n17.9\n\n95\n\n7.6\n\n638.6\n\n6.4\n\n66\n\n12,1\n\n503.0\n\n16.2\n\n46\n\n1.9\n\n22216\n\n3.1\n\n141)\n\n100.0\n\n9262.5\n\n100.0 1291\n\n100.0\n\n9752.5\n\n100.0\n\n550\n\n100,0\n\n)106,8\n\n100.0\n\n1171\n\n100.0\n\n7160.0\n\n100.0\n\n$91\n\n90.6\n\n2610.6\n\n69.1\n\n1017\n\n85.6\n\n7296.4\n\n67.2\n\n076\n\n91.1\n\n1796.8\n\n89.1\n\n916\n\n86.0\n\n5465.1\n\n06.7\n\nHentlflcAtion\n\n60\n\n7.7\n\n726.2\n\n10,2\n\n172\n\n14,4\n\n1068.4\n\n12.2\n\n46\n\n1,4\n\n1 4650\n\n10.1\n\n122\n\n14.0\n\n01910\n\n11.)\n\nTotal\n\n651\n\n100.0\n\n2997,0\n\n100.0 11109\n\n100.0\n\n1362.3\n\n110.0\n\n766\n\n100,9\n\nX4262.1\n\n100.0\n\n1014\n\n100.0\n\n5704.1\n\n100.0\n\n11nundary\no\n\nw\nP,\n\nIdentlltCatlOr\n\n1\nu\nTotal\n\nC"\n\nboundary\nn\nu\n\n1 Tw-tl fusel acreages 59.876 acres,\n?

This was expected because of the high percent of boundary\nerror and agriculture being the major land use in the county. However,\naccuracy may be improved if treed bogs and brushlands are considered forested\nareas.\nThe frequency and area of misinterpreted forest cover type categories\n(omission errors) were proportional to their occurrence in the county. Both\nstocking level. (density) and stand size affected the interpretability of all\nforest cover types. forest stands of lower stocking level and small stand\nsize were more often misinterpreted, however, stocking level contributed\nmote to omission error than stand size.\nThe amount of time spent on interpreting each Landsat image, including\nreS istration j\n\ntraining Anil int erpretation, was r ecord ed.\n\nThe total\n\ntime. re-\n\nquired to map the forests of the county ranged from about 13 hours for the\nwinter color composite to 21 hours for the fall color composite.\nAnother factor considered was the availability of Landsat images for a\n^.\t\n\ngiven season. All available Landsat images of the county taken between 1972\nand 1980 were classified according to frequency and percent cloud cover. A\ntotal of 186 Landsat images have been taken since 1972 and, of these, only\n13 images (7 percent) have no cloud cover. Over 64 percent of all images\n\n^\t\n\nand over 93 percent of the winter scenes have a cloud cover of more than 40\n\n;t\n\npercent. The availability of cloud-free winter images is definitely much\nLower than clear fall images.\nThis study found that accurate acreage estimates of forestlands can be\nderived from Landsat imagery. The total forested area in .Barry County was\nestimated to be within 3 percent of reference data, although site-specific\naccuracies of the Landsat images ranged from 74.0% to 88.3%. The falsecolor composite of the winter Landsat scene (with snow cover) provided the\nmost accurate Forest map and diazo enhancement improved the accuracy achievable from the fall Landsat scene.\n\nIn light of the accuracy levels achieved, and considering the relative efficiency and availability of the technology, the Forest Management\nDivision, Michigan Department of Natural Resources, believes that Landsatderived forest statistics can provide a valuable supplement to current\nforest resources data. It is also likely that Landsat can provide the\nfirst level forest area statistics\n\nin the periodic\n\nused to up-date some of those statistics.\n\nforest surveys and be\n\nr\nORIGINAL PAGE 13\nOF POOR QUALITY\nA-2.\t\n\nA22lication of Remote Sensing for Assessment of Damage to Small\nGrains Caused by the Cereal Loaf Beetle\nDepartment of Entomology\nMichigan State university\nEast i.ansing, Michigan \t 48824\n\n(517) 353-9081\nInvestigators from the Center for Remote Sensing, in collaboration\nwith faculty of the MSU Department of Entomology, conducted a small pilot\nstudy a:tTed at ;incorporating information from remote sensing data into\n\n`\n\non-Line integrated pest management programs. \t\n\nObjei^,tives of the study were\n\nto evaluate remote sensing information as to its ability to provide costeffective information on the location, intensity and extent of crop damage\nresulting from pests.\t\n\nSuch information capabilities could lead to improved\n\ncrop loss evaluation systems and/or more effective pest control procedures.\nThe cereal leaf beetle is a pest of small grains in many Locations in\neastern North America.\t\n\nIt has since spread from its initial introductory loca-\n\nduring the 1950\'x.\t\n\ni\n\nn\n\t er;\t\nt on\nG^S.I Ll ( 17 CS; I:I CL7\n\ngrains.\t\n\nty\t\n\nCoun ty ,\n\neastern seaboard.\t\n\nThe beetle was accidentally introduced into Michigan\n\nMi ch i gan) as\n\t\n\nfar\t\nLaL\n\nw es t\t\nt\n\na s so u\n\nth\nw\t\n\nern\n\nLT.t..\t\nn\n\n.1\n\nnJ.0 4.oiZQ d.n\n\nto\n\nt.\n\nThis pest can cause variable levels of damage to small\n\nIn some instances, losses have been estimated at 25 percent in oats.\n\nDamage occurs to .leaves of the crop since the beetle adults and larvae feed\non the upper leaf surface and remove green tissue.\nFaculty investigators chose an on-going field experimental plot to\ntest the remote detection capabilities of remote sensing. \t\n\nThis field con-\n\ntained a replicated test of the effect of cereal leaf beetle on oats.\nPlots were randomly assigned a treatment of cereal leaf beetle infestation,\nmoisture stress, cereal leaf beetle and moisture stress, and control plots.\nAn aerial photographic mission was then flown over the test plots in June\n1980.\n\nA densitometric analysis was made of the color-infrared film which\nconsisted of measuring transmittance through the individual dye layers of\nthe film.

Objectives of the study were to evaluate remote sensing information as to its\nability to provide cost-effective information on the location, intensity\nand extent of tree fruit damage resulting from diseases. Such information\ncapabilities could lead to improved crop loss evaluation systems and/or\nmore effective disease control procedures.\nX-disease, caused by a mycoplasma, is a major problem in southwest\nMichigan and in certain other areas of the state of Michigan.

The disease occurs over a\nwide area of southwest Michigan and is the major disease problem at this\ntime. A method of rapidly determining disease incidence in individual\npeach and cherry orchards is needed to establish the effectiveness of control procedures and for conducting research on disease spread.\nFire blight, caused by the bacterium Erwinia aMZlovora, is the major\ndisease problem faced by pear growers. Blight is also a problem on susceptible apple varieties. The disease causes loss of blossoms and fruit,\nbut its most serious effect is reduced future production due to destruction\nof fruiting wood.\nThe objectives of this study were to determine the utility of aerial.\nIR photography to detect disease infected trees in individual orchards\nlocated in southwest Michigan.

The Department of Resource Development, in cooperarion with tho\nCenter, will determine the usefulness and costs of aerial survey methods\nfor obtaining -gregata bean area estimates. lE successful,, these techniques coi:ld be operationalized by the Michigan Bean Commission to provide\nreliable crop-specific area estimates at reduced costa.\n\n22\n\n\xc2\xa9Rtt^tNA^ P UA^^"\nQ\nOFPOOR\n\nA-3t Delimitin g Areas of Virus Inf\n\nDepartment of Botany and Plant Pathology\nMichigan State University\nEast Lansing, Michigan 48824\n\n(517) 355-4683\nU.S. Department of Agriculture\n:National Crape Cooperative\nMichigan Blueberry Growers Association\nDuring May 1,981, staff membars from the Center acquired close-range,\n35mm color and color infrared transparencies of grape vines and blueberry\nbushes which were propagated in the research greenhouses on campus. \t\n\nBx-\n\nampler of both healthy and diseased symptom-bearing individuals were\nphotographed.\t\n\nThese slides provided a "first look" at the utility of\n\nphotography to detect peach rosetta mosaic virus in graph vines and blueblueberries.\t\n\nberry shoestring virus in highbush \t\n\nInterpretation of this\n\nimagery showed that in certain diseased individuals, subtle chlorosis or\nleaf surface mottling was detectable on both film types but sli ghtly more\nobvious on this color infrared photographs. \t\n\n_\n\nsymptomless plants were available for study. \t\n\nNo examples of diseased but\nThis experiment was also com-\n\nplicated by a probable nitrogen deficiency in some of the plants photographed\nwhich prodtaced additional stress symptoms.\nPeach rosette mosaic virus, to which Michigan\'s $10 million per annum\nConcord grape crop is particularly susceptible, has cost the growers tens\nof millions of dollars over the last thirty years. \t\n\nIn highbush blueberries,\n\nwhich contribute; about $25 million each year to the state\'s economy, the\nblueberry shoestring virus causes annual losses of ^Nbout $3 million. \t\n\nBoth\n\nof these diseases have a multi-year dormant, symptomless period prior to\nthe time visual symptoms appear.\t\n\nThese infectious, symptomless plants make\n\ncontrol of these diseases particularly difficult.\nIt is envisioned that remotely sensed imagery may be able to discriminate between healthy, diseased symptomless and symptom-bearing grape\nvines and blueberry bushes.\t\nt\nY\t\n\n^.\n\nIf successful, this application of remote\n\nsensing will provide an effective, fast and relatively inexpensive procedure\nfor growers to assess the true extent of infection within their fields and\nmove completely control these devastating diseases,\n\n23\n\nP\n,`\'\xe2\x80\x9e 4\nDuring the upcoming growing seasoa, large-scale color and color infrared 70mm aerial imagery will be acquired of rest fields near Lawton (graces),\nHolland (blueberries) and West Olive (blueberries), Michigan, Extensive\nground truth information in these test plots will also be collected including ground-based and aerial tower photography (color, CIR and multiband)\nand botanical sampling, Extremely accurate laboratory procedures are\navailable (ELISA testing) to detect the presence of either of these two\ndiseases in cut samples of the plants providing precise control for our\ntests nk remotely-sensed data,\n\nORIGINAL PACE IS\nOF POOR QUALITY"\n\nSection B: C0ATR.ACTUAL SBRVICES\nThe Center for Remote Sensing has been providing technical services\nsince 1973 under contractual arrangements for public and private agencies\nwhich do not need remote sensing-derived information or analysis/evaluative\nprocesses frequently enough to justify establishing their own specialized\ntechnical staf^a with the basic equipment, imagery resources and other\nlogistical means. Those agencies that do have regular need for remote\nsensing personnel and processes and attempt to set up their own remote\nsensing laboratories (such as state departments of transportation) have\neither to try to recruit qualified technicians from a very limited market\nor arrange for training for their own personnel already on board.\nThe MSU Center has been able to ihelp public and private agencies by\nserving, under contractual agreements, as consultants, to provide whatever\nremote sensing services may be needed..... from at;quiring required magery>\ndoing the necessary interpretation, plotting, evaluating, preparing needed\ncartographic formats, developing computer software and analysis routines,\netc. The Center is also able to provide training for industrial groups\n(like foresters), for Cooperative Extension Service specialists, for business personnel groups and for public agency personnel. Many of these kinds\nof service experiences generate further requests for assistance.\nDuring this 1984-81 reporting year, four contractual units were coi*\n\npleted:\nB-1 Important Farmlands Inventory\nB-2:\nB-3:\n\nDelineation of Possible Crop Stress Due to Excessive\nSoil Chlorides\n\nB-4:\n\nr-\n\nStatewide sand Cover Mapping from Landsat\n\nMichigan High Priority Sand Dune Areas Land Use Change\nAnalysis\n\nCase B-1, an inventory of important farmlands in a group of Michigan\ncounties, is a continuing commission from the USDA Soil Conservation Service\nin force for several years whereby contracts are offered to the CRS at\napproximately yearly intervals to inventory additional blocks of five or\n\nt\n:y\n\nmore counties. Presumably, these contractual assignments will continue\nuntil all of the 83 Michigan counties will. have been analyzed.\n\n25\nQ 1. Y\n\n^f\n\nr\n26\n\nCase B-2 was commissioned by the Michigan Department of Transportation\n(DOT) to develop processes whereby available black-and-white imagery could\nbe color-enhanced to produce sharper contrasts for land cover identification which could be more rapidly identified, delineated and digitized as\ninputs to the geographic information system of DOT. The products of the\nstudy were accepted as Cully satisfactory for the agency\'s purposes.\nCase B-3 was commissioned by the Dow Chemical, Company which needed a\nreliable basis for determining the legitimacy of claims for crop loss and\nthe amount of compensation, if needed, for crops damaged by alleged leaks\nin a brine pipeline. The CRS delivered the full, information for which it\nwas commissioned.\nCase B-4 involved a contract from the Michigan Geological Survey Division to detect and classify land use changes over a 15-year period within\nthe barrier dune formations of Michigan\'s high priority sand dude resources,\nIntrusions of residential and recreational land uses and activities have\ngenerated serious modifications and damage to the ecological structure of\nmany areas of such fragile, unique resource areas. The resulting tabulations of information are being used by the state to establish revised\npriorities for the lands purchase program in the continuing efforts to\npreserve these dwindling precious resources.\nThese four commissioned studies do represent a tide variety of subjects, Yet they do offer certain similarities in that they were routine\ninventorying of the condition and characteristics of different conditions\nof terrain. Each of these studies were conducted at the request and initiation of the user agencies; and, as in the past, none of these were\nsolicited by the Center ..... all were requests from users who viewed remote\nL\n\nr\n\nsensing as the best, if not the only, means for obtaining the neededinformation. The accomplishment of these interesting four studies has advanced\nthe technical capabilities and versatility of the Center staff; have added\nto the reputation and image of the Center as a highly reliable and productive operation. The Center principals are pleased to have been able to\nserve effectively important groups and agencies in Michigan and at the\nfederal. level.\n\n\'E\n\n\t\n\nA-l: Short Course in Remote Sensing, for Forest Inventory\nDuring the 1973-74 period, the MSU Remote Sonsi.ng Project conducted\n\ni14\n\n\t\n\na study of the full territory of Mason Co%;i..,ty, Michigan at the request of\nthe reason County Soil Conservation Service and an industrial timber harvesting and wood products firm for their use in locating merchnnti.ble timber\nwithin economic haul of processing plants and in delineating the limits of\nownership parcels. Both private and public forested bracts were analyzed.*\nAs a follow-up on that endeavor, a group of industrial and public\nagency foresters, operating in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, requested\nthe conduct of a short course on the application of remote sensiictg for inventorying forest resources with emphasis on the use of color-infrared\nphotography.\nIn October 1980, the Center for Remote Sensing, in cooperation with\nLifelong Education Programs and the Department of \'forestry, conducted a\nthree-day short course on the application of remote sensing for forest inventories at Bay De Noc Community College in Escanaba, Michigan.\nThis introductory short course was designed for practicing foresters\nwho utilize and/or are familiar with aerial photography. The course :focused\non the use of medium-scale (1:24 ) 000) color infrared aerial photography to\nmap forest cover types. Specific topics included a review of basic principles of stereoscopy, photometrics and elements of airphoto interpretation,\nthe characteristics and interpretation of color infrared rhotography and the\napplication of airphoto interpretation of ,forest resources. One half-day\nsession was devoted to field verification of an interpretation exercise.\nOf the twenty participants who attended the short course, 11 were industrial foresters, one was an employee of the Gogebic County Forestry Commission and eight were from various offices of the U.S. Forest Service.\nComments from these participants indicated that the course was a total success.\nMany felt that the techniques learned will allow them to gain more information\nfrom imagery, cut down on field work and make their inventory procedures more\ncost-effective.\n\n*This Mason County study has been reported in three fromats: a) as a special,\nsummary package report; b) as an item in the 1973 and 1974 semi-annual reports; and c) as a separately published complete report (1974).\n27\ni\n\nB-2; Installation of Landsat Digital Processing System\n\nPersonnel from the Center for Remote Sensing and the Earth Resources\nData Analysis Systems, Inc. (ERDAS) have completed the installation of the\nERDAS micro-computer system. The Michigan State University Agricultural\nExperiment Station provided $50,000 in funding to the Center for Remote\nSensing for the purchase of the ERDAS system. The ERDAS system features\nboth ^j grld-bused geographic information software package and a Landsat\ndigital analysis software package. Faculty and staff of Michigan State\nwill utilize the ERDAS system for future research and application projects\nfunded under the NASA grant.\nThe ERDAS system is a stand-alone computer system based around a\n2-80 Central Processing Unit (CPU), supporting ASSEMBLER, BASIC, FORTRAN\nand PASCAL programming languages. Other hardware includes dual double density, double sided floppy disk drives, a joystick cursor control, CRT,\nmatrix printer and RGB color monitor. The ERDAS system is interfaced with\nMichigan State\'s Control Data Corporation Cyber 750 mainframe computer to\nof far maximum data pro cess ing flexibility.\nThe Landsat software package is a modular interactive system permitting color display of a 240 by 256, three band, .false color image of a\nuser selected subscene. The Landsat software includes supervised training\nsite selection, visual enhancement, haze correction, maximum likelihood\nclassification and unsupervised classification. Output is in the .Corm of\na color display and computer line printer maps.\nThe IMGRID geographic information system is a menu driven, interactive\ngrid based software system with a 512 by 480 color display. Designed to allow the user to y asily integrate Landsat data into a geographic data base\nwith other nai.ural resource data such as soils, topography, etc., the IMGRID\nsystem FallowG the user to store and access natural resource information,\nprovide rapid access and analysis capabilities and to create and evaluate\nalternative scenarios for resolution of land management issues. IMGRID\noutput is in the form of color display and computer line printer maps.\n\n28\n\n2\n\nr\n\nB-3: IMAGE 2 Software Developed\n\nMSU\'s Center for Remote Sensing (CRS) has developed version 2.0 of\nthe IMAGE Manipulation and Geographic Evaluation System, IMAGE 2 is a software package for the supervised classification of Landsat multispectral\nscanner data which is a Dart of the Center\'s technical aid in support of\nfaculty and student research at Michigan State.\nIMAGE 2 software provides students with an opportunity to learn the\n,fundamental concepts of digital image processing and analysis through "handson" experience. The IMAGE 2 package consists of\nprograms which\n\nare accessed\n\nBASIC language computer\n\nthrough IMAGES, a Fortran language program that\n\nserves as an interface between the user and MSU\'s interactive system. The\nflow of information through the image processing system is shown on the\nfollowing figure (Figure I). The functions of the individual programs consist of: CNUT--reformats any EDIPS BIL or BSQ CCT for use on MSU\'s CDC\nCyber 750; IMAGES--a ,file handling routine which Loads and executes user-\n\nselected IMAGE\n\n2 software modules; SUBIMG --selects\n\na subset\n\nfrom a refor-\n\nmatted disk file of the original Landsat scene; GREY--generates a computer\nline printer "gray scale" map of a\nselectsrectangular areas to serve\n\nuser- selected Landsat band; TRAIN-as training sets in a supervised clas-\n\nsification; TEST--selects rectangular test sites to access the classification accuracy; SPCCTRL--computes and outputs co-spectral plots for each\ntraining set; CLASIFY--a minimum distance classifier utilizing a maximum\ndistance limit; and ACCNT--which\n\nselectively reviews or\n\ndeletes subimages,\n\ntraining sets or test sets.\nThe IMAGE 2 package has recently been incorporated into the MSU De-partment of Geography\'s course in advanced remote sensing.\n\n29\n\n\t\n\nORIGIN AL\n\nPAGE I5\t\n\n30\n\nOF POOR QUALITY\n\nt\n\nIMAGE2 Data Processing Flow\nLandsat\t\n\nIr\n\nLandsat\n\nCCT\t\n\n,t\t\n\nCOT\n\nVol.T\t\n\nVol.X\t\n\nLEGEND\n\nat\n= at\n\nTAPE\n\nCNVT\ns\n\nDISK\nFILE\n\nIMAGE 1 - 4\t\n(Reformatted\nImago files)\n\nPROGRAM\nDATA\nAcquIsItIon\t\n4~\t\n\nSUl31M(3\t\n\nSUS 1 - 4\t\n\nHIST 1 - 4\n{histogram\nfiles)\t\n\nDISPLAY\t\n\n(subimage\nfiles)\t\n\nSupervised\t\nfeature\t\nextraction\t\ni\ni\n\nGRAY\t\n\nLine Printer\t\n------GREY map\t\n\nCLASSIFY\nand DISPLAY\n\nSPECTRL\t\n\nCLASIFY\n\n^\ni\t\n4 --\t\n\n:a\t\n\nline printer\n-------\t\n\n----- classification\nmap\n\nr\n\n..............\nuser analysis\nan d Input\nfile Input\n\nsupervised\nfeature\nextraction\nTEST\n\nTRAIN\t\n\nAnalysis\n\n7\t\n\nPRINT\nFILE\n\nA\n\nS-4: Informational Programs\nV\n\nMichigan State Remote Sensing Newsletter\nThe Center began producing a quarterly newsletter (the first edition\nwas March 1981) which is distributed principally in-state.

These kinds of missions curried out during the reporting year are\ndescribed in Section "A" of this document, of secondary priority are\n\nthose missions performed for public and private institutions at their\n\nC\n\n\t\n\nrequest and for which service they reimburse at least direct costs and\nmany payments include coverage of estimated indirect costs (utilities, use\nof equipment and furnishings, administration/supervision), These "contractual services" executed for 1580-81 are reported under the pr4ceding\nSection "B."\nBoth of the "A" and "B" categories of missions are more or less carried\non simultaneously by different teams of research staff and faculty scientists. Staff principals perform the many roles within supervision and\nmanagement and, in so doing, are overseeing all of the on-going activities,\nBut, in addition to these dynamics, they are directing the inevitable\narray of daily tasks, such as responding to requests for information,\nmaterials (particularly imagery, maps, etc.) and assistance in application\nmethods and interpretation,\nNeed for organizational training programs is an ever-present expression, but for which response cannot be provided without user-participants\npaying for costs incurred. With deteriorating fiscal constraints on every\ninstitution, the availability of funds for training short courses has become severely curtailed. It is most unfortunate that special funding for\nmulti-level training cannot be obtained whereby agency and firm staffs\ncan be progressively enabled to work with wider and deeper elements of\n\nn\t\n\nremote sensing technology.\nInterspersed with these research application and contractual units,\ntraining and informational services, the Center staff members are steadily\nlaboring at strengthening their individual and team expertise which becomes the collective expertise of the Center for ultimate transference to\nfaculty, students and agency personnel. These efforts are never-ending;\n\n1-\n\n32\n\nis\n\nr\n33\n\nthey must be continually carried forward as gaps of time, energy and momentum accommodate.\nTwo of these kinds of missions are reported in this section, namely\nC-2 0 Installation of Landsat Digital Processing System, and C-3, Image 2\nSoftware Developed. Subsequent to this yeer being reported, activities\nin this category of expanding and strengthening the expertise of the Center\nin the skilled use of the newer emergent data sets and the computerassisted means for eliciting maximum information from them and providing\nunequalled capabilities for comparative experimentation for the formulation\n\t\nu\n\nof significant findings of high social and economic potential value have\nbeen advanced considerably.

About 22 square miles (14,161 acres or 5,735\nhectares) of the Lake Michigan sand dune shoreline wars analyzed.\nThe specific objectives of the study were,\na.\n\nTo identify and delineate on acetate overlays all present\n(1978) developed and undeveloped Land (2.5 acres or more\nin size) within the barrier, dune formations (utilizing\n1975, 1.:24,000 1 color infrared aerial photographs).\n\nb.\n\nTo identify and delineate on acetate overlays the pattern of developed/undeveloped :land at an earlier time\n(utilizing 1963 to 1967, 1.20,000 or 1.15,840, blackand-whi,te panchromatic aerial photography).\n\nc.\n\nTo compare: the past and present developed/undeveloped land\nto determine the location and sextant of land development\nsince the 1963 to 1967 time window.\n\nThe study showed than less than one-fifth (18.0 percent) of this 22\nsquare mile aggregate sensitive environmental zone has been developed to\ndate. The results of the change-detection analysis show that 754 acres of\nnew\n\nland development has occurred on these dunes since 1963. Although this\n\nrepresents only 5.3 percent of the total dune study area,\n\nit\n\nreveals that\n\n29.6 percent of all presently developed land became converted in Just the\nlast 15 years. The greatest development pressure on these barrier dunes\nresults from continuing expansion of residential land uses. All other land\nuse conversions combined constituted less than 15 percent of the dune land\nconversions in the study area since. 1963.\n\n37\n\n38\nDetermining the magnitude and location of these land use changes\nwithin the sand dune area will allow the stank to prioritize ite acquisition program of preserving unique dune environments.\n\nn\n\nSection D: IN FORMATI O H A L S U M M\n\nit\n\nIt Y -- Update of Quan f,i-\n\ntative Information on Center Operations\n\nThe 1979 Annual Progress Report included for the first time a section\n\ni\n\nwhich has since become a standard component of annual reporting, Reference\n.`\t\n\nis made here to the "Informational Summary," a systematic tabulation of\nspecified data about cumulative features and accomplishments of the Center\nfor Remote Sensing, including those elements carried on with NASA grant\nfunds and those with other funding resources$\nThe categories of reported information were specified by the University\nApplications Program of NASA.
