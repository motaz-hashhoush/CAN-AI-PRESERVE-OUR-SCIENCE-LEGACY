b'Industrial Productivity and Manufacturing Technology\n\nS a Business Innovalions\nml\nCongress established the Small\nBusiness Innovation Research (SBIR) program\nas a means of increasing opportunities for\nsmall businesses to participate in federal R&D\nactivities. A related objective was to stimulate\nconversion of government-funded R&D into\ncommercial applications; that benefits the U.S.\neconomy-in terms of jobs created and\ncontribution to the Gross Domestic Product-\n\nwhen the SBIR project generates a commercial\nspinoff.\nEach technology generating agency of the\ngovernment sets aside a percentage of its R&D\nbudge for SBIR projects. There are 11 such\nagencies, each administering its own program\nindependently under policy guidelines set by\nthe Small Business Administration.\n\nJ\nEIC Fiber %tic Raman\n\n4)e&graPh\n\nE-TEK High EsEindon Ratio Electmoptic Switch\n\nNASA\'s SBIR program\nhas been eminently\nsuccessful. It has\nprovided the agency\nan additional\nsource-beyond\ntraditional aerospace\nfirms-of R&D talent\nand innovative\nthought. Hundreds of\nnew systems that\nadvance NASA\'s\ncapabilities for\naerospace research\nand operations have\nemerged from the\nSBIR program. About\none of every three\nSBIR projects results\nin a commercial\nspinoff.\n\nAmong representative examples of SBIR\nprojects in the field of industrial productivity is\na family of spectroscopic instruments developed by EIC Laboratories, Inc., Norwood,\nMassachusetts. EIC\'s instruments are based on\nRaman spectroscopy, a laser-based measurement technique that provides-through a\nunique vibrational spectrum-a molecular\n"fingerprint." Raman offers an advantage over\ninfrared absorption techniques in its ability to\nfunction in aqueous environments. EIC is\ncombining optical fiber technology with\nRaman methods to develop sensors that can be\noperated at a considerable distance from the\nlaser excitation source and the spectrographic\nanalysis instrumentation.\nThat technology was substantially advanced\nunder a NASA SBIR contract designed to\nproduce a Raman spectrograph with fiber optic\nsampling for such space applications as sensing\nhazardous fuel vapors, monitoring hydrogen\ngas, and making on-board rapid analyses of\nchemicals and minerals.\nEIC successfully developed the NASA system\nthen, using its own capital, refined the technology to create a commercially available Fiber\nOptic Rarnan Spectrograph and an associated\npatented RamanProbeTM,fiber optic probe\na\nthat can make measurements up to 500 meters\ndistant from the spectrograph. The system has\nno moving parts and is 10 times more compact\nthan prior equipment.\nAmong industrial applications of the system\nare process control, polymer processing,\nanalyzing liquid mixtures, corrosion analyses,\nmonitoring hazardous materials, quality\nassurance assessments, and use in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals and semiconductors.\nThe Raman spectrograph and probe system has\nbeen a singularly successful technology transfer, one that brought EIC $3 million in sales\nover a two-year period and resulted in creation\nof a new company division-EIC Raman\nSystems-to provide commercial Raman\ninstruments and services.\nAnother example of a successfully commercialized NASA SBIR project is the work of E-TEK\nDynamics, Inc., San Jose, California. Founded\nin 1983, E-TEK initially confined its activities to\n\nR&D in the fiber optic, microwave/millennium\nwave, and integrated opto-electronics disciplines. Since 1990, however, the company has\nbeen manufacturing and marketing a line of\nintegrated optic and fiber optic components\nand instruments; annual sales grew from $2\nmillion to $32 million in the 1990s and\nemployment increased about tenfold.\nE-TEK has worked on a number of NASA\nSBIRs. One of them, sponsored by Kennedy\nSpace Center (KSC), called for a new line of\nelectro-optic switches for fiber optic communications and optical signal processing applications. KSC wanted faster switch speeds, substantially smaller switches and much improved\ntemperature stability.\nUnder the SBIR, E-TEK developed a line of\nmicrofabricated switches with nanosecond\nspeed, extremely low crosstalk and the requisite temperature stability. The technology\ndeveloped in the KSC project was integrated in\nE-TEK\'s commercial product line, specifically\nin a High Extinction Ratio Electro-optic Switch\nfor high speed communications and optical\nsignal processing, a 4x4 Switch Module, and a\nProgrammable Fiberoptic Switch for routing\noptical signals, automatic optical testing and\nfiber optic communications.\n(Continued)\n%imanProbe is a trademark of EIC Laboratories, Inc.\n\nETEKProgrammable Fiberoptic Switeh\n\nIndustrial Productivity and Manufacturing Technology\n\nS a Business lnnova lions\nml\n\nantintmi\n\neach Space Shuttle flight, an extraordinary amount of ground processing is required\nto assure safe and effective operation of the\nShuttle and its payloads. To shave the time,\nlower the costs and increase the efficiency of\nthese ground processing operations, NASA has\nturned increasingly to automated systems. But\nrobotic systems pose problems, too; there is the\nchance that an errant robot might damage\ncritical flight hardware.\nKennedy Space Center (KSC) saw a need for\nan obstacle detection system to insure that\nrobots avoid collisions in their workplace.\nAccordingly, KSC sponsored a Small Business\nInnovation Research (SBIR) program with\nMerritt Systems, Inc. (MSI), Merritt Island,\nFlorida, a research and consulting firm with\nspecial expertise in whole-arm proximity\nsensing technology for dextrous robot manipuMerritt Systems\' Tom Pigoski\n\nmonitors the M.SI Obstacle\nDetedon System as it directs\na robot arm awayan\nobstacle.\n\nlators. From 1991 to 1995, KSC and MSI\nworked together on four SBIR projects to\ndevelop sensing and control technology for\nwhole-arm robot manipulators.\nFrom this work, Merritt Systems has developed\na unique sensing architecture that allows\nretrofitting existing types of robots with a\nwhole-arm obstacle detection and avoidance\nsystem that offers applications for NASA, other\ngovernment agencies and their contractors,\nand also has broad potential for commercial\nuse in such areas as robotic manufacturing\nsystems, remote hazardous waste cleanup, and\nhigh value robotic tasks in constrained\nenvironments.\nThe key elements of the MSI system are the\ninnovative sensorskin and its associated\ncompact, low cost smartsensor modules. Made\n\nof flexible material, the sensorskin can be cut\nand shaped to fit the mechanical arm of a\nrobot. Within the skin is a distributed array of\nsensors-more than 1,000 of them, including\nproximity, motion, contact,lforee and temperature sensors-networked interchangeably over\na single four-conductor wire. Each compact\nmodule contains on-board intelligence to\nl\nperform al the analog processing and handle\nall communicationsbetween the module and\nthe control computer. An on-board\nmicrocontroller processes the sensor information and transmits only relevant information\nback to the control computer.\n\nMSI also developed a control algorithm for\nactive collision avoidance during robot arm\nmotions; as obstacles are eneountered, a\nmanipulator arm will react to avoid the obstacle while at the same time maintaining its\n\ndesired end-effector position and orientation.\nThe algorithm is incorporated in MSI\'s Robot\nSimulation and Control Environment (RSCE),\nwhich also provides kinematic control and\nthree-dimensional graphic animation of\nrobotic devices. The RSCE is designed as a\ntool for robotics training, analysis, design\nand control applications.\nRobots incorporating the MSI sensorskin and\nsmartsensor technology are now being used\nin Space Shuttle processing. MSI proceeded\nto commercialize the technology; the initial\ncommercial systems were delivered in 1995.\nMSI is investigating new applications in a\nvariety of fields, including industrial process\nmonitoring, building security, medical\ninstrumentation and intelligent automation\napplications.\n(Continued)\n\nAn operator adjusts the\nObstacle M\n\na robot arm.\n\no\n\nn System in\n\nD\nIndustrial Productivity and Manufacturing Technology\n\nSmall Business lnnova lions\n\nantinu,\n\nhydrides are chemical compounds\nformed by the reaction of hydrogen with\nmetals, alloys or intermetallic compounds.\nMetal hydrides that react at room temperature\nwere discovered in the 1960s. Even before that\nthey had found many practical applications, for\nexample, in processing steel, coating and\nbonding processes, in the preparation of metal\npowders, and in portable hydrogen generators\nfor weather balloons.\n\n1\n\ntheir ability to store\nhydrogen in a solid\nstate, an area that has\nnot been widely\nexploited. Since\nhydrogen is a common spacecraft\npropellant, but\ndifficult to store,\nNASA was interested\nin the potential of\nmetal hydrides as a\nmeans of storing.\n\n1\n1\n\nI\n\nII\n\nI\n\nHydwgm Consultana, 1%.\ndew@& a nrpa metd\n\nf\n\nhydridemn-fm\nextended stomge ofindwtrialuse hydrogen.\n\ning the hazards of\n\nhydrogen.\n\nMarshall Space Flight\nCenter (MSFC)\nawarded a Small\nBusiness Innovation\nResearch (SBIR)\ncontract to Hydrogen Consultants, Inc. (HCI),\nLittleton, Colorado to explore the utility of\nmetal hydrides in spacecraft hydrogen systems.\nA follow-on Phase I1 SBIR directed HCI to\ndesign and develop two prototype hydride\nsystems identified as promising in the Phase I\neffort: a Long Term Hydrogen Storage System\nfor space use and a Metal Hydride Refrigerator\nfor possible use aboard the International Space\nStation.\n\nHCI delivered prototype systems to MSFC for\ntesting. The Metal Hydride Refrigerator is\nthermally powered and can operate off a low to\nmoderate source of waste heat, which makes it\nideal for spacecraft applications where electric\npower carries a big weight penalty. Clearly, the\nrefrigerator also has broad potential for Earth\napplications in view of the fact that it requires\nno compressor, a significant advantage in light\nof the planned phaseout of terrestrial freonbased refrigeration systems.\nThe Long Term Hydrogen Storage System\ndelivered to MSFC enables storage of 10\npounds of hydrogen in a vessel only 15 inches\nin diameter and 32 inches long; its principal\nadvantages are extended storage time and its\ncompactness, compared with conventional\ncryogenic (very low temperature) storage. HCI\nhas drawn upon its SBIR work to produce a\ncommercial derivative of the technology under\nthe trade name SOLID-H.\nSOLID-H systems are a series of compact\ncontainers in which hydrogen is stored in solid\nstate, offering an attractive alternative to large\nhigh-pressure cylinders and small disposable\ncylinders in industrial storage applications.\nHydrogen gas is converted to solid state by a\nchemical absorption process in which the gas\nreacts with powdered metal crystals within the\ncontainer to form metal hydrides. The hydrogen can be stored at room temperature and\nreleased without high pressures by decomposition of the metal hydrides, which liberates the\nhydrogen while returning the crystals to their\noriginal state. Among SOLID-H advantages\ncited by HCI are economy, safety,\nrechargeability of the containers, and their\ncompactness; the containers are 9 1/2 inches\nhigh, 6 to 6 \'/2 inches wide at the base, weigh\nonly 4 \'/2 to 9 pounds, and have capacities from\n40 to 140 liters.\nAnother example of a NASA SBIR project that\nspawned commercial products is the work of\nBarr Associates, Inc., Westford, Massachusetts.\nEstablished in 1971, Barr has been a supplier\nof optical filters to NASA, the European Space\nAgency, and other space-oriented organizations\nsince the company\'s inception. Barr has\nprovided filters for instruments used in such\nNASA projects as the Hubble Space Telescope,\n\nthe Galileo spacecraft, the Cassini planetary\nexplorer to be launched in 199\'7, and the\nMultiple-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer\nslated for space service in 1998. The company\'s\nfilters have flown on, or are scheduled to fly\non, more than 40 space-based instruments.\nIn 1989, Barr was awarded an SBIR contract by\nJet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to develop\nand fabricate advanced technology, image\nquality, space-qualified ultraviolet (W)\ninterference filters. W filters are thin filmcoated windows that act like sunglasses on\ninstruments to enhance scientific observations,\nsuch as ozone studies, planetary atmospheric\ncompositions, or the chemical reactions of\nenvironmental pollutants. Over a two-year\nperiod, Barr developed an advanced ionassisted deposition process, which enabled\ncreation of filters that eliminated certain\ntechnical problems associated with earlier\nfilters and also broadened the range of environments in which the filters can be used.\nBarr has since refined the JPL deposition\ntechnology and used it in a commercial line of\nfilters that have utility in such applications as\nfiber optic communications, hand-held spectrometers, tabletop laboratory analyzers and a\nvariety of industrial applications. The filters are\nstable, durable, provide high spectral performance, and can be fabricated in miniature\nsizes for portable instruments.\n\nBarr developed an advanced\nionassisted physical vapor\nhi& performance filters fm\n$ber optic communications\nand other applications.\n\nI\n\nA BarrhsociatRF teahnieian\nunlwds afilterJioma\nchamber where thinfiIm\ncoatings\nto\nultravioletfilters.\n\n'
