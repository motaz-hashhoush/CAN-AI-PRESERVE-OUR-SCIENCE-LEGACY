Red crystals of the compound obtained by layering with hexanes were subjected to single crystal X-ray diffraction. The structure was refined to R = 0.026 and R(sub w) = 0.036 in a space group P1bar (No. 2), with Z = 2, a = 13.983 (2) A, b = 15.384 (2) A, c = 9.660 (1) A, alpha = 93.87 (1)deg., beta = 93.38 (1)deg., gamma = 99.78 (1)deg., V = 2037.9 (9) A(exp 3). The compound has approximate S(sub 4) symmetry and consists of two pentasulfide chains linking four Cu(I) ions, each with a corrdinating 2-methylpyridine. The infrared spectrum was dominated by absorption due to coordinated 4-methylpyridine with several low-energy peaks attributable to S-S stretches, which were also observed by Raman spectroscopy. A featureless electronic absorption spectrum yielded a single peak in the near ultraviolet upon computer enhancement (lambda = 334 nm, epsilon = 10,000), most likely an intraligand transition. Cyclic voltammetry indicates that the polysulfide complex undergoes irrversible oxidation and reduction at +0.04 and -0.34 V vs. SCE, respectively, at 298 K in 4-methylpyridine when swept at 20 mV/sec. The electrochemical behavior was unvaried even at sweep rates as high as 100 V/sec.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"volume": "7", "submissionId": 19970026992, "issue": "2", "issn": "1040-7278", "publisher": "Plenum Publishing Corp.", "id": "4a060c73b80f4a8db9396d6e19f5bc21", "publicationName": "Journal of Cluster Science", "publicationDate": "1996-06-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19970026992.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19970026992/downloads/19970026992.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19970026992/downloads/19970026992.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19970026992/downloads/19970026992.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
