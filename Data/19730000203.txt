The detector is hand-held\nand moved over the external surface flush with the\nvessel. When a leak is present, the gas escaping from\nthe vessel in the area over which the detector is held\nincreases pressure inside the device and automatically\nactivates a warning light, a buzzer, or an electrical\nmeter. Unfortunately, these devices cannot locate leaks\nfrom inside the pressurized vessels. Therefore, leaks in\npressurized cabins such as in spacecraft and aircraft\ncannot be effectively located and repaired in flight.\nA detector has been developed for locating the leaks\nfrom inside the pressurized cabins. The detector (see\nfigure) is essentially a differential pressure sensor. It\nincludes a rigid housing with the top end covered by a\nflexible diaphragm. The housing has an open port on\none side and a handle containing a battery on the other.\n\nInside the housing are two electrical contacts that are\nkept apart by a spring. One electrical contact is attached\nto the diaphragm and connected to a warning light and\none battery terminal. The second contact is attached to\nthe bottom of the housing and connected to the second\nbattery terminal. The entire housing, with the exception\nof an open port, is sealed off from the outside environment. A flexible tubing fixed to a cylindrically shaped\nhead on one end is inserted over the port nipple and\nsecured with a clamp.\nIn use, the detector is held by the handle and the\nhead is placed flush against the area that is being tested.\nShould a leak be present, most of the air inside the\ndetector housing will escape. The diaphragm will then\nflex into the chamber and push the electrical contacts\ntogether, closing the circuit and turning on the warning\nlight.\n\nidle\n\n%.,Ul\n\n(continued overleaf)\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National\t\nAeronautics and Space Administration.

Instead of a warning\nlight, a buzzer or a needle valve may be used to indicate\na drop in pressure.\n\nNote:\nRequests for further information may be directed to\nTechnology Utilization Officer\nMarshall Space Flight Center\nCode A&PS-TU\nMarshall Space Flight Center, Alabama 35812\nReference: B73-10203\n\nPatent status:\nThis invention is owned by NASA, and a patent\napplication has been filed: Inquiries concerning nonexclusive or exclusive license for its commercial development should be addressed to:\nPatent Counsel\nMarshall Space Flight Center\nCode A&PS-PAT\nMarshall Space Flight Center, Alabama 35812\n\n.\n\nSource: J.
