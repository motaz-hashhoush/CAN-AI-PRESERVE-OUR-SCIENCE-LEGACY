The\n&erial&olicies of the various governments also are largely controlled by the \xe2\x80\x9dpotentialitiesof commercial aircraft in war, as\none of ,thereasons for encouraging commercial flying is the desire to build up a strong and efficient reserve of aircraft\nagainst a time of national need,\nAnother illustration of the importance of the relation be\xe2\x80\x93\ntween commercial and military flying appeared in the work of the\nrecent l?ashingtoi~\nConfez\xe2\x80\x99ence,\nwhere the task of regulating the\nconstruction and maintenance of military aircraft was abandoned\n.as hopeless because of the difficulty of drawing a line of demarcation between air~raft which are military and aircraft intend+\nedto\n\nfollow only paths of peace.\nConvertible Pia.nes First Idea.\nThe signing of the armistice and even the end of the subse-\n\nquent proceedings at Versailles\xe2\x80\x9dfound aeronautical &gineers\n\nso\n\nimbu-ed\nwith the ideas of military design that the first commercial machines naturally bore strong evidence of their relation.,Taken from l!Christain\nScience Monitor\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nI\n\na\nidea wkier.t..\n\n..\n\n.t mpts at .f\ne\nlying..commr,ce.\nfirst began that it would be carried\nout with aix\xe2\x80\x99craft\nat least readily convertible to military ends,\n,\n\nand that impression can be traced in the phrases of the first\nFrench subsidy law, where great stress was laid on the production\nof commercial airplanes able to fly for long distances without\nstop, capable of maintaining a high speed, and easily convertible\nfor bombing or observation purposes. The terms under which the\nsubsidy was granted offered the strongest inducement to\xe2\x80\x9ddesigners\nto continub war-time practices in their output.\n,.\nIti-pression\nDispelled.\nThe impression that commercial and military aircraft are interchimgeable has been largely dispelled by two years of actual\ntest, alttiugh certain of the subsidy laws still give some attention to the feature of convertibility of use.\n\nThe inducements for\n\n\xe2\x80\x98 such convertibility are, however, much less accented than they\nwere in the beginning. It is coming to be realized that the commercial airplane cannot be made \xe2\x80\x99closely similar to the military\ntype without causirig\nit to become a hopeless proposition economically.\n\nThe tme\n\nfunction of commercial aeronautics from the view-\n\npoint of national safety is not to provide airplanes for military\nuse.,but to nourish an industry.\ncapable of turning quickly to the\nproduction of any sort of machine that may be required for any\npurpose in emergency. No government can keep air transport up to\n.\n\n.\n\n-3kt\n\nthe point where it will b& abM! $d suppdr~ tidh an industry on the\n,.,\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9c-basis f a-subsidyalone, and it\no\n\nis,\n\nessenti,a that governmental\n\nsupport.be of a sort which will develop an industry ultimately\nable to stand on its own feet.\nlTotInterchangeable.\nIt is evident that there are some types of airplane which\ncannot be improvised from commercial craft. The pursuit machine\nhas no parallel in commerce, and the armored attack airplane\ncould hardly be made by conversion of anything else excx?ptin the\nmost makeshift way, as armored vessels for blockade running were\nonce produced by stacking bales of cotton along the rail and steel\nplates around the wheel house. Even bombing airplanes, however,\naannot be made from any other type in a fully satisfactory \xe2\x80\x98manner.\n\nOf course, it is possible for the commercial airplane to\n\ncarry bombs and fo\xe2\x80\x99rthe \xe2\x80\x98pilotto drop them after a fashion, but\nthe modern bombing airplane is so specialized in desi=gnand func..\ntion that itcould hardly be made interchangeable with any other\nsort of craft.\nA Flyinp Battleship,\nThe modern military airplane is coming more and moze into\nthe class of a flying battleship, and it is impossible to produce\nan sffective design by laying\n\nout the sirp\xe2\x80\x99lanestructure first\n\nand then adding the armament as an afterthought.\n\nThe armament\n\nand other equipment must be incorporated in a single unit.\n\n.., _...\n\n.\xe2\x80\x94. \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94...\n\n-448\n\nQuite aside from the ri6tifi\xe2\x80\x99t& amament, too.,an airpl=i~e\nof\nsuitableto-be opexate.d. conqmi,gally not fast enough or maneue\nis\n..\n.\nto\nverabl.eenough for serious military use\xe2\x80\x99.
