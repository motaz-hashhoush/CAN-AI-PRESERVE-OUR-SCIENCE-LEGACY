The apparatus includes a pair of curved extraction grids (16, 18) with multiple pairs of aligned holes\npositioned to direct a group of beamlets (20) along converging paths. The extraction grids are closely spaced\nand maintained at a moderate potential to efficiently\nextract beamlets of ions and allow them to combine into\na single beam (14). An accelerator electrode device (22)\ndownstream from the extraction grids, is at a much\nlower potential than the grids to accelerate the combined beam.\n11 Claims, 4 Drawing Figures\n\nU.S. pltkn&\n\nMay 8, 1984\n\nSheet 1 of 2\n\n7,773\n\n73\n\n62\n\n\\\n\n1\n\n4,447,773\n-\n\n2\n\nsource 12 and accelerate the extracted ions to form an\nION BEAM ACCELERATOR SYSTEM\nion beam 14of high beam current density that is suitable\nfor a variety of processes, particularly in ion implantaORIGIN OF THE INVENTION\ntion applications.

To achieve a considerable beam current, the extraction grids 16, 18 are\nconstructed, as shown in FIG. 2, with a height H much\ngreater than their width W, such as 5 times as great. 10\nThis produces a slit-shaped beam 14. It is found that the\nresulting beam 14 is well collimated both in height and\nwidth.\nThe extraction efficiency of the extraction grids 16,\n18 is enhanced by utilizing grids which are very thin 15\nand maintained very close together. Thin grids, and\nespecially a thin screen grid 16, increases the efficiency\nwith which ions are extracted from the ion plasma\nsource 12, since a thin screen grid reduces ion recombination losses on the walls of the grid holes 28. It is 20\ndesirable to maintain the grids 16,18 as close together as\npractical to maximize the ion field current. The extracted ion current density increases as a function of\n( V 3 / 2 / S 2 ) , where V is the voltage between the grids and\nS is the separation between the grids. Since the maxi- 25\nmum voltage that can be applied before there is arcing,\nis proportional to the grid separation, it can be seen that\nthe extracted ion current density increases as the extraction grid separation S decreases (assuming that the voltage is adjusted so the electric field between the grids is 30\nmaintained at a constant value).\nIn one ion accelerator that has been constructed, both\nof the extraction grids 16, 18, were formed of graphite,\nwhich is useful to stand up to the high temperatures\nsuch as 1,ooo" F. to which the grids are subjected. The 35\nscreen grid 16 had a thickness A of 18 mil (one mil\nequals 0.001 inch), the focusing grid 18 had a thickness\nB of 22 mil, and the grids were separated by a distance\nS of 60 mil as measured along the beam centerline 50.\nEach of the holes 28, 30 in the grids were drilled to a 40\ndiameter of 82 mil, and the centerlines of the holes in\neach grid were spaced by about 100 mil. The holes were\nformed in staggered rows with four or five holes in each\nrow, to form a hexagonal pattern wherein each hole\n(except those at the edges) is equally spaced from six 45\nadjacent holes. The distance C between the extraction\ngrids and the accelerator electrode device, as measured\nalong the beam centerline 50, was 0.6 inch. The accelerator grid 24 had a thickness D of 0.31 inch and a hole\nwidth E of 0.375 inch. The deceleration electrode 26 50\nhad a thickness F of 0.24 inch and a hole width G of\n0.50 inch. Both of the holes 34, 52 in the electrodes had\na height of l # inches, which is slightly greater than the\nheigth of the matrix of holes in the extraction grids. The\napparatus was fed with Xenon gas at a rate of 0.35 stan- 55\ndard cubic centimeters per minute into the ion beam\nplasma source 12 and there was almost 100% extraction\nof the ions into the beam 14. Ion beams were produced\nhaving a centerline density of over 500 A/& and a\nbeam divergence of less than one degree.\n60\nIn constructing and testing the accelerator system 10,\nit was found that care must be taken in designing the\ngeometry of the extraction grid apparatus and the voltages applied between the grids, to assure that the beamlets 20 merge into a single beam. If the ion current in 65\neach beamlet 20 is too small, then the beamlets 20 will\npass across one another instead of merging into a single\nbeam 14. On the other hand, if the beadei currents &e\n\n4\n\ntoo large, then the combined beamlets form a beam that\nfans out or diverges at a large angle. The moderate\nvoltage such as 550 volts between closely spaced extraction grids, and the size of the holes such as 28 in the\nscreen grid, provide beamlets that merge, while allowing a large voltage drop to the accelerator electrode\ndevice 22 to further accelerate the beam.\nAlthough the single slit-shaped ion beam 14 produced .\nby the above-described system is useful in many applications, it is often desirable to provide a collimated\nbeam of much greater current. This can be accomplished, as by the apparatus of FIG. 3, wherein the\nbeams 14 from several of the ion beam accelerator systems of the type shown in FIG. 1 can be combined into\none higher current beam 60. This can be accomplished\nby utilizing a pair of electrostatic beam deflection plates\n62,64 on either side of each beam 14 as it emerges from\nits corresponding decelerator electrode such as 66\nwhich is similar to the electrode 26 of FIG. 1. The\ndeflection plates 62,64 are maintained at different voltages to deflect the ion beam 14 to one side, to merge\nwith the other ion beams. In another merging apparatus,\nof which part is shown in FIG. 4, the decceleration\nelectrode 67 near the downstream end of each ion beam\naccelerator can be split in half, with the two halves 68,\n70 separated by an insulation 72. Such an electrode is\nutilized in place of the accelerator electrode 24 in FIG.\n1 The two halves 68, 70 are maintained at a different\n.\nvoltage, as by maintaining the half 68 at minus 300 volts\nand the other half 70 at minus 300 volts, with respect to\nthe grounded decelerator electrode (not shown, and\ntherefore serve to electrostatically deflect the ion beam.\nA group of ion beam accelerators can be set up so they\nare positioned beside one another as in FIG. 3, to merge\nthe group of beams 14 into one higher current beam.\nThus, the invention provides an ion beam accelerator\nsystem which efficiently extracts and accelerates ions to\nproduce an ion beam of high current density, high total\ncurrent, and good collimation. This is accomplished by\nutilizing a pair of extraction grids which are closely\nspaced and at a moderate potential difference to extract\nion beamlets, and with the grids having pairs of holes\naligned so that the beamlets merge. The extraction grids\nare both held at a high potential above ground, so that\nthe beam formed by the combined beamlets can be\naccelerated to a high voltage by an accelerator electrode device. The beam formed by the combined beamlets, can, in turn, be combined with other beams to form\na large ion beam current by sidewardly deflecting a\ngroup of slit-shaped beams.\nAlthough particular embodiments of the invention\nhave been described and illustrated herein, it is recognized that modifications and variations may readily\noccur to those skilled in the art and consequently, it is\nintended that the claims be interpreted to cover such\nmodifications and equivalents.\nWhat is claimed is:\n1 An ion beam accelerator system for accelerating\n.\nions of an ion source, comprising:\na pair of slightly spaced extraction grids having upstream faces facing the ion source, a first of said\ngrids being positioned upstream from a second of\nsaid grids, said grids forming a plurality of pairs of\nholes, one in each grid, with said pairs of holes\naligned in directions to form a plurality of converging beamlet paths;\nan accelerator electrode device spaced downstream\nfrom said extraction grids by more than twice the\n\n5\n-\n\n4,447,773\n\n-\n\n6\nspace between said pair of grids, including a first\n7 A method for extracting and accelerating ions from\n.\nelectrode with a hole for passing said beamlets; and\nan ion source, comprising:\nmeans for establishing said second grid at a negative\nextracting and dightlf accelerating by a potential\npotential relative to said first grid, and for establishdrop of less than IO00 volts, a plurality of ion beamlets from said source along a plurality of paths that\ning said first accelerator electrode at a negative 5\npotential with respect to both of said grids, the\nconverge into an ion beam while maintaining the\nions i said beamlets at a high potential above\nn\npotential difference between either grid and said\nground before they merge;\nfirst electrode being a plurality of times greater\napplying a much lower potential of more than 1O00\nthan the potential difference between said pair of\nvolts below the potential of said beamlets before\ngrids.\n10\nthey converge, to a location immediately around\n2.
