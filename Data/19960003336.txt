In this paper, key propulsion technologies to meet future\nneeds are identified and the associated challenges are briefly discussed. Also discussed are NASA\'s vision, NASA\'s\nchanging role in meeting today\'s challenge of a shrinking research budget, and propulsion technology impacts on the\nenvironment and air transport economics. Critical aeropropulsion technology drivers are identified and their impact\nevaluated. The aviation industry is critical to the nation\'s economy,job creation, and national security.NASA\'s\nadvanced aeropropulsion technology programs and their relation to the aviation industry are discussed.\nINTRODUCTION\nPropulsion systems pace the development of advanced aircraft. Early propulsion system technology\ndevelopment and validation permit timely integration of the propulsion system into the vehicle system, thereby\nreducing risk and cost. Dramatic changes in the world economic and political arenas,the rise of international\nconsortia, the trend toward more partnerships, and reduced research budgets have all created an environment within\nwhich technology development has become a high-riskundertaking crucial to remaining competitive on the world\nmarket. This situation is further complicated by global environmental awareness.The design paradigm of maximum\nperformance has shifted to one of balanced design whereby performance,economics,the environment, and external\nforces and requirementsall play major roles in the development of advanced aeropropulsion systems.\nNASA\'s base research and technology (Base R&T) as well as its systems technology programs, such as\nAdvanced Subsonic Technology (AST), High Speed Research (HSR), High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC) and Numerical Propulsion System Simulator (NPSS), contribute significantly to developing critical\naeropropulsion technologies. Lewis Research Center is committed to the continued development of key aeropropulsion technologies. This commitment is reflected in the NASA aeropropulsion budget for Lewis and is\nprojected to be in excess of $1.4 billionover a 7-year period (FY 1995throughFY 2001).\nBACKGROUND\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe international business environment is changing rapidly. These changes are being driven by political\nand economic influences and a strong desire by some countries to enter the prestigious aeronautics market. This\nmarket is highly competitive and technology is the key to success. Although U.S. industry has competed well in this\nmarket, future success is not assured.\nNational and international consortia, partnerships, and joint production are real current trends. The competitive environment is further complicated by the fact that some foreign companies are directly or indirectly supported\nby their governments. New propulsion competitors are emerging in the expanding world economy. U.S. research\nbudgets are shrinking. The drive to reduce government deficit spending and the national debt continues, the defense\nbudget has been reduced, industry continues to down-size, and the expansion of the commercial market is slow.\nThese factors are forcing U.S. industry to focus on the near-term needs. Joint programs tend to reduce in-house\nresearch because of limited return on investment and the fear of technology transfer to potential competitors. Fierce\ninternational competition tends to favor evolutionary technology to minimize corporate risk and capital costs. As a\nresult, large potential gains from revolutionary technologies are no longer explored to the same extent.\n\nAeropropulsion system development is costly and time consuming. The multibillion dollar investment\nrequired to develop a new propulsion system in today\'s uncertain market is a high risk venture. NASA\'s aeropropulsion system technology program is being conductedto reduce development cycle, risk, and cost.\nMilitary applications impose additionalrequirementsand constraints on propulsion systems. The technology to detect military aircraft and take countermeasureshas dictated the need for highly stealthy systems of which\nthe aeropropulsion system is a part. Meeting logistical and economic requirements in operating from remote and\nrough runways have enhanced aeropropulsion system maintenance. NASA participation in military programs is\nundertaken to maximize transfer to civil systems.\n\nAEROPROPULSION\n\nCHALLENGES\n\nAeropropulsion technology is the pacing technology for the next century\'s air transportation systems.\nTimely technology development is a continuing process that requires long-term planning and commitment. Future\ntransport systems must have a balance of performance,economic, and environmental attributes desired by the\ninternational air transport community.\nAeropropulsion systems must integrate contradictory requirements. Noise and emission requirements, for\nexample, can impose serious penalties on performance, cost and/or weight. Some major technical challenges\nconfronting the propulsion designer are\n(a) Computational tools:Advances in computationalcapability allow more accurate designs and prediction\nof design concept characteristics. This presents an opportunity to overcome existing design limitations and significantly reduce engine development cycle time. Significant engine development cost savings can be realized.\n(b) Active controls: Real-time intelligence in closed-loop control can optimize engine operability and\nperformance. Advanced sensor technology combined with on-board computer capability would make this optimization feasible. Surge margin and rotating component clearance control features are two examples where maximum\nperformance can be achieved without exceeding engine limits. Engine response to power requirements can be significantly improved using the real-time intelligence with feedback. Definition of real-time intelligence logic, sensor\ntechnology, and sensor location are the keys to success.\n(c) Engine/airframe integration: Engine integrationwith the airframe becomes increasingly important with\nincreasing flight speeds, particularly at supersonic and hypersonic speeds. For systems operating in a broad Math\nnumber range, inlet and nozzle performance must be carefully traded to define an optimum system. Minimizing\nchemical recombination loss in a nozzle is a difficultbut essential design task. Noise reduction requirements present\nchallenging opportunities.\n(d) Advanced materials: High-performance and lightweight engines require materials that withstand high\ntemperatures in the engine operating environment.Near-term high-temperature requirementscan be met with\nsuperalloys and fiber-reinforced superalloys.However, much higher temperature and strength materials, such as\nceramic matrix composites and ceramics, will be needed to meet engine performance and durability requirements.\n(e) Instrumentation and sensors: The existing instrumentation and sensors are limiting technologies in the\ndevelopment and operation of aeropropulsion systems.Advanced technology allows the realization of the full\npotential of engine components. High performance and/or durability can be achieved with more accurate sensors.\nNonintrusive instrumentation technology such as electro-optic technology offers a quantum jump in sensor technology.Advanced instrumentation will allow an engine to be operated very close to its maximum temperature limit,\nthus achieving maximum power.Advanced instrumentation can be used to monitor the engine health to avoid\nunpredictable failures.\n(f) Mechanical components: Advances in mainshafts, bearings, seals and lubrication technology operating\nat high speed and high temperature are critical to the advanced propulsion system. Magnetic and air bearings offer\nan opportunity to eliminate cooling requirements to improve performance and reduce complexity.Advanced engines\nrequire advanced design techniques to reduce component weight and improve durability.\n(g) Control system: Increased onboard computer capability will allow precise control of engine functions to\noptimize performance. Full-authority digital electronic control (FADEC) would be integrated with the vehicle control system and the component active control system. FADEC allows the propulsion system to respond quickly to\nthrust requirements without exceeding any limits. Engine/vehicle operating logic development and feedback sensor\ntechnology would be the key to success.\n\n(h) Manufacturing: An economically viable aeropropulsion system must incorporate advanced manufacturing technologies. Low-cost, low-rejection-rate,and high-durability manufacturingprocesses must be developed.\nLabor intensive processes such as machiningmust be minimized. Stereolithography and solid-forming technology\nproduce solid geometric shapes directly from digitized designdata and offer potential cost reduction.\nNASA LEWIS RESEARCHCENTER VISION AND CHANGING ROLE\nf\n\nThe NASA Lewis Research Center vision is to be the world\'s center of excellence in civil airbreathing\npropulsion in partnership with industry and academia, developing and transferringaeropropulsion technologies\nneeded to power the next generation of U.S. aircraft and to support the global preeminenceof the U.S. aviation\nindustry.To fulfill this vision and meet the new propulsion system design challenges, Lewis has taken a collaborative approach to work with industry and academia to develop technologiesneeded for advanced propulsion systems.\nWith NASA-supported and -developed technologies, industry will be able to manufacture high-performance,\nenvironmentally friendly, affordableengines and thereby promote economic growth (fig. 1).\nThe aviation industry is critical to the nation. The primarydriving factors for this industry are contributing\nto the national economy,maintaining a critical transportation infrastructure,and contributing to the national defense.\nIn addition to creating high-quality employment,the aviation industry has posted a needed positive ($29 billion)\ntrade balance. U.S. airlines have generated large revenues ($60 billion) in satisfying critical transportation needs.\nAdditionally,the aviation industry has a positive impact on the U.S. defense technology and budget.\nRecognizing the importance of the aviation industry to the nation, NASA has made a renewed commitment\nto support this industry.This commitment is reflected in a new approach based on a NASA-industry collaboration to\ndevelop airbreathing pr0pulsion technologies.This approach represents a shift from the traditional agency role by\nfocusing NASA and industry efforts to collaboratively\n(a) Enable U.S. industry to employ a more timely design, development,manufacturing, and test cycle,\nthereby shortening the product development time\n(b) Provide highly proven technology by means of system level validation\n(c) Facilitate the introduction of new technology into the propulsion system certification proces\n(d) Decrease overall development costs and increase economic competitivenes\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThis approach has forged a stronger technical and programmaticrelationship with U.S. industry, government agencies, universities, technical societies, and international organizations.NASA is working more closely with\ngovernment agencies such as the Departmentsof Defense and Commerce to leverage program resources to meet\n\xe2\x80\xa2common technology needs.Academia is a partner in many programs to provide basic research. International partners\nenable technical collaboration on safety,operational issues, and R&T that transcendsnational boundaries.\nNASA\'s role in the engine development cycle is significantly expanded to support technology development\n(fig.2). With partners, NASA\'s responsibility is to develop the technology to the point where industry can confidently make the additional investment necessary to integrate it in their development programs. In this partnership\nrole, NASA provides leadership and support for key technologies,thereby reducing overall engine development\ncycle time and overall cost. NASA\'s collaborative approach includes contributing to the propulsion system validation process, an approach currently supportedby industry.During the technology development phase, new materials,\nadvanced concepts, advanced computational capabilities,and similar advancementsare incorporated in NASA\'s\nBase R&T, which includes cooperativeprograms with industry as well as university grants. Promising new concepts\npass from the base into system technology programs to demonstrate system benefits and to address component\ninteractions.\nBecause aeropropulsion is a pacing technology, its needs must be addressedprior to aircraft development.\nTo develop propulsion technology, Lewis is conducting a number of new technology programs including Advanced\nSubsonic Technology (AST) and High Speed Research (HSR). These are NASA-wide programs that include aircraft\ntechnology development. These programs are to demonstrate the required propulsion technologies for efficient new\naircraft systems that are economically and environmentally compatible. Lewis is also developing high-speed propulsion technologies for other supersonic and hypersonic aircraft.Because of the number of new technical challenges,\nthe High Speed Civil Transport is an exceptional example of this new approach with the cooperative successes\nattained to date, the size of anticipated development cycle costs, and the potential high payoff to the U.S. aeropropulsion industry.\n3\n\nTECHNOLOGY\n\nPAYOFFS AND ECONOMIC\n\nIMPACT\n\nTechnology has a significant impact on the aeropropulsion system. However, technology development\nrequires a significant commitment of resources.The technology payoffs are classified in four categories: high\nefficiency, low emissions, improved capability,and economic benefits. Lewis-developed and -supported technologies have resulted in advanced aeropropulsion systems, the advanced technologies for which came from such critical\ntechnology development programs as the Energy Efficient Engine (E3), the Quiet Clean Short Haul Experimental\nEngine (QCSEE), the Experimental CleanCombustor, and the Unducted Fan. An investment of $2.1 billion (19955)\nfrom 1977through 1990contributed to $113.3billion (19955)direct sales (1986 to 2000).\nTechnology programs both maintain and enhance national core capabilities for developing future technologies and advanced systems. Skills and facilitiesrequired to execute advanced programs are national assets and must\nbe maintained to compete in the global world economy.\nLewis technology development programs support multiple national needs from national security to environmental protection (fig. 3). Advanced aeropropulsion technologies stimulate the national competitive spirit in\nsubsonic, supersonic, hypersonic and other critical disciplines.These technologies, in turn, have a major impact on\nthe growth of the national economy.\n\nTECHNOLOGY DRIVERSAND ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES\nTechnology drivers are significantly influencedby external forces. Environmental awarenesshas\nreprioritized aeropropulsion design optimization. Decades ago, efficiency and performance were the key drivers in\nnew turbofan engine design and development. Now the global aviation market is demanding lower environmental\nimpact as well. Thus, although efficiency,reliability,and cost are still major drivers, resolving the issues of noise\nand emissions has greater urgency and importance.These critical technology drivers are not necessarily synergistic\nand must be balanced in future generationsof aeropropulsion systems. Lewis has significantly contributed to this\nbalancing of requirements and reprioritizing of technology development, delicately offsetting environmental\nconsiderations with the economic feasibilityof advanced aeropropulsion systems.\nTechnologies required to design and develop aeropropulsion systems must address environmental and\neconomic issues during the design phase.Enabling technologies required to satisfy environmental requirements for\nemissions and noise are low-NOx combustorsand low-noise fans. Exhaust nozzles require careful design to balance\nperformance and noise attenuation. Environmentalconstraints will continue to result in limitations of severe oxides\nof nitrogen (Nox). NOx limits are pesented in figure 4. Proposals for future requirements indicate NOx levels to be\nat a constant 30 g/kN level. NASA will continue to strive to achieve these low-NOx levels through advanced\ncombustor programs with industry.\nThe complex economic issue is impacted by contradictory design requirements. Primary factors that influence the economic feasibility of an aeropropulsion system are performance, operating cost, fuel cost, manufacturing,\nlong-term durability and maintainability,affordablematerials, engine weight, and component integration. Under the\nLewis AST and HSR techology programs,major advances have been made to address these key technologies.\nNASA\'S AEROPROPULSIONPROGRAM STRUCTURE\nNASA\'s programs are structured into two synergistic elements to effectively develop and transfer new technologies: the systems program element and the Base R&T program. The Lewis programs are vertically integrated,\nbuilding on each other to effectively develop and transfer new technologies (fig. 5).\nThe system technology program is focusedon specific vehicle classes and system validation ranging from\nsubsonic transport to hypersonic vehicles. The overall objective of the Advanced Subsonic Technology (AST) and\nthe High Speed Research (HSR) programs is to markedly enhance the technology base for the next-generation\naircraft. The High Performance Computingand Communication (HPCC) program is developing the Teraflop\ncomputing capabilities needed to analyze increasingly complex aircraft and engine systems.The Numerical Propulsion System Simulation (NPSS) program is intended to simulate complete engine behavior, reducing the design, test,\nand redesign iteration currently used to meet design goals. The total planned budget for these four aeropropulsion\nprograms is in excess of $1.4 billion from FY 1995through FY 2001.\n\nThe Base R&T program provides the fundamental technologies and enables the initiation of new system\ntechnology programs. These technologies can also be used in existing systems. Some of the key fundamental\ntechnologies developed under the Base R&T are materials, structures,computationaltools, instrumentation, sensors,\nengine components, and controls. The Base R&T for Lewis is currently about $74million per year.\nThe two synergistic elements provide demonstrated technologiesready for integration by industry to aeropropulsion system development with reduced risk and cost.\nMAJOR PROPULSION TECHNOLOGYPROGRAMS\nLewis Research Center has initiated technology programs to enhance the technology of aeropropulsion systems. The current programs include HSR, AST,NPSS/HPCC, and the Base research and technology\nprogram. These technology programs are developing enabling technologies that range from emission reduction to\nadvanced materials for very high-temperature operating conditions.A summaryof these programs follows.\nHigh Speed Research (HSR)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nOngoing NASA-funded studies continue to indicate that an opportunity exists for a secondgeneration supersonic transport to become a key part of the 21st century international air transportation system.\nThe large potential market for an HSCT is shown in figure 6. However, significantadvances in airframe and\npropulsion technologies over the levels currently available will be required for an HSCT to become a reality.These\ntechnologies must contribute to an aircraft design that is both environmentallycompatible and economically viable.\nThe environmental barrier issues facing the HSCT are depletion of the Earth\'s ozone layer, resulting from HSCT\nexhaust products, and airport noise. The economic viability will require superior performance with low weights,\nlong-term durability in extreme operating conditions, and low manufacturing costs for the required new materials\nand components.\nRecognizing the large potentialmarket, NASAinitiated the HSR program to address these barrier issues.\nThe vision of the program is to establish the technology foundationby the year 2001 to support the U.S. transport\nindustry\'s decision for a 2006 production of an environmentally acceptable, economically viable aircraft with\nnotional design features of a 300-passenger capacity, 5000-n mi range, and a Math-2.4 cruise speed. The three\nelements of the program are airframe, systems integration, and propulsion. The propulsion element receives the\nlargest share of the budget because it must overcome a number of barrier issues.Technologies for new low-NOx\ncombustors are being developed to reduce ozone depletion.Assessments of the effects of HSCT exhaust on the\natmosphere have been made using state-of-the-art two- and three-dimensionalatmosphericmodeling codes. Recent\nresults from these models have shown steady-state ozone depletion to be substantiallyless than 1percent for an\nHSCT fleet that meets the HSR goalemissions index (EI) of 5 g NOx/kg fuel. Flame tube experiments of new HSR\ncombustion concepts have produced an EI in the range of 2 to 10, giving a strong indication that the EI goal is\nachievable. These concepts have moved into the more substantial combustorsector tests, and early test results have\nproduced EI\'s surpassing the interim goal of no greater than 20 g NOx/kg fuel.These designs will be further refined\nand tested before a final combustor design selection is made and a full annular combustor is tested to verify the\ntechnologies required for achievement of the EI goal of 5 gNOx/kN. The other environmental issue, airport noise,\nalso impacts primarily the propulsion system.Reducing engine noise becomes essentially a task of reducing nozzle\njet velocity to approximately 1400ft/sec to meet a noise goal of FAR 36 stage III, with a margin. Achieving this goal\nis a tradeoff between cycle selection, nozzle noise suppression, and engine sizing.The selected current HSR engine\nconfiguration is a mixed-flow turbofan of moderate bypass ratio to significantlyreduce nozzlejet velocity.Jet\nvelocity will be reduced with a mixer/ejector nozzle to meet the noise reduction goals. However, tradeoff studies at\nthe system level will continue to ensure the selection of the optimumcycle/nozzle combination that meets program\ngoals.\nAnother barrier issue facing the HSCT is economic viability,which will require engines with a superior\nperformance and weight that result in an aircraft of reasonable size. The projected HSR vehicle and the current\nConcorde are compared in figure 8. Advanced, high-temperatureengine materials will contribute to the HSCT\nenvironmental and economic success.The primary materials being developedare ceramic matrix composites for\nthe combustor liner, intermetallic/metal matrix composites for the nozzle, lightweight composites for fan containment, and long-life materials for compressorand turbine disks and turbine blades. Other materials required for the\n\npropulsion system are being developedin other Department of Defense (DOD) andNASA programs. In addition to\ngood performance and light weight, long-term durability becomes a design issue because the duty cycle of an HSCT\nengine is much more demanding than that of current subsonic transport engines. Long life for critical components\nsuch as compressors, turbines, and nozzles exposed to long-duration, high-temperature environments will have to be\ndemonstrated. The development of new materialsand new component designs is not sufficient;manufacturing cost\nwill have to be reduced to ensure the future success of an HSCT.\nThe current HSR program will demonstrate the aerodynamic and acoustic performance of the critical\npropulsion components through isolated, large-scale (approximately 1/3 full scale) component tests. These tests will\nreduce the development risks associatedwith an HSCT, enabling the U.S. manufacturers to proceed toward an\ninformed product launch decision as early as 2001.\nAdvanced SubsonicTechnology (AST)\nThe AST program is a NASA-U.S.industry-FAApartnership for developing high-payoff technologies to\nenable a safe, highly productive globalair transportation system.This system will include a new generation of\nenvironmentally compatible, economical subsonic aircraft.The AST elements at NASA Lewis Research Center\ninclude propulsion, fly-by-light/power-by-wire, engine noisereduction, and short haul (civil tiltrotor and general\naviation) propulsion technologies.\nPropulsion.--NASA Lewis and the U.S. aircraft engine manufacturers are developing technology to reduce\nemissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) by 70 percent, reduce direct operating cost (DOC) by 3 tol0 percent, and\nimprove fuel efficiency by 8 percent. These technologies will be incorporated in future (2005 entry-into-service)\nengines and transitioned into derivatives and enhancements of in-service engines. Future engines range from large\n(20 000 to 100000-1bthrust) for commercial transports of 700 or more to small (5000 to 20 000-1bthrust) for\nregional transports of 50 passengers.\nStudies recently completed by the U.S. aircraft engine manufacturers revealed that these engines will\nprocess about twice as much airfow, with bypass ratios up to 20:1, operate at higher temperatures and pressures to\nimprove efficiency, at peak temperatures of 3000 \xc2\xb0F and pressure ratios up to 60:1, and burn fuel in low-emission\ncombustors. These engines will depend on lightweight composites and geared engine systems to enable very high\nbypass ratios, will use improved metallic disk, blade, and case materials, and incorporate improved turbomachinery.\nValidated turbomachinery aerodynamic and aeroelastic designcodes are being developed to reduce development\ntesting and cost and the time to bring an engine to market. Low-emissioncombustor studies have identified promising concepts and barrier technologies. Screening tests are underway to address the technology barriers and to\nfacilitate the development of low-emission combustors. Testing will be conducted in a state-of-the-art,\nhigh-pressure,high-temperature combustor facility at Lewis.\nFly-by-light/power-by-wire technology (FBL/PBW).--The goal of this element is to provide lightweight,\nhighly reliable, highly electromagnetically immune fiber-optic-basedcontrol systems and all-electric secondary\npower systems. These technologies will lower acquisition and direct operating costs, reduce weight, and increase\nperformance and reliability (fig. 8). The FBL plans include an airplane control system design and the detailed\ndesign, fabrication, and flight demonstrationof an FBL-controlled, aileron electrical actuator (EA). The PBW plans\ninclude detailed design, fabrication, and ground test of an airplane power management and distribution (PMAD)\nsystem and starter-generator, and the design, fabrication, and flight demonstration of an aileron EA integrated with\nthe FBL system. Flight tests are to be performed on NASA\'s 757 TSRV-IIaircraft in 1999.Additional flight tests of\nan FBL/hydraulic control system are scheduled for 1996 on NASA\'s F-18 aircraft. Todate, the FBL system design\nhas been completed and detailed design is underway.The F-18 FBL/hydraulic hardware will soon be installed and\nflight tests will commence. The PMAD architecturehas been down-selected from I0 concepts, the design has been\ncompleted, and the detailed design is underway.The detailed designs of the starter-generatorand the flight EA are\nalso underway.\nNoise Reduction.--The goal of this element is to reduce the engine noise 6 dB by the year 2000 (relative\nto 1992technology). Three areas of engine noise reduction are being investigated:jet noise, advanced low-noise\nfan designs, and active control of fan noise. Experimental and analytical work is being performed in all three areas.\nJet noise tests were conducted in collaboration with industry in the NASA Lewis Aeroacoustic Propulsion Laboratory (APL) and at industry sites. Fan testing was conductedon a research model in the Lewis 9- by 15-Foot LowSpeed Wind Tunnel where aeroacoustic, aerodynamic, and structural data were obtained. A diagnostic fan test was\n\n,\n\n\'\n\nperformed to identify dominant fan broadband noise Sources.A test was completed with engines in the Lewis APL\nto demonstrate an active noise control (ANC) conceptusing a large low-speed fan. In addition to experimental work,\nseveral analyses were developed with industry to predict jet and fan noise and were applied to many of the test\nconfigurations for code validation.This effortincludes new or improved fan tone prediction, fan broadband, and jet\nnoise prediction codes.\nShort Haul - Civil Tiltrotor.m A civil tiltrotor aircraft is viable for air transport that provides relief when\ntraffic is congested. Technology developments in noise, terminal area operations, safety,weight reduction, and\nreliability remain barriers to acceptance and implementation of the tiltrotor concept. Tiltrotor research at Lewis\ncenters on improved system safety, specificallytiltrotor operation in the emergency contingency power\n(one-engine-inoperative or OEI) condition.Three industry efforts are currently underway to evaluate the full range\nof concepts for engine power augmentationin the event of an OEI condition. By the end of FY97, preliminary\ndesigns of the most promising contingency power concepts will be prepared and ranked, and at least one of the\npreliminary designs will be selectedas a candidatefor detailed design. Current plans include an engine system\ntechnology demonstrator in FY 2000; this demonstrator will be used to validate OEI technology and demonstrate the\nselected system\'s ability to meet the OEI safety requirement at minimum vehicle cost.\nShort Haul - General Aviation.m Lewis is working with the general aviation (GA) industry to provide\ntechnology for improved safety and performance of general aviation aircraft. To make GA easier to use, Lewis\nefforts focus on advanced propulsion sensors and controls for simplified controls of intermittent combustion engines\nand aircraft. Lewis icing expertiseis being applied to aircraft ice avoidance and deicing methods and sensors. Lewis\nalso has three study contracts to examine the application of existing military and automotive small gas turbine\ntechnology to the GA market. These studies include an evaluation of critical GA noise, emissions, and performance\nissues. The Lewis general aviationpropulsion programs are defined jointly with industry and are executed through\n\xe2\x80\xa2methods appropriate for the industry it serves.\n\nAdvanced Computational System Programs (NPSS/HPCC)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe primary objective of Numerical Propulsion System Simulation (NPSS) is to develop the technologies\nnecessary to perform large, computationallyintensive system and subsystem simulations of aircraft engines in a\ncost-effective and timely manner. NPSS, referred to as the "Numerical Test Cell," is being developed in close\ncoordination with the aeropropulsion industry to assure that the software will meet its needs. Computer simulation of\naeropropulsion systems is primarilylimited to modeling single components with codes of a single discipline, such as\nthe structural or aerodynamic analysis of inlets, compressors, combustors, nozzles, or other elements of the system.\nLewis has traditionally been a major participant in developing codes for the aeropropulsion industry.With greater\ncomputing capability expected in the future, the current strategy is to develop the capability to computationally\nmodel the complete engine and capture the real physical interactions that take place between the components in the\nengine (fig. 9). The effects of component interaction on engine performance have been quantified in full-scale tests.\nSuch tests have been time consuming and costly to perform. Simulating tests "numerically" early in the design\nprocess promises to substantially reduce the time and cost of developing and certifying engines and thereby help the\nU.S. aeropropulsion industry maintainits preeminence in the world market. Estimates indicate that over 18months\nand approximately $300 million could be saved in the development and certification of a new engine.\nThe financial support for the NPSS project comes from the High Performance Computingand Communication (HPCC) Program and the Base R&T.HPCC is a national program with the goal of significantly advancing the\ncomputing capabilities in the U.S. The key elements of advanced computational systems are summarized in the\nfollowing:\nHigh performance computing.-- Integrating complex applications with advanced computational hardware\nand system software will reduce the time required to perform simulations. The current Lewis focus is to develop and\nimplement computing and communicationstechnologies that permit large simulations to be executed simultaneously\n(in parallel) on several processors. To make effective use of the computing resources, the processors may reside in\nsupercomputers or desktop workstationsor multiprocessor systems. The Lewis Advanced Cluster Environment\n(LACE) is a group of distributed, 32 networked IBM RS/6000 desktop engineering workstations. LACE is used as\nthe primary testbed for developing NPSS parallel application codes and system software to take advantage of the\nlarge number of workstations in use in the aerospace industry.\n\nAxisymmetric engine simulation(ENG10).--The ENG10 code is to provide a high-fidelity flow model in\nan aircraft gas turbine engine (fig. 10). It provides a two-dimensional flow field that captures engine component\ninteraction effects on system performance.\nCombustion simulation (CORSAIR).--CORSAIR enables the analysis of a full combustor from compressor exit to turbine inlet. It reduces design cycle time by executing an unstructured mesh analysis on distributed\ndesktop workstations. It has been recently selected as the basis of the flow solver for the National Combustor Code\nfor further development by a NASA-DOD-DOE-U.S. industry partnership.\nCoupled aerodynamic-thermal-structures (CATS).-- CATS is to be a multidisciplinary simulationprocess\nto improve compression system designs. Turbomachinery compressor performance,including stall, is strongly\ninfluenced by a combination of aerodynamic, thermal, and structural effects. The interactions among these disciplines have been neglected because of a limited ability to exchange data amongdiscipline codes in a timely and\nefficient manner. CATS is to result in data management and data exchange among turbomachinerydiscipline codes,\nsuch as CFD and finite-element structural and thermal analyses, and the component geometry on CAD/CAM\nsystems. The goal is to reduce multidisciplinary analysis time by 50 percent and to improve stall margin prediction\nby 10percent.\nVisual computing environment (VCE_.--VCE allows coupling analysiscodes of various engineering\ndisciplines such as CFD, structural, and thermal, with the capability of performing simulations with different\ndimensionality or fidelity, empirical performance-map-basedmodules linked with full three-dimensional transient\nCFD simulations, for example. VCE will permit the coupling of multicomponent analysis codes.The modules in\nVCE are typically distributed across several computer processors, allowing VCE to take advantage of inherent\ncoarse-grained parallelism.\nPortable extensible viewer (PEV).-- PEV Team is a viewer for nonuniformrational b-spline (NURBS)based geometry capable of operating on desktop computers from a variety of different vendors, permitting the use of\ncomputing systems of choice by the aerospace industry.\nWorkspaee simulation manager.-- The NPSS workspace is a standard graphical user interface (GUI)\nwindowing system used for launching and administering simulations, a "Windows for engines," serving as the toplevel view of the NPSS environment that establishes a consistent platform.\nAdvanced e0mmunieations technology.--A series of numerical experiments utilizing the Advanced\nCommunications Technology Satellite (ACTS) are being conducted to develop a high-speed inlet control system\nusing the NPSS. The engine inlet simulator is executed on the Lewis Cray YMP supercomputer but is controlled by\nBoeing Corporation in Seattle, Washington. Flow visualizationinformation is transported via the ACTS to the\nremote site for quasi-real-time display on high-performance, three-dimensionalgraphics workstations. The experimental ACTS satellite network allows remote access of NASA\'s distributed engine inlet simulation application to\naerospace manufacturers.\nBase Research and Technology\nThe Base R&T program consists of multiple program elements that are focused on advancing the fundamental understanding in aeropropulsion and span multiple vehicle classes. These elements include improvements in\npropulsion components in both the core and low-pressure systems as well as in materials and structures, instrumentation and controls, and computational fluid dynamics. Universities are important partners in the Base R&T program. The following examples illustrate these partnerships.\nHITEMP.--This program is a very productive partnership including NASA Lewis, universities, industry,\nand other government agencies. Figure 11shows the objectives of this program and the breadth of the teaming.\nSeveral new materials have already been produced and have been successfully transferred, by additional industry\ndevelopment, to several modem propulsion systems, dramatically reducing weight and cost. The methodologies to\ndesign actual components and to predict their life have also been developed and transferred.\nAirbreathing propulsion for hypersonic flight.-- The objective of this element of the Lewis aeropropulsion program is to develop and demonstrate technologies for airbreathing hypersonic flight for global access\nand space access. Flight-validated, all-speed, integrated airbreathing propulsion systems, used from takeoff to the\nfinal flight Math number, will be provided by means of ground testbeds and experimental flight.\nRequirements are defined by means of mission and/or system analysis of potential applications.\nMultidisciplinary optimization of the final system is conducted to obtain the final design. The elements integrated\n\ninto the final system include the following: turbine engines, thermal management systems, heat exchangers, ejectors;\ninlets, diffusers, combustors, fuel systems, nozzles, and rockets. Enablingcomponent and system technologies are\ndeveloped and demonstrated in ground test facilities, such as the HypersonicTunnel Facility (ITrF) and the Propulsion Systems Laboratory (PSL). Flight experimentation, validation,and demonstrationare conducted to reduce the\nrisk of airbreathing hypersonic flight.\nChallenges exist in defining the analytical, ground, and flight program elements, content, and coupling.\nChallenges exist technically in defining the propulsion system for a givenmission or application and in optimizing\nthe total system with accepted criteria. Technical challenges include developing the highly integrated systems\ndefined as above. These challenges are compoundedby the lack of complete ground test capability (scale, Math\nnumber, degree of integration, and the adequacy of the physics of simulation),CFD with real gas effects, and\naffordable flight test capability with its real constraints of limited instrumentation,limited test condition variability,\nand limited configuration changes.\nThe aeropropulsion program is a representativeparticipant in the impending NASA flight demonstration\nprogram. A global access x-plane family is expected to be the focus of a portion of that program. Preliminary\ncandidate airbreathing propulsion systems have been identified, including turbine-based, combined-cycle (TBCC)\nand rocket-based, combined-cycle (RBCC) systems. Long-leadplanning is being conducted. Facility preparation is\nin progress; steady flow in direct-connect and free-jet configurations can be tested to Mach 7, pulsed flow to Mach\n14+.A scramjet will be flight tested by Russia\'s CIAM for NASAto Mach 6.5 to provide limited data for\nground-flight-analysis correlation and to demonstrate flight test techniques.\nA test program is underway to demonstrate the rocket-based, combined-cycle concept for application to\nhigh-speed cruise missions and accelerator missions such as space access.Analytical (cycle code) predictions show\nthat this engine system has the potential to maximize the overall ISP of the propulsion system for these missions.\nThe focus of this program is a free-jet test series of a RBCC engine at Mach 5 to7 in the HTF.A substantial amount\nof work has been accomplished in supportof this program. The engine design has been completed.The HTF facility\nis fully operational. All new support systems have been defined and designed.A parametric subscale inlet model (40\npercent scale) of this RBCC engine design was tested in the NASALewis 1-by 1-Foot SupersonicWind Tunnel at\nMach- 5 to -7 conditions. This test contributed to defining the final RBCC engine geometry and established the\noperability and performance of this geometry.A direct-connectcombustor test is underway to verify the operability\nand performance of the RBCC combustor and to optimize the combustor geometry and fuel staging scheme for the\nHTF test conditions. A data set has been obtained at Mach 6, and additional tests at Mach 7 are planned.\nFUTURE PLANS\nNASA is already planning future activitiesto continue to advance and validate aeropropulsion technologies. We will continue to work with industry,academia, and other government agencies to develop future programs.\nIt is anticipated that high speed research and advanced subsonic propulsion systems will continue to need focused\nsystem development in key areas. Lewis proposes to integrate all critical technologies in a demonstrator engine to\nverify system performance, acoustics, emissions, and durability as a follow-on for the HSR porgram. Planning for\ntechnologies beyond the next generation of subsonic transport systems is also being considered.After completion of\nthe NPSS software that will perform a high-fidelity multidisciplinaryanalysis of the complete gas turbine engine,\nplans are to integrate it with airframe analysisand design systems.This combined capability will enable designers to\nevaluate the three-dimensional multidisciplinary interaction effects between the propulsion system and the airframe\nat all operating conditions. Integrated propulsion system performancemust be validated with the direct-connect and\nfree-jet test data. Viable systems will be flight tested. Design methodologies will be availablefor the implementation\nof airbreathing hypersonic flight.\nCONCLUSIONS\n.\n\nThe aviation industryis critical to the nationaleconomy.Aeropropulsion technologies are essential to\nsatisfying the global environmental requirementsattendant to economically viable transport systems.The aeropropulsion system has been recognized as the pacing technologyfor developing advanced aircraft.Technology\ndevelopment and timely implementation into future systems is a continuing process that requires a detailed longterm planning and commitment as well as a balanced approach betweenenvironmental considerations and economic\n\nfeasibility. NASA Lewis will continue to strengthen its programs and partnerships to develop and transfer key\naeropropulsion technologies addressing national and internationalpriorities. These collaborative programs will play\nan increasingly important role in ensuring U.S. leadershipin aeropropulsion and advancements in safety and\nfundamental research. NASA Lewis Research Center has demonstrated technology advancement in critical technologies areas and is ready to meet the challenges of the future.\n\n10\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nGovernment\nagencies\n\nHBCU\'s\nUniversities\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n_\n\nSDB\'s\nIndustry\n\n_\nAeropropulsion\nChallenge\n\nInternational\norganizations\n\nTechnical\nsocieties\ni\n\nFigure1.--NASA
