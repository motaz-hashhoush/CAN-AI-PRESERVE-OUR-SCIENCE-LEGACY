As shown in FIG. 2, the primary sensing means of 35\nthe present instrument is an angle-of-attack sensing head\n17, cylindrical in form and projecting laterally from the\nside of the aircraft fuselage I6 into the airstream. Sensing head 17 contains two narrow slots, designated by reference numerals 18 and 19, arranged parallel to the axis 40\nof the cylinder and spaced from about 60" to about 90"\napart along the circumference of the cylinder. Slots 18\nand 19 extend throughout the major portion of the cylinder length while constituting only a relatively minor portion of the circumferential area of sensing head 17. Slots 45\n18 and 19 merge, respectively, with a pair of chambers\nor cavities 20 and 21, which are fovmed within sensing\nhead 17 by a partition member 22, wi\'th the respective\ncavities being in fluid communication with flexible conduits 26 and 27, as will be further explained hereinafter.\nConduits 26 and 27 lead to the interior of instrument\nhousing 12 through suitable conventional seals 28 and 29,\nrespectively, at *the base 31 of instrument housing 12.\nThe conduits then connect to the interior of each of two\npressure-responsive aneroid units, designated by reference 55\nnumerals 35 and 45 (FIG. l ) , which are fixedly mounted\nwithin instrument housing 12.\nAneroid units 35 and 45 consists of identical flexible\ndiaphragm wall cells each having the cen\'ter of one wall\nrigidly mounted whereas the center of the other wall is 6~\nmovable by reason of the flexibility of both walls. Units\n35 and 45 are arranged so that the movable faces of each\nare positioned adjacent to one another and rigidly connected to each other by a tie bar 34. It is thus seen that\nwith the airstream direction disposed perpendicularly to 65\nthe cylinder or sensing head 17, at a point on the circum9\nference midway between slots 18 and 1 , that the pressure exerted by the airstream at these openings will be\nequal, but for any other direction of the airstream component, the pressures will be different to thereby provide 70\nthe angle-of-attack sensing capability for instrument 11.\nThe air pressures received by slots 18 and 19 pass through\nconduits 26 and 27 to the interior of aneroid units 35\nand 45 which, with the movable faces being rigidly connected by tie bar 34, move in response to, and in pro- 75\n\nportion to, any differences in pressure in the cell interiors\nto thereby respond definitely to variations in the airflow\nangle of attack at the angle-of-attack sensing head. More\nspecifically, slot 18, as shown in FIG. 2, being connected\nthrough flexible conduit 26 to the interior of aneroid unit\n35 serves to correlate decreases of pressure, at the same\ntime that slot 19, conduit 27, and unit 45 respond to increases in pressure in the respective slots as a result of\nan increasing angle of attack, to move the pair of diaphragms of units 35 and 45 and their inner conneotion or\ntie bar 34 therebetween to the right as shown in FIG. 1,\nto thereby produce an input in instrument 11, the function Qf which will be further explained hereinafter.\nA third flexible diaphragm cell or aneroid unit 55 (FIG.\nl ) , similar in form and mode of operation to those described hereinbefore serves the function of a total-pressure-rate responsive unit, and is fixedly secured within\ninstrument housing 12 adjacent to units 35 and 45 and\nspaced therefrom. A capillary tube 56 of suitable length\nand diameter opens into the interior of unit 55 with the\nother end of capillary tube 56 opening into the interior\nof instrument housing 12. The interior of instrument\nhousing 12 is subjected to the total pressure of the airstream through a tube 57 leading to a total-pressure sensing head S9, of conventional design, suitably secured to\nthe exterior of the aircraft fuselage 16 (FIG. 2 . Tube\n)\n57 is sealed through base 31 of housing 1% by a conventional seal connection 58 and opens into the interior of\nhousing 12. The movable wall of unit 55 is provided\nwith a rigid boss 61 extending laterally therefrom to which\nis secured projeotion or a m 62, the function of which\nwill be further explained hereinafter. When the total\npressure varies, there will be flow through capillary tube\n56 causing a pressure difference across the flexible diaphragm walls of aneroid unit 55 approximately proportional to the rate of change of total pressure, and thereby\na movement of the movable wall also approximately\nproportional to rate of change of total pressure. An increasing total pressure, or positive total pressure rate, will\nthus cause a lower pressure to be exerted on the inner\nsurfaces of the diaphragm of unit 55 than on the outer\nsurfaces causing a movement of the movable diaphragm\nface and the attached boss 61 toward the right as shown\nin FIG. 1. A negative total pressure rate will give the\nopposite result with the movement of the movable diaphragm face toward the left, as shown in FIG. l, the\nmovements producing an input to the instrument as will\nbe further described hereinafter.\nA fourth pressure-responsive unit is part of a rotation\nprogramming unit which employs another aneroid cell 65\nfixedly Positioned in spaced relationship to and along the\nSame longitudinal axis of the hereinbefore described\naneroid units. The interior of aneroid unit 65 is designed\nbe subjected to the static or ambient pressure through\na tubular member 66 leading through the base 31 of housing 12. Tubular member 66 is exteriorly sealed to base\n31 by suitable seal 67 and leads to a static pressure orifice\n68 positioned in the side of the fuselage 16.\nThe exterior of aneroid unit 65 is exposed to the total\npressure existing within the interior of instrument housing\n12 due to tubular connection 57 discussed hereinabove.\nThe pressure differential between outside and inside of\nunit 65 is therefore dynamic pressure-proportional to the\nsquare of fonvaTd speed of the aircraft. The flexible\ndiaphragm O r movalde face of aneroid 65 and the boss\nor Projection 69 attached thereto move to the right as\nshown in FIG. 1 as aircraft speed increases, as does the\narm 71 Projecting Upwardly from boss 69, as will be\nfurther explained hereinafter.\nLINKAGE SYSTEM\nThe linkage system for transmitting output functions\nfrom the hereinbefore described pressure-responsive\naneroid units 35, 45, 55, and 65 will now be described.\nAs mentioned heretofore, aneroid units 35 and 45 have\n\n3,221,549\n\n6\ntheir respective flexible diaphragm walls facin,g and\nrigidly connected to each other by tie bar 34. Tie bar\n34 i s provided with a 1ateTal extending arm 36 servhg\nto normally abut O r Push against a link member 37*\nThe upper end of link 37, as shown in FIG. 1, is figidly 5\nsecured to a freely pivotal cylinder O r rocking drum 38\nwith the other end thereof conneoting with a horizontal\nlink 39 though Pivot COnnection 41* Drum 38 pivotally\nrotates about an axis defined by its shaft 40, With shaft\n40 being journaled at each end into a suitable bearing, 10\nsuch f m example jewel bearings, not shown in the interest\nof clarity. Horizontal link 39 has at its other end a\nPivoted connection 42 joining with the end of a vertical\nlever 43. The Opposite end of vertical lever 43 engages\narm 44 in such manner that lever 43 may be moved 15\nby arm 44 as will be further explained h ~ e i n a f t e r - Arm\n44 has a ninety-degree curved extension, with the longer\nleg thereof in position to abut a JTOkCtiOn 62 which\nextends from boss 61, and terminates in a r i g s COnneCtion with freely pivotal cylinder 46. A vertically disposed 20\nlink 47 is provided parallel to vertical lever 43 and has\na branch 48 which pivotally connects to Vertical lever 43\nat a pivot point substantially intermediate the ends of\nvertical lever 43. One end of vertical link 47 is rigidly\nattached to a freely pivotal cylindeq or rocking shaft 49 25\nwith the other end thereof terminating and ConneCtiDg at\npivot point 51 with rod 52.\nVertical link 47, extension 48, pivotal cylinder 49 and\nvertical lever 43 serve to amplify and sum the motions\nof the angle-of-attack responsive units 35 and 45, and 30\nthe total-pressure-rate-responsive cell 55, in predetermined proportion as determined by the Telative stiffnesses\nof the aneroid cells and the geometry of the linkage SYStem. n i s sum is transmitted through rod 52 leading\nto a summation linkage, generally designated by reference 35\nnumeral 75,as will be fupther explained hereinafter. The\noutput of this portion of the instrument, or the movement of rod 52 may be dekermined by the relation:\n\nLOCKOUT SYSTEM\nReferring now more particularly to FIGS. 3, 4, and 5,\nthe mechanism designed to provide the pilot with means\nof performing consistent rotation and lift-off of the aircraft\nin take-& are illustrated. This mechanism includes a\nlockout system designed to lock the programming unit out\nof action during landing when the signal from this u&\nis not needed or wanted. The lockout system is generally\ndesignated by reference numeral 95 and includes a cylindrical stop 96 secured at one end to and extending from\nh g interior of instrument casing or housing 12. Stop 96\nserves to position and limit the movement of vertical lever\n72,as will be further explained hereinafter. Vertical lever\n72 is attached at one end thereof radially to rocking shaft\n73 with the other end thereof terminating in essentially a\nhalf-cylinder segment having an arcuate and a fiat surface\narea. Vertical lever 72 is urged into abutting relationship\nwith stop 96 due to the slight spring tension exerted on\nthe various elements of the system by hairspring 109.\nHairspring 109, being disposed on indicator staff 88, also\nserves to prevent backlash between the various mechanical\nelements of the system while maintaining the components\nin operative contact with each other. An L - l a t h 98, having a tapered or cam face extension on the short leg thereof is journaled on bearing 97 carried by bracket 99 within\ninstrument casing 12, with the tapered face of latch 98\nnormally abutting the arcuate surface of the end of vertical lever 72. A horizontally disposed L-shaped cam lever\n101 is fixed to arm 71 and has a camming surface on the\nend thereof adapted to abut against latch 98.\nA tension spring 103 having one end connected to a\npin or extension on latch 98 and the other end thereof\nconnected to a pin on a support member 104, which extends from the sidewall of instrument housing 12, is constructed and arranged so as to maintain latch 98 under\ntension, and in contact with vertical lever 72. A shaft\n106, supporting a cam 107, projects downwardly from,\nand is journaled in, boss 69 for movement therewith. The\ncam 107 is angularly positionable, as well as displaceable\n6= KIci.--K+?T\n40 with boss 69, to contact depending arm 74 of rocking shaft\nwhere\n73 at a predetermined aircraft speed to cause the direction of rotation of rocking shaft 73 to be affected.

The input from\naneroid unit 65 is fed t o summation linkage 75 by way\nwhich corresponds to the lift-off speed at which rotation to\nof boss 49 and its attached arm 71 which is in initial 55 lift-off angle of attack would be completed.

Cylinder 78 is\nrigidly secured to a vertical arm 79 leading to summa- 65 leading from the other pressure variable inputs and then\ntransmitted to the indicator or pointer 89 as hereinbefore\ntion linkage 75 by way of pivotal connection 81.\nThe output from summation linkage 75 is amplified\ndescribed.\nand. transmitted through positively connected rocking\nBy (manipulation of the aircraft controls, the pilot will\nthus endeavor to hold a fixed position for the point of inshafts 83 and $4 to a gear seotor 86.

It is to be understood\nthat since conduits 26 and 27 are constructed of flexible\nmaterial that the limited rotation of the sensing head will\nnot affect the transmission of fluid pressure therethrough.\nA scale or index 113 (FIG. l ) , marked off in units of\nangle of attack, is printed on the face of the instrument\ndial adjacent to a slot through which a cursor or pointer\n114 projects to indicate the position to which the angle-ofattack sensing head has turned in response to movement\nof knob 111. It is also obviously within the scope of the\npresent invention, if desired, to provide the movement of\nthe angle-of-attack setting knob 111 to transmit, by direct\ngearing, movement of the cursor or pointer 114. However, for reasons of safety, in the preferred form of the\npresent invention the cursor I14 is driven by a receiving\nunit 115 (FIG. 1) through gear 118 and gear segment 119,\nof the electrical self-synchronizing motor system 112; a\ntransmitter unit 116 (FIG. 2) being connected to receiver\nunit 115 through electrical leads 617 for directing the location of the angle-of-attack sensing head 1 .\n7\nThe second knob on the instrument face, designated\nby reference numeral 120 and marked \xe2\x80\x9cWeight,\xe2\x80\x9d when\npressed in against spring 121, so as to engage a conventional type clutch mechanism, which is generally designated by reference numeral 122, causes integrally secured\ngear 123 to contact a like gear 124 provided on rotating\nshaft 106 to effectrotation of cam 107, and simultaneously\ncausing the cursor 127 to move relative to the lower index\nor scale 128 which is marked off in units of aircraft\nweight. Due to the fact that takeoff rotation and lift-off\nspeeds are directly related to aircraft weight for a given\naircraft, the instrument is constructed and arranged so\nthat, by setting cursor 127 by means of \xe2\x80\x9cWeight\xe2\x80\x9d knob\n120 to point to a value on the weight index 128 representing the aircraft weight at takeoff, the cam l Q 7 is\nsimultaneously set to the position that will provide indication of the correct rotation and lift-off speeds for that\nweight.\nThe action of the rotation programing assembly in\nconjunction with the angle of attack and total pressure\nrate summing mechanism is further explained hereinafter.\n\n5\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n80\n\nOPERATION\n\nAs mentioned hereinbefore, prior to takeoff, the angleof-attack senskg head 17 is set in such position that\nwith the aircraft at the proper angle of attack and speed\nfor lift-off, the output of summing linkage 75 is null\nand Will cause no displacement of indicator hand 89\nfrom the reference marker or indicia 90. However,\nduring ground roll, that is, the period of acceleration\nup to rotational speed, the aircraft will be at an m e n tially constant and lower angle of attack than that for\nwhich the angle-of-atteck sensing head is set. There\nwill thus be a difference of pressure in aneroid units\n35 and 45, proportional to the difference in angle of\nattack between ground roll and lift-off, and proportional\nto dynamic pressure, resulting in increasing displacement (rightward in FIG. 1) of rod 52. At the same time,\nthe increasing dynamic pressure will act on the aneroid\nunit or pressure cell 65 of the \xe2\x80\x9crotation programing\nassembly\xe2\x80\x9d giving an input motion (leftward in FIG. 1)\nto the summing linkage 75 which, at first, offsets the\ninput from rod 52. The output motion of summing\nlinkage 75 is therefore nulled and the indicator hand\n89, being initially alined on reference indicia, remains\n\n65\n\nGO\n\n65\n\n70\n\n75\n\nzeroed or alined with the reference indicia 90 without\nany action required by the pilot of the aircraft.\nWhen rotation speed is reached, however, the cam\n107 engages the depending arm 74 of rocking shaft 73\nthereby reversing the direction of the input motion, as\nairplane speed increases further. The pilot must then\nactuate the aircraft controls to increase the aircraft angle\nof attack, thereby reversing the motion of rod 52, to\nmaintain zero output of summing linkage 75 and consequent continued alinement of indicator 89 with reference\nindicia 90. When aircraft speed has reached the desired lift-off speed, rocking shaft 73 will have returned\nto its zero or static position and will be restrained from\nfurther movement by stop member 96 as speed continues\nto increase. Rod 52 must therefore, also have returned\nto its initial zero position, if the indicator hand 89 is\nstill zeroed and the aircraft will be at the angle of attack desired for lift-off. If, thereafter, the pilot continues to control the aircraft so as to keep indicator hand\n89 zeroed o n indicia 90, the aircraft will follow a smooth\ntransition flight path to a steady climbout condition.\nIn order that the rotation programing assembly may\nbe inactivated t o permit use of the instrument during\nlanding approach, the latch assembly 95 and its corresponding parts are provided, the operation of which is\nbest followed by referring to FIGS. 3 to 5. As aircraft\nspeed increases during the takeoff ground roll, the differential pressure cell or fourth aneroid unit 65, contracts\nin proportion to the square of ground speed. The boss\n69 carried by the movable face of pressure cell 65 moves\nto the right (as shown in FIG. 3) and thereby moves\narm 71 and rotatable shaft 106, Vertical lever 72 is\nheld in contact with the end of arm 71 under the influence of the indicator staff coilspring 109 and is thereby caused to move away from stop member 96 and rotate clockwise, as viewed in FIG. 3, about the axis of\nrocking shaft 73. At a certain speed, or rotation speed,\ngoverned by the position of cam 1@7,which in turn i s\ncontrolled by rotation of rotating shaft 106, the depending arm 74 contacts the surface of cam 107. Since\ncam 107 is also being moved to the right by contraction\nof the fourth aneroid unit or differential pressure cell\n55 with increasing aircraft speed, the vertical lever 72\nis caused to reverse its direction of rotation; that is, to\ncommence rotating counterclockwise, with any further\nincrease of speed, until at lift-off speed it is returned\nto its starting position against stop member 96. Curved\narm 76, which projects upwardly from rocking shaft\n73, duplicates the motions of vertfcal lever 72 and transmits these motions to the summing linkage 75 as described\nhereinbefore.\nThe lockout mechanism of the rotation programing\nunit is composed o\xe2\x82\xac latch 98, which rotates about a\nsuitable bearing or pivot connection 99 with spring 103\napplying a clockwise moment to latch 98 (FIGS. 1 and\n4), and the L-shaped cam arm 101 which is rigidly fixed\nto arm 71. In the rest or zero speed condition, the\ncam arm 101 holds latch 98 out of contact with vertical lever 72. As aircraft speed increases during the\ntakeoff ground roll, the pressure cell or aneroid unit 65\ncontracts in proportion to the square of speed causing\narm 71, cam arm 101 and shaft 106 to move to the right\n(FIG. 3). Vertical lever 72, which is held in contact\nwith the end of arm 71 by the action of indicator staff\ncoilspring 109 or by an auxiliary spring, not shown, is\nthereby caused to move away from stop 96 and rotate\nclockwise about the axis of rocking shaft 73. This allows\nspring 103 to move latch 98 clockwise in such a way\nthat its extremity moves in behind, or to the left of vertical lever 72 as viewed in FIG. 3.\nAt a certain aircraft speed, or rotation speed which\nis governed by the position of cam surface 107, which\nin turn is controlled by rotation of shaft 106, the depending arm 74 engages cam surface 107. Since cam\nsurface 107 is also being moved to th? right, by con-\n\n3.221.549\n\n1\ntraction of cell (65 as aircraft speed increases, vertical\nlever 72 is then caused to reverse direction of rotation\nor rotate counterclockwise. The instrument parts are so\n\'constructed and arranged that when vertical lever 72\nrotates counterclockwise, by the action of cam 107, it\nmoves back toward stop member 96 and engages the\ntapered or cam face extension on latch 98 forcing the\nlatch back against its spring 103 until, when lever 92\nis against stop 96, it has cleared the latch. Spring 103\nthen forces latch 98 to move in front of vertical lever\n72 and engages the flat surface thereon to lock it in position against stop 96. A t this point, the aircraft has\nreached lift-off speed.\nIt will thus be noted that cam arm 101 is still held\nout of engagement with latch 98 since at this speed the\naneroid unit 65 has forced arm 71 and cam arm 101\nto the right (as viewed in FIG. 3 ) . The latch 98 therefore holds vertical lever 72 against stop 96 throughout\nthe flight and landing until during the attainment of\naequired low-landing touchdown speed, the aneroid unit\nor cell 65 will have returned far enough toward its rest\nposition that cam arm 101 again engages latch 98 and\nforces it back out of engagement with vertical lever 72\npreparatory to the next takeoff, wherein the cycle of\noperation would be repeated during the next takeoff run\nof the aircraft.\nAs is obvious to those skilled in the aircraft instrumentation art, various means for damping and mass balancing the various elements of the herein described instrument to avoid excessive response of the indicator\nhand 89 to vibrations, are considered an essential part\nof this instrument. Also, all the various rotating parts,\nsuch for example as described hereinbefore for cylinder\n38, are provided with suitable bearings supported by\nconventional supports attached to the instrument housing interior. Such means are well known in the art\nand have been omitted in the illustration and description herein in the interest of clarity.\nMODIFICATION\nReferring now to FIG. 6, a schematic diagram of a\nmodification of the hereinbefore described instrument is\nshown, and wherein similar or like elements are designated\nby like reference numerals and need not be further described. The embodiment illustrated in FIG. 6 operates\non the same principles as the system described hereinbefore with the major difference being that the transmission and summing of the various outputs of the pressureresponsive cells is performed elearically rather than\nmechanically, with the electric power being supplied by\nsuitable source 130. The various pressure-responsive\nunits of this embodiment are each enclosed in separate\nhermetically sealed containers within instrument housing\n12. That is, the individual units are sealed except for the\ntubular conduit connection from the appropriate pressure\nsources and the required electrical connections as will be\nfurther explained hereinafter. It is also, obviously, within\nthe scope of this invention to provide the various units\nin separate locations within the aircraft without requiring them to be enclosed within the same instrument\nhousing.\nThe angle-of-attack responsive unit of this embodiment\nincludes compartment 131 having the interior thereof\nconnected to the upper slot of an angle-of-attack sensing\nhead 17 (identical to that described hereinbegore), by way\nof tubular conduit 133, and the interior of the contained\naneroid cell 132 being connected to the lowermost slot of\nsensing head 17 by way of conduit 135. Aneroid unit\n132 is so constructed and arranged that an increase in\nangle of attack above that for which the sensing head 17\nis set initially, or the null position, causes movement of\nthe flexible diaphragm face of cell 132 to the right as\nviewed in the schematic illustration of FIG. 6 . A linkage 134 is attached to the movable face of cell 132 and\nserves to actuate the movable arm 137 of a potentiometer\n\n5\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nd,,\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n65\n\n70\n\n75\n\ndesignated by reference numeral 138. Potentiometer 138\nis connected in series with a Wheatstone bridge circuit 140\nprovided in casing 168 and constructed so that movement\nof variable arm 137 due to an increase in aircraft angle\nof attack causes an increase in resistance in arm 141 of\nthe bridge circuit 140. Obviously, in a decrease in aircraft angle of attack, the resistance in arm 141 would also\nbe deceased, as will be further explained hereinafter.\nThe total-pressure-responsive-unit compartment, designated by reference numeral 148 has an aneroid cell 151\nfixedly attached therein with the exterior of cell 151 being\nsubjected to a total pressure sensing head 59 by way of\nconduit 153. The movable face of aneroid cell 151 has\na linkage or movable arm 154 attached thereto in pivotal\nconnection with a movable arm 155 of a potentiometer\n156. Potentiometer 156 is also connected in series with\nWheatstone bridge circuit 140. The total pressure encountered by the aircraft is transmitted to the interior of\naneroid cell 151 through a suitable capillary tube 56, as\nin the previously described embodiment, so that an increasing total pressure of positive total-pressure-rate, will\ncause the aneroid cell 151 to move the linkage or arm 154\nto the left as shown in FIG. 6 and thereby through the\nassociated potentiometer 156 cause an increase in resistance in the arm 142 of the Wheatstone bridge circuit 140.\nAs seen in the schematic diagram of FIG. 6, arm 142 of\nbridge 140 is adjacent to arm 141 which is associated with\nthe angle-of-attack unit. The result is a voltage across\nthe output terminals at the bridge circuit 140 which may\nbe described by the relation:\nV=K~~--K~H\nWherein\nV=the bridge output voltage;\na=the angle-of-attack indication;\nl?=the total pressure rate; and,\nK 1 and K,=constants having suitable prescribed values\ndetermined by pressure cell-stiffness, linkage arrangement, and potentiometer resistance characteristics.\nThe rotation programing unit of the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 6 comprises compartment 158 having the\ninterior thereof connected t,o static pressure source 68, by\nway of conduit 159, and containing an aneroid pressure\ncell 161. The interior of pressure cell 161 is connected\nto the total pressure sensing head 59 through tubular\nmember 162. Two potentiometers 164 and 165 are oonnected to aneroid cell 161 through a suitable linkage system, generally designated by reference numeral 167, serving to control movement of the respective movable arms\nof the two potentiometers in relation to the movement\nof the movable face of pressure cell 161. Potentiometer\n164 is connected in series with resistance arm 144 of bridge\ncircuit 140 and provides an increasing resistance in arm\n144 as aircraft speed increases during the takeoff ground\nrun. The increasing resistance in arm 144 balances out\nthe effect of the decreasing resistance in arm 141 which\nis simultaneously occurring due to the lower angle of attack of the aircraft in the ground run, relative to the setting\nof the angle-of-attack sensing head 17 which has been\ninitially set for lift-off angle of attack. Potentiometer\n165, which is connected in series with arm 143 of bridge\ncircuit 140 is arranged so that when the aircraft reaches\nrotation speed it will provide a resistance increasing at a\nsuitably greater rate than that of the potentiometer 164.\nThus, when the aircraft reaches lift-off speed the resistance change in potentiometers 164 and 165 will be equal\nand their combined effect on the bridge output will be null.\nIn the interval between rotation speed and lift-off speed,\ntherefore, the pilot will have to increase the aircraft angle\nof attack to keep the bridge circuit 140 in balance and the\noutput voltage zeroed. As a result, at lift-off speed the\naircraft will be at the required angle of attack.\nThe speed or dynamic pressure at which potentiometer\n165 begins to cause an increasing resistance is the aircraft\n\n3,221,549\n\n1\nrotation speed and can be adjusted in relation to the takeoff weight of the aircraft by means of the \xe2\x80\x9cWeight Adjustment Knob\xe2\x80\x9d 120 which actuates a suitable adjustment\nmechanism, designated by reference numeral 169. Adjustment mechanism 169 varies the dynamic pressure or\naircraft speed at which potentiometer 165 begins its increasing resistance to a value appropriate to the aircraft\nweight at which a particular takeoff is to be made. The\nadjusting of knob 120 also actuates a suitable weight index,\nnot shown, similar to that described in the previously\ndescribed embodiment.\nA stop mechanism is provided to halt the action of the\nrotation programing unit enclosed in compartment 158\nat the same time that the output of this unit is nulled at\nlift-off speed. This stop mechanism includes a pivoted\narm 171, which, due to the construction of linkage 167,\nis driven by the aneroid cell 161 at a slower angular rate\nthan the movement of the movable arm of potentiometer\n165. The adjustable arm 166 of potentiometer 165 is\ncontrolled by the weight adjusting knob 120 and adapted\nto engage pivotal arm 171 at the desired lift-off speed to\nthereby prevent further notion of the movable arms of potentiometers I64 and 165 driven by the pressure cell 161\nthrough linkage 167. When it is desirable to use the\nangle-of-attack, total-pressure-rate combination for landing approach, suitable provisions may be made to shortcircuit the rotation programing unit contained in compartment 158 as soon as lift-off speed is reached and holding\nit in this position until aircraft speed becomes zero again,\nat which time it could be restored to active condition. The\ndeactivating and reactivating of this unit could be accomplished automatically by a suitable conventional system\nof microswitches and relays which are not shown, but are\nwell known to those skilled in the art.\nThe indicator for the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 6,\nconsists essentially of a voltmeter or galvanometer driven\nby the output voltage from bridge circuit 140 which in\nturn drives indicator hand 89 on the instrument face. As\nseen in FIG. 6, indicator hand 89 points toward reference\nindicia 90 which is the position at which the indicator\nhand 89 should be held by suitable control of the aircraft\nby the pilot during the takeoff run and climbout as well\nas during all other flight conditions, in which the system\nmight be used, such for example as in cruising and in\nlanding approach.\nAn angle-of-attack adjusting knob 111 is provided at\nthe indicator unit face for adjusting the angle-of-attack\nsensing head 17 to the position corresponding to the desired aircraft angle of attack, with the adjusting mechanism being the same or similar to that previously described\nand including a servo-motor system for locating the sensing head 17. A scale 113 is provided on the dial with\ncursor or pointer 114 relatively movable therewith to indicate the aircraft angle of attack corresponding to the\nsetting of the angle-of-attack sensing head.\nIt is thus seen that in each of the herein described embodiments of the invention that an instrument has been\ninvented that will enable the pilot of an aircraft to control\nhis aircraft, in the vertical plane throughout the takeoff\nroll, rotation to lift-off angle of attack and climbout, by\nreferring to a single indicator as compared to the multiplicity of indicators which must be used in present-day\naircraft operation. The use of this instrument is not\nmeant to imply that all other instruments normally used\nin aircraft operation are to be completely ignored. On\nthe contrary, the well-trained pilot is taught to scan constantly all the pertinent aircraft instruments, but when he\nis flying by use of the instrument of the present invention he needs to make corrections through the aircraft\ncontrols only as called for by this single instrument and\nthe other instruments will then indicate the desired readings as they are scanned.\nReferring now back to FIG. 1, the theoretical development leading to the use of pressure sensing devices to produce the combined signal for angle of attack and rate of\n\n12\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n2o\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\nchange of total pressure, and the relative sensitivities required in combining these measurements to provide phugoid damping, will now be explained. The output or signal from angle of attack units 35 and 45 and rate of change\nof total pressure unit 55 corresponds to angle of attack\nminus a given amount of rate of change of total pressure\nas indicated by the expression, a-KH.\nThe angle-of-attack measurement, as discussed hereinbefore, comes from cylindrical sensing head 17 mounted\nwith its axis horizontal and perpendicular to the airstream\nwith slots 18 and $9 located angularly apart on the upstream face thereof. Thus, when the angle of the airstream component is such that it bisects the angle between\nthe orifices, the slot pressures p1 and pu are equal. The\nangular deviation A a of the wind component from this\nposition is given by the following relation, which is based\non the theoretical flow past a circular cylinder in a uniform stream:\nPl--Pu=8sA.a=Pa\nwhere: q=dynamic pressure.\nWhen the cylinder 17 is mounted laterally from the side\nof a fuselage of near-circular cross section the indicated\nvalue of A a will be about 1.5 times the actual value because of the cross flow around the fuselage and the resultant change in local flow direction. Values of p, are independent of dynamic pressure only when this device is used\nas a null-seeking instrument whereby the angular position\nof the \xe2\x80\x9cnulled\xe2\x80\x9d cylinder is equivalent to the angle of attack. The cylindrical sensing head 17 is preset to some\ndesired angle -a, such that it is nulled when the airplane\nis rotated to the proper angle ( A a = a + a , ) .\nThe method of measuring total-pressure rate is similar\nto the method used for a rate-of-climb meter and is based\non the measurement of the pressure difference across\ncapillary 56 connecting the total pressure H and the pressure in a fixed volume pQ, as shown in the following\nrelation:\nH=q+P\nwhere:\nH=total pressure\np=static pressure\nPQ=pressure in volume Q\nq=dynamic pressure\n\nTDPQ=H-P,\n50\n\nwhere:\nP ~ = p r e s s u r esensed by unit 55\n55\n\nd\nD=operator dt\n\neo\n\np=viscosity of air in capillary\nZ=length of capillary tube\nQ=volume of chamber\nr=radius of capillary tube\nThe pressure signals sensed by the pressure measuring\ndevices, Le., units 35 and 45 and unit 55, are combined\nto give an instrument reading, 6, as follows:\n\n70\n\nwhere K1 and K2 are constants determined by the sensitivities of the aneroid pressure cells 35, 45, and 55, respectively, and the linkage system of the instrument with\nthe ratio KZ/Kl establishing the amount of phugoid damp75 ing. The relation between rate-of-change of total pres-\n\n3,221,549\n\n1\n\n13\nsure and aircraft motion is given by the following expression:\n\ndH\n-=- dq\ndt\n\ndt\n\nd\n+d p =pv- V -pg-= dh\ndt\n\ndt\n\ndq\nV--pgVr\nds\n\ndt\n\nwhere :\np=static pressure\np=density of air\ns=distance along flight path\nV=flight-path velocity\ny=flight-path angle\nOr for conyenience, using the nondimensional notation\n\ns*=-s\n\nPS\nand\nq10\n\nD*-\n\nc\n\ni)\n\nis the spatial angular frequency of the oscillation in terms\nof s*. For the exemplary aircraft considered herein,\n-- 0.178\ncDCL\n\nand\n10\n\nv1,=313 ft./see.\nWith these values it is found that the oscillations have a\nperiod of 40 seconds and a damping ratio\n\nd\n\nds*\n\nu of 0.125. That is, with the use of angle-of-attack alone\nwhere subscript lo refers to lift-off condition, we have:\n20 as a pilot\'s reference, a long-period, poorly damped oscillatory flight path will follow take-off.\nDH=pgV( D*q*-y)\nIf the aircraft is to be controlled by means of the inEquation 1 may be expressed as follows, for low frestrument described hereinbefore as represented by Equaquency motion such as in the phugoid oscillation and\ntion 2, the equations of motion may be written by subwith the time constant T small compared to the motion\n25 stituting Equation 3 in Equations 4 and 5 :\nfrequency\n(D*+c)q*+y=b-e[X+~(D*q*-y)l\n(8)\nPk= TDH\n-1/2q*+D*y=1/2a[X+~(D*q*--y)]\n(9)\nEquation 2 then becomes\nThe aircraft is to be controlled so that the instrument\n6=K18qAp-K27pgV(D*q*--y)\n30 reading described remains constant (8=constant).
