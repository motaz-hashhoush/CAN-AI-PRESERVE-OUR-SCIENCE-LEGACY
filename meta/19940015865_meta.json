The 4 week postflight recordings included: postflight recordings from flight animals; postflight recordings on 3 control (non-flight) animals; postflight recalibration of force transducers on 1 flight and 4 control (non-flight) animals; and attempts to record EMG and video data from the flight animals during postflight locomotion and postural activity. The flight EMG recordings suggest that significant changes in muscle control may occur in spaceflight. It is also clear from recordings that levels of EMG recorded during spaceflight can attain values similar to those measured on earth. Amplifier gain settings should therefore probably not be changed for spaceflight.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19940015865, "id": "59df3a2bf64a4426a4faa65f716df051", "publicationDate": "1993-11-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19940015865.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19940015865/downloads/19940015865.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19940015865/downloads/19940015865.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19940015865/downloads/19940015865.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
