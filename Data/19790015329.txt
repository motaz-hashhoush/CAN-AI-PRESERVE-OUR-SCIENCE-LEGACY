Primary\nareas of investigation were the potential ob the SPS as a weapon, for supporting\nU.S. military preparedness and for affecting international relations. In addition,\nthe SPS\'s relative vulnerability to overt military action, terrorist attacks, and\nsabotage was considered.\nThe SPS could act as an electronic warfc..e weapon and, with modification,\nas a marginally effective energy-beaming weapon. The system could support\nmilitary preparedness by providing energy for a strong and stable U.S. economy\nand by providing a powered platform for military systems, system segments,\nand operations.\nThe SPS would be vulnerable to military action, terrorism and sabotage\nunless hardened against these attacks by design, security, and a self-defense\nsystem. Because space is an international resource, military use of the SPS,\neven to protect itself, may have an adverse impact on the relations of the United\nStates with other nations.\nTasks identified for completion in fiscal year 1979 include (a) a detailed\nvulnerability study, (b) evaluation of an SPS self-defense system concept, (c)\ndetermination of the effect of SPS flexibility to deliver different sized electrical\nloads on the ability to gain SPS support from individual nations, and (d) investigation of the effect of SPS deployment schedule on obtaining needed agreements,\nproviding security, and controlling risks of armed conflict. A fifth and !Ong-term\ntask would consist of a worldwide survey identifying military imrlit-ations of\nthe SPS that result from the specific requirements of potential SPS power customers.\n\n*See table 2.1.\t\n\n\t\nvii\n\nINT>clUTiDIiI^,i.;.Y\n\ni^\n\nwpm\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n\t\n\nr i\n\nPage\nv\n\nPREFACE\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nGLOSSARY\nINTRODUCTION\nI.\t\n11.\t SURVEY OF RELEVANT LITERATURE AND RELATED WORK\n\nvii\nxi\nI\n3\n\n2.1\t Weapon and Military Preparedness Implications\n2.2\t Impacts on International Relations\n2.3\t Relative Vulnerability\n1 1 I.

INTROC.iUCTION\nThe U.S. Deportment of Energy (DOE) and the National Aeronautics and\nSpace Administration (NASA) are investigating a potential new source of energy\ncalled the Satellite Power System (SPS)J/ The SPS concept involves placing\nin orbit around the earth satellites equipped with large solar arrays. The arrays\ncollect solar radiation from the sun (approximately 99 percent of the time), which\nis then converted to electromagnetic radiation and beamed by a transmission\nsystem located on the satellites to receiving/conversion stations on the ground.\nThe receiving equipment at the conversion static i changes the electromagnetic\nradiation, to electricity that can be fed directly nto the utility network. The\nsatellite and receiving antenna/rectifier (recter t , a), for the current NASA2/ reference system using solar cells, and microwave power transmission subsystems\nare approximately 50 and 100 sq. km in size, resp -ctively. The system is designed\nso that each rectenna will provide power to the itility grid. The scope of the\nconcept can be placed in perspective by considering that the generating cc; ocity\nof these satellites would be equal to all the electrical power generated in the\nUnited States in 1975. Projected energy demand at the turn of the century, as\nwell as basic economics, indicate that at least 60 satellites will need to be programmed.\nSuch a system is anticipated to have far-reaching impacts on society.\nThe SPS will have many features in common with systems of past and current\nspace programs and will build on the technology that these programs have created.\nSystem development, production, and deployment will be coGtly processes, and\nSPS relative productiveness will be relied on to place it within the cost feasibility\nrange. Lightweight structures and equipment and reliable operation, made possible\nby the favorable environment of space and design for the market, may hold the\nsecrets to the needed cost control. If it is believed that the SPS will fulfill its\npostulated role by becoming a supplier of a significant part of the total energy\nconsumed in the United States at some time during the first half of the twentyfirst century, then SPS development, production, and deployed assets are valuable\nto both civilian and military segments of our nation now and in the forseeable\nfuture. Furthermore, if the United States decides to depend on the SPS for so\ngreat a part of its total energy supply, the systern must be seCL , re. Some believe\nthat the SPS cannot be defended successfully, but that if it could be, this defense\nwould cost more than the SPS.\n\n\t\n\nThe investment of materials, effort, and money to fill the energy gap in\nthe time available will be large but finite. Spending a large part of these resources\non the development and deployment of a system that is superior from the standpoints\nof technological, economical, and environmental risks and yet is militarily indefensible actually may be squandering the resources. What is worse, however,\nis that these resources (and valuable time) then are denied to the alternative\n"runner-up" energy system concept that (though inferior in some respects) is\nacceptable and militarily defensible. This study has been performed to determine\nwhat role, if any, the SPS has in the U.S. military posture. Tasks includes\' the\nfollowing:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nInvestigation of the SPS potential as a weapon or other supportive\nelement of U.S. military preparedness;\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nInvestigation of the potential for impacts on international relations;\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nInvestigation of the relative vulnerability to overt military action,\nterrorist attacks, or sabotage; and\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nIdentification of questions needing further study.\n\n2\n\n1 I. SURVEY OF RELEVANT LITERATURE AND RELATED WORK\n\nThe survey for unclassified relevant literature and information on related\nwork has included a Defense Documentation Center search, a search of We open\nliterature, and conferences and contacts with representatives of the Department\nof Energy (DOE), the Department of Defense (DOD), the National Aeronautics\nand Space Administration (NASA), and industrial organizations and individuals\nacting in a private capacity. During this survey it was learned that several efforts\nhave included the consirieration and documentation of the general topic of military\nactivities in space. Examples include references 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. However,\nwith the exception of reference 6, no effort has been made to summarize this\nwork because these reports and papers are readily available. Some of *he pertinent\ninformation contained in reference 6 concerning laws and treaties is summarized\nby\n\nNor. Leonard Uavid in appendix A.\nThe potentia- of the Satellite Power Systern (SPS) to function as a weapon,\n\nsupport U.S. rnilitary preparedness, and affect international relations and SPS\nvulnerability, are discussed in the following paragraphs.\n2.1 WEAPON AND MILITARY PREPAREDrJESS h iPLICATIUNS\nCivilian space systems, like military space systerns, are bcsed on current\ntechnology; therefore, the systems provided by NASA and DOU would be expected\nto have many common features, several of which could implicate the SPS militarily.\nIn 1958, shortly otter the Sputnik la,inch, NASA 8/ was formers from the old Notional\nAdvisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) and from selected individuals and\ngroups performing DUD space-related work. Proje :i transferred to NASA included\nproject Vanguard and certain lunar probes and rocket engine programs. The tonnation\nof joint committees of i4ASA and military personnel to pursue common objectives\nand the free rnovenient of worKers (even the astronauts) Between rnilitar," and\nNASA space projects tend to promote similarities between NASA and military\nspace efforts and equipment. Therefore, it does not seem inappropriate to consider\nthe question of military implications of a civilian space system.\n2J.1\n\nWeapon Implications\nUse of the SPS as a weapon is a major concern. U.S. r itizens as well us\n\nforeign governMents and their citizens will want to know whether the power\ntransmission beams can open ite as weapons and what assurances can be provided\nthat this 5 giynwatts of power will riot be used cis a weapon. The weapons i\'llplic\'.01011\nof the I\'AMA reference SPS (table 2.1) is exornined.\n3\n\n\t\n\nTable 2.1 Summary of SPS Reference System Concept\nGenerating Capacity\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nS GW DC output per SPS unit at the utility interface\n\nOperational Characteristics\ne\t\n\nFlat solar array with transmitting antenna on one end\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nPower collection at GEO\n\nEnergy Conversion\ne\t\n\nPhotovoltaic\xe2\x80\x94single-crysral gallium aluminum arsenide or singlecrystal silicon\n\nPower Transmission\ne\t\n\nMicrowave, phased-array transm\' t : ing antenna, klystron power amplifiers and slotted waveguide rod` \t\nelements\n\nStructural Material\ne\t\n\nGraphite composite\n\nR ectenno\ne\t\n\nSubarray panel with -8 km 2 active element area\n\nSpace Construction\ne\t\n\nConstruction at GEO\n\nSpace Transportation\ne\t\n\nHeavy Lift Launch Vehicle !,HLLV)\xe2\x80\x94two-staae, vertical launch, winged,\nhorizontal land-landing, reusable vehicles with 400 metric ton payload\nto low earth orbit\n\ne\t\n\nPersonnel Launch Vehicle (PLV)\xe2\x80\x94modified Space Shuttle orbiter with\npassenger module\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nCargo Orbital Transfer Vehicle (CO TV)\xe2\x80\x94 independent reusable electricpowered vehicle\n\n0\t\n\nPersonnel Orbital Transfer Vehicle (POTV)--two-stage, reusable chemical fuel vehicle\n\nEarth Launch Site\ne\t\n\nKennedy Space Center pending further study\n4\n\n\t\n\ne\n\n2.1.1.1\t\n\nMicrowave Power Transmission Subsystem (MPTS)\n\nThe MPTS is the transmission subsystem used in \'he current NASA reference\nSPS concept. The system, to be constructed and deployed in geostationary earth\norbit (GEO), will Ee ,p owered by a solar cell array having a platform of approximately SS sq. km . Tuble 2.2 provides MPTS details ?/ from which ;` foi`.owing\nobservations can be made:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nThe system radiates a large amount of power.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nPower density at its highest level nets the center of the antenna is\na relatively low 2.2 W/cm 2 (approximately 16 solar constants), from\nwhich workers near the antenna can be shielded for short periods\nof tinie. (Figure 2.1 is a plot of maximum power density versus distance\nfrom the antenna toward the ground receiver.)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nThere should be no trouble designing spacecraft that can travel in\nthis beam with passengers aboard. Spacecraft or satellites not designed\nfor this radiation field could overheat when moving ;lowly through\na\nit \xe2\x80\x94/ resulting in temporary disability or permanent damage to their\nelectronic systems.\n\nTwo possibilities exist for weapon use. First, the bccm could be defocused\nand noise introduced to render se!ected communications ineffective (an electronic\nwarfare weapon). Second, the beam could be directed at ground targets or scanned\nin a manner to follow spacecraft until overheating occurs, and/or until electronic\nfailure Jisables the craft or produce- a mission abort.\n\n2.1.2\n\nU.S. Military Preparedness Implications\nThe energy problem of the DOD was defined in the January 1977 U.S. Navy\n\nEnergy PIan9/ as f of l ows:\nThe most serious and pervasive threat to long-term national stability is\nthe growing world inadequacy of assured energy resources to support world\nneeds. National security depends on maintaining o wor !,Iwide balance of\nthe distribution of energy resources. Notional security objectives can be\nachieved only if the United States is thoroughly prepared to meet essential\nindustrial and military energy requirements. Attaining these objectives,\ndeterring armed conflict, producing modern weapons systerns, cnd maintaining\nthe overall : eadiness of the U.S. military are all keyed to uninterrupted\nenergy supplies.\n\n\xc2\xb0-/ A radiation level as high as 1.5 W/crn 2 is permitted for aircraft. H:,,4,\nspeed circraft flying at low altitude are able to dissipate radiatiai loads several\ntimes this value. (In space there is no air flow across spacecraft surfaces to\ncool there. Therefore, the radiant heat of the beam must be rejected by tyre\nuse of reflective surfaces and/or absorption and reradiati(n.)\n\n,a\n\nTable 2.2 Microwave Power Transmission Subsystem Parameters\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nFrequency 2.45 GHz\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nWavelength = 12.2 cm\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nOutput Power to Power Grid = 5 GW\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nTransmit Array Size = I km in diameter, 13.4 x 10 6 kg mass\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nPower Radiated from Transmit Array = 6.85 ^N\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nMPTS Efficiency = 6;.1 percent\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nPhase Control System: An active retrodirective array with a pilot beam\nreference for providing phase conjugation.

The embargo on the export of petroleum products to\nselected countries in October of 1973 by the OPEC nations, and the realization\nthat petroleum is a limited resource, have placed a high national priority on energy\nand energy-related issues. Objectives have been a:tablished to:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nCunserve energy;\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nIncrease domestic oil and gas production while reducing the use of\noil and gas;\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nConvert oil and gas electric plants to other fuels, such as coal, hydro,\nnuclear, solar;\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nDevelop the inexhaustible energy resources;\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nReduce oil imports; and\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nDevelop a billion barrel petroleum reserve.\n\nThe embargo has pointed out to the military the necessity of having a reliable\nsource for each form of energy or fuel that it uses and has caused accelerated\nenergy planning. Military bases, for example, have introduced programs to supply\nmuch of their own energy requirements and to reduce their dependence on outside\nsources.\nThese basic energy availability and use issues implicate the "PS in U.S.\nmilitary preparedness. Many in the military community who have surveyed the\nproblem believe that the United States will begin to be affected by the fuel shortage by 1985 or 1990; costs are already reducing fuel availability to some of the\npopulation. The power expected from the SPS cannot relieve these early shortages\ndirectly, but its imminence may encourage a freer flow of oil into the market,\nthereby keeping a bad situation from becoming intolerable.b/\nIf the SPS comes on line, its power can begin to be used in the following\nways:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nStrengthen the civilian/industrial sector, allowing more effective\nsupport to the military in the areas of technology, production, and\ncapi tal;\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nFree larger quantities of portable fuels required for military mobility\n(and mobility related stockpiling);\n\nb/ Dr. William Shurcliff has pointed out that the encouragement of a freer\nflow (and use) of oil, with the prospects of an SPS that in fact does not come\non line, could hasten and intensify the ultimate energy bind.\n8\n\n,A\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nProvide electricity to military ground installations through the utilities;\nand\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nSupply markets that will strengthen mutual security bands and reduce\ntensions.\n\nThe current plan is to deploy two 5-GW SPS units each year starting in the year\n2000 and running through the year 2030 for a total SPS output of 300 GW. This\nis equivalent to the 1975 electrical power generating capacity in the United States\nand from 7.5 to 10.0 percent of the expected U.S. power requirement in 2030.\n(Other scenarios have projected the SPS deployment rate at two times to approxirnately four times this rate.)\nAny growing dependence of the United States on an unfolding and successful\nSPS for power, coupled with the constant dependence of military preparedness\non an economically and industrially strong United States, will implicate the SPS\nin U.S. military preparedness. However, the implication goes farther; the SPS\nmust be protected by either the U.S. military or a military/quasi-military force\nin which the United States plays a part commensurate with its potential for loss.\n2.1.3 Platform for Weapons\nThe NASA 5-GW SPS reference design is driven by a solar cell array with\nan area of approximately 50 sq. km .?/ This array is supported by a platform\nthat is 10,400 m long, 5,200 m wide, and 470 m thick\xe2\x80\x94a volume of approximately\n25 cu km. Materials used in this platform and its design combine for an extremely\nlightweight structure having the appropriate stiffness for SPS functions. This\nplatform, as well as SPS construction/maintenance facilities and personnel living\nquarters would seem from a cursory examination to be ideal assets for beginning\nany necessary SPS military operations. Military housing and work areas could\nbe integrated into the SPS solar array platform by modifying and beefing up structures as required. The array could be extended to supply any added quantities\nof ei.. i, icity needed by the military unit. During times of conflicts / the array\nwould be a prodigious source of power that could he preempted from the private\nsector and used to power weapons. The functions of such a military outpost could\ninclude security, supply, maintenance, repair, personnel, and training.\nSecurity would encompass activities involving the maintenance and use\nof defensive/offensive equipment needed to protect the SPS. Systems could include\n\n^/ During a national emergency (declared by the president) civil and commerciol satellites would be subject to control by the `department of Defense. See\nappendix A, PRM-23.\n9\n\n1\n\nvisible/infrared/rador sensors for reconnaissance, si+_ .-JIlance, and search/track/pointing; radiation/particle weapons; projectiles and missiles; communications/command/control; data-handling electronics; and electronic warfare/countermeasures\nequipment. A recent study by McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Company10/\ninvestigated the evolutionary development of a space station to support people\nand equipment engaged in peaceful pursuits. Many of the same problems they\nencountered would need to be solved in developing and equipping the SPS military\noutpost. The shuttle transportation system is used to support the McDonnell\nDouglas space station concept.\nMajor technologies (including surveillance, detection, track, pointing, and\nlaser weaponsd/ and missiles) for beginning any needed self-defense system for\nthe SPS and for deploying other weapons at the SPS space site are progressing\nsteadily. However, before an appropriately equipped operational SPS self-defense\nsystem can be defined, an understanding of the threat, the output of operational\nanalyses involving this threat, and the feel of experience may need to be combined\nfor an extended operational shakedown of potential system elements. This suggests\nthe possible usefulness of early experience with a system that may supply only\nmodest amounts of power compared to the 5 GW of the NASA reference system.\n2.2 IMPACTS ON INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS\n2.2.1 SPS Security/ Weapons\nThe potential value of the SPS to our industrial capability and national\neconomic system arises from the fact that by 2030 the SPS may be filling a significant part of the U.S. electrical power needs. Any attack, on this high-valued\nasset by a major force would be considered an attack that flies in the face of\nthe U.S. strategic deterrent force. Such an attack could mean that strategic\ndeterrence had failed 3/ and would lead the United States into decisions and actions\ninvolving the very weapons and forces that should have prevented attack but\ndid not. 7\'lese risks to the SPS and to strategic deterrence might be ameliorated\nby internationalizing the system and/or by reaching agreements declaring the\nSPS off-limits for military action. SPS strengthening (which may include a selfdefense system) could be made a part of the SPS to discourage and defend against\nsmall, unsophisticated attacks./ In the beginning, it will be difficult to determine\n\nd/ Information from the DARPA high-energh-laser space defense program\nwould be helpful in projecting loser weapons capabilities and in defining approaches.\n\n10\n\nw\'\n\nwhat the extent of\n\nany SPS defense system should be. It could start small and\n\nexpand to fit the need as requirements are developed. At present, space law\ncontains nothing to prevent the United States from stationing parts of its strategic\ndeterrent system (and f orces) at the SPS space site, as long as these parts do\nnot include nuclear weapons or weapons of mass destruction. l/ Growth of a\ndefended SPS may tend to be limited by the fact that as the military capability\nincreases, the value of the already high-valued target becomes even higher.\n2.2.2 Agreements/Disputes\nWorld communications have progressed to the point that populations in\nall parts of the world are becoming aware of resources, (such as solar flux, electromagnetic spectrum, and geostationary orbit) and want to share in their exploitation.\nThe elctromagnetic spectrum and the geostationary _orth orbit are limited resources.\nThe breadth of the useful electromagnetic spectrum, limited by equipment performance, has increased significantly with the widespread development of ultraviolet,\nvisible, and infrared systems. However, in many regions of the spectrum, particularly the microwave region, bandwidth is a carefully controlled, highly coveted\ncommodity. In the allotment of bandwidth, extreme care is exercised to ensure\nthat the assignment is in the public interest and will +tot be used in a manner\nthat interferes with equipments on the some band or operating in other bands.\nFor this reason, the use of any frequency/bandwidth used by the SPS will likely\nneed to be cleared through an international organization.\nThe geostationary orbit, because of its special characteristics, is a limited\nresource (there is only one around the earth). The number of slots available in\nthis orbit for communication satellites, if collisions are to be prevented and occultations and radio interference avoided, has been bounded by the range of 180\nto 1800.3/ The number of satellites now using geosynchronous orbit is large (approximately 100) and growing. This growth in operating systerns and the difficulty\nanticipated in reserving bandwidth for systems that are not scheduled should\ncombine to expedite both the planning of SPS development and deployment schedules\nand an early determination of bandwidth requirements. The solar flux in space\nis not a limited resource but a flow of radiation that is continuous. However,\nthe solar flux that can be intercepted in the geostationary orbit may have a practical limit.

This\norganization cnuld also include countries located in other parts of the world,\nas long as orbit slots and bandwidth are available on a "local" basis and other\nconditions of any agreements are met.e/\nMost of the world\'s developing countries ure located between 30 0 N. and\n300 S. latitude, the region of the globe that is inosi easily served by an SPS from\nGEO. Many of these countries are small and have relatively small power demands.\nCountries in this region currently do not present a threat to the United States;\nhowever, within the time required to deploy the SPS, this situation could change-particularly if one or more of these countries became allied with a larger country\n(U.S. adversary) and became a staging area(s) for it. It is also possible that SPS\npower, once available, could reverse the industrial and economic trends of some\nof these countries, allowing them to become real and significant partners or adversaries.\n2.3 RELATIVE VULNERABILITY\nThe vulnerability of the SPS to disruptive groups or to rnilitary forces is\nbelieved to be greater than for terrestrial electric power systems. Terrestrial\nsystems are vulnerable to (a) air- and ground-delivered ordinance by military\nor terrorist groups, (b) military or terrorist groups that could take over operations,\nand (c) saboteurs within the SPS/utilities and support organizations. The systems\nare vulnerable at the generating site, in the power distribution system, and in\nthe lines of supply3/ for fuel, spare parts, and other operating items. The power\ndistribution and supply systems lend themselves to covert kinds of activity (sornetirnes part of a larger activity) that con precede open confrontation. The vulnerability of the rectenna site and the distribution systern of the SPS is expected\nto be similar to that of terrestrial systerns, except that the supply lines for the\nSPS do not deliver fuel to the ,ectenno. "Fuel" is supplied to the rectenna via\na bearn from the satellite in geosynchronous orbit. Therefore, on the basis of\n\ne/ Several questions needing answers are: Should the organization include\nonly friendly nations, or both friendly and not-so-friendly nations? What about\nthe strategic arms limitations treaties? What part can onsite inspections play\'?\nWhat about questions of technology transfer?\n13\n\na first-order evaluation, the relative vulnerability of the SPS to that of a terrestrial system reduces to a comparison of the vulnerability of the spaceborne parts\nof the SPS (and launch sites) to the vulnerability of the terrestrial system\'s fuel\nsupply line(s).\nThe spaceborne segment of the SPS will be vulnerable to military attack\nand to the activities of sabotuers. Vulnerability to terrorist attacks is not likely\nfor some time because such attacks would require the use of either a high-technology space transportation system or sophisticated ground-based equipment capable\nof destroying a target 36,000 km away. Launch sites are vulnerable in much\nthe same way as the terrestrial power plants except that security probably would\nbe better at the launch sites.\nThere is likely to be at least a norninal effort to harden the satellite components and space transportation units against the hits and explosions of a military\nattack and the resulting environment. Hardening may be needed against interceptor\nand satellite killer impacts and explosions, nuclear radiation, high-energy laser\nand particle weapons, and electronic warfare waged to obstruct the flow of radiation\nor to compromise and/or gain control of satellite functions. Passive hardening\nis unlikely to be effective in all these areas; therefore, it is believed that dependable hardening against military attack will necessarily include an active SPS\nself-defense system unless other assets capable of defending the SPS are available\nfor this function at the time of SPS deployment (see appendix B).\n\n14\n\n\t\n.+ .\n\nI 1 I. ANALYSIS AND EVALUATION\n4\nSeveral major military implications were identified during the survey of\nrelevant literature and related work. Results of an analysis of these implications\nare discussed in the following paragraphs.\n3.1 WEAPON AND MILITARY PREPAREDNESS IMPLICATIONS\nThe Satellite Power System (,SPS` is designed to provide power for peaceful\npursuits. As the SPS grows and is retied on by the United States as one of its\nprime sources of power, it will become a potential military target. Its significance\nas a potential target will grow in relation to the increasing power demands that\nit fills. Issues concerning the SPS as a weapon and/or a base for weapons, and\nas a source for fuel to the military, will need to be considered when scheduling\nits development and deployment.\n3. 1.1 Weapon Considerations\nAs discussed previously, the SPS can be used as an electronic warfare weapon,\nan energy-beaming weapon, and a powered platform for weapons and weapon\nsystem segments.\n3.1-1.1\t\n\nEleci:anic Warfare Weapon\n`uring ncrrnal operation of the Microwave Power Transmission Subsystem\n\n(MPTS), noise could be introduced to discriminate against or to render ineffective\ntransmi&c ions in selected bonds. During hostile periods, the beam could be defocused i n offect a larger area; selected communications or other transmissions\nover an enfi,e hemisphere cc -!d he degraded or blocked. Friendly forces having\ncontrol of the beam could control noise content, beam spread, and times of noise\ntransrr!i:.s;on.s. Microwave densities, from the defocused microwave beam, though\nsignificant when compared with the sensitivities of many microwave receivers,\nwould be tolerable in terms of the levels (short-term and intermittent) that would\nbe detrimental to health and the public welfare. For example, the microwave\npower from one 5-GW SPS radiated evenly over the projected area of on-, earth\nhemisphere results in a density of approximately 5 x 10 -5 W/m2.\n3.1.1.2\t\n\nEnergy-Beaming Weapon\n\nThe familiarity of the general public with the concepts of high-energy laser\n(and particle) beams and their frequently cited ability to distribute deadliness\nand/or destruction has raised the question of the potential use of SPS power beams\nas weapons. For ex,3mple, a target in a circular orbit below and 10,000 km from\n15\n\ni!\n\nthe SPS traveling in the some dir%ction of the SPS will have a velocity relative\nto the beam at the point of crossing of 1.16 km/sec (and 5.65 km/sec for a retrograde orbit). From the position of the SPS, these relative velocities represent\nangular rates of 0.116 and 0.585 mrad/sec, respectively. To follow a target of\nthe lower angular rate a beam would have to be rotated about its origin at a rate\nof 3600 in 895 minutes (0.4 degrees per minute), and the higher rate 2.0 degrees\nper minute. In orbits 1000 km below the SPS, these rates would be 0.36 to 20.7\ndegrees per minute. The angular rates of maneuvering targets or satellites in\nretrograde orbits at close range generally would be expected to exceed the track\ncapabilities that could be designed into the MPTS. Targets traveling toward\nthe SPS could be followed at much slower slew rates except at close range when\na miss or "fly-by" is involved (see figure 3.1). The effectiveness of an energybeaming weapon depends on the power in the beam, the beam intensity versus\ntime profile, the angular cross-section of the beam, required beam xceleration\nand slew rates, and the accuracy to which a target can be tracked and the beam\npointed. The tracking/pointing error of a system against a moving target (h?gh\ninformation rate required) will usually be significantly greater than the error\nof that same system against a stationary or nearly stationary target (under mechanically damped low information rate conditions).\n3.1.1.2.1\t\n\nMicrowave System\n\nThe accuracy to which the microwave beam of the reference design can\nbe pointed toward the rectenna site (table 2.0 is considered adequate for a "weapon\nmode" if this accuracy could be maintained during target track. The antenna,\na low-density structure, is large and massive but probably could be used to track\nnonmoneuvering orbital targets at rates of one or so mrad/sec, provided target\ndetection and/or designation is completed early enough to allow the antenna\nto be brought on target moving at the appropriate rate without exceeding acceleration limits as established by antenna structural characteristics and figure requirements. Figure tolerances may be as stringent as one tenth the wavelength\n(+O.la - + 1.22 cm) for a frequency of 2.45 GHz. From figure 2.1, it is only after\na target has closed to within 12,000 km that irradiance on target is greater than\none solar constant. Therefore, use of the microwave system in geostationary\norbit (GEO) against earth and near-earth targets does not seem practical. However,\nat ranges of 4,000 km or less, the rate of temperature rise for highly absorptive\ntargets being irradiated could be significant, causing a damaging heat huildup.\n\n1^\n\non\n\nJ\nQ J\nQ W\nF Co Q\n\n2o F-\n\nP A\n\n`i\nr\nQ\n^Z\nQZ\nW\n\nW\naE,\n\n(~,^ W\nW W\n\ncc cc\ni\n\nL.\n\na\ng\'\nYU\n\nv\nH\n\nf /\nf..\n\nv\n\n0\n\n/wN\n\nU^\n\nh\n\nN\nm\n}\t\n\nQ W\n\n/\t\n\nU\n\nj\n\nUQ\t\n\nLL\t\n\nt ^\n\n^. o\n\nN (x\n\n^~\n\nw0\no ^\'\nv --\n\na\xc2\xb0\nw\n0\n\nN\nv\n\ni\n\nFa\n3\n\nx\n\nQ N\n\nW\n\nQ _N\n\na)\n\nE\n\nZi\n\nri\n\n,^^x\n\nE\n\nQ\n\nZ\n\nW\n\nZW\n\nwg\n\n0\nQZ\ncc\n\ngY\n\nau\nV\n\nY\n\nQ\n\nO\n\nW\n\nW\n\nac\n\nn\n\n2a\nQC\n17\n\nE\n\nY\n\nv\n\n8\n\nLA-\n\nO\n\nN\n\nIt would be possible to increase the energy density on target and thus Improve\nweapon capability by equipping the antenna with higher frequency transmitting\nunits to be used during the weapon mode. Figure 3.2 is a plot of gain (G) in peak\npower on target versus frequency. (Curve is normalized to 2.45 GHz.) Assuming\nequal efficiency, power on target (using the I-km diameter antenna structure)\ncan be increased by a factor of 100, for example, by increasing the transmitting\nfrequency to 24.50 GHz. f/ This would reduce bean diameter by a factor of 10,\nbut would decrease figure tolerances, and also decrease the track error allowed\nby factors of 10.\nThe smaller, higher frequency transmitting units incorporating electronic\nscan would handle less power and thus would have to be used in greater numbers\nthan the 2.45-GHz units, and the finer figure tolerances would be expected to\nrequire a beefed-up antenna structure. The increased number of transmit modules\nwill result in more complex phasing circuits and the refined tracking accuracy\nwill require more sophisticated track circuits and pointing controls. During operction in the weapon mode, power from the array would be switched from the 2.45GHz klystrons to the higher frequency transmit units. These additions and modifications to the 2.45-GHz MPTS would increase its weight and cost significantly.\nFrom the foregoing analysis, it appears that the microwave system operating\nat 2.45 GHz would be relatively ineffective as an energy-beaming weapon, whereas\nuse of shorter wavelength transmitting units and the large 1-km diameter antenna\nwould provide marginally effective results. The cost for either design based\non weapon effectiveness probably would be prohibitive, except that with an operating\nSPS, a large pc , t of the required equipment is already in place. Further study\nof the weapon potential of the MP15 is needed to identify specifically the feasibility issues and to estimate cost deltas.\n3.1.1.2.2\t\n\nBase for Weapons/Military Operations\n\nThe SPS satellite\'s location at UO, it-, size, and the electric power that\nprobably will be available at the site could Make it an excellent location for a\nlookout post and far the deployment of energy-intensive weapons. However,\nfor the lookout function to have greatest value, the satellite must be stationed\nover the right areas. S \xe2\x80\xa2 ationing such c satellite over the Indian Ocean near the\nU.S.S.R. or adjucent to other adversary nations without benefit of previous mutual\nagreements, would likely be provocative. An SPS in (,FO i,c,ed as a base for weapons,\nt -T Higher frequencies also should c)e practical.\n18\n\n100\n\n10\n\nis\n\ni\n^c\nc^\n\n1.0\n\n0.1\n\t\n\n1.0\n\n2.45\t\n\n10\t\n\n100\n\nFRECUENCY MHz)\n\nFigure 3.2\t\n\nPower on Target (Gain, a Ratio, Versus Frequency)\n\nPower density at new frequency (P F ) is given by: P F = GP,j.\n(PR ) is 23 mW/cm 2 at 35,800 kin range.\n\n19\n\n1\n\nweapon system segments, and their integration into military operational scenarios\nwill be a high-value target and vulnerable to attack, except as this vulnerability\nis reduced by U.S. strategic deterrence and the SPS self-defense system and/or\na space defense system of more generalized capabilities. The deterrent concept\nis good until it fails, but in any case can provide added time, if needed, for selfdefense system development.\nThe SPS structure may not represent an optimum location for some electronic\nsystems because of the RFI/EfVd problems that would result from operation of\nthe SPS Power Transmission Subsystem (PTS) and the electric currents associated\nwith the electrical power transmission system that is part of the solar array.\nThe firing of projectiles or launching of missiles from the array platform depending\non launch method could impart a velocity delta. Rotational and/or lateral velocities,\ncontributed in this manner, would have to be compensated for by the SPS orientation\nand station-keeping system.\nThese and other questions concerning the SPS self-protection system and\nuse of the SPS as a platform for other weapons and as a support to U.S. military\noperations should be investigated in detail to determine technology problems,\nprovable costs, schedules, and values and risks of these weapons and activities\nto the SPS itself and to international stability.\n3.1.2 Preparedness\nThe SPS could be made to contribute to military preparedness by incorporating\ninto its design a weapon mode, by serving as a base for additional weapons and\nmilitary aperations, and by supplying power. The SPS could (1) contribute energy\nto U.S. activities and industry for e \' -ig and productive economy, (2) provide\npower to friendly and adversar y\n\nCOMITY\n\nes where this promotes U.S. interests\n\nand a favorable international stability, (3) supply power to the military, and (4)\nsubstitute electricity for portable fuels that then could be released to the U.S.\nmilitary. The extent to which all these purposes could be served would depend\non policy decisions and the SPS\'s flexibility to service the variety of demands\nthat .nake up the potential market for SPS power. In discussions with military\nrepresentatives regarding military preparedness and SPS defense, the following\ncornme,-Js/issues were raised:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nThe military is concerned about the availability of energy and would\nuse direct SPS power for bate operntio.-Is. T :-.e Army mj/ be interested\nin providing (I) the acreage needed for ;,table ground powe , conversion\nsites c.nd (2) ground security.\n\n20\n\n1\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nScheduling early, smaller SPS systems will provide operational experience\nand a;low defense requirements to be worked out incrementally (if\ndefense is possible) before large SPS funding commitments are made.\n\n9\t\n\nThe VOU should be brought into system planning and development\nas early as possible to support the identification of defensehnintary\nrelated issues and be ready to initiate any R&D required to resolve\nthese issues.\n\n3.2 IMPACTS ON INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS\nThe impacts of the SPS on international relations will be both positive and\nnegative. They will include weapons; military impacts, impacts related to the\nallotment of the rights to frequency and orbit resources, and impacts that result\nfrom large quantities of SPS power being made available for use, export, and\ncontrol. It is probable that there will be SPS-related disputes to resolve, agreements to forge, and international organizing to do for some time to come.\n3.2.1 Weapons Impacts\nboth the severity of the weapons impacts on internatir-;al relations and\nSPS security will be related to the emphasis that is placed on weapons and military\nactivity at the space site. These impacts will be good or bad, depending on the\ncountry in question and its own current self-centered interests. Freedom of space\nas now recognized, just as freedom of the seas, allows property to be escorted\nand protected ns required. This freedom and the limited restrictions (nuclear\nweapons and weapons of mass destruction in space) should permit the gradual\ndevelopment and deployment of an effective and accepted SPS self-defense system.\nWeapons that provide a military advantage to the nation(s) in control of\nthe SPS without introducing capabilities that tend toward weapon stability may,\nthrough the creation of suspicion, fear, and actual vulnerability to those nations\nnot in control, accelerate the arms race.\n3.2.2 Po wer Exp ort/Pow er f_mborgoes\nThe large power production capability of an SPS developed and deployed\nby the United States will provide a valuable export commodity provided that:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nThe necessary agreements can be reached ensuring the United States\nthe required trequency, bandwidth, and orbit slots;\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nThe SPS is designed with a fiexiblity that allows it to serve export\nden lands; and\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nThe necessary agreements can be reached involving assurances relating\nto payments, reliability of power delivery (embargoes), and SPS system\nsecurity (transmitting and receiving sites) between export/import\ncountries.\n21\n\n3.2.3 Internationalization\nThe more logical approach to developing and deploying the SPS from military\nand security considerations may be to internationalize it from the beginning.\nSecurity procedures could then be designed to distribute cost and responsibility\namong the members of the association of nations formed to exploit the SPS concept.\nThe formation of such an association and the equitable distribution of costs, opportunities, and benefits should facilitate the forging of agreements to obtain needed\norbit slots and frequency assignments.\nWhen considering the requirements and opportunities for agreements and/or\nfor internationalization of the SPS, several facts stand oui.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nFrom figure 2.2 it can be seen that the part of the geosynchronous\norbit that is of greatest interest to the United States is approximately\none-fourth of the orbit that passes over South America and west of\nit.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nThis location is on the other side of the world from the U.S.S.R. and\nChina. Military equipment (and forces) in space protecting SPS and\nmonitoring this region of the world should not cause a maximum level\nof U.S.S.R./China concern.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nAlthough South and Central American countries would be easy targets,\nthey are not logical U.S. targets.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nThe U.S.S.R. land mass is one of the least favorable locations with\nrespect to a satellite in geosynchronous orbit for receiving power.\nThe long atmospheric transmission paths and the oblique surface of the\nearth at this location (relative to a line from GEO) may combine to make\nSPS service to a large part of Russia marginal. A low earth orbit\n(LEO) relay SPS may be of more interest to Russio.9/\n\n3.3 RELATIVE VULNERABILITY\nCommunication satellites located in GEO are considered by some to be\nvulnerable to direct ascent interceptors and to orbiting satellite killers. The\nCOMSAT\'s prime power, control, and electronic systems are also vulnerable to\nnuclear radiation and to high-energy laser and particle-beam weapons. The SPS,\nbeing much larger, is usually considered to be more vulnerable and, like the communication satellite, can be vulnerable to overt military attack in space and on\nthe ground. Actually its size may permit the use of such techniques as redundancy,\n\n2/\n\nThe orbits used for this LEO SPS could be selected to satisfy both energy\ndistribution and military objectives.\n\n22\n\nbreakaway structures, placing of decoys of vital aim points at many places on\nthe structure, and other countermeasures to make the SPS less vulnerable than\na COMSAT. The large platform of the SPS will also allow the use of larger electronics that are more resistant to radiation such as bipolar devices for some electronics applications instead of the smaller, more vulnerable LSI semiconductor\ncircuits. L It will also allow some of the more sensitive components to be placed\nbeneath structure to avoid damage due to natural radiation or nuclear radiation\nfrom a weapon or test explosion. Hardening against lasers, particle beams, and\nmissiles may be used to control damage and thus require an enemy to come within\nrange of an SPS self-defense system. The SPS transportation system will include\nthe Heavy Lift Launch Vehicle (HLLV), the Personnel Launch Vehicle (PLV) and\nthe Cargo-and Personnel-Orbital-Transfer Vehicles (COTV and POTV). The vulnerobility of the personnel vehicles will be a function of vehicle hardening and lifesupport system design, whereas the vulnerability of cargo vehicles will be a function\nof the hardening techniques used, escort policy/capobilit-, and vehicle velocity\n(trip duration). For more information concerning the impact of hostile environments\non the SPS, see appendix B.\nThe rectenna site is vulnerable to ordinary ground attack but probably can\nbe designed so that its performance degrades gracefully. Vulnerability can be\nreduced by placing much of the power distribution and heavy power-handling\nequipment underground at the rectenna site and by closely controlling design\nand site layout data. Care given to the security aspects of the design (controls\nand data handling/processing equipment) can reduce the risk of SPS equipment\ntakeover by hostile forces.\nFor the most part terrorist attacks will be limited to ground facilities.\nAttacks could be launched against the rectenna site, ground-based space transportation facilities, power distribution system, and ground-based supply lines for\nSPS materials and spares.\nTerrorist attacks against SPS space assets are conceivable but probably\nwill not be important considerations until equipment such as higtrenergy laser\nand/or particle-beam weapons can be acquired by such groups or until earth-space\ntransportation is commonplace. Sabotage of the system is more likely and can\noccur on the ground or in space. Losses due to sabotage can be controller; through\ninternal security, employee screening, and the enforcement of harsh penalties\nfor sabotage at SPS, utility, and support organizations.\n\n23\n\nIV. KEY ISSUES AND GENERAL OBSERVATIONS\n\nDuring the study several key issues were identified and observations were\nmade concerning the military implications of the SPS. These are noted in the\nfollowing paragraphs.\n4.1 WEAPON AND MILITARY PREPAREDNESS IMPLICATIONS\nAs a weapon the microwave power transmission subsystem (NiPTS) may\nhave some applications as a noise generator in an electronic warfare role. Its\napplications as an energy-beaming weapon are limited in the current NASA reference\nsystem configuration because of the low-power density in the microwave beam\nand the large massive antenna that would need to be moved to follow the target.\nA geostationary (GEU) location of the NASA reference system maintains the\nsatellite and any weapons capability stationary over a single spot on earth.\ni,iAitary preparedness will be supported by the SPS in the following ways:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nStrengthen the civilian/industrial sector allowing more effective technology, production, and capital support to the military;\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nFree portable fuels required for military mobility (and stockpiling);\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nProvide electricity to military ground installations through the utilities;\nand\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nSupply markets for electricity and thus strengthen mutual security\nbonds and reduce tensions.\n\nLarge, powered, platforms for weapons can be provided by the SPS at several\ndifferent GEU locations. Weapons or weapon systems segments could include\nsensors, communications, and laser/particle beam weapons; projectiles/missiles;\nand electronic warfare and data-handling systems. The platform, reinforced\nand modified, could be made to provide storage, housing, etc. This additional\nmass would result in a larger load on the SPS station-keeping system.\nEach deployment of modestly sized SPS\'s would provide operational experience\nand allow any needed SPS defense system to start small and grow to be compatible\nwith risk. In this rnanner the ability of the SPS to be defended could be determined\nbefore making large resource commitments.\n4.2 INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS\nInternational relations could be affected as a result at:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nDisputes between nations with regard to the international agreements\nthat must be made concerning solar flux at GEU, frequency, orbit,\npower export, security, etc.;\n25\t\n\nJr\t\n\nIr;\t\n\n4kLLY\n\nSAM\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nPossible requirements to place weapons in space to ensure the security\nof the SPS; and\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nPossible need to internationalize the SPS to reduce its vulnerability.\n\nSystem deployment schedule and flexibility of service may affect the availability of frequency bands and orbit slots needed for the SPS, and flexibility of\nSPS service available may determine the degree of interest among potential national\nparticipants in an internationalized SPS.\n4.3 VULNERABUTY\nVulnerability of the SPS relative to terrestrial systems is determined by\ncomparing the vulnerability of the spaceborne segment of the SPS and launch\nsites with the vulnerability of the terrestrial system\'s fuel supply line(s).\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nThe spaceborne segment of the SPS is vulnerable to military adversaries\nand to saboteurs;\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nSPS defensive measures may need to include\n--\t\n\nHardening against nuclear radiation, laser/particle weapons,\nand missiles, and\nA self-defense system;\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nLaunch sites are expected to be vulnerable in approximately the some\nmanner as terrestrial plant sites, except that launch sites probably\nwill have better security.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nAt ground rectenna sites it should be possible to use a redundant design,\narranging rectenna modules in parallel so that partial destruction\nwould only degrade rectenna performance. (Much of the cabling and\nheavy equipment could be placed underground.)\n\n26\n\nV. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY\n\n5.1 SHORT-TERM TASKS\nIn conducting this study, four tasks were identified and are recommended\nfor completion in fiscal year 1979.\nTask I would identify and assess areas of SPS vulnerability to military/quasimilitary actions and prepare SPS design guidelines to reduce this vulnerability.\nTask 2 would prepare an SPS self-defense system concept and a plan for\nits evaluation.\nTask 3 would investigate the probable effect of the flexibility of the SPS\nto deliver different sized loads on the ability to get individual nations to support\nSPS. This support (or lack of it) should be related to the following:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nProspects for internationalizing the SPS;\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nSPS vulnerability to military attack; and\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nInternational acceptance of an SPS self-defense system.\n\nTask 4 would investigate the effect of the SPS deployment schedule on\nthe ability to (a) obtain international support and get needed agreements to allot\nGEO solar flux, bandwidth, and orbit slots, and (b) plan, develop, and deploy an\nadequate SPS defense system at a rate to reduce risks of confrontation and "space\nwar."\n5.2 LONG-TERM TASK\nA fifth task would be longer term designed to identify military implications\nthat result from the specific requirements of potential world customers for SPS\npower. Information concerning customer requirements relating to participation,\ntiming, product, service and reliability of service would provide important data\nto be used in designing a secure system. In addition, this task would contribute\nsignificantly to the information base needed to promote the international interest\nand cooperation leading to a militarily secure SPS.\n\n27\n\nVI.

These would include: the 1958 NASA Space Act; the Treaty on Banning\nNuclear Weapons Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space, and Under Water\n(1963?; and the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the\nExploration and Use of Outer Space, Including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies\n(1967). Due to the possible impact an SPS bean would have on the Earth\'s upper\natmosphere, the Convention on the Prohibition of Hostile Uses of Environmental\nModification Techniques (1977) would also be affected.\nOperations in outer space can be manifested in a number of ways. Among\nthese are the peaceful, aggressive, nonaggressive, and military uses of outer\nspace. Disagreement concerning what definitions apply to these words !^- been\nthe subject of discussion since the earliest days of space exploration.\nThe mewing "peoceful," occording to space law experts, gives rise to two\ndifferent interpretations. Under one interpretation, primarily used by the United\nStates, "peaceful" connotes "nonoggressive:\' A second interpretation of the term\nis "nonnilitay" and is used, although not exclusively, by the Soviet Union. In\naddition, "peaceful" use has been applied to defense support space missions that\nare "noninterferinq" or "nonaggres3ive:1(1, 2)\n\nAs stated in the Air Force Manual 1-1:(3)\nThe underlying goal of the U.S. national space policy is that the\nmedium of space must be preserved for peoceful use of all mankind.\nAir Force principles relating to space operations are consistent\nwith this national commitment. National policy and international\ntreaties restrict the use of space for employm \t\nf weapons of\nmass destruction. There is, however, a need t. insure that no other\nnation gains a strategic military advantage through the exploitation\nof the space environment.\nThe possibility of an SPS linked to high powered laser could lead to a ballistic\nmissile defense capability. In addition, an SPS/laser system could be utilized\nin a particle beam weapon, with lasers creating highly intense, coherent light\nA-I\n\nt\xe2\x80\xa2,\n\nsources to develop a reduced density channel, thereby enhancing particle beam\npropagation. (4, S)\nSuch possibilities would have significant impact upon existing treaties between\nthe United States and the Soviet Union on the limitation of anti-ballistic missile\nsystems. Signed parties have agreed not to develop, test, or deploy ABM systems\nor components that are sea-based, air-based, space-based, cr mobile land-based.\nHowever, suggestions have been made that aspects of the ABM Interim Agreements\nand Agreed Interpretot i cns, can be interpreted ambiguously, perhaps allowing\nresearch, development, and proof testing of space-based ABM systerns, short\nof actual deployment.\n\nDefensive/Offensive Use of Space\nSpace lawyer Andrew Holey once stated: (6)\n...a nation is justified in protecting itself from attack no matter\nwhere the staging area of the attack may be, including on the high\nseas or in outer space, and a nation may cerry its defensive forces\nto such areas. The great unresolved problem, so for as defensive\nmeasures in space are concerned, is to translate the general recognition of this right of self-defense into some workable criteria for\ndistinguishing between the defen^:ve and offensive uses of space.\nThe fear of a technological, space-based "Pearl Harbor" has been r^ iterct d\nin military literature. According to General Jacob Smart (retired): (7)\nDespite wishful thinking to the contrary, man is and promises to\nremaisi an aggressive, combative creature. We fear, we :late, we\nfight one another. Until we remove causes of fear and hatred and\ncorrect the conditions which prompt us to arm our.,elves, we have\nno choice but to prepare to defend ourselves against attack in whatever form and through whatever media attacks ma y come. Today\nand henceforth, the United States must be prepared to defend itself\nagainst aggression in space and from space. We cannot surrender\nthe "high ground" without contest.\nJustifications for Military Activity in Space\nRecent official speeches 8 clarify curr\xe2\x80\x94it justification of the U.S. military\ninvolvernent in the space medium. These or,::\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nUniqueness - some functions essentially can only be done from space,\nsuch as near real-time warning of a ballistic missile attack\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nEconomi cs - some functions are more cheaply done from space, such\nas long-haul communications\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nFunction effectiveness - some functions are more effectively done\nrorn space, like meteorology\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nForce effectiveness enhancemeot - some space functions can greatly\nenhance the effectiveness o terrestrial forces.\nA-2\n\nDenial of Access\nWith increased use by the military of space-based systems, a dependence\nhas been created. In turn, this dependence has Ind l o fears that an aggressor\nnation "deny access to such systems:\' Developr- :!nt of the limited anti-satellite\n(ASAT) capability by the Soviets has jeopardized "the heretofore accepted sanctuary\nof space," and now requires the "ability to protect satellites in space" as f undomental "to defending the right of the United States and its allies to use of space\nto achieve military advantage."(9)\nSecretary of Defense Harold Brown 00) also hcs testified to Congress that:\nAs the President has clearly stated, it would be preferable for both\nsides to join in on an effective, and adequately verifiable ban on\nantisatellite (ASAT) systems; we certainly have ne desire to engage\nin a space weapons race. However, the Soviets with their present\ncapability are leaving us with little choice. Because of our growing\ndependence on space systems we can hardly permit them to have\na dominant position in the ASAT realm.\nSoviet ASAT capabilities, although still unable to reach geostationary orbit,\nhave produced studies by the U.S. military to develop special maneuvers for future\nmilitary sate!lites once in orbit to avert an*i-sate-llites. These maneuvers would\navert satellites that are capeble of (a) using pulverized aluminum particles to\nform a "smokescreen;\' protecting a satellite from laser yearns; (b) increasing\nU.S. knowledge of the effects of pulsed laser radiation on solar ceas and sensors;\n(c) using alternative power generation for spacecraft \'instead of vulnerable solar\n\t hardening of\ncells and solar cell panels; and (d) renewing emphasis art\ndelicate electronic payloads to counter possible high-altitude or space-environment\nnuclear explosions.\nThe implicctions of verifying the results of these studies would include\nadding weight to military pa yloads, pushing their weight to the upper limit of\nSpace Shuttle carrying caKcity. Investigations are now underway to upgrade\nthe Space Shuttle, allowing for heavier-than-expected cargo.\nPublic Support for the Space Peace/ War Potential\nA Hudson Institute study has stated that fear of being second in space competition produces a number of social effects. According to the report, war remains\nof paramount concern to the American public. Support of U.S. space activity\nhas been greatest when there was a linkage between the Cold War and space\ncompetition. However, the report cautions that events, such as the launching\nof the first satellite, the Soviet Sputnik 1, resulted in a tendency of the public\nA-3\n\n...to bla-.P political aid governtnental officials for allowing the\nUnite: States to fall behind a competitor. This kind of blame constitvted,\t\neff+-r,t, strong support for the space program--at least\n;r a p.-riod when the public connected space issues to the Cold War.\nBro ,-tirg second resulted in put,\'\'.; questioning of U.S. military competence.\n\xc2\xb0\nDo;s military activity irk space &t--r international cooperation? As stated\nin a U.S. House of R. tp. \xc2\xb0.:senta tivcs report: (12)\nThe Defens:^ Department has suggested guidelines for the export\nof U.S. technology under which maintenance of U.S. technological\n,uperrivi ity by absolute control of design and manufacturing know^, vjw is considered ty DOD to be essential. All other considerations,\nincluding international goodwill, are secondary under these guidelines,\n5:ccording to DOD.\nThe report raises the following important questions: (12)\nBecause of the military potential of space technology, should sharing\nof space technology come under these guidelines? Would maintenance\nof U.S. technological leadership in space under these guidelines\nbe compatible with U.S. stated policy regarding international coopero-tion in space? If maintenance of U.S. technological leadership\nin space can only be achieved at the expense of international coopet ation, which goal shall prevail?\n\nMilitary Use of the Space Shuttle\nLt. Generui TI`om W. Morgan, (13) Commender of the Space and Missile\nias\nSystems Organizations, AFSC, has stated that the Space Shuttle\n...will open a new chapter of our national space program. It may\nwell make economically feasible for the first time whole new missions\nin space - in addition to opening the door to better or cheaper ways\nof performing traditional missions. I see the 1980\'s - the time in\nwhich the STS (Space Transportation System) becomes a proved\nquantity - as a time of major reappraisal of the role of space in\nthe Air Force Future.\nMilitary/civilian space dependence on one vehicle, the Shuttle, has developed\na number of interesting policy problems. According j the Council of Economic\nPriorities (CEP), (14)\nbecause the DOD will be entirely dependent upon NASA\'s transportation\nsystem for space launches, and because NASA is a small agency\nin budget and iaborpower relative to the DOD, there is Aanger that\nin the future, NASA programs will be oriented toward military,\nrather than civilian and scientific uses.\nThe CEP feels that NASA could be pressured to restructure the U.S. space program\nto f it DOD needs.\nA-4\n\nThe passibility exists that, upon operational status, the DOD will increase\nits manned military activity via the Shuttle. Such a possibility may result in\nprocurement of a special DOD Space Shuttle. According to a report by a panel\nof the National Academy of Public Administration, shifts in U.S. and Soviet relations could result in increased Defense expenditures. Such expenditures could\ninclude establishment of a "...NASA-based civilian (and open) STO (Space Transportation Organization), and a DOD \'classified STO: \xe2\x80\x9e(15)\nPR M - 23\nRecently President Carter directed under a Presidential Review Memorandum\nthat the National Security Council Policy Review Committee examine existing\npolicy and formulate overall principles which should guide our space activities.\nPrinciples were set forth in the Directive. 06) Of interest with regard to SPS\nare the following:\nThe U.S. rejects any claims to sovereignty over outer space or over\ncelestial bodies, or any portion thereof, and rejects any limitations\non the fundcmentai right to acqui re da*o from space.\nThe United States holds that the space systems of any nation are\nnational property and have the right of passage through and operations\nin space without interference. Purposeful interference -:. \'th space\nsystems shall be viewed as an infringement upon sovereign rights.\nThe United States will pursue activities in space in support of its\nrights of self-defense and thereby strengthen national security,\nthe deterrence of attack, and arms control agreements.\nThe U.S. will encourage domestic commercial exploitation of space\ncapabilities and systems for economic benefit and to promote the\ntechnological position of the United States.\nThe Secretary of Defense will establish a program for identifying\nand integrating, as appropriate, civil and commercial resources\ninto military operations during national emergencies declared by\nthe President.\nWhile the United States see\'.cs verifiable, comprehensive limits\nof anti-satellite capabilities and use, in the absence of such an\nagreement, the U.S. will vigorously pursue development of its own\ncapabilities. The U.S. space defense program shall include an integrated attack warning, notification, verification, and contingency\nreaction capability which can effectively detect and react to threats\nto U.S. space systems.\n\nA-5\n\nr^\n\nREFERENCES\nI.\t\n\nMcNaughton, J.

Holloway\nManager, Projects Staff\nVulnerability & Hardness Laboratory\nDefense and Space Systems Group of TRW\nRedondo Beach, California 90275\nThis discussion addresses the influence of natural radiation environment,\nand of some weapon environments, on the performance of the Satellite Power\nSystem. The discussion is generic, rather than system specific, in that it is concerned with classes of effects on equipment of the type that would probably be\nused to implement the Satellite Power System (SPS) design, rather than with\nan assessment of the system itself. The weapon environments considered include\nnuclear radiation from a weapons test, or an attack on another satellite, as well\nas direct attack by an Anti-Satellite Satellite (ASAT) carrying pellet, nuclear,\nor laser weapons. Effects are considered from the viewpoint of the payload (solar\narray) as well as the vehicle-operating systems.\nNatural Radiation\nThe natural radiation environments are the trapped-electron environment,\nthe solar flare proton environment, and the trapped-proton environment, which\nall contribute to the total dose seen by the system. Current understanding of\nthese environments probably is best exemplified by the NASA AE-7 model for\nelectrons and the APBMAC and APBMIC models (also NASA) for protons. Exposure\nto the total dose environments, for both the payload (solar array) and the vehicle\nelectronics, results in the gradual degradation of performance parameters. For\nthe solar array itself, this degradation would result in a loss of power output\nof the order of 15 percent over 5 years in orbit. This kind of degradation is generally accounted for by including the end-of-life degradation in the initial design.\nFor the SPS the degradation allowance would be sized to the refurbishment cycle\ntime. Semiconductor devices in the vehicle electronics would be similarly affected,\nthe degradation ranging from insignificant for most diodes and small signal transistors to potential catastrophic failure for some integrated circuit operational\namplifiers. Hardening techniques available include mitigation of the dose incident\non the parts by the use of added structural, box or piece part shielding, or by\ndetermination of the radiation sensitivity of the pats by test in a simulated radiotion environment and providing for this radiation sensitivity in the design. This\nB- I\n\n_t\n\nlatter approach requires some degree of ongoing monitoring of production devices,\nsince the total dose sensitivity is very sensitive to manufacturing process changes\nin some devices. Several device manufacturers are beginning to introduce lines\nof radiation-hardened devices that should reduce this concern in the future.\nCollateral Nuclear Effects\nThe baseline environment defined for the nuclear radiation levels arising\nfrom a nuclear weapons test by another power, or from an attack on another\nsatellite, is the JCS guidelines level defined in SAMSU Exhibit 69-13 (secret).\nFor a synchronous satellite over the continental United States, the probability\nof seeing these levels resulting from an actual test is very small. Radiation levels\nresulting from an attack on another satellite will vary depending on the distance\nfrom the nuclear event, except for the electron and electromagnetic pulse (EMI )\nenvironments which are relatively independent of distance. The following discussion will be based on the distance specified in 69-13, and the levels, and the\neffects will vary as the distance varies.\nThe principal impact of nuclear radiation on the Satellite Power System\nwill be in the solar array itself and in the seminconductor devices that implement\nthe vehicle electronics. The potential radiation failure modes are:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nF\n1\n\nIrF\ntE\n\nCatastrophic failure, arising from the burnout of semiconductors\nfrom X-r-iy induced photocurrents, or frorn electrical currents resulting\nfrom X-ray illumination of the vehicle cables or structure. X-ray\nillumination of the solar array itself at 69-13 levels will not result\nin catastrophic failure of the array, but couild result in surges in the\nprimary power lines which could damage equipment connected to\nthose lines. Such surges can be eliminated by a combination of mitigation of the X-ray environment by the use of shielding by material\nof high atomic number and by limiting the devices response by the\naddition of limiting impedances in series with the power supply lines\nto the affected devices. The efficacy of these protective approaches\nwill be valid for increases in the environmental level of 3 to 4 times\nin most cases. The effects of electrical currents resulting from Xray illumination of the cables or structure may be eliminated by the\nuse of terminal protection devices (e.g., surge limiters, voltage clamps)\nat component input/output circuits.\nDegradation, which is the same effect considered in the discussion\nof the natural radiation environment, except that the environments\nof concern are the weapon electron and neutron environments. The\nweapon electron environment will be larger than the natural environment, but otherwise may be treated in the some way. The neutron\nenvironment may not be shielded, but at the 69-13 level is too low\nto be of concern to the large majority of parts. Degradation which\ndoes exist must be characterized on the basis of tests on specimen\ndevices in a simulated neutron environment, and then allowed for\nin the design.\n\nt^- 2\n\n^l\n\nb\xc2\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nTransient upset, which is the inadvertent switching or change of state\nof digital devices when subjected to X-rays or System Generated\nEMP (SGLMP). It is not a failure mode of concern to the solar array\nitself, but must be addressed for the vehicle electronics. A typical\nsystem response of concern would be the inadvertent firing of stationkeeping thrusters which could result in a change of orientation or\nposition of the systern. Hardening approaches for such effects include\nthe use of invulnerable devices (e.g., electromagnetic relays) or by\nthe use of devices that will not respond to the short weapon radiation\npulse.\n\nASAT Attack\nThe options available to conventional satellite systems for withstanding\nASAT attack include (1) hardening, in which the weapon impact is conceded,\nbut its ability to kill thwarted, (2) misdirection, in which the attacker\'s ability\nto direct the weapon to the target is defeated, either by maneuvering of the\ntarget or deceiving the attacker\'s acquisition and tracking system by decoys or\njamming and (3) counterkill in which the ASAT is shot down before it can do any\ndamage. The features of the SPS that dictate a survivability approach are its\nlarge size and the large amount of power available to it. Hardening, whether\nagainst pellet, laser, or nuclear weapons is not sufficient to ensure survival against\non attack, but it can aid the SPS\'s defensive posture by forcing on attacker to\ncorne in closer to fire effectively. Maneuvering and decoys are not feasible for\nsuch a large system. Jamming the attacker\'s acquisition and tracking system\nwould be effective against today\'s generation of trackers, particularly in view\nof the SPS power capability. More advanced trackers with home-on-jam capability,\nor using long-wavelength infrared (LWIR) or optical data may negate this advantage.\nCounterkill would appear to be a feasible survivability approach, particularly\nwith an on-board laser weapon which could utilize the SPS power capability to\nfire at long range with sufficient power to destroy an attacker before he got\nwithin range with his smaller weapons. Counterkill would require nn indPnonte\nwarning signal from a system such as the Satellite Attack Warning System (SAWS)\nto be effective, but this should be available in the SPS time frame.\n\n13- 3\n\n'
