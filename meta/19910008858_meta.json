The first project is a design to eliminate a majority of orbital debris. The Orbital Debris and Salvage System will push the smaller particles into lower orbits where their orbits will decay at a higher rate. This will be done by momentum transfer via laser. The salvageable satellites will be delivered to the Space Station by an Orbital Transfer Vehicle. The rest of the debris will be collected by Salvage I. The second project is the design of a space based satellite system to prevent the depletion of atmospheric ozone. The focus is on ozone depletion in the Antarctic. The plan is to use an orbiting solar array system designed to transmit microwaves at a frequency of 22 GHz over the region in order to dissipate polar stratospheric clouds that form during the months beginning in August and ending in October. The third project, Project Poseidon, involves a conceptual design of a space based hurricane control system consisting of a network of 21 low-orbiting laser platforms arranged in three rings designed to heat the upper atmosphere of a developing tropical depression. Fusion power plants are proposed to provide power for the lasers. The fourth project, Project Donatello, involves a proposed Mars exploration initiative for the year 2050. The project is a conceptual design for a futuristic superfreighter that will transport large numbers of people and supplies to Mars for the construction of a full scale scientific and manufacturing complex.", "title": "Orbital debris removal and salvage system", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T14:16:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19910008858, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19910008858, "id": "b27b6cca6d7345e2973466b07ba6c551", "publicationName": "USRA, Proceedings of the 6th Annual Summer Conference: NASA(USRA University Advanced Design Program", "publicationDate": "1990-11-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19910008858.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19910008858/downloads/19910008858.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19910008858/downloads/19910008858.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19910008858/downloads/19910008858.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
