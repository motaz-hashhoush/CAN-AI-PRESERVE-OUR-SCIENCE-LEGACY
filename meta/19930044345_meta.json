In situ airborne measurements of the relative angular distribution of scattered radiation are compared to known asymptotic expressions for the intensity field deep within an optically thick cloud layer. Analytical expressions relating the ratio of the nadir-to-zenith intensities to surface reflectance, similarity parameter, and scaled optical depth beneath the aircraft flight level are used to analyze measurements obtained with the cloud absorption radiometer mounted on the University of Washington's C-131A research aircraft. It is shown that the total optical thickness of the cloud layer increased in the ship tracks, in contrast to the similarity parameter, which decreased. The decrease in absorption was a direct consequence of the reduction in cloud droplet size that occurred within the ship tracks.", "title": "Optical properties of marine stratocumulus clouds modified by ships", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-16T00:34:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19930044345, "meta": {"author": {"name": "King, Michael D."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD, United States"}}, "id": "afcb4f6d11be4d7d9f21af7e2f81cb8a"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19930044345, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Radke, Lawrence F."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD, United States"}}, "id": "4e9f7e8a10214bf4932a763cc58d6f5c"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19930044345, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Hobbs, Peter V."}, "organization": {"name": "Washington Univ.", "location": "Seattle, United States"}}, "id": "83e981c6270e4962ba162596a1d36dfb"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19930044345, "publications": [{"volume": "98", "submissionId": 19930044345, "issue": "D2", "issn": "0148-0227", "id": "cf1f7c4150ff4f398fe410678fb7444f", "publicationName": "Journal of Geophysical Research", "publicationDate": "1993-02-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
