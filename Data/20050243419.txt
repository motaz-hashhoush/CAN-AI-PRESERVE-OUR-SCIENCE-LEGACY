An in-space propellant depot will provide\naffordable propellants and other similar consumables to support the development of\nsustainable and affordable exploration strategies as well as commercial space activities.\nAn in-space propellant depot not only requires technology development in key areas such\nas zero boil-off storage and fluid transfer, but in other areas such as lightweight\nstructures, highly reliable connectors, and autonomous operations. These technologies\ncan be applicable to a broad range of propellant depot concepts or specific to a certain\ndesign. In addition, these technologies are required for spacecraft and orbit transfer\nvehicle propulsion and power systems, and space life support. Generally, applications of\nthis technology require long-term storage, on-orbit fluid transfer and supply, cryogenic\npropellant production from water, unique instrumentation and autonomous operations.\nThis paper discusses the reasons why such advances are important to fiture affordable\nand sustainable operations in space. This paper also discusses briefly R&D objectives\ncomprising a promising approach to the systems planning pnd evolution into a\nmeaningfhl stepping stone design, development, and implementation of an In-Space\nCryogenic Propellant Depot. The success of a well-planned and orchestrated approach\nholds great promise for achieving innovation and revolutionary technology development\nfor supporting future exploration and development of space.\n\n-1-\n\ncomparable to (but lower than) the Space\nShuttle at about 3-4 launches per year, plus\ntypical EELV (evolved expendable launch\nvehicles) costs per launch at the same rate.\n\nThe Sustainabilitv Challenge\nOne of the central challenges to more\nambitious-yet still affordable-space\noperations in the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s neighborhood lies\nin our inability to affordably preposition\nconsumables and needed systems (including\nspares for in space servicing and\nmaintenance). This requirement is\nespecially critical in the case of propellants\n-including propellants for vehicles\ntransporting crew or time-critical payloads.\nAs long as it is not possible to locally repair\nand refuel high-value (and high-cost) space\nsystems beyond low Earth orbit (LEO). This\nchallenge affects planning for a wide range\nof potential future missions, but is\nparticularly important for (a) major, highvalue missions such as human exploration\nactivities beyond low Earth orbit; (b) largescale defense and/or security focused\nmission systems; or, (c) \xe2\x80\x98future space\nindustries\xe2\x80\x99 (such as larger, multi-payload\ngeostationary Earth orbit (GEO) platforms,\nspace solar power systems, and related\nconcepts).\n\n8\n\n8\n\n8\n\nExcursion Transport: Assuming expendable\nsystems, involving nominally a descent\nmodule and an ascent module with a\ncombined mass of about 10,000 kg to\n20,000 kg (and a recurring unit per kilogram\ncost of approximately $50,000 per\nkilogram), for a \xe2\x80\x9cper mission cost\xe2\x80\x9d of about\n$750M per mission.\n\n8\n\nFor example, a large-scale, permanently\ninhabited lunar base might involve 3-4\nhuman missions to the Moon per year (for\ncrew rotation every 120 days or 90 days,\nrespectively). However, if such a mission\nscenario were to involve Apollo-era\nconcepts and current-technology expendable\nspace transportation systems, then the total\ncost per mission due to transportation costs\nalone (hardware and operations), could\nrange from $2,40OM per mission to more\nthan $3,1O M per mission (current year\nO\ndollars). Transportation cost components\nhere are assumed to include the following:\n\nIn Space Transport: Assuming expendable\nsystems involving at least two in-space\nstages with individual mass of about 10,000\nkg (and a recurring unit per kilogram cost of\nabout $50,000 per kilogram\xe2\x80\x99) for a \xe2\x80\x9cper\nmission cost\xe2\x80\x9d of about $500M per mission.\n\nTransportation Operations. Assuming\nincremental improvements on Space Shuttle\nand International Space Station (ISS) era\nground operations concepts,, involving\nnominally about 20,000 total personnel\n(with an average cost of about $100,000 per\nFTE (full time equivalent))2, for a \xe2\x80\x9cprogram\nper year cost\xe2\x80\x9d of about $2,00OM, and a per\nmission cost of about $500M per mission at\na rate of 4 missions per year, or about to\n$667M per mission at a rate of 3 missions\nper year.\n\nThe very rough, mass-based cost estimation\nrelationships (CERs) used in this illustration are\nintended to be consistent with-and perhaps a bit on\nthe optimistic side of-past human-rated space\nsystems recurring hardware costs. A more detailed\nanalysis would consider the specific cost per\nkilogram for each of the major elements in each\nsystem, as well as taking into account the specific\nnumber of unique elements to be manufactured over\nthe life of the program, and the degree to which\nadvanced production methods (such lean\nmanufacturing)might be brought to bear on the\nproblem. However, for the purposes of this\ndiscussion, the single value of \xe2\x80\x98about $50,000 per\nkilogram (about $22,000 per pound) for recurring\nflight hardware costs seems adequate.\n2\nThis figure is intended to be a very rough average,\nintegrating all personnel involved; clearly some cost\ncategories, such as senior engineers, are at much\nhigher labor rates when \xe2\x80\x98fully wrapped\xe2\x80\x99.\n\nET0 Transport: Assuming Shuttle-derived,\nexpendable systems involving 2 Heavy Lift\nLaunch Vehicles (HLLVs), 1 Crew\nLauncher at a total cost of $500M to\n$l,000M per mission. Note that this rough\nestimate for E T 0 costs is intended to be\n-2-\n\nelements with substantially higher levels of\nonboard autonomy. Four functional\nchallenges must be resolved to enable this\nhighly desirable, but technical difficult\ntransition:\n\nIn summary, this scenario would result in an\nannual cost-for lunar base transportation\nonly-of approximately $7,00OM/year (best\ncase, 3 missions/year), to about\n$1 1,000Wyear (worst case, 4 missions per\nyear). Additional costs would, of course be\nincurred for crew transportation systems,\nsupporting Mastructures (such as\ncommunications systems), as well as for the\nwide range of surface systems that would be\nneeded for a lunar base. (It is perhaps worth\nnoting that in the case of the tightly\ninterwoven Space Shuttle and ISS programs,\nthe costs of transportation to and from the\nStation are very roughly equivalent to the\ncosts of ISS engineering and operations. If\nthe same were to hold true for a far-more\ntechnically challenging lunar base and its\ntransportation system, then the total annual\ncosts would be double the figures noted\nabove-or equivalent something greater\nthan the entire current U.S. annual civil\nspace budget.) The total of such annual\noperational costs would, of course, far\nexceed the current annual US investment in\nhuman space flight. Moreover, they would\nnot allow for vitally needed investments in\nthe systems that would allow us to go\nbeyond and initial operational base.\n\nLower cost ET0 transport (perhaps by\nenabling a transition to launchers that are\nmore similar to those used by other\ngovernment organizations or by commercial\nsectors; and in the long term by transitioning\nto reusable launch vehicles);\nHighly-autonomous assembly, maintenance\nand servicing of modular systems in space\nand on planetary surfaces (including both\nrobotic and crew-assisted operations),\nAffordable and timely pre-positioning of\nfuel, systems and other materiel throughout.\nthe Earth-Moon system (including to the\nsurface of the Moon); and,\nReusable, highly reliable and high-energy in\nspace transportation (and for lunar missions,\nexcursion transportation systems).\n\nThe systems that would enable such\nvisionary capabilities must also be highly\nautonomous (to reduce ground operations\ncosts), as well as substantially less\nexpensive to buy and own (with greater\noperational margins than current systems, as\nwell as lower per unit costs-perhaps\nachieved through modularity and the\neconomies of production).\n\nAlthough the sketch above is specific to a\nnotional lunar base, the affordability issues\ninvolved are quite similar for a range of\nother ambitious future space operational\nscenarios- particularly those involving (as\ndoes the Terrestrial Planet Imager (TPI)\nconcept) a number of exceptionally large,\nhigh-value imaging systems deployed\nbeyond low Earth orbit (LEO).\n\nDetailed studies would be needed to\ndetermine the appropriate technical\nperformance objectives for such advanced\nsystems-in the context of cost constraints\nand reliability (safety) goals. However, it\nseems plausible to suggest that at a\nminimum, such future R&D efforts should\ntarget new systems approaches and novel\ntechnologies that would make possible not\nless that a factor of four reduction in per\nmission costs, and perhaps as much as a 10fold reduction. In the case of the lunar base\nexample sketched above, a 4-fold reduction\n\nA Key Element of a Notional Solution\n\nOne potential solution to this challenge is to\nmove successfully to more affordable\nreusable space transportation system\n\n-3-\n\nwould be equivalent to seeking to achieve a\nlunar base per mission transportation cost of\nno more than $1,75OM to $2,75OM per\nmission+r, in the case of a 10-fold\nreduction, a per mission transportation cost\nO\nof no more than $700M to $1,1O M per\nmission. (For comparison, note that the\nlatter figures are roughly comparable to the\nfully-loaded costs of Space Shuttle missions\nto LEO at the present time-although they\nare still much greater than the marginal costs\nof such flights.)\n\nAs a result, the future development of such\ntechnologies should be broadly beneficial to\nthe full range of ambitious mission options\nthat are under consideration by various\norganizations.\nKev Technical Challenges\nThe central functional issues associated with\naffordably realizing advanced, highly\nreusable architectural concepts lies in\nsolving several key technology challenges.\nThese include:\n\nHowever, setting a goal is hardly the same\nas achieving it. Although the technologies\nneeded to achieve this vision are (in many\ncases) already validated in the laboratory,\nthey are certainly not \xe2\x80\x98in hand\xe2\x80\x99 or\nsufficiently mature to incorporate into space\nsystems being build today. As a result,\nsubstantial research and technology\ndevelopment and validation must still be\nundertaken in order to realize the potential\ncost savings that are so clearly needed in\nend-to-end space transportation.\n\nTele-supervised (and eventually\nautonomous) highly-resilient deep space\nsystems operations (in this case, \xe2\x80\x98deep\nspace\xe2\x80\x99 operations includes all ambitious\nmission operations beyond LEO).\nReconfigurable and self-adaptive modular\nsystems.\n\nSpace assembly, maintenance and\nservicing (from the systems level, down\nto the subsystem level).\nHighly fuel-efficient, high reliability, restartable propulsion, such as high-power\nelectric propulsion for cargo and\ncryogenic engines for time critical\nmission (such as those involving\nastronaut crews).\n\nFortunately, the capabilities for local\nrefueling, as well as locally autonomous\nassembly, repair and maintenance are\ninherent for any kind of extended and\nambitious deep space scenario-such as a\nlunar surface base? Moreover, they become\neven more critical as one considers the longterm requirements of human mission to\nMars, much less the far more ambitious\nrequirements of extended human presence\nand activity in space (e.g., space settlements\nor missions beyond the inner solar system).\n\nHigh-energy propellants for longduration missions (particularly cryogenic\npropellants such as liquid oxygen, liquid\nhydrogen, etc.)\nHigh-power, but low-mass space power\ngeneration and management systems\nLong-term storage and management, as\nwell as the highly reliable and low-loss\ntransfer (including transfer in microgravity) of cryogenic propellants.\n\n3\n\nNote: although smaller missions-such as those\ninvolving traditional communications satellitesmight benefit from in-space refueling, low-cost in\nspace transportation and similar space operations, the\ncosts of developing and deploying such\ntransformational new capabilities are very difficult, if\nnot impossible to justify based on these missions\nalone.\n\nThis paper will deal with a specific class of\nthese technology problems: those that\ninvolve the long-term storage and\n\n-4-\n\n25-ton class cryogenic propellant tank. (In\nthis concept, the tank is transported to LEO\non an Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle\n(EELV) and is itself expendable.\n\nmanagement, and transfer of cryogenic\npropellants in low gravity.\nA New Capabilitv: ISCPD\n\n\xe2\x80\x99\n\nIn either case, the concept provides for\npayload attachments on each module to\nprovide flexibility and re-configurability\noptions for accommodating multiple\ntechnology experiments and eventually\ndifferent exploration payloads. In the case\nof a linear configuration, the platform may\nalso provide a single, larger payload\nattachment at the central of gravity of the\nintegrated vehicle.\n\nIn-Space Cryogenic Propellant Depot\n(ISCPD) systems represent a broad class of\nnew concept of operations with the potential\nto meet several of the important challenge of\nenabling affordable pre-positioning of key\nlogistics (including fuel, hardware, and\nappropriate systems) to points beyond LEO.\nThe basic concept of an ISCPD system may\nbe pursued in a variety of alternate system\nconfigurations-given that the key\ntechnology areas have been addressed\nsuccessfully. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate two\nnotional approaches to cryogenic propellant\ndepots; both involving large, in-space\nassembled structures and a depot that\nremains in a low Earth orbit (LEO).\n\nAt present, there are still unresolved\nresearch issues involved in two-phase\ncryogenic fluids management. Moreover,\nISCPD systems entail considerably greater\nsystem development uncertainty than more\nconventional systems and technologies (e.g.,\nfully expendable, Apollo-era concepts with\ntechnologies that are already at TRL 7-9).\nAs a result, significant research and\ntechnology is needed prior to beginning\nmajor systems development for architectures\nthat involve such concepts. However, if\naffordability and sustainability are important\ncharacteristics for future transformational\nspace operations, then the development of in\nspace refueling is essential.\n\nAnother rather different approach is that of\nthe \xe2\x80\x9chybrid propellant module\xe2\x80\x9d (HPM) in\nwhich the fuel depot itself is modular and\nthe individual modules are small enough to\nbe transported individually using a system\nsuch as a solar electric propulsion (SEP)\norbital transfer vehicle (OTV). Figure 3\nillustrates the HPM concept. However, the\nHPM may also be integrated with others, or\nwith a \xe2\x80\x98stack\xe2\x80\x99 of vehicle elements to form\nand operational vehicle. Figure 4 illustrates\nthis conceptual approach-with the\ncryogenic propellant depot element (the\nHPM) integrated with other elements to\nform an operational vehicle that may in turn\nleave LEO with high value, time-critical\ncargos.\n\nNeeded ISCPD Research and\nDevelopment\n\nA number of important technology areas\nmust be advanced to enable ISCPD\ncapabilities for future space operations.\nFirst, an in-space depot will be required to\ncontinuously supply vapor-fiee cryogenic\nliquids to an orbital transfer vehicle at an\nacceptable flow rate and pressure drop. Also\nto meet a depot efficiency metric of less than\n2% fluid residuals, a highly-capability\ncryogenic liquid acquisition device (LAD)\n\nFor any of these options, cryogenic\npropellants will at first require transport\nfrom Earth to LEO for subsequent transfer,\nstorage and later use in LEO or elsewhere.\nFigure 5 illustrates one such concept for a\n\n-5-\n\npreviously developed by NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Glenn\nResearch Center (GRC) and Ames Research\n(ARC)). In addition, continuing R&D to\ndevelop new, more efficient and longerlived cryo-coolers is also important. In the\narea of ZBO and other topics, flight-like\ncomponents must be developed for use in\nfuture systems-level technology validation\ntesting.\n\nmust be designed and developed. R&D is\nneeded to characterize and develop a design\ndatabase for fundamental screen wicking\ncharacteristics, surface tension data, and\nscreen channel outflow performance with\ncryogenic fluids.\nIn addition, low gravity mass gauging with\nan accuracy of better than 5% of fill tank\nwill be required for the in space depot.\nCurrently no mass gauge at the desired\naccuracy level exists for low gravity\napplication. Serveral different approaches to\nlow gravity mass gauging have been\nidentified. Two promising concepts are the\nCompression Mass Gauge (CMG) and the\nOptical Mass Gauge (OMG). For both of\nthese, reference mass gauging accuracy data\nis needed, and previous functional and\nperformance data must be documented.\nFollowing further R&D-in combination\nwith analyses to better defme depot\narchitecture derived operational\nrequirements-it will be possible to downselect to a single mass gauge concept to be\nmatured further.\n\nPresent in-space depot architectures require\nliquid oxygen (LOX) as an oxidizer for\ndifferent propellant options. The use of LOX\npresents various fluid management\nchallenges, with must be resolved through\nboth component level research as well\nreduced scale depot systems-level testing\nwith LOX. The objectives of such testing\nwould be to validate system designs, provide\nLOX ZBO and associated pressure control\ndata, validate scaling parameters for active\nthermal management, and investigate the\nLOX properties effects on propellant\nmanagement.\nAnother in-space depot operational\nrequirement is to assure the \xe2\x80\x9cleak-free\xe2\x80\x9d\ntransfer of cryogenic propellants during\nmating and de-mating operations. Efforts are\nneeded to develop and test secondgeneration miniaturized leak sensors for\nbroad application use in propellant depots,\nin-space transportation vehicles, and launch\nvehicles.\n\nMinimal or zero loss of cryogenic\npropellants (i.e., \xe2\x80\x9czero boil-off \xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x9cZBO\xe2\x80\x9d)\n,\nduring storage for long durations on an inspace depot is critical for any exploration\nmission success. Boil-off losses exceeding\n3% per month require excess propellant\nstorage margins and translate into\nsignificantly large Earth-to-orbit launch\ncapability. Efforts are needed to develop an\nefficient, low mass depot concept through\nupgrades of existing thermal analysis tools.\nFurther development is also needed of a\nCryogenic Analysis Tool (CAT) that can\nquantify system weight comparisons\nbetween passive insulation systems and\nZBO systems such as cryo-coolers and\nradiators for a defined scenario-including\nspecified cryogenic fluid, environment, and\nquantity). (A partially-validated CAT was\n\nNearer-term R&D must establish a basis for\nsubsequent technology flight demonstrations\n(TFDs) of cryogenic fluid management\n(CFM) technologies requiring a low-g\nenvironment, ultimately leading to an\noperational system supporting a human and\nrobotics space infrastructure. To accomplish\nthis goal, architecture and cost/benefit trade\nstudies are needed, in conjunction with test\narticle and facility upgrades, analytical tool\ndevelopment and verification, and leverage\n\n-6-\n\nThe ISCPD systems concept addresses these\nfeatures in a robust, approach that can\nenable the synergistic future incorporation\nof in situ resources as these become\navailable.\n\nof existing hardware, facilities, and on-going\ntests. It is important to build on the\nsynergism to be achieved through a\ncollaboration of experts in the field of\ncryogenic fluids physics and also to develop\na new generation of experienced and skilled\npersonnel to support this critical long-term\nexploration capability. The goal of such\nefforts would be to assess and mature the\ntechnologies that support future\ndevelopment of modular architectures and\nsystems involving regular, low-cost in space\nrefueling.\n\nGlossarv of Acronyms\n\nSummarv and Conclusions\nWithout substantial systems-level\ninnovation and the development of tractable,\nbut as yet un-demonstrated new\ntechnologies, a broad range of ambitious\nspace operations beyond low Earth orbit\ncannot become either affordable or\nsustainable. The servicing of propellants and\nother consumables in space enables a\nmany mission scenarios, otherwise\nunavailable due to costs, operational\nconstraints, or inefficiencies.\nLow-gravity CFM is a fundamental\nrequirement for establishing a robust space\nexploration infrastructure,and is applicable\nacross the spectrum of exploration objectives\nand goals. CFM is the dominant theme of\n'depots for long-term storage and use of highenergy propellants and other fluids. Cryogenic\nfluid management technologies represent a\ncapability supporting a spiraling and\nexpanding development philosophy towards a\nrobust, reliable, reusable, efficient, and\nflexible space infrastructurefor transportation,\noperations, commercialization, and science.\nCFM enables operational flexibility and\ntolerance to failure, and is particularly suited\nfor spiral investments in evolving capabilities.\n\n-7-\n\nCAT\nCryogenic Analysis Tool\nCost Estimating Relationship\nCER\nCFM Cryogenic Fluid Management\nEELV Evolved Expendable Launch\nVehicle\nEarth-to-Orbit (Transportation)\nET0\nFTE\nFull Time Equivalent\nGEO Geostationary Earth Orbit\nHLLV Heavy-Lift Launch Vehicle\nISCPD In-Space Cryogenic Propellant\nDepot\nISS\nInternational Space Station\nkilowatt\nkW\nkilowatt-hours\nkWh\nLAD\nLiquid Acquisition Device\nLEO\nLow Earth Orbit\nLOX\nLiquid Oxygen\nM E 0 Middle Earth Orbit\nNASA National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration\nPMAD Power Management and\nDistribution\nR&D Research and Development\nSPG\nSolar Power Generation\nTFD\nTechnology Flight Demonstration\nTPI\nTerrestrial Planet Imager\nTechnology Readiness Level(s)\nTRL\nZero Boil Off\nZBO\n\nFigure 1 One Concept for a LEO-based In Space Cryogenic Propellant Depot\n\nI\nFigure 1 Another Concept for a LEO-based In Space Cryogenic Propellant Depot\n\n-8-\n\nII\nI\n\nFigure 3 The Hybrid Propellant Module (HPM) a Modular approach to ISCPD\n-\n\nk\n\n- -\n\nL\n\nFigure 4 The HPM integrated wt other system elements to form an\nih\nOrbit Transport Vehicle (OTV)\n\n-9-\n\n1\nFigure 5 A typical 25-ton class expendable cryogenic propellant tanker\n(launched i a modular fashion using a commercial EELV)\nn\n\n-10-\n\nv)\n\n0\n0\n\ncv\n\n1\n\nY\n\n4\nI\n\nI\n\nL ..:\n\n"
