The sea trial would also include a gas chromatography/differential mobility spectrometer based Air Quality Monitor (AQM), which is used operationally on ISS for volatile organic compound analysis. AQM preparation and results will be the subject of a separate paper. The Navy's interest in testing NASA equipment in general relates to their ongoing search for better air monitoring technology. NASA's goal is studying submarines as closed environment analogs to spacecraft. MGM's core technology was developed by Vista Photonics Inc. using Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grants and expanded for various applications using NASA program funding. The MGM measures oxygen, carbon dioxide, ammonia and water vapor in ambient air, displays concentrations with temperature and pressure, and stores 30 second moving averages. The sea trial involves collocating the instrument with the Central Atmosphere Monitoring System (CAMS Mk II) of the submarine, connecting it to rack power prior to departure, and letting it run during the entire 90 day patrol. All data is stored within MGM, with no connection to the vessel data bus. Crew intervention is limited to checking MGM periodically to see that it is working and power cycling if necessary. After the trial is over, the unit with its data will be retrieved. Post sea trial calibration check and data analysis are planned and results will be compared with both CAMS Mk II data and results from MGM's ISS technology demonstration. Since the sea trial itself has been delayed, this paper describes the preparation of MGM for the sea trial and also provides a summary of the latest data from the ISS MGM technology demonstration.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20170002603, "endDate": "2017-07-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "International Conference On Environmental Systems, Inc.", "location": "Stafford Springs, CT, United States"}}, "meetingId": "c120e9e6f054478a8e5a462cb3dca58c", "id": "d6a74368c3f64520bfa4e5b600e3dae0"}], "name": "International Conference on Environmental Systems", "location": "Charleston, SC", "id": "c120e9e6f054478a8e5a462cb3dca58c", "startDate": "2017-07-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20170002603, "id": "85da18950aac48baa78a504cf490789b", "publicationDate": "2017-07-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20160013656, "type": "SEE_ALSO", "title": "US Navy Submarine Sea Trial of NASA developed Multi-Gas Monitor", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20170002603.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20170002603/downloads/20170002603.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20170002603/downloads/20170002603.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20170002603/downloads/20170002603.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
