On May 6, a dinner gathering was organized for the new\nNASA-MSU Award recipients. At the gathering, the participants first made a brief selfintroduction regarding their background and research interests. Then they formed five groups to\nwork on manuscripts. Furthermore, each new awardee was recognized with a certificate at the\nconference luncheon on July 6. In addition, the awardees attended a \xe2\x80\x9cStudent/Mentor Lunch\xe2\x80\x9d on\nJuly 8 when the awardees (and other students) met with leading scientists. The awardees also\nattended a workshop on telecoupling on July 5. The awardees had a great time and were very\nproductive at the conference, and many are continuing to collaborate on preparing manuscripts\nafter the conference and preparing presentations for next year\xe2\x80\x99s meeting of US-IALE.\nNASA was gratefully acknowledged at the conference. NASA\xe2\x80\x99s continued support and\ncontribution was greatly appreciated by the landscape ecology community and the attendees.\nEnclosed are a list of NASA-MSU Award recipients and comments. Please let me know if\nadditional information is needed. Thank you very much for your continued support of the\nNASA-MSU Awards program.\n\nComments of the 2015 NASA-MSU Awardees\n\nThe NASA MSU Professional Development Award was indispensable for monies toward my\nattendance of the IALE 2015 World Congress. Its goal of professional development has\nalready started to be returning dividends. From this meeting, I have connected with\nresearchers in my field. I can now say that a much larger collection of fellow Master\xe2\x80\x99s\nCandidates, Ph.D. Candidates, researchers, university faculty, and other professionals in\nlandscape ecology can be called colleagues and friends. I was pleased to meet such a broad\nswathe of the attendees in the Telecoupling workshop and meetings. Many of us have\nconferred with each other and have developed ideas for new research and papers. This is also\nto be true of other contacts and lab mates that I attended the conference. The symposia and\ncontributed papers (of which I presented one) have been very informative to the direction of\ncurrent work. They also provided insight into where future research should be focused\n(particularly useful for a new researcher). If I needed to sum up the conference,\npresentations, and NASA MSU workshop it would be like this: fun, collaborative, and\nproductive. Now I just have to find the time to work on all the new ideas spurred on by my\nexperience there.\n***\nMy coming to IALE World Congress 2015 was mission accomplished. Aside been provided\nwith the opportunity to present my PhD research orally to a wide spectrum of audience that\nyou could call the big stage, I was also able to meet and share research and professional\nexperiences with like-minded contemporaries and seniors who have been working on local,\nregional and global landscape problems, both privately and during workshops. I had the\nchance to listen first-hand to variety of talks on existing methodological approaches currently\nbeing used in problem solving (e.g. the telecoupling framework, visualization of problems\nthrough the coupled human and natural systems perspectives etc.), as well as the state of the\nart in landscape science globally.\nIt was a great delight to have all of these benefits together at the same time within one\nconference in the space of one week. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have wished for more. My very many thanks\ngoes to National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Michigan State\nUniversity (MSU) for their support in making this a reality.\n***\nI am halfway through my PhD studies in Landscape Ecology at the University of New South\nWales, Australia. My research uses graph theory network modelling to study landscape\nconnectivity through time and across large spatial extents. I recently attended the IALE 2015\nWorld Congress held in Portland (July 5-10th) as a NASA-MSU Professional Enhancement\nawardee, where I gave an invited presentation at the \'Landscape Connectivity and Its\nImplications for Conservation Management and Planning\' symposium.\nIALE 2015 has been one of the highlights of my PhD to date. I feel very lucky to have attended\nsuch a fascinating, varied and engaging conference at this stage in my candidature, and to have\npresented in a symposium along with several of the most eminent landscape ecologists in my\narea of study. The wide range of topics presented at the conference have confirmed my belief in\n1\n\nthe important role landscape-scale research has to play in guiding conservation within\nincreasingly modified and contested landscapes, and I hope to apply many aspects of what I\nhave learnt throughout the conference in my own research.\nWhile IALE 2015 has been fantastic part of my PhD, I would have been unable to attend had I\nnot been fortunate enough to receive a NASA-MSU Professional Enhancement Award.\nReceiving this award and being part of the special NASA-MSU program greatly enriched my\nconference experience. Completing an interdisciplinary honours degree combining geoscience\nwith environmental studies has made me keenly aware of the complex linkages which exist\nbetween the human and natural worlds, a theme which was central to the fascinating one-day\nworkshop on the \'telcoupling\' framework presented by Jack Liu. Getting to know other\nawardees at this workshop and at other NASA-MSU events (including a luncheon and banquet\ndinner overlooking Portland) was also a highlight of the conference, and I look forward to many\nnew and exciting collaborations between now and my next IALE attendance!\n***\nI write to thank you for the opportunity to attend the 2015 IALE World Congress. I presented\nmy research in the symposium: \xe2\x80\x9cDrivers and Outcomes of Regime Shifts in Land-use Systems\xe2\x80\x9d\n(Symposium S17). I presented my research at Dartmouth, \xe2\x80\x9cAvoiding Regime Shifts in Great\nLakes Coastal Wetlands\xe2\x80\x9d. In addition, I attended the day-long workshop on Telecoupling, led\nby Dr. Jianguo Liu. Together, the workshop and my participation in the symposium, was an\nexcellent experience for professional networking and intellectual growth. The symposium in\nwhich I participated included established scientists whose work I greatly admire, as well as upand-coming scholars such as myself, with whom formed relationships. By participating in the\ntelecoupling workshop, I had the opportunity to explicitly apply the telecoupling conceptual\nframework. In fact, I am currently working with other participants in the workshop to study\nsand scarcity as a limited resource using the telecoupling framework, and we recently submitted\na proposal to present this work at next year\xe2\x80\x99s IALE meeting in the telecoupling symposium. The\nLandscape Ecology community has been an integral part of my career trajectory, and this year\xe2\x80\x99s\nparticipation provided an unparalleled opportunity to present my work at the IALE World\nCongress, to expand my professional network and to integrate my current work into the\nimportant emerging telecoupling conceptual framework. Thank you very much for your support.\n***\nMy research interest coincides with the theme of the 9th IALE World Congress, \xe2\x80\x9cCrossing\nscales, crossing borders: Global approaches to complex challenges\xe2\x80\x9d. The World Congress\nprogram helped me to study the linkages between ecosystem services and human society at\ndifferent spatial and temporal scales by using landscape ecology theory. The World Congress\nprovided various sessions that dealt with ecosystem services. I identified that many researchers\nhave expanded their interests from the supply of ecosystem services to the flow and demand of\necosystem services. For example, researchers can not only map the locations of various coastal\necosystem services (supply part) but also identify how these ecosystem services flow and\nbenefit to human well-being.\nI\xe2\x80\x99m particularly intrigued by a session \xe2\x80\x9cEcosystem Services: Supply, Flows and Demands in\nand Between Landscapes\xe2\x80\x9d and Felix Muller\xe2\x80\x99s research (Kiel University in Germany). Since a\ntelecoupling framework is so strong and welldesigned to adopt to the \xe2\x80\x98ES: Supply, Flows and\nDemands\xe2\x80\x99 at a regional and global level, I will try to link an ecosystem services framework to\n2\n\nthe telecoupling framework. The telecoupling framework can accommodate ecosystem service\nflows (flows), supply (sending systems), demand (receiving systems), and more.\nI participated in Telecoupling workshop and consisted of working groups to study the naturebased tourism for protected areas and its impact on biodiversity over distances. The research of\nnature-based tourism would be the first step to integrating the ecosystem services framework to\nthe telecoupling framework. I am ongoing the research about nature-based tourism using\ntelecoupling framework. I hope I will present this result at the 2016 US-IALE meeting.\n***\nAttending the International Association of Landscape Ecology (IALE) World Congress in July\n2015 allowed me to present my research on cross-scale urban water connections, receive\nvaluable feedback, and network with important current and future collaborators. The workshop\nand networking opportunities provided by the NASA-MSU program proved particularly\nfruitful, offering settings throughout the week to develop relationships with like-minded\nstudent and early-career researchers. My focus group has continued communications following\nthe conference, and we plan to work towards a joint manuscript building from our discussions\nat IALE. Attending the conference also gave me the opportunity to co-present the IALE\nStudent Workshop, "Using R to Model, Manipulate, and Manage Spatial Data." The workshop\nallowed me to share expertise with my peers and make additional connections with a wide\narray of student researchers using similar tools and approaches to conduct landscape scale\nresearch. In my research and career, I aim to contribute integrated, sustainable solutions for\nregional water management in human-environmental systems, and my experience at IALE\n2015 helped me share my current work, meet potential future collaborators, and widen my\nperspectives and understanding.\n***\nIt has been very interesting to get involved into the IALE community at my first participation\nat the IALE congress. My poster and talk were well perceived. I got positive feedback and\nconstructive and critical question, especially following my presentation, which possibly help\nme in further advance my research. Next to my personal presentation I very much enjoyed the\nTelecoupling workshop and the following dinner and discussions.\nMost interesting sessions from my perspective were related to land use change, agrarian\nlandscapes, and ecosystem services. Here I like to highlight especially the session: agrarian\nlandscapes I, land use change IV and VIII, and ecosystem services IV. While the first two gave\nme some insights on current research advances in my field of study, systematic approaches on\necosystem service assessments and definitions opened a new and interesting field for me.\nOverall the conference was very well organized and filled with opportunities to get to know\nand meet people. For me participation was profitable and I would go again.\n\n***\nI was very honored to be a recipient of this award and to stand among the company of so many\nsuccessful colleagues. I was pleased to see the award was associated with a telecoupling\nworkshop, luncheon and dinner with fellow awardees, as this ensured we understood the\n3\n\ncontext behind the award we had received. It helped to highlight telecoupling and propel the\nunderstanding and science of this growing topic among like-minded individuals. During the\nluncheon I was able to sit at the same table with Dr. Liu and I found him to be very\napproachable, and interested in my work, and I felt very proud to accept my award in front of\nconference attendees. During the Awardees dinner that same evening, I joined the \xe2\x80\x9cInvasive\nSpecies/Biodiversity group\xe2\x80\x9d and participated in some fascinating discussion about long\ndistance connections between human and non-human processes as they related to wildlife\nspecies and pathogen movement. My group was comprised of researchers covering topics as\ndiverse as vector-borne diseases, pathogens of old growth forests, aspects of social/human\ngeography, and remote sensing habitat modelling. It was challenging to find common ground\nfrom which to develop a paper topic, but our conversations were thought-provoking and\npushed me to consider the bigger picture (i.e., the global interconnectedness of our own\nindividual research, and how they can be linked). I particularly enjoyed the portion of the\ndinner where everyone introduced themselves and shared something funny or interesting,\nwhich really helped to build a feeling of comradery among our group.\nThank you again for the honor of this award, and for the special events held on our behalf.\nThank you especially to Dr. Liu for organizing and hosting these events, for sharing his\nexperiences, and being so generous and welcoming.\n***\nParticipating in the IALE World Congress has been a very enriching experience. As a PhD\nstudent it provided me the opportunity to interact with many people working in similar research\nareas as myself, and it also exposed me to new areas of research. During my time in the\nconference I was able to attend many presentations that provided me with insight and ideas for\nmy current and future research. During the social events I had the opportunity to meet other\nscience professionals that followed various careers paths after completing their PhD. It was very\ninteresting to meet this people and know of the various job opportunities out there for people\nwith PhD in ecology. I was also very excited to have the opportunity to present my research as\npart of the Landscape Genetics symposium during the meeting (S46) and have experts in the\nfield listen and give me feedback about my research.\n\n***\nWith the generous support the NASA MSU Professional Award, I attended the 9th\nInternational Association of Landscape Ecology (IALE) World Congress at Portland, OR held\nfrom 5 10 July, 2015. During the conference, I presented an interdisciplinary study as part of\nmy PhD research that examines the role of multi level water governance in sustaining\nhydrologic services in agricultural landscapes. The audience provided excellent feedbacks and\nsuggestions that are very helpful to guide the next step of this work. In addition, I attended a\nworkshop on telecoupling which is a research frontier for coupled human and natural systems.\nThis workshop not only explained the detailed conceptual framework along with interesting\nempirical examples of telecoupling research, but also break down into sub working groups to\nallow for in depth and productive discussions. Each group has a focused research topic, and at\nthe end of the workshop, we came up with a research plan and outlined a manuscript that will\ncarry on after the conference. Also, this award program greatly helps me enlarge my\nprofessional network, and build up connections with the same cohort of awardees as well as\nother leading scientists and researchers at the conference. Finally, I also learned a lot about the\n4\n\ncutting edge science at the frontiers of landscape ecology during this meeting, which inspire\nnew ideas for future research. I much appreciate this great opportunity for graduate students\nand early career scientists and would highly recommend it to my colleagues and peers.\n***\nAt this stage of my professional career it is extremely important to show to the scientific\ncommunity the progress of my research and to have the opportunity for networking with my\npeers. My experience at the 9th IALE World Congress in Portland Oregon enabled me to\nachieve these goals. Specifically in this occasion, I had the chance to heard talks from\nrelevant topics in my area, which also gave the opportunity to further interact in person with\nothers colleagues. Moreover, during the workshop and dinner organized for the NASAMSU awardees I had the interesting experience of getting to know other researchers with\nbroad areas of expertise. In this experience, we had the opportunity to establish further\ncollaborations (Telecoupling workshop) for a team research project. From attending to the\nIALE conference I really appreciate the multiple opportunities I had to increase my\ncollaborative network, and I look forward for attending to future IALE conferences.\n***\nThanks to funding from the NASA MSU award, I recently attended the 9th IALE World\nCongress in Portland, OR. This was my first time attending IALE, which was a great\nexperience. Attending the NASA MSU workshop on telecoupling allowed me to meet a great\ngroup of colleagues. My telecoupling working group and I are now working on a manuscript\nthat we plan to submit to a special journal section on telecouplaing being organized by Dr. Jack\nLiu.\nPresenting my dissertation work was also a great experience. I received positive feedback from\nseveral IALE attendees, which led to discussions about possible post doc opportunities next\nyear. Additionally, presenting my researched and attending other presentations helped me\nsituate my scholarship within the landscape ecology community. As a human environment\nscholar working in a geography department, this was my first time attending a landscape\necology conference. It was rewarding to see the breadth of human environment scholarship at\nIALE. As such, I look forward to contributing to future IALE meetings.\n***\nThe NASA-MSU Professional Enhancement Award allowed me to attend the IALE 2015 World\nCongress in Portland, OR. This was a tremendous opportunity for me to gather expert feedback\non my thesis project, refine my understanding of telecoupling, and expand my professional\nnetwork. As part of this conference, I was able to present my thesis research,\nentitled, "Modeling the impact of hydrological alterations: Shifts in Eurasian spoonbill habitat\nin Poyang Lake, China". In addition to the questions and comments I received after my\npresentation, I personally talked with a number of landscape ecology experts to identify\nimprovements and potential extensions to my analysis. The information I gathered in sessions\nand symposium further enhanced my modeling capabilities.\nBeyond developing my own research, I also took advantage of this opportunity to delve into Dr.\nLiu\'s telecoupling framework. In a specially-designed workshop, I formed a small group with a\nnumber of colleagues and began working towards a manuscript operationalizing the\n5\n\ntelecoupling framework in a study system closely related to my own. Through this project, I\nwill be able to expand my knowledge of hydrological systems and gain valuable experience\ncollaborating with other researchers. I look forward to continuing this project and to following\nup on the new connections I\'ve made.\n***\nThe 2015 IALE conference in Portland, OR, was the first of its kind in my case. My background\nand past work experience mainly spanned from Statistics to geographical information systems\n(GIS) with applications in invasive species modeling. Landscape Ecology became a major\ncomponent of my research about a year ago. The IALE conference was a pleasant surprise\nbecause I realized how many topics and applications overlap with my research interests and past\nbackground: patterns crossing spatial scales and temporal resolutions, interactions between\nhumans and the environment across borders, and computational challenges when dealing with\nlarge ecological problems.\nThe workshop on \xe2\x80\x9cTelecoupling Framework for Studying Cross-border and Cross-scale\nInteractions\xe2\x80\x9d exposed me to a novel research topic and sparked my interest in trying to\nunderstand how to re-think any real-world problem within the telecoupling framework. Prior to\nthis year\xe2\x80\x99s IALE, I never had a chance to study this topic and I really enjoyed learning about\nseveral case studies where the telecoupling framework has been applied. Finally, co-instructing\nthe student workshop on \xe2\x80\x9cUsing R to Model, Manipulate, and Manage Spatial Data\xe2\x80\x9d was\nextremely helpful to build my teaching skills, directly interact with students and receive their\nfeedback to improve future workshops. Throughout the conference, I enjoyed making new\nconnections, expanding my research network, and building new friendships.\n***\nAs a recent PhD graduate at the University of Toronto, the NASA-MSU award provided me a\nvery rich academic experience at the 2015 IALE world congress in Portland, Oregon.\nMy research focus is in landscape epidemiology, a frontier discipline that aims to quantify the\ninteractions between landscape structure and disease-transmission processes at the populationand community-level. Landscape ecology therefore remains a core aspect of my current\nresearch and is likely to remain the foundation for my future career trajectory in disease\nmonitoring and surveillance. Being provided the opportunity to attend the 2015 conference by\nthe NASA-MSU grant facilitated my networking opportunities with other students, academics,\nand industry representatives who have similar research interests in this particular niche of\nenvironmental and health sciences that is rarely available at alternative infectious disease or\nhealth-related conferences I normally attend.\nThis year, the theme of \'telecoupling\' was a central focus of the NASA-MSU awardees.\nWorking with other student awardees on the focus of \'telecoupling\' provided a unique interface\nto connect with other young scientists and to problem-solve issues in multi-scalar links between\necological and human systems. This concept is a cutting-edge perspective on complicity theory\nand is extremely amenable to my personal work in terms of how local-scale disease outbreaks\nmay drive global-scale pandemics with significant economic, social, and environmental\nconsequences. Therefore, the introduction to \'telecoupling\' has provided personal benefits\nbeyond the scope of the group discussions at the conference. For example, I expect to develop\nmulti-scalar disease networks at an agricultural-trade interface using meta network theory\n\n6\n\napproaches towards understanding critical spatial and economic links that bridge local disease\nclusters to major global contagion.\nThank you for providing me as a young landscape ecologist the opportunity to attend, present\nmy research, and network at the 2015 IALE conference. I am looking forward to attending this\nconference annually in the future.\n***\nI am an Agriculture Engineer and currently about to defend my Master of Science thesis on the\nNatural Resources Master of Science program from the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile.\nI was accepted to orally present in the 2015 IALE World Congress in Portland Oregon, the\nresults of my research in the Historical Ecology Symposia, titled: Historical Dynamics of a\nPatagonian Landscape: Patterns and processes in forest cover and use since late 19th\ncentury in Chilean Patagonia. I briefly describe the unique experience I had during my stay in\nPortland, OR, to which I must specially acknowledge the support given by Michigan State\nUniversity and NASA with the NASA-MSU award.\nStarting with the Telecoupling workshop led by Dr. Liu, it was a unique experience to meet\nscientists from all over the world and to establish relationships that will surely develop to the\nfuture. All along the week of the congress, this people were like friends. The diversity of the\ncongress speakers every one of the days constituted a real challenge to follow and take\nadvantage of the wide opportunities of opening my frontiers of knowledge in the landscape\necology science. Beside attending a diverse array of presentations, I had the remarkable chance\nto meet researchers of my specific field (historical ecology), including one of my mentors\nabroad, Dr. Lars \xc3\x96stulnd, with whom we intensively worked on the research we are together\ninvolved. It was as well a great opportunity to revise my Master thesis with him and other\nexperimented researchers in the field. About the effects of the telecoupling framework in my\nresearch after attending the congress, I am involved in the premises of a research group formed\nafter the telecoupling workshop, concerning the telecoupling of sand resources. I came back to\nChile not only with good advance on my thesis, after having presented it and received the\nproper critics and advises, but also with a new and diverse group of friendship to develop and\nnourish in the future.\n\n7\n\nNASA-MSU Awardees (Class of 2015)\nName\n\nAffiliation\n\nOludunsin T Arodudu\n\nLeibniz Centre for Agricultural Landscape Research\n(ZALF), Germany\n\nRobbi C Bishop-Taylor\n\nUniversity of New South Wales, Australia\n\nJodi S Brandt\n\nDartmouth College\n\nMin Gon Chung\n\nMichigan State University\n\nArjan de Bruijn\n\nPurdue University\n\nJillian M Deines\n\nMichigan State University\n\nJoseph Drake\n\nTexas Tech University\n\nFlorian Gollnow\n\nHumboldt-Universit\xc3\xa4t zu Berlin, Germany\n\nAmy B Mui\n\nUniversity of Toronto, Canada\n\nBeatriz Otero Jimenez\n\nUniversity of Michigan\n\nJiangxiao Qiu\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison\n\nYessica Rico Mancebo del Castillo Royal Ontario Museum, Canada\nJesse S Sayles\n\nArizona State University\n\nBenjamin K Sullender\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison\n\nFrancesco Tonini\n\nNorth Carolina State University\n\nAlexander Watts\n\nUniversity of Toronto, Canada\n\nGabriel Zegers\n\nPontifical Catholic University of Chile, Chile\n\n'
