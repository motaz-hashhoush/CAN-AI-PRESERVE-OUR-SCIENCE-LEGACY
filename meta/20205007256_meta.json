Most landers are being developed for commercial launch vehicles (CLVs) in the Falcon Heavy / Vulcan / New Glenn / Atlas V class, limiting their performance with many lunar surface studies consequently restricted to 5-10 metric ton payloads.  The JUMP Lander (Joinable Undercarriage to Maximize Payload) attempts to overcome this limitation by performing an in-space mating, linking multiple landers together.  This research provides an initial proof of concept demonstration that two or more CLV-launched lunar landers can be mated in-space to produce a larger lander with greater payload capacity.  Multiple rockets have been connected hundreds if not thousands of times in spaceflight history.  An example is the space shuttle.  The External Tank-Orbiter interface is an example where the 100-ton Orbiter is bolted to the side of the External Tank.  This example serves as a concept metaphor for JUMP where a system of bolts is used as the mating system.  This paper performs a high-level sizing analysis of the bolt, including the structural connection to each lander and the physical dimensions of the bolt, given the projected lander and payload masses.  It sizes the necessary motors to perform the in-space mating and describes the motor to bolt integration.  It describes the mounting and translation for the bolt-motor assembly, including structural supports, physical stops, and range of travel.  It discusses active-active and active-passive implementations for the mating system and post-mating options to jettison no-longer-needed components of the assembly, including a discussion of benefits of jettisoning or not jettisoning.  Finally, forward work for the mating mechanism and overall JUMP Lander concept is described.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "US", "submissionId": 20205007256, "endDate": "2020-11-18T06:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"organizationId": "71fb4af96d4a59b5a0a2084db7b4ce35", "meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "Reston, Virginia, United States"}}, "meetingId": "73163761c3d74295bad1a57eaf52450b", "id": "2d6f32b79a2b43ffbafc72d6f13658e6"}], "name": "2020 AIAA ASCEND Conference", "location": "Virtual (formerly Las Vegas, NV)", "id": "73163761c3d74295bad1a57eaf52450b", "url": "https://www.ascend.events/", "startDate": "2020-11-16T06:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20205007256, "publisher": "", "id": "a1b5140d4d1343e69d4af8d954d62f8a", "publicationName": "", "publicationDate": "2020-11-16T06:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "FINAL - An Initial Concept for a JUMP Mating Mechanism.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20205007256/downloads/FINAL%20-%20An%20Initial%20Concept%20for%20a%20JUMP%20Mating%20Mechanism.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20205007256/downloads/FINAL%20-%20An%20Initial%20Concept%20for%20a%20JUMP%20Mating%20Mechanism.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20205007256/downloads/FINAL%20-%20An%20Initial%20Concept%20for%20a%20JUMP%20Mating%20Mechanism.pdf.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
