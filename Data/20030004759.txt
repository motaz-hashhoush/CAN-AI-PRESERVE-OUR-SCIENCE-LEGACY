b"Lightning\n\nProtection\n\nIn the photo, an airplane's wingtip tank is being\nstruck by simulated lightning in a test conducted\nby Lightning Technologies,\nInc., Pittsfield,\nMassachusetts,\na consulting firm specializing in\ndesign features to protect aircraft from the hazards\nof electrical phenomena.\nThe firm's customers\ninclude several of the nation's leading manufacturers\nof private, business and commercial\naircraft.\nLightning simulations like the one pictured are\nemployed to test the effectiveness\nof Lightning\nTechnologies'\nprotective\nmeasures.\nMuch of the technology\nemployed by Lightning\nTechnologies\noriginated\nin NASA-sponsored\nstudies.\nThese studies, conducted\nwith contractor\nassistance\nby Langley Research Center, Lewis Research Center\n\nand Dryden Flight Research Center, focused on the\neffects of lightning on aircraft structures,\nelectrical\nsystems and fuel tanks, and on means of protecting\nagainst hazardous\neffects. As an employee of General\nElectric Company's\nHigh Voltage Laboratory,\na\nNASA contractor,\nJ. Anderson Plumer acquired\n12\nyears experience\nin lightning investigations.\nIn 1977,\nhe left GE to form Lightning Technologies,\nof which\nhe is president.\nPlumer is thus an example of a\npersonnel-type\nspinoff, wherein NASA technology\nis transferred\nto the private sector in the course of\nan occupational\nshift by a scientist or engineer\nonce engaged in NASA research activity.\n81\n\n"
