The remaining chapters of this part provide\ndetailed measurement\nand data analysis protocols\nfor in-water radiometric\nprofiles (Chapter\n10),\nthe Marine Optical Buoy (MOBY) radiometric\nobservatory\nfor vicarious calibration\nof satellite\nocean color sensors (Chapter\n11), above water measurements\nof remote sensing reflectance\n(Chapter\n12), determinations\nof exact\nnormalized\nwater-leaving\nradiance\n(Chapter\n13),\natmospheric\nradiometric\nmeasurements\nto determine\naerosol optical thickness\nand sky radiance\ndistributions\n(Chapter 14), determination\nof absorption\nspectra from water samples (Chapter\n15),\nand determination\nof phytoplankton\npigment\nconcentrations\nusing HPLC (Chapter\n16) and\nfluorometric\n(Chapter 17) methods.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nData Reporting and Archival:\nChapter 18 describes the methods and procedures for data archival,\ndata synthesis and merging, and quality control applicable\nto the SeaWiFS Bio-optical\nArchive\nand Storage System (SeaBASS),\nwhich is maintained\nto support ocean color validation\nfor the\nSeaWiFS,\nSIMBIOS\nand other cooperating\nsatellite\nsensor projects.\nCurrent\nSeaBASS\nfile\ncontent and formatting requirements\nare given in Appendix B.\nWhat is new in Revision 3 to the ocean optics protocol document, as compared to Revision 2 (Fargion\nand Mueller 2000). The most obvious changes are the insertion of 3 new chapters into the document,\nand\nthe renumbering\nof the other chapters to accommodate\nthem. The new chapters are:\n1.\n\n2.\n\nChapter 2, Fundamental\nDefinitions,\nRelationships\nand Conventions,\nintroduces\nthe radiometric\nquantities,\ninherent optical properties,\nfundamental\nconcepts and terminology\nunderlying\nthe in\nsitu measurement\nand analysis protocols discussed\nthroughout\nthe document.\nThe chapter also\ndiscusses\nthe scales adopted\nin these protocols\nfor such quantities\nas extraterrestrial\nsolar\nirradiance, and the absorption and scattering coefficients\nof pure water.\nChapter 11, MOBY, A Radiometric\nBuoy for Performance\nMonitoring and Vicarious Calibration\nof Satellite Ocean Color Sensors:\nMeasurement\nand Data Analysis Protocols,\ndocuments\nthe\nspecific measurement\nand data analysis protocols used in the operation of this critical radiometric\nobservatory.\nThe MOBY\nnormalized\nwater-leaving\nradiance\ntime series has provided\nthe\nprincipal, common basis for vicarious calibration of every satellite ocean color sensor in operation\nsince 1996.\n\n3.\n\nChapter 13, Normalized\nWater-Leaving\nRadiance and Remote Sensing Reflectance:\nBidirectional\nReflectance and Other Factors, develops the physical basis underlying\nthe bidirectional\naspects of\nthe ocean\'s\nreflectance,\nand presents\nmethods\nfor removing\nthis effect to determine\nexact\nnormalized\nwater-leaving\nradiance,\nthe only form of water-leaving\nradiance\nsuitable\nfor\ncomparisons\nbetween determinations\nbased on satellite and in situ measurements.\nAside from renumbering,\nseveral of the chapters carried over from Revision 2 have been revisited and\nsignificantly revised, while others have been modified only slightly. The two chapters providing overviews\nof Instrument\nCharacteristics\n(Chapter 4) and Field Measurements\nand Data Analysis (Chapter\n9) have\nbeen revised to reflect the changed content of those two major parts of the document.\nChapter 15, covering\n\niii\n\nOcean Protocols Satellite\nOptics\nFor\n\nOcean Color Sensor Validation\n\nprotocols\nfor laboratory\nspectrophotometric\ndeterminations\nof absorption\nby particles\nand dissolved\nmaterials in seawater samples, has been significantly\nrevised to condense the workshop results reported in\nthe Revision 2 version into more focused descriptions\nof measurement\nand analysis protocols;\nthe more\ndetailed workshop results and background\nin the original version of this chapter (as cited in the present\nversion) comprise the single case where material presented\nin Revision 2 is not completely\nsuperceded\nby\nthe present document.\nProtocols for HPLC measurements\nof concentrations\nof phytoplankton\npigments\n(Chapter\n16) and fluorometric\nmeasurements\nof chlorophyll\na concentration\n(Chapter\n17) have been\nsignificandy\nupdated\nand revised.\nProtocols\nfor characterization\nof radiometers\n(Chapter\n6) and for\ncalibration of, and measurements\nusing, sun photometers\nand sky radiance instruments\n(Chapters 7 and 14)\nhave been updated\nsignificantly,\nbut modestly,\nand modifications\nto the remaining\nchapters\nare all\nrelatively minor.\nAlthough the present document represents\nanother significant, incremental\nimprovement\nin the ocean\noptics protocols,\nthere are several protocols\nthat have either been overtaken\nby recent technological\nprogress, or have been otherwise identified as inadequate.\nSome of the deficiencies\nand corrective steps\nthat will be taken in Revision 4, scheduled for completion\nin 2002, include:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe present state of the art in instruments\nand methods for determining\nproperties\n(IOP) is described only via abstract-level\nsummaries in Chapters\nchapter will provide more complete and up-to-date IOP related protocols.\n\ninherent optical\n4 and 9.

Continued discourse within\nthe ocean color research community\nled to Revisions\n1 (Mueller and Austin 1995) and 2 (Fargion and\nMueller 2000) of these protocols.\nThe Ocean Optics Protocols for Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation (Revision 3.0) are intended to\nprovide\nstandards,\nwhich if followed\ncarefully\nand documented\nappropriately,\nwill assure\nthat any\nparticular set of optical measurements\nwill be acceptable\nfor ocean color sensor validation\nand algorithm\ndevelopment.\nThese protocols\nare guidelines and may be somewhat\nconservative.\nIn the case of ship\nshadow avoidance,\nfor example, there are some circumstances\nin which acceptable radiometric\nprofiles\nmay be acquired considerably\ncloser to a ship than is specified here (Section 10.2). When the protocols are\nnot followed in such cases, however, it is incumbent upon the investigator\nto explicitly demonstrate\nthat the\nactual error levels are within tolerance.\nClose adherence to these protocols is the most straightforward\nway\nfor an investigator\nto establish a measurement\nthat is uncontaminated\nby artifacts, such as ship shadow, and\nis accurate enough to meet the requirements\nof satellite ocean color product validation.\nFinally, having a standard set of measurement\nprotocols\nis indispensable\nin developing\nconsistency\nacross the variety of international\nsatellite ocean color missions either recently launched or scheduled\nfor\nlaunch in the next few years.\nWhile each mission has its own validation\neffort, the mission validation\nteams should not need to define separate validation measurement\nrequirements.\nIn the U.S., for instance,\nocean color validation support is derived from four separate funding programs, i.e., the SeaWiFS Project,\nModerate\nResolution\nImaging\nSpectroradiometer\n(MODIS)\nvalidation\nprogram,\nthe Earth Observing\nSystem (EOS) calibration and validation program, and the Sensor Intercomparison\nfor Marine Biology and\nInterdisciplinary\nOceanic Studies (SIMBIOS)\nProject (McClain and Fargion,\n1999a, 1999b).\nContinued\ndevelopment\nand refinement of these protocols help ensure coordination,\ncollaboration,\nand communication\nbetween those involved.\n\n1.2 OBJECTIVES\nImmediate\nconcerns focused the early versions Of the Ocean Optics Protocols (Muetler\nand Austin\n1992, 1995) on specific preparations\nfor the SeaWiFS mission.\nIn the interim, not only SeaWiFS, but the\nJapanese Ocean Color Temperature\nSensor (OCTS), the Polarizat_ofi Detection Environmentai_ad_0meter\n(POLDER),\nand the MODIS\nglobal coverage ocean color systems have been successfully\nlaunched and\nbrought into operation, and the near-term launch Of several other such systems is anticipated (Appendix A).\nThe SIMBIOS Program goal is to assist the international\nocean color community in developing\na multi-year\ntime-series\nof calibrated\nradiances\nthat transcends\nthe spatial and temporal boundaries\nof individual\nmissions (Barnes et al. 2001). Specific objectives are to: (I) quantify the relative accuracies of the products\nfrom each mission, (2) work with each project to improve the level of confidence and compatibility\namong\nthe products,\nand (3) develop methodologies\nfor generating\nmerged\nievel-3 products.\nSIMBIOS\nhas\nidentified\nthe primary instruments\nto be used for developing\nglobal data sets. These instruments\nare\nSeaWiFS, OCTS, POLDER [Advanced Earth Observing Satellite (ADEOS)-I and II], MODIS (Terra and\nAqua),\nMulti-angle\nImaging\nSpectroRadiometer\n(MISR), Medium\nResolution\nimaging\nSpectrometer\n(MERIS),\nand Global Line Imager (GLI).\nThe products from other missions [e.g., Ocean Color Imager\n(OCI), Ocean Scanning Multisprectral\nImager (OSMI), and Modular Optoelectronic\nScanner (MOS)] will\nbe tracked and evaluated, but are n0t considered as key data sources foi\'acombined\nglobal data set.\nThe scope of the protocols was, therefore, broadened to support development\nof bio-optical\ndatabases\nthat meet the expanded requirements\nof the SIMBiOS goals and objectives\n(Fargion and Mueller 2000).\nThe key objective addressed by the original working group was to recommend\nprotocols and standards for\nsupporting in situ optical measurements.\nThe original objectives\nremain valid today, albeit with broader\nrequirements\nfor detailed measurements\nand sensor characteristics\n(e.g. wavelength characteristics).\nThe\ngeneralized\nprotocol objectives address the following subject areas:\n1.\n\nThe required and useful optical parameters\nsensor normalized\nwater-leaving\nradiances\nmonitoring each satellite sensor\'s calibration\n\nto be used for validation of satellite ocean color\nand atmospheric\ncorrection algorithms,\nand for\nand stability, will be defined.\n\nOcean ptics rotocols\nO\nP\nforSatellite cean olor ensor\nO\nC S\nValidation,\nRevision\n3\n2.

Experience with the CZCS\nshowed it is very difficult to determine a sensor\'s calibration once it has been launched CViollier 1982,\nGordon et al. 1983, Hovis et al. 1985, Mueller 1985, Gordon 1987, and Evans and Gordon 1994). Similar\nproblems have been encountered with other earth observing systems, such as the National Oceanic and\nAtmospheric Administration (NOAA) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer\n(AVHRR) (Brown and\nEvans 1985 and Weinreb et al. 1990). Because of the large atmospheric contribution to the total observed\nradiances (Gordon 1981) and the great sensitivity\nof the bio-optical algorithms to the estimated waterleaving radiances (Clark 1981), small errors in the calibration can induce sizable errors in derived\ngeophysical products, rendering them useless for many applications.\nBy processing\nlarge quantities of so-called\n"clear-water"\nimagery,\ni.e. in water with pigment\nconcentrations\nless than 0.25 mg m 3 (Gordon and Clark 1981), Evans and Gordon (1994) were able to\ndevelop a vicarious calibration that was used in the global processing of the entire CZCS data set (Esaias et\nal. 1986, Fetdman et al. 1989 and McClain et al. 1993). The approach, however, required assumptions\nthat\nmay limit the scientific utility of ocean color imagery.\nSpecifically,\nthe normalized clear water-leaving\nradiances,\n\nLWN(443), LWN(520), and LwN(550),\n\nwere assumed\n\nto be 1.40, 0.48,\n\nrespectively.\nThe Angstrom exponents were assumed to be zero, and certain\nthe Sargasso Sea, were assumed to be clear-water sites at all times.\nUnder\nwater LWN values were used to calculate calibration\nadjustment coefficients\nvalues into agreement for these regions.\nThe vicarious calibration of the 443\n\nand 0.30 mW cm:gm\'lsr\'l,\n\ngeographical regions, such as\nthese assumptions,\nthe clearto bring CZCS derived LWN\nnm band is tenuous, because\n\nof the great variablqity in LwN(443) even in ciear Water. Additionaily.certain\ncommand and engineering\ndata from the NIMBUS-7\nplatform were not archived, so that a detailed analysis of possible effects related\nto the spacecraft\nenvironment\nand the effects of spacecraft\noperation\non the calibration\ncould not be\nperformed.\nUnlike CZCS, SeaWiFS and other modern ocean color sensors routinely produce geophysical\nfields in\na near-real time, operational\nmode for distribution\nto the science community.\nThis aspect, as well as\nmerger of multi-satellite\ndata sets spanning\nmany years, necessitates\nconstant\nevaluation of system\nperformance\nand derived products for all of the sensors.\nTherefore,\na consistent multifaceted\napproach to\naddress problems of sensitivity degradation\nand sensor characterization\nis required on a continuing\nbasis.\nThe goal is to ensure that satellite derived water-leaving\nradiances are accurately\nknown and meet the\nspecifications\nof the individual missions and SIMBIOS.\nAs implemented\nby the SeaWiFS Project Office, for example, the validation\nprogram includes both\nonboard and vicarious calibration\napproaches\n(McClain\net al. 1998, 2000a, 2000b; Barnes et al. 1999a,\n2000a, 2000b, 2000c). SeaWiFS has a solar measuring diffuser plate to reference the response to the sun\nand is also capable of periodically\nimaging the moon by maneuvering\nthe spacecraft (Barnes et al. 1999b).\nMODIS and some other ocean color sensors have similar capabilities.\nThe vicarious calibration program\nincorporates\nmeasurements\nof water-leaving\nradiances,\nand other related quantities,\nfrom ships, drifting\nbuoys, and fixed moorings,\nto develop time series and geographically\ndiverse samples of oceanic and\natmospheric\ndata.\nEach approach\nhas advantages\nand disadvantages,\nbut when combined,\nthey should\nprovide a complementary\nand comprehensive\ndata set that will be sufficient to monitor short-term changes\nand long-term trends in the sensor\'s performance.\nPresendy,\n\nthe\n\nSIMBIOS\n\nProject\n\nuses\n\na combination\n\nof\n\nsatellite\n\nand\n\nin situ\n\nobservations\n\nfrom\n\ngeographically\ndiverse vicarious\ncalibration\ntest sites as a means of comparing\nocean color satellite\ninstruments.\nUsing this vicarious calibration\napproach, results retrieved\nfrom different sensors can be\nmeaningfully\ncompared and possibly merged (Barnes et al. 2001). More importantly, one can use the same\nprocedure,\nwith in situ ocean and atmospheric\noptical property measurements,\nto recalibrate\nsatellite\nsensors (Fargion et al., 1999, 2000; Fargion and McClain 2000).\nThe SIMBIOS\ncalibration\nstrategy is to focus on regions\nproperties of the marine atmosphere\nand ocean are well understood\n\nand circumstances\nand homogeneous,\n\nwhere the optical\ni.e. where the errors\n\nOcean ptics rotocols\nO\nP\nforSatellite cean Sensor\nO Color\nValidation,\nRevision\n3\nintheatmospheric\ncorrection thein situ optical measurements are expected to be minimal. The Marine\nand\nOptical Buoy (MOBY), near the island of Lanai, Hawaii, provides the principal instrumented\ntest site for\nvicarious calibration measurements\n(Clark et. al. 1997; see also Chapter 11). The MOBY project officially\nsupports the validation of ocean color data that is collected by SeaWiFS and MODIS.\nIn addition, MOBY\nhas been successfully\nused for OCTS and POLDER and indirectly\nfor MOS (Wang and Franz, 1999)\nvicarious calibrations.\n1.4 BIO-OPTICAL\n\nALGORITHMS\n\nThe SeaWiFS Project Office, and each of the counterpart ocean color sensor projects, is responsible\nfor\nproducing\na standard set of derived products. The oceanic products include chlorophyll\nconcentration,\nK d (490),\n\nand\n\n_\n\n(%,0,\xc2\xa2)\n\nat 5 wavelengths\n\n(see Chapter\n\n13 regarding\n\nthe significance\n\nof the angular\n\ndependency).\nThe basic quantities to be computed from the sensor radiances are the water-leaving\nradiances, from\nwhich all other derived products except the aerosol products are computed.\nEvery effort must be made to\nensure these radiances meet the goal of no more than 5 % uncertainty\nin case-1 waters.\nThis requires the\natmospheric\ncorrection\nalgorithms\nto be considerably\nmore sophisticated\nthan were the original CZCS\nalgorithms.\nThe baseline bio-optical\nproducts must meet the SeaWiFS,\nMODIS, other sensors, and SIMBIOS\nProject accuracy requirements\nover a variety of water masses.\nThe CZCS algorithms were based on a data\nset consisting\nof fewer than 50 data points (only 14 observations\nwere available for the band-2-to-band-3\nratio algorithm)\nand performed\npoorly in regions of high concentrations\nof phytoplankton\npigments,\nsuspended\nsediment, or CDOM, and in coccolithophorid\nblooms (Groom and Holligan\n1987). Accurate\nestimates of the baseline products are essential if SeaWiFS is to be useful in programs such as the Joint\nGlobal Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS)\n[National Academy of Science (NAS) 1984], carbon cycle research,\nand climate change research.\nSeaWiFS, and the other modem ocean color sensors, have the capability, due to improvements\nin the\nsignal-to-noise\nratio (SNR), digitization,\ndynamic range, and wavelength\nselection, to increase the accuracy\nof these products and to flag areas where anomalies or low confidence conditions exist. Clearly, a much\nlarger database is needed for developing\nand validating a broader variety of bio-optical algorithms,\nsome of\nwhich will be region specific.\nThe radiometric,\noptical, and chemical field observations\nused in deriving\nbio-optical\nalgorithms\nand for vicarious calibration of the sensor must, therefore,\nconform to stringent,\nuniform\nrequirements\nwith respect\nto instrument\ncalibration\nand characterization,\nand methods\nof\nobservation.\nThe SeaWiFS and SIMBIOS Projects jointly manage a program to compare the various atmospheric\ncorrection\nand bio-optical\nalgorithms\nproposed\nby the science community\n(Wang and Bailey 2000,\nMcClain et al. 2000a, 2000b; O\'Reilly\net al. 2000).\nThe purpose of this program is to independently\nevaluate suggested improvements,\nor additions, to the SeaWiFS and merged products.\nThis component of\nthe calibration\nand algorithm development\nprogram runs in parallel with, but off-line from, operational\nprocessing and provides an essential mechanism for incorporating\ndata and analyses from the community at\nlarge (Barnes et al. 2001).\n\n1.5 VICARIOUS\n\nCALIBRATION\n\nFor ocean observations,\nit is easy to show (Gordon 1987 and Gordon 1988) that satellite sensor\ncalibration requirements based on the quality of the existing CZCS pigment algorithms exceed currently\navailable capabilities. Furthermore, the sensor calibration is unlikely to remain unchanged through launch\nand five years of operation in orbit. The only foreseeable way of approaching the ocean calibration needs\nis through vicarious calibration, i.e., fine tuning the calibration in orbit.\nGordon\n\n(1987)\n\ndescribed\n\nFirst, the calibration was\nradiance and the expected\n\nthe detailed\n\nmethod\n\nused to achieve\n\nvicarious\n\ncalibration\n\nfor the CZCS.\n\ninitialized after launch by forcing agreement between the sensor-determined\nradiance based on radiometric\nmeasurements made at the surface under clear\n\nOcean\n\nOptics\n\nProtocols\n\nfor Satellite\n\nOcean Color Sensor Validation,\n\nRevision\n\n3\n\natmospheric\nconditions.\nNext, since the CZCS responsivity\nwas observed\nto be time dependent,\nthe\nalgorithms\nwere applied\nto other scenes characterized\nby bio-optical\nsurface measurements\nand more\ntypical atmospheres,\nand the calibration\nwas adjusted until the measured water-leaving\nradiances\nwere\nreproduced.\nFinally, the surface measurements\nof pigments were combined with satellite pigment estimates\nfor a wide variety of atmospheric\nconditions,\nand the radiance calibration\nwas fine tuned until the best\nagreement was obtained between the retrieved and true pigments.\nThe CZCS vicarious calibration was not radiometric.\nIt was a calibration of the entire system - sensor\nplus algorithms.\nTo predict the radiance measured at the satellite, Lt, the water-leaving\nradiance, aerosol\noptical thickness, and aerosol phase function are all required. Also needed are ancillary data, including the\nsurface pressure, wind speed, and ozone optical thickness.\nFor vicarious calibration and validation,\nthese\ndata are obtained by measuring the upwelling radiance distribution just beneath the surface, along with the\naerosol optical thickness and the sky radiance, at the time of the satellite overpass.\nThe sky radiance is\nused to deduce the required\ninformation about the aerosol phase function (Voss and Zibordi\n1989).\nThe\ndata set is finally used to deduce L, at the top of the atmosphere,\ncoincident with a SeaWiFS overpass from\nwhich the calibration is initialized (Clark et at 1997).\nThe present approach\n\nused by the SIMBIOS\n\nand SeaWiFS\n\nProjects\n\nis to develop\n\na Level-lb\n\nto Level-2\n\nsoftware package (MS112) which is capable of processing data from multiple ocean color sensors using the\nstandard\nSeaWiFS\natmospheric\ncorrection\nalgorithms\nof Gordon and Wang (1994a,\n1994b).\nThe\nintegration of a new sensor into MSI12 involves the development\nof a set of input functions and derivation\nof bandpass\nspecific\nquantities\nsuch as Rayleigh\nscattering tables and Rayleigh-aerosol\ntransmittance\ntables. Once the processing\ncapability has been established,\nthe vicarious calibration can be tuned using\n"match-up\ndata" from the MOBY site, and/or cross calibration with another sensor. For example, Wang\nand Franz (1999) used SeaWiFS normalized remote sensing reflectances and aerosol models to successfully\nre-calibrate\nthe MOS spectral channels.\nUsing this approach,\nthe SIMBIOS Project can provide a completely\nindependent\nassessment\nof\ninstrument\ncalibration\nand sensor-to-sensor\nrelative calibration.\nThe Project also provides insight to the\nsensor teams on how differences\nin calibration techniques and atmospheric correction algorithms propagate\nthrough the processing\nto produce differences\nin retrieved optical properties\nof the water. It must be\nstressed that this exercise is absolutely essential for calibrating the ocean color systems, i.e. sensors plus\nalgorithms,\nand that it cannot be implemented\nwithout\na high quality surface data set obtained\nsimultaneously\nwith the satellite imagery.\n\n1.6 AEROSOL\nAerosol\n\noptical\n\nOPTICAL\nthickness\n\nproducts\n\nTHICKNESS\ndetermined\n\nVALIDATION\n\nfrom the satellite\n\nocean\n\ncolor\n\ndata itself\n\nare Critical\n\nfactors in the uncertainty\nbudgets of atmospheric\nCorrection algorithms (Gordon and Wang 1994a) and\nresults of vicarious calibrations\n(Clark et al. 1997; Gordon 1981, 1987, 1988). The SIMBIOS Project is\nvalidating the SeaWiFS aerosol optical products by comparing them to in situ measurements\n(Wang et aL,\n2000). A second, related objective of these comparisons\nis to determine the validity of the aerosol models\ncurrently used by SeaWiFS for atmospheric correction.\nThe principal source of in situ aerosol observations\nis the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET).\nAERONET\nis a network of ground-based\nautomated\nsun photometers\nowned by national agencies\nand\nuniversities\n(Holben et al. 1998). AERONET data provides globally distributed, near-real time observations\nof aerosol spectral optical depths, aerosol size distributions,\nand precipitable\nwater. Because the majority\nof the AERONET\nstations\nare at continental\nlocations,\nSIMBIOS\naugmented\nthe network\nwith 12\nadditional\nisland and coastal sites, including Lanai and Oahu Hawaii, Ascension\nIsland, Bahrain, Tahiti,\nWallops\nisland, South Korea, Turkey, Argentina,\nAzores and Perthl\nThe SIMBIOS\nProject also has\nshipboard\nand hand-held\nsun photometers\n(MicroTops,\nPREDE, and SIMBAD)\nand an aerosol-profiling\nLIDAR system. These instruments\nare calibrated in collaboration\nwith the AERONET\nProgram at NASA\nGoddard\nSpace Flight Center (GSFC) and loaned to investigators\nstaging SIMBIOS sponsored\nresearch\nexpeditions.\n\n6\n\nOcean ptics rotocols\nO\nP\nforSatellite\nOcean Sensor\nColor\nValidation,\n1.7 COMMUNITY\n\nRevision\n\n3\n\nPARTICIPATION\n\nThe SeaWiFS and SIMBIOS Project Offices rely on the oceanographic\ncommunity to perform field\nresearch for atmospheric and bio-optical algorithm development, and for all of the in situ data collection for\nvicarious\nsensor calibration.\nThe SIMBIOS Project sponsors a subset of these observations,\nbut many\nprojects sponsored\nby the NASA Research and Application\nProgram, other government\nagencies and the\ninternational\nocean color research community all make major contributions\nto the global multi-year effort.\nThe SIMBIOS\nProject has undertaken\nthe challenge\nof coordinating\nthe in situ observations\ncontributed\nby these various programs, linking it to ocean color imagery from the international\nensemble of\nsatellite\nsensors,\nand making the overall data sets available\nto the ocean color research\ncommunity\n(McClain and Fargion 1999a, 1999b). A workable strategy to meet those challenges\nfirst requires a clear\ndefinition\nof the observations,\nuncertainties,\nand data collection protocols\nassociated\nwith each type of\nactivity. The purpose of this document is to clarify these requirements.\n\n1.8 PROTOCOL\n\nDOCUMENT\n\nThe chapters of this document\n\nORGANIZATION\n\nare organized into 4 parts"\n\n1.\n\nThe first 3 chapters are introductory\nin nature.\nChapter 1 introduces perspectives\non ocean\ncolor research and validation,\nChapter 2 provides fundamental\ndefinitions\nand conventions\nused throughout the document, and Chapter 3 defines requirements\nfor in situ observations.\n\n2.\n\nChapters 4 through\n8 address\nthe characteristics\nand performance\nspecifications\nof\ninstruments\nused for in situ observation,\nand provide protocols\nfor their calibration\ncharacterization.\nChapter\n4 provides\nan overview\nof instrument\nspecifications\ncharacterization,\ntogether with brief protocol descriptions\nfor instrument\ntypes that are\ncovered by a separate chapter.\n\n3.\n\nChapters 9 through 17 provide detailed protocols describing methods for making\nfield measurement\nand associated\ndata analysis.\nChapter 9 provides\nan\nmeasurement\nand data analysis topics, together with protocols for measurements\ncovered by a separate chapter.\n\n4.\n\nFinally, Chapter\n18 addresses\ncontrol procedures.\n\nthe methods\n\nand procedures\n\nfor data\n\narchival\n\nthe\nand\nand\nnot\n\neach type of\noverview\nof\nthat are not\n\nand quality\n\nREFERENCES\nBarnes, R.

As the\nscope and breadth of chapter authorship has expanded, authors new to the protocols have introduced variant\nterminology\nand conventions\nthat pose an increasingly burdensome\neditorial task. It is hoped that by\ncollecting the most common aspects of this topic in one place as a source guide for authors and co-authors\nof protocol chapters, a more uniform usage and terminology\nmay result.\nAs with all chapters of the\nprotocols, it is fully expected that, in the future, this first attempt will be significantly revised and improved\nthrough constructive criticism and suggestions from the ocean color research community\nat large.\nIn\nparticular, the present chapter does not yet address important fundamental\nquantities,\nconcepts and\nrelationships of atmospheric optics, as they relate to ocean color science. This omission results purely from\na lack of adequate time, within the scheduie for publication of the protocol document (Revision 3), to write\nthis important topic and it will be added in the next revision.\n\n2.2 GEOMETRY\nRemote\n\nSensing\n\nFigure\n\nCoordinate\n\n2.1 illustrates\n\nfrom direction\n\nan arbitrary\n\nS, a unit-length\n\nthe origin from direction\nnotation\n\nSystem\n\nvector\n\nI) oriented\n\nCartesian\n\ncoordinate\n\nsystem,\n\noriented at (zenith, azimuth)\nat (0, 0O).

In ocean optics, it may ordinarily be assumed that mattering is azimuthally\nthe coordinate\nreference of Fig. 2, so that one need not consider _ dependence of scattering.\n\nScattering\n\nisotropic\n\nin\n\nAngle Invariance\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that the relationship\nof the scattering angle W to the angular orientation\nof the scattered\n(viewing) path relative to the transmission\npath is identical in Figures\n2.1 and 2.2.\nDetermining\nu? is simpler and more intuitive in the representation\nof Figure 2.2, when the origin and\norientation\nof the transmission\npath are held fixed, and only the direction from which the origin is viewed\n\n11\n\nOcean ptics rotocols\nO\nP\nforSatellite cean olor ensor\nO\nC S\nValidation,\nRevision\n3\nvaries. orasatellite\nF\nremotelyensed colorimage,\ns\nocean\nonthe\nother and,\nh\nboththesource\n(transmission)\nand\nsensor\n(viewing)\ndirections\nchange\ncontinuously\nfrompixel opixel,and is more\nt\nit\nconvenient\ntoplace\ntheorigin\nateach\npixel(Figure .1) determineusing (2.5).\n2 and\nqJ\nPlane and Solid Angles\nIn plane geometry,\nquantities\nare represented\nin 2-dimensional\nCartesian\n(x, y), or polar\ncoordinates.\nThe natural measure of angular distance in plane coordinates\nis the tad/an,\ndefined\nangle subtending\nan arc of unit length\nThere are 2re radians in a full circle.

The AOP are measurements\nof the vector light field in the sea, as\ndetermined by the surface illumination boundary conditions (the part of the downward radiance field at\ndepth z = 0- that is transmitted\nthrough the surface from above) and the IOP. The bidirectional\ncharacter of\nthe ocean\'s remote sensing reflectance,\nwhich results from interaction of surface boundary conditions and\nthe IOP, is examined in detail in Chapter 13.\n\nCoefficients\n\nof Absorption,\n\nConsider\n\na narrow\n\nF_ (_,), I.tW nm 4,\nover a distance\n\nScattering\n\ncollimated\n\nincident\n\nand Beam Attenuation\n\nbeam,\n\nnormal\n\nof cross-sectional\n\nto the xy-plane\n\nAz along the z-axis 2, a fraction\n\ndirections,\n\nor. particles,\n\nanother\n\nand the remaining\n\nfraction\n\nfraction\n\nat the origin of Figure\n\nA(k)=_\n\no,,,\nmolecules,\n\narea Aa, of monochromatic\n2.2.\n\nwill interact\n\nspectral\n\nenergy\n\nflux\n\nAs the flux is transmitted\n\nwith and be absorbed\n\nby water\n\nFB( )\n\nt_[_,)=F"_\n\nwill be scattered\n\nT(_,) = Fr (_------_) be transmitted\nwill\n\nout\n\nthrough\n\nof the\n\nbeam\n\nthe volume\n\ninto\n\nother\n\nAaAz cmZm\n\nThe dimensionless\nfractions A(L), B(_.), and T(L) are, respectively,\nthe spectral absorptance,\nspectra/\nscatterance, and spectral transmittance\nof the medium (e.g., MoNey 1994): If there are no other sources in\nthe medium,\n\nA(2_)+B(_)+T(_,)\n\n= 1, and in the limits Aa --) 0 and Az --->0, we may write\n\nlim lim_Fr(_\')-Fi(_)=\n_-,0_-,0[\nAaAz\nSince by definition\n\nE(L)=-_-_,\n\nA(_\')+B(_\')F-_--_\').},l.tWcm\'2nm-lm-I\nAz\n\n(2.16) may be written in differential\n\n(2.16)\n\nform in terms of incident spectral\n\nirradiance as\n\naei\n\n(3")=-[a(_)+b(2_)]Ei\ndz\n\nwhere\nvolume\n\na (_.) is the spectral\nscattering\n\ncoefficient\n\nvolume\n\nabsorption\n\nb (_.) = lim B (k)\n_0--_--\'\n\n(L)=-c(_.)Ej\n\ncoefficient\n\n(_.), gW cm\'2nm\'lm "1,\n\na (3.) = lira A (_.)\naz-,o Az\n\nm4, and c(_.)\n\nis the spectral\n\n(2.17)\n\nre.l, b (_.) is the spectral\n\nvolume\n\nbeam attenuation\n\ncoefficient,\nc(_)=a(_,)+b(_,),\n\nm".\n\n(2.18)\n\n2 In the present context, the variable z in Fig. 2.2 does not correspond to depth in the water column, as it\ndoes elsewhere throughout this document.\nIn Fig. 2.2 and the introduction of IOP, the z-axis defines only\nthe direction of the optical path of radiant flux transmitted\nfrom the collimated source to "detector 1", and\nthe angular orientation\nof the coordinate\nframe in the medium is arbitrary and irrelevant.\n\n16\n\nOcean\n\nThe Volume\n\nOptics Protocols\n\nScattering\n\nThe directional\n\nfrom the volume\n\nfor Satellite\n\nOcean Color Sensor\n\nValidation,\n\nRevision\n\n3\n\nFunction\nscatterance\n\nB(L,W,O)-\n\nFs (_,,_d,Cp)\nF_ (_.)\n\nAaAz into a solid angle increment\n\nis the fraction\n\nAD centered\n\nof incident\n\nin direction\n\nradiant\n\n(_F,_).\n\nflux scattered\n\nRecall\n\nthat\n\n_F = 0\n\nin the coordinate frame of Figure 2.2.

The variables\nare\n\ngrouped, in Table 3.1, into four related groups: Radiometric\nQuantities\n(both oceanic and atmospheric),\nInherent Optical Properties\n(IOP) of sea water, Biogeochemical\nand Bit-Optical\nProperties of sea water,\nand Ancillary\nData and Metadata\nrequired\nto support\nthe use, analysis,\ninterpretation,\nand quality\nassessment of the other data. Those in situ variables that are measured are classified into three categories\nof descending\npriority.\nThe first category of measurements,\nflagged "Required"\nin Table 3.1, is the minimum subset required\nfor validating\na satellite\nsensor\'s\nradiometric\nperformance,\nexact normalized\nwater-leaving\nradiances\n(Chapter\n13), and fundamental\nderived products,\nincluding chlorophyll\na concentration,\naerosol optical\nthickness, and K(490), and for associated algorithm development\nand validation.\nThe second category, flagged "Highly Desired" in Table 3.1, are measurements\nthat supplement\nminimum\nsubset and are needed for investigations\nfocused on atmospheric\ncorrection\nalgorithms\naerosols, relationships\nbetween IOP and remote sensing reflectance, and/or Case 3 algorithms.\n\nthe\nand\n\nThe third category, flagged "Specialized Measurement"\nin Table 3.1, are measurements\nwhich either\naddress\naspects of ocean bit-optics\nthat are secondary\nto satellite remote sensing, or require highly\nspecialized\nequipment that is not readily available to the community at large.\nA fourth category, flagged as "Derived", comprises key quantities that are either calculated from the in\nsitu measurements,\nor are derived from models.\nThe above set of variables is also listed in Table 3.2, to\nidentify the satellite ocean color sensor application for which each measurement\nis needed. Table 3.2 also\nprovides an index of the protocol chapters addressing each in situ measurement.\n\n3.2 RADIOMETRIC\nSurface\nE_ (z,X),\n\nincident\nand upwelled\n\nQUANTITIES\n\nspectral\nspectral\n\nirradiance\nradiance,\n\nin air,\n\nEs(_.)-Ed(0\xc3\xb7,_.),\n\ndownwelled\n\n_ (z, X), are the fundamental\n\nmeasurable\n\nspectral\nquantities\n\nirradiance,\nneeded\n\nto\n\nderive\nnormalized\nwater-leaving\nradiances\n(or equivalently\nremote sensing\nreflectance)\nin most\ncircumstances.\nOther radiometric properties listed in Table 3.1, including sky radiance and normal solar\nirradiance, are also important in situ measurements in the SIMBIOS ocean color validation program.\nAlso\nlisted are critical radiometric\nquantities that are calculated, or derived, from in situ measurements.\nIn some\ncases, listed radiometric\nquantities\nmay be derived, wholly or in part, from other non-radiometric\nmeasurements\nlisted in the table.

These data may also be used to calibrate continuous profiles\nof in situ fluorescence.\nChlorophyll a and pheopigment\nconcentrations\nwill also be determined using the\nfluorometric\nmethod\n(Chapter 17).\nThe HPLC chlorophyll a concentrations\nare more accurate than\nfluorometric\nconcentrations,\nwhich are often biased systematically\nthroughout a particular geographic\nregion and time of year. On the other hand, fluorometric measurements of chlorophyll a concentration\nare\nboth far easier and less expensive to perform, allowing a far greater number of pigment validation samples\nto be acquired on a given cruise than if HPLC sampling were used alone. If a well-distributed\nsubset of\npigment filter samples from each validation cruise are reserved for HPLC measurements, it is possible and\noperationally\neffective\nto derive regional and temporal corrections to scale fluorometric\nand HPLC\nchlorophyll a concentrations into close agreement.\nPhycobiiipigments,\npresent in cyanobacteria\nand cryptophytes, are treated separately from the HPLC\nfat-soluble\npigments.\nPhycoerythrin and phycocyanin\nare the two major groups of phycobilipigments\nfound in the marine environment.\nThe concentration of these water-soluble pigments is important due to\nthe contribution\nof solar stimulated phycoerythrin\nfluorescence to the underwater light field, and also to\ncharacterize the phytoplankton population.\nAt times, species that contain phycobilipigment\ncan account for\na large fraction of the primary productivity (especially in oligotrophic waters) and have been difficult to\nquantify due to their small size. Although neither SeaWiFS nor MODIS contains bands at the absorption or\nfluorescence peaks of phycobilipigments,\nfuture satellite ocean color sensors, including GLI and MERIS\nwill have\nappropriate\nhands.\nThe present\nprotocols\ndo not specify\nmethods\nfor measuring\nphycobilipigments,\nbut qualitative concentrations\nmay be obtained today using a fluorometric approach,\nand a new capillary electrophoresis\nmethod is currently under development (C. Kinkade, personal comm.).\nA new chapter giving protocols for measuring this important group of phytoplankton pigments may emerge\nin the near future.\nCoccolith concentration,\nwhich is the number density of small plates (coccoliths) composed of calcium\ncarbonate (CaCO3), is very important to light scattering.\nCoccoliths are produced in copious amounts by\n\n32\n\nOcean Optics Protocols\n\nfor Satellite\n\nOcean Color Sensor Validation,\n\nRevision\n\n3\n\nmarine phytoplankton\ncalled coccolithophorids.\nScattering of light by coccoliths\nis highly apparent in\nvisible wavelength\nsatellite imagery, because they perturb the usual relationships\nbetween water-leaving\nradiances and pigment concentration,\nand therefore, adversely impact atmospheric corrections\n(Balch et al.\n1991, Voss et al. 1998). Additionally,\ncoccolith formation, sinking, and dissolution are significant\nfactors\nin the ocean carbon flux budget.\nIt is, therefore, necessary to measure coccolith concentration,\nboth as\nnumber density and CaCO3 concentration,\nto aid in 1) the correction\nof chlorophyll\na concentration\nalgorithms, 2) coccolith algorithm development,\nand 3) atmospheric correction development\nand validation.\nThis present version (3.0) of the ocean optics protocols does not cover methods for measuring\ncoccolith\nconcentration.\nSuch protocols may be included in a future revision.\nTotal Suspended Matter (SPM) measurements\nare required to assess the effect of suspended\nsediment\non the derived products.\nSPM is of primary importance\nin coastal waters, where simple radiance ratio\nalgorithms\nfor SPM have uncertainties\nequivalent to, or greater than, those for estimating\nchlorophyll-like\npigment concentration.\nOrganic suspended\nmatter and inorganic\nsuspended\nmatter concentrations\nare\nfractions of SPM; this partitioning\nof SPM is particularly useful in process studies.\nContinuous\nuseful\n\nprofile\n\nas guidarice\n\nK d (z, X),\n\nmeasurements\n\nin analyzing\n\nK L (z,_.),\n\nand K u (z,_.),\n\nof in situ chlorophyll\n\nprofiles\n\nof\n\nrespectively.\n\nE a (z,_.),\n\na fluorescence\n\nL_(z,_),\n\nMoreover\n\nand\n\nintensity\n\nE u (z,_.)\n\nif these profiles\n\nare exceptionally\n\nto derive\n\nare viewed\n\nprofiles\n\nof\n\nin real time, they\n\nare also useful guides for taking water samples at depths that allow the vertical structure\nof pigment\nconcentration\nprofiles to be accurately\nresolved in the top optical depth and to determine\nsubsurface\nmaxima in chlorophyll\nconcentration.\nFinally, the continuous\nin situ chlorophyll\na fluorescence\nprofile\nmay be used to interpolate HPLC, or extracted fluorescence,\nmeasurements\nof chlorophyll\na concentrations\nfrom water samples at discrete depths. It is desirable to make these measurements\nsimultaneously\nwith IOP\nprofiles, and also those of irradiance\nand radiance if it can be done in a way to avoid self-shading\nof the\nradiometers.\n\n3.5 ANCILLARY\n\nDATA\n\nAND METADATA\n\nThe geographic location and time at which in situ validation data are acquired are essential information\nthat must be included in every data subn_ssion under the SIMBIOS program. The obvious metadata items\nin this context are latitude, longitude, date and time (UTC).\nExpressing date and time in UTC is also\nessential, even though it may be helpful to also list local date and time with a validation station\'s metadata.\nToo often, field investigators neglect to identify (or possibly\ndata-logging computer to enter time into data records.\nSea state,\nmeasurements.\n\neven keep track of) the time zone used by a\n\nexpressed\nas significant\nwave height in m, must be reported with in situ validation\nWhitecap conditions, expressed as the estimated fractional area covered, are also useful and\n\nhighly desired. Digital photographs\ndocumenting surface wave and whitecap conditions during radiometric\nmeasurements\nare also helpful. This information is essential for identifying measurements\nmade under\nquestionable environmental\nconditions.\nWind speed and direction are required to generate, through models, estimates of the surface wave slope\ndistribution, which will be used to calculate reflected skylight and sun glint in radiative transfer models\n(Cox and Munk 1954).\nWind speed is an essential parameter for computing exact normalized\nwaterleaving radiance from measured water leaving radiance emerging from the ocean at zenith angles greater\nthan\n\n25 \xc2\xb0 (Chapter\n\n13).\n\nSurface\n\nwave models\n\ndriven by wind\n\nvelocity\n\nmay also be used\n\nto provide\n\nquantitative estimates of surface wave induced radiometric fluctuations.\nQualitatively, wind velocity,\nphotographs or videotape recordings of sea state, will be useful for assessing station data quality.\n\nand\n\nSurface barometric\npressure\nmeasurements\nare required to validate both atmospheric\ncorrection\nalgorithms and the surface pressures derived from operational weather analyses for use in processing\nsatellite ocean color data\nCloud cover (expressed as fractional coverage in octals, or percent) is essential metadata\nused for\nassessing\ndata quality and screening questionable cases from algorithm development\nand validation\nanalyses.\nA description of sky conditions near the sun and satellite zenith and azimuth angles, including\n\n33\n\nOcean\nOptics rotocols\nP\nforSatellite ceanolor\nO\nC\nwhether the sun is obscured during observations,\nalso useful, as are photographs\nof sky conditions.\n\nSensor\n\nis also important\n\nValidation,\n\ninformation.\n\nSecchi depth measurements\nare required for real-time\nassessment\nstation and as a quality check during analysis of radiometric profiles.\nWater depth,\nbottom reflections\n\nRevision\n\nCloud\n\nof water\n\nz in m, is important information\nfor screening\ndata from\nmay be present in water-leaving\nradiance measurements.\n\n3\n\ntype information\n\ntransparency\n\nshallow\n\nwater\n\nis\n\nduring\n\ncases\n\na\n\nwhere\n\nHydrographic\ndata, water temperature\n(T), and salinity (S), derived from conductivity,\ntemperature,\nand depth (CTD) profiles, are useful for characterizing\nthe physical water mass regime in which an optical\nprofile is measured.\nA T-S characterization\nis especially\nimportant near ocean fronts and eddies where\ninterleaving\nwater masses of very different\nbiogeochemicaI\ncomposition,\nand therefore\nfundamentally\ndifferent bit-optical\nproperties,\ncan produce complex spatial and temporal patterns of near-surface\noptical\nproperties.\nIn these circumstances,\nT-S profiles can provide an indication\nof whether a station location is\nsuitable for reliable remote sensing validation and algorithm development\ncomparisons.\nThe T(z) and S(z)\nmeasurements\nare also needed for corrections to pure water absorption in processing IOP measurements.\n\n3.6 PROCESS\n\nMODEL\n\nRELATED\n\nDATA\n\nOther types of in situ measurements\nare also important in the context\nof ocean color validation,\nbecause they are needed either to support, or validate, process models that are derived with the aid of ocean\ncolor image data. Primary productivity models are, perhaps, the foremost example of these secondary\nproducts of satellite ocean color measurements.\nThe in situ measurements\nneeded to support such models,\nand other scientific investigations\nand applications\nthat may exploit\nocean color data products, are\nundeniably important and closely related to the quantities listed in Table 3.1. These measurements\nare not,\nhowever, essential to algorithm development and validation of products derived from the ocean color data\ndirectly. In the future, the scope of the ocean optics protocols may be expanded to embrace methods for\nmeasuring and/or analyzing some of these variables, but at present they are not included. Some of the more\nimportant measurements of this class are briefly described in this section, but none of them are discussed in\ndetail.\nAerosol concentration\nsamples using high volume techniques will be useful, in conjunction\nwith\naerosol optical depth spectra determined from sun photometer measurements,\nfor chemical, size, and\nabsorption characterization\nof aerosols, especially in studies of the effects of Saharan and Asian dust clouds\non atmospheric corrections.\nParticulates,\nboth Particulate Organic Carbon (POC) and Particulate Organic Nitrogen (PON), are\nrequired for process studies to help characterize\nthe adaptive state of phytoplankton\nand to inventory\ncritical biogeochemical\nelements.\nDissolved\nOrganic Carbon (DOC) has been shown to be a major pool of carbon in the oceans.\nQuantification of the transformations\nof this pool is crucial to understanding the marine carbon cycle. The\nColored Dissolved Organic Material (CDOM) fraction of the DOC is highly absorbent in the blue range,\nthus decreasing blue water-leaving\nradiances, and it must be taken into consideration\nfor pigment\nconcentration algorithms.\nDOC measurements\nare needed to develop robust relationships between CDOM\nand DOC, which are needed to evaluate the usefulness of ocean color observations _for estimating\nDOC\nconcentrations.\nCDOM concentrations\nare required to assess the effect of Gelbstoff on blue water-leaving\nradiances\nand chlorophyll\nconcentration.\nThis is of primary importance in case 2 waters, but is also relevant to\nphytoplankton degradation products in case 1 waters.\nHumic and fulvic acids comprise the bulk of CDOM and have different specific spectral absorption\ncoefficients.\nTheir concentrations\nare useful for determining the correction used for phytoplankton\npigment\nconcentration\nalgorithms in case 2 waters and for estimating CDOM from ocean color observations.\nParticle\nsize spectra are very useful for in-water\nmeasurements include particles smaller than 1 _m.\n\n34\n\nradiative\n\ntransfer\n\ncalculations,\n\nparticularly\n\nif\n\nOcean\n\nOptics Protocols\n\nfor Satellite\n\nParticle fluorescence,\nmeasured\nusing laser\ncalculate particle scattering-to-fluorescence\nratios\n(both phyto- and zooplankton).\n\nOcean Color Sensor Validation,\n\nRevision\n\n3\n\nsources in single-cell\nflow systems, may be used to\nfor evaluating the population structure of the plankton\n\nPhytoplankton\nspecies counts are important\nbecause species-to-species\nvariability\nin optical\nand\nphysiological\nproperties\nrepresents\na major source of variability\nin bio-optical\nalgorithms\nand primary\nproductivity\nmodels.\nThis has been recognized,\nbut it is generally ignored in remote sensing algorithms\ndue to the tedious nature of species enumeration,\nthe small sizes of many species, and the large number of\nspecies involved.\nThis information,\nhowever,\nat various levels of rigor, is useful in evaluating\nthe\npopulation\nand pigment\ncomposition.\nThis is especially\nimportant\nfor some groups,\nsuch as\ncoccolithophorids.\nPrimary productivity,\nusing the radioactive\nisotope _4C estimation method, is not strictly required for\nvalidation\nof water-leaving\nradiances\nor system initialization.\nIt is a MODIS product and will be a\nSeaWiFS product in the future. It will, moreover, be extremely\nuseful for process study applications\nof\nocean color data if these measurements\nare made at the same time that the water column optical properties\nare determined.\nThese data will aid in the development\nof models of primary production\nusing satellite\nocean color observations,\na goal which is central to all global ocean color mission.\nOf special importance\nare determinations\nof key photo-physiological\nparameters\nderived\nfrom production\nmeasurements\nas\nfunctions\nof irradiance.\nIf _4C productivity\nmeasurements\nare made, they should conform to the JGOFS\nCore Measurements\nProtocols (UNESCO\n1994).\n\nREFERENCES\nAustin, R.W., and T.J.

The uncertainty\nbudgets of in situ measurements\nused for comparisons\nare obvious critical factors in such validation\nanalyses, as also are details and uncertainties of critical design and performance characteristics\nof the\ninstruments with which they are measured.\nThis and the next several chapters specify appropriate instrument characteristics and describe accepted\nlaboratory procedures for characterizing instruments to determine and verify their compliance with those\nspecifications.\nDetailed characterization and calibration protocols for radiometers and sun photometers are\nprovided in Chapters 5, 6 and 7. The status of each of these chapters, and topic areas in each where future\nadvances and/or changes may be appropriate, are discussed briefly in sections 4.2 through 4.5.\nA\nshortcoming\nof the present protocols\nis that a similarly in-depth treatment is not provided\nfor\ncharacterization\nand calibration of instruments used to measure inherent optical properties (lOP).\nThe\ncurrent state of the art regarding IOP instrument calibration is briefly abstracted below in Section 4.6. This\ndocument does not provide detailed methods for calibrating meteorological\nsensors, CTD instruments,\npressure transducers,\nand other ancillary sensors.\nSections 4.7 through 4.9 emphasize\nthe importance of\nusing properly calibrated sensors to make these important supporting measurements,\nbut a well-established\ninfrastructure for these calibration services exists within the general oceanographic\nand atmospheric\ncommunities.\n\n4.2 INSTRUMENT\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\nChapter 5 provides detailed specifications\nfor performance-related\ncharacteristics of radiometers, and\nother types of instruments, that measure in situ variables used to validate satellite ocean color sensors,\nalgorithms and derived products. The specifications\nin this revision (3.0) to the protocols are unchanged\nfrom those in Revision 2 (Fargion and Mueller 2000).\nTime constraints and conflicting schedule demands of key individuals precluded adequate communitywide review, debate and refinement of specifications\nin a few areas where instrument development\nhas\nprogressed significantly.\nTopic areas that should be reviewed thoroughly in preparation of this chapter for\nRevision\n3 of the Ocean Optics Protocols\n(2001)\ninclude specifications\nof performance-related\ncharacteristics of:\n1.\n\nhyperspectral\nradiance and irradiance spectrometers\nbased on miniature fiber-optic monochromators;\nand\n\n2.\n\ninstruments\n\nused to measure\n\nIOP (absorption,\n\n39\n\n(but see Chapter\n\n1 I), especially\n\nbeam attenuation and backscattering)\n\nthose\n\nin situ.\n\nOcean Optics Protocols\n\nfor Satellite\n\nOcean Color Sensor Validation,\n\n4.3 CHARACTERIZATION\nOF OCEANOGRAPHIC\nATMOSPHERIC\nRADIOMETERS\n\nRevision\n\n3\n\nAND\n\nThe procedures given here in Chapter 6 are essentially those from Mueller and Austin (1995). Changes\nand additions primarily reflect results and lessons learned from the SeaWiFS Intercomparison\nRoundRobin Experiment (SIRREX) series (e.g. Mueller et al. 1996; Johnson et aL 1996) and deal primarily with\nmethods for transferring the NIST scale of spectral irradiance from an FEL lamp source to the responsivity\nscales of oceanographic\nand atmospheric radiometers.\nThe SIMBIOS and SeaWiFS Project Offices are\ncontinuing\nthe SIRREX, now SIMBIOS\nRadiometric\nIntercalibration\n(SIMR.IC),\nseries to assure\nmaintenance\nof consistent radiometric calibration\nuncertainties throughout\nthe community\n(Riley and\nBailey 1998; G. Meister, personal comm.) and for better determination of, e.g., quantitative uncertainties\nassociated with radiance calibrations using Spectralon plaques (S. Hooker, pers. comm.).\nThe Chapter 6 protocols recommend experimental\ndetermination of immersion\nfactors for every\nindividual underwater irradiance collector. In Mueller and Austin (1995), it was suggested\nthat immersion\nfactors determined for a prototype irradiance collector could be used for other radiance collectors of the\nsame size, design and material specifications.\nThe results of Mueller (1995) demonstrated that individual\ndeviations between collectors of the same design, size and materials may be as large as 8 %, with a 3 %\nRoot-Mean-Square\n(RMS) uncertainty for the group of such instruments tested. Using replicated tests and\nvariations in setup configuration\nfor each instrument tested, the experimental uncertainty associated\nwith\nthe immersion factor characterization procedure was shown to be less than 1% (Mueller 1995). Topic areas\nin Chapter 6 that should be reviewed and considered for possible inclusion in Revision 4 (2002) include:\nI.\n\nMethods for applying to ocean radiometers (K. Carder and R. Steward, pers. comm.) the sunbased methods used in the atmospheric radiation community for calibrating sun photometers\n(Chapter 7 of these protocols; Schmid et al. 1998) and other radiometers (Biggar 1998). In\nthis regard, the question\n\nof continuing\n\nto use the Neckel and Labs (1984)\n\nan alternative such as that of Thuillier\ndiscussion in Chapter 2).\n\net aL (1998),\n\nwill become\n\ncritically\n\nfro ($) spectrum,\nimportant\n\nor\n\n(see the\n\n2.\n\nUncertainty budgets associated with the use of Spectralon reflectance plaques for calibrating\nradiance sensors continue to be inadequately understood, a difficulty noted during the last\nSIMtLIC exercise (G. Meister, personal comm.).\n\n3.\n\nImproved methods for characterizing stray-light, spectral calibration,\nand slit responses\nin\nmonochromator\nbased hyperspectral\nspectrometers, which are increasingly being adopted and\nused within the ocean color research community. The innovative recent application, by NIST,\nof integrating-sphere\nsources illuminated by tunable LASERs to this problem represents a\nmajor advance (Chapters 6 and 11).\n\n4.4\nCALIBRATION\nRADIANCE\nSENSORS\n\nOF\n\nSUN\n\nPHOTOMETERS\n\nAND\n\nSKY\n\nChapter 7 is not significantly changed from Revision 2 (Mueller and Fargion 2000), where it appeared\nfor the first time as Chapter 6. The calibration and characterization of sun photometers and sky radiance\nsensors was covered very briefly in Mueller and Austin (I995), and no detailed method descriptions were\nprovided. These Chapter 7 protocols are based on the methods developed within the atmospheric radiation\ncommunity,\nand by the AERONET Project at GSFC and its collaborating institutions around the world.\nProtocols for calibrating Shadowband Radiometers are also new to the Ocean Optics Protocols. There is\nsome overlap between Chapters 5 and 6, but the redundancies are not a serious drawback.\n\n4.5 STABILITY\nMONITORING\nPORTABLE\nSOURCES\n\nOF FIELD\n\nRADIOMETERS\n\nUSING\n\nMueller and Austin (1995) recommended the development and use of portable standards to verify the\nstability of radiometers during deployment\non research cruises, or other field deployments,\nof several\n\n40\n\nOcean ptics rotocols\nO\nP\nforSatellite\nOcean olor\nC Sensor\nValidation,\nRevision\n3\nweeks uration.\nd\nTheseeneral\ng\nrecommendations\n\nwere based on limited experience\nwith prototype analog\nsources developed by Austin and his colleagues in the 1980\'s at the Scripps Visibility Laboratory.\nSince\n1995, joint research by investigators\nat NIST and GSFC developed\na much-improved\nprototype\nof a\nportable source, the SeaWiFS Quality Monitor (SQM), suitable for shipboard use (Johnson et al. 1998) and\ndemonstrated\nits ability to verify stability of radiometers\nwith an uncertainty\n< 1% (Hooker and Aiken\n1998). Subsequently,\nless expensive versions of the SQM have been developed and become commercially\navailable.\nChapter 8 (formerly\nChapter 7 in Fargion\nand Mueller 2000) provides\na review of this\ndevelopment,\ndetailed protocols for using SQM devices in the field, and uncertainty budgets.\n\n4.6 CALIBRATION\nSENSORS\n\nOF INHERENT\n\nOPTICAL\n\nPROPERTY\n\nMany significant improvements\nhave been made, over the last five years, in the development\nand\nunderstanding of instruments used to measure inherent optical properties (IOP).\nToday, in situ profile\ndeterminations of the coefficients of absorption a(z,_,), beam attenuation c(z,_) and backscattering\nbb(z,_,) -1\nall in m - are almost routinely made and reported by many investigators in the ocean optics and ocean\ncolor remote sensing communities.\nHowever, key members of the IOP community continue an active\ndebate on the relative merits of alternative design characteristics\nof, and methods for calibrating and using,\nthese first and second-generation\ninstruments. In the case of some instruments and measurements,\ne.g. the\nAC9 absorption and beam attenuation meters (see below), a de facto consensus is emerging on methods and\nuncertainty budgets. In these cases, it remains only to draft protocols and pass it though a critical review by\nthe community; a focused workshop is often the surest way to do this quickly.\nIn other cases, technical\nquestions and valid criticisms remain to be answered before protocols can be distilled from various\nproposed methods; additional research to sort out uncertainties is clearly needed here.\nThe present version of the Ocean Optics Protocols does not provide complete protocols, or even\nprovisional\nprotocols,\nfor either in situ measurements\nof IOP, or calibration\nof IOP instruments.\nIt is\nplanned to remedy that omission in a future revision of this document by including new chapters on in situ\nmeasurements\nof absorption, beam attenuation and backscattering.\nFor the present, however, the closest\nthing to protocols are the methods and calibrations specified by instrument manufacturers, a few published\njournal articles, and informal instructions and reference materials provided via the world-wide\nweb by a\nfew recognized experts in various aspects of IOP measurements.\nPure Water Absorption\n\nand Scattering\n\nCoefficients\n\nThe recommend values for the volume absorption coefficients of pure water, aw(_,) m"l, are those of\nSogandares\nand Fry (1997) for wavelengths\nbetween 340 nm and 380 nrn, Pope and Fry (1997) for\nwavelengths\nbetween 380 nm and 700 nm, and Smith and Baker (1981) for wavelengths\nbetween 700 nm\nand 800 nm. The recommended values for the volume scattering coefficients\nof pure water, bw(_,) in m "1,\nare those of Morel (1974).\n\nSingle-Wavelenth\n\nTransmissometers\n\nRelatively simple single-wavelength\n(usually near 660 nm) transmissometers\nhave been in widespread\nuse for two decades.\nAlthough the beam attenuation coefficients\nc(z,660) obtained with these devices are\nno longer state of the art measurements,\nthe profiles\nof this variable\nconcentrations\nof suspended particles.\nProtocols for using these instruments\nMueller and Austin (1995).\n\nare strongly\ncorrelated\nwith\nare unchanged\nfrom those in\n\nThe manufacturer\nfirst calibrates\na transmissometer\nof this type by measuring\nits response\nin pure\nwater.\nHe also measures the open and blocked (dark) sensor responses in air and records these as factory\nair calibration\ncoefficients.\nThe user must perform air calibrations\nin the field. When transmissometer\nprofiles are analysed (Chapter 9), the field and factory air calibrations are used to compensate\nfor drift in\nthe instrument\'s\nsensitivity over time.\nThe windows on the beam transmissometer\nmust be cleaned with lens cleaner or a mild detergent\nsolution and a soft cloth or tissue, rinsed with distilled water, then rinsed with isopropyl alcohol and wiped\n\n41\n\nOcean ptics rotocols\nO\nP\nforSatellite cean Sensor\nO Color\nValidation,\nRevision\n3\ndry.Anapproximate calibration\nair\n\nreading should be made before every cast to verify that the windows\nare clean.\nA transmissometer\ndark voltage should also be measured\nat this time.\nThese on-deck air\ncalibrations\nare not, however, very reliable measures of temporal drift or degradation\nin the instrument\'s\nsource or detector.\nIn the humid, or even wet, environment\non the deck of a ship, the windows are often\nquickly obscured by condensation,\nand the glass also tends to absorb enough water to affect transmission\nslightly (Zaneveld pers. comm.).\nA very careful air calibration should be performed\nbefore and after each\ncruise under dry laboratory conditions.\nDuring an extended cruise, it is also recommended\nto remove the\ninstrument to a dry location in a shipboard laboratory,\nand after allowing several hours for the windows\ndehydrate,\na careful air calibration\nshould be performed.\nOnly the laboratory\nair calibrations\nshould\nused in the final processing of beam transmissometer\ndata.\nBoth the laboratory\ncondition air calibration\nand dark voltages, and the factory calibration\nassume the data acquisition system measures instrument response as true volts.

In the absorption part of the instrument, a beam of light passes through the center of\na tube having a reflective wall that redirects most scattered photons into the forward direction toward a\nlarge detector which fills the exit cross section; only those photons that are either absorbed, or scaRe_red in\nthe backward direction, are attenuated.\nBecause the backscattering\nby marine particles is a small fraction\nof their total scattering, it is possible to model this contribution\nand subtract it to obtain a(k) within a\nreasonable uncertainty.\nThese devices may also be used to measure absorption\nby CDOM ifa 0.4 Ixm filter\nis inserted in the instrument\'s\nintake port. Since the beam attenuation coefficient\nis the sum of absorption\nand scattering, i.e.\nc()_)=a(X)+b()_),\nit is also possible to determine\nvalues of c(Z,) and a(_,).\nPerhaps\n\nthe best known\n\nthe total scattering\n\nexample\n\ncoefficient\n\nm",\n\n(4.2)\n\nb(_,) as the difference\n\nof this class of instruments\n\nbetween\n\nthe measured\n\nis the AC9, which uses interference\n\nfilters\n\nto measure a(X,) and c(_,) at 9 wavelengths.\nThe AC9 is manufactured\nby WetLABS\nof Philomath,\nOR.\nAlternative\ninstrument designs are also commercially\navailable, e.g. from HOBILABS\nof Moss Landing,\nCA and other manufacturers.\nThese protocols make no recommendations\nregarding specific manufacturers\nor instruments,\nand examples of specific instruments\nare included here only for purposes of illustrating\ngeneral characteristics\nand procedures.\nThe instrument\nmanufacturer\nperforms\ntwo factory\ncalibration\nprocedures\nto first determine\nthe\ninstrument\'s\ntemperature dependence,\nand second to record its response when optically clean water is being\nmeasured.\nTo obtain good data, it is absolutely\nessential to repeat this second calibration measurement\nfrequently (typically once per day) in the field. Protocols for carrying out calibrations\nare provided by each\ninstrument\'s\nmanufacturer.\nAdditional protocols\nfor calibrating the AC9, expanding\non methods described\n\n42\n\nOcean ptics rotocols\nO\nP\nforSatellite\nOcean olor ensor\nC S\nValidation,\nRevision\n3\ninTwardowskial.\net\n\n(1999), and other IOP instruments have been developed by the Optical Oceanography\nGroup at Oregon State University\nand may be accessed via hnp://photon.oce.orst.edu/(S.\nPegau, Pers.\nComm).\nPerhaps the most challenging\naspects of these protocols deal with methods for using reverseosmosis filtration systems to obtain optically pure water in the field, and with procedures\nto verify the\noptical purity of the water.\n\nBackscattering\n\nMeters\n\nThere is little historic data on the variation of the shape of the volume scattering function\n_(W,_,), in the backward\ndirection.\nPetzold (1972) described\nthe scattering function for selected\n\n(VSF),\nnatural\n\nwaters measured with the General Angle Scattering Meter (GASM). This reference is the one most widely\nused to describe shapes of I](W,_,). Balch et al. (1994) have published new in situ measurements,\nagain\nusing GASM, describing\nthe shape of [5(0,_) for marine hydrosols.\nRecently, measurements\nof the VSF\nusing new instrument designs have begun to appear.\nFor example, Mobley et al. (2001) demonstrate\nthe\nsensitivity\nof remote sensing reflectance\nto correctness\nof the backscattering\nfraction of the VSF as\nmeasured using the new meters.\nThe GASMI built circa 1970 at the Scripps Institution\nof Oceanography\'s\n(Petzold 1972), consists of a lamp focused into a cylindrical beam, and a narrow\nmounted\n\nto swing in an arc to view the beam at many off-axis\n\nand 170 \xc2\xb0 .\n\nAt each incremental\n\nangle, the instrument\n\nscattering\n\nangles\n\npauses and light scattered\n\nVisibility\nLaboratory\nfield of view detector\n\nbetween\n\napproximately\n\nfrom the source\n\n10 \xc2\xb0\n\nbeam into\n\nthe detector\'s\nfield of view is measured. The phase functions at different wavelengths\nare determined\nby\nchanging interference\nfilters. The next generation of instruments\nwere designed to measure 13(W,_,) at a\nsingle wavelength\n(typically 532 nm) and a single angle, e.g. 150 \xc2\xb0 (Maffione et al. 1991) or 170 \xc2\xb0 (Smart\nI992).\nThe first commercial\nversions of these so-called backscattering\nmeters, the HydroScat\nseries of\ninstruments manufactured\nby HOBILABS Inc. (www.hobilabs.com),\nmeasure scattering at a centroid angle\nof 1400 at several fixed wavelengths\n(Maffione and Dana 1997). A more recent entry into this market is\nthe ECO-VSF\nseries of scattering meters manufactured\nby WETLABS\n(www.wetlabs.com),\nwhich are\ndesigned to measure scattering at a single wavelength (450, 530 or 650 nm) but at three scattering centroid\nangles I00 \xc2\xb0, 1200 and 150 \xc2\xb0.\nAny sensor designed\nto measure 13(_,_,), at any nominal scattering angle W, actually measures\na\nweighted\nintegral of radiance\nscattered\nfrom a working\nvolume defined\nby the intersection\nof the\nillumination\nsource beam and angular field of view of the detector system. The source illumination\nis\nattenuated\n\nfrom source to detector\n\nthrough\n\neach infinitesimal\nelement of the finite working volume.\nIf both source illumination\nand detector\nresponse functions\nare azimuthally\nsymmetric about their nominal axes, and the working volume\nsmall, the integral may be expressed in the relatively simple conceptual form\n\nby the factor\n\ne -rCv)c(_) over the slightly varying\n\nangular\nis very\n\n_(_,_;c)\nwhere the weighting\nillumination\n\nfunction\n\nand detector\n\n= 2trj\'_alo\nW (_,_;c)\n\nresponse\n\nr(_)\n\nfl(_.,_)W(,_,tP;c)sintPdtFdX,\n\naccounts\n\nfunctions,\n\npathlength\n\nm\'lsr "1,\n\nfor the angular W and wavelength\n\nand attenuation\n\nover a variable\n\npathlength,\n\n(4.3)\n_. dependencies\n\nof\n\nin each each\n\ninfinitesimal\nsubelement of the working volume. The parameters cF and _" are respectively\nthe centroid\nscattering angle and wavelength\nof the weighted integral. The functional form and detailed parametric\ndependencies\nof the weighting function are greatly abstracted in (4.3), which is presented here only as a\nconceptual framework for the discussion.\nThe weighting function can be measured by moving a Spectralon\nreflective target through the working volume (Maffione and Dana 1997), a procedure that also serves to\ncalibrate the device. Alternatively,\nif the spectral and geometric distribution\nfunctions of the source\nillumination\nand detector response are well characterized,\nthe weighting function can be calculated from\nfirst principles (Zaneveld and Twardowski, Pets. Comm), albeit based on a geometrically\nmore\ncomplicated\nform of the integral equation abstracted here as (4.3). Given the weighting function, the\nscattering sensor may be calibrated by measuring its response to scattering by polystyrene spheres, the\nscattering functions of which may be accurately determined using Mie scattering computations\n(Zaneveld\nand Twardowski,\nPers. Comm).\n\n43\n\nOceanptics\nO\n\nProtocols\n\nfor Satellite Ocean Color Sensor\n\nThe scattering parameter of principal interest in the context\nOcean Color Sensor Validation is the backscattering coefficient\nbb (3,)=\n\n2_j\';\n\n13(;t, V)sin\n\nValidation,\n\nRevision\n\n3\n\nof the Ocean Optics Protocols\n\nfor Satelline\n\nWdV,\n\n(4.4)\n\n2\nassuming\n\nazimuthal\n\nthe backscattering\nobserve\n\nsymmetry.\n\nClearly\n\nfrom measured\n\nnone of the sensors\n\n_(_\',\n\nre;c)at\n\ndescribed\n\nabove measure\n\na single angle, one invokes\n\nthat there must be at least one angle W* for which (4.4) reduces\nbb ($)=\n\n2zr13(A,w\')J;sin\n\nVdV\n\nbb(_,).

In either case, water pressure is increased in steps to produce several readings spanning\nthe\noperating range of the instrument under test, and a polynomial equation is fit to the data to relate transducer\noutput to the pressures measured with the dead-weight tester, Detailed methods and a certificate of NIST\ntraceable\ncalibration should be obtained from the manufacturer\nof the pressure calibration\ndevice.\nCalibration services of this type are readily available, on a fee-for-service\nbasis, at laboratories maintained\nby many oceanography departments and commercial\nvendors of oceanographic equipment.\nIf simultaneous\ndeployment\nof the CTD with optical instruments\nhaving\nindependent\npressure\ntransducers is practical, the two depths measured by the different instruments should be compared over the\nrange of the cast.

In some cases, the specifications have been selected to allow use of instruments\nthat are affordable and that either currently exist, or that can be developed without major improvements\nin\ntoday\'s state-of-the-art\ntechnology.\nIn a few cases, new or improved instruments must be developed to\nrealize the specified performance\ncharacteristics.\nThe data uncertainty\nrequirements\nfor this program are\nmore severe than those for a general ocean survey. Here, various investigators\nuse a variety of instruments\nthat are calibrated\nindependently\nat a number of facilities, and contribute data to a common database used\nto validate SeaWiFS, and other satellite, ocean color measurements.\nThe resulting radiometric\nand biooptical database provides an essential means of detecting and quantifying\non-orbit changes in the satellite\ninstruments\nrelative to their prelaunch calibrations and characterizations.\nThis chapter specifies instrument\ncharacteristics\nand data uncertainties\nthought to be necessary, as well as sufficient,\nfor this task.\nThe\nvalidation analysis would be significantly\ndegraded should calibration errors or differences\nof even a few\npercent, or wavelength\nerrors or differences of a few nanometers,\noccur in (between) the instruments\nused\nto acquire the validation in situ bio-optical database.\n\xc2\xb1_i\n\nZ\n\n2\n\n5.2 IN-WATER\nThis section\n\nRADIOMETERS\n\nspecifies\n\nradiometric\n\ncharacteristics\n\nfor instruments\n\nthat\n\nare used\n\nto measure\n\nEd(Z,L),\n\nEu(z,_.) and Lu(z\'L). The specifications are applicable to filter radiometers and to spectroradiometers\nbased\non monochr0_tors_\n=M_nimum\nperformance\ncharacteristics\nare specified\nfor spectral\nresolution,\nradiometric\nresponsivity\nand resolution, signal-to-noise\nratios (SNRs), radiometric\nsaturation and minimum\ndetectable values, angular response, temporal sampling resolution, linearity, and stability.\n\nSpectral\n\nCharacteristics\n\nIn-water radiometers shall be capable, as a minimum, of making measurements\nat the wavelengths\nshown in Table 5.1, which refers specifically to the SeaWiFS channels.\nThe SeaWIFS channel wavelength\ncombination\nis consistent\nwith the recommended\npreferred\nocean radiance channel combination\n(C3)\nrecommended\nby the International\nOcean Color Coordinating\nGroup (IOCCG\n1998), albeit with wider\nspectral bandwidths.\nFor the SIMBIOS in situ validation database, the wavelength\ncombinations\nin Table\n5.1 must be expanded\nto provide radiance\nand irradiance\nmeasurements\nat the greater\nnumber\nof\nwavelengths\nrepresented\nby the full ensemble of ocean color sensors (Appendix A). For example, OCTS\nand POLDER each had a channel at 565 nm, rather than that at 555 nm on SeaWiFS.\nFor purposes of these\nprotocols,\nin-water radiometer channels at these additional wavelengths\nmust match the satellite channel\nwavelengths\nand have full-width\nat half-maximum\n(FWHM)\nbandwidths\nwithin the same tolerances\ndescribed below with reference to Table 5.1.\nTable 5.1 presumes the use of properly blocked interference\nfilters to provide the required\nspectral\nbandpass and out-of-band\nrejection (10Vor better).\nCare must also be taken to avoid possible out-of-band\nleakage due to fluorescence by filter, or other optical component, materials.\nFilter radiometers\nshould have\nchannels with center wavelengths,\nas measured in the assembled instrument, matching those given in Table\n5.1 to within 1 nm for 410 nm and 443 nm, and within 2 nm for all other spectral bands.\nShifts of these\nmagnitudes\nin center wavelengths\nwill result in changes in measured radiometric\nvalues of approximately\n\n48\n\nOcean ptics rotocols\nO\nP\nforSatellite\nOcean olor\nC Sensor\nValidation,\nRevision\n3\n1% or less(R.Boothpers. omm.) ndthisspecification\nc\na\nshould\nbemetif possible.t is recognized,\nI\nhowever,\nthatenforcing 1nmhard-and-fast\na\nspecification\ncouldbeprohibitively xpensive,\ne\nandthis\ntolerancehould regardedsa goal.With knowledge, lessthan0.2nm,of the actualcenter\ns\nbe\na\nto\nwavelengths complete\nand\nspectral\nresponse\nfunctions,\ncorrections\nprobably\ncanbemade\ntoinfereffective\nradiometric\nquantities\nforthesatellite\ninstrument\nchannels.\nBandwidths be10+2 nmFWHM.They\nmust\naremade\nnarrower for example,\nthan,\ntheSeaWiFS\nchannels reduceheskewing theparameters\nto\nt\nof\nderived\nfromunderwater\nirradiance, radiance,\nor\nprofiles spectral\nin\nregions here\nw\nabsorption natural\nby\nseawater\nexhibits variation ithwavelength.\nrapid\nw\nTable Recommended bands\n5.1:\nspectral fordiscrete-wavelength\nfilterradiometers 10nm\nusing\nFWHM\nbandwidths.\nInaddition,\nout-of-band\nblocking\ninthetailsofthe\ninstrument\nresponse\nfunctions\nshoulde10 orbetter.\nb -6\nSeaWiFS\nWavelengths Eu, __ Es\nEd, 1\nBand\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n5\n6\n7\n8\n1.\n\n2.\n3.\n4.\n\nwith\n\n[nm I\n\n[nm]\n4121\n443,4352\n490\n510\n555\n665,683\n555\n665,683\n4\n4\n\n402-422\n433-453\n480-500\n500-520\n545-565\n660-680\n545-565\n660-680\n745-785\n845-885\n\n[nm]\n412\n443\n490\n510\n555\n665\n555\n6653\n780\n875\n\nA preferred option is to replace two separate 10nm FWHM bands centered at 406 and 416 nm with a\nsingle 412 nm channel The two channels would allow more accurate modeling of Lw_ (412),\nmatching SeaWiFS characteristics.\nAn optional extra band is used to improve modeling of l-.ws (k) radiances to match the SeaWiFS 443\nnm channel.\nEs deck, only channel in this band is necessary.\nDue to the specialized nature of infrared in-water measurements, specialized sensors will be needed.\n\nTo maintain\na tolerance\n\nthe above tolerances, it is anticipated that filters will be ordered to a center wavelength\nof +1 nm and a FWHM bandwidth\nof 8.5+_1 rim.\nWhen the filter is installed in a\n\nradiometer with a 10 \xc2\xb0 (half-angle) FOV, however, the spectral bandpass will broaden by 2 nm to 3 rim, and\nthe center wavelength\nwill shift. Furthermore,\nas a filter ages in use, its transmission\ncurve may undergo\nchanges to further broaden the FWI-IM bandpass and shift the peak. The tolerances specified above include\nan allowance for some degradation\nbefore expensive filter and detector changes must be done. In a single\ninstrument,\nall channels\nat a given nominal wavelength\nshould match within 1 nm, if possible. It is\ndesirable,\ntherefore, to obtain all of the filters used by an investigator\nfor measurements\nat any nominal\nwavelength\n\n(;_.n) from a single\n\nmanufacturing\n\nlot when possible.\n\nIf this is done, Es(_,n), Ed(_.n), Eu(Ln), and\n\nLu(_),\nand any atmospheric\nradiometric\nquantities measured with that investigator\'s\nhave a greater likelihood\nof being measured\nover the same range of wavelengths,\nwavelength\n(_n).

At the surface,\nEd(0) should be resolved\n\nto 0.05 laW cm -2 nm -_ per count.\n\n50\n\nOcean\nOptics rotocols\nP\nforSatellite cean Sensor\nO Color\nValidation,\nRevision\n3\n5. TheCase-I\nsaturation of Ed(0)\nvalues\n\nrepresent the Instrument Specification\nSubgroup\'s\n(\'Mueller\nand Austin 1992) estimate of maximum reflectances to be expected in ordinary Case-1 waters:\n12.5 % at 410 nm, 7.5 % at 488 nm and 0.5 % at 670 nm. These saturation values will be too low\nfor measurements\nin Case-2 waters, or coccolithophorid\nblooms. In these situations, a maximum\n\nexpected reflectance of 40 % for _, < 660 nm and 20 % for L > 660 nm is assumed.\nThis implies\nthat the expected maximum irradiance in Eu(0) should be 80 _tW cm -2 nm -! for _, <660 nm and\n40 _tW crn -2 nm -I for Z, > 660 nm.\n6.\n\nThe minimum required irradiances at three optical depths (as given in Table 5.3) assumes\nminimum reflectances of 1% at 410 nm, 2 % at 488 nm, and 0.15 % at 670 nm.\n\n7.\n\nThe saturation\nLu(3/Kd)\n\nand minimum\n\nare calculated\n\nradiances,\n\nand radiance\n\nresponsivity\n\nas LulEu = Q-I times the corresponding\n\nresolutions,\nspecification\n\nfor Lu(0) and\nfor Eu(0) or Eu(z).\n\nMueller and Austin (1995) it was assumed that Q = 5, a constant at all wavelengths\nand depths.\nMorel and Gentili (1996) showed that Q actually varies between approximately\n3.14 and 5 at\n410 nm and 488 nm, and between approximately\n3.14 and 5.7 at 670 nm (see Chapter 13).\nSaturation radiances, for the extreme minimum case of Q = 3.14 (very clear waters with the sun\nnearly overhead), are increased by a factor of 1.6 at all three wavelengths relative to Mueller and\nAustin (1995). Minimum radiances at 670 nm, for the extreme maximum case of Q = 5.7 (turbid\nwaters and solar zenith angle > 60\xc2\xb0), are decreased by a factor of 0.75, and the implied digital\nresolution at 670 nm was changed accordingly. Minimum expected radiances and required digital\nresolution at 410 nm and 488 nm are unchanged.\nThe specifications\nin Table 5.3 are meant as guidance to interpret\nrequirements:\n1. The instrument must maintain a 100:1 SNR at every operating\nmeasurements.\n\nthe following\n\nrequired\n\nrange encountered,\n\nin the field must be recorded\n\nperformance\n\nduring\n\nfield\n\nwith a digital resolution\n\nless\n\n2.\n\nThe data for measurements\nobtained\nthan or equal to 0.5 % of reading.\n\n3.\n\nThe dynamic range of the instrument\'s linear sensitivity must extend to include the signal levels\nencountered during laboratory calibrations, and the calibration signals must be recorded with a\ndigital resolution of 0.1% of reading to permit 1% uncertainty\nin calibration.\n\nIn general, the above performance\nspecifications\ndo not pose exceptionally\ndifficult engineering\nwith the possible exception of the full dynamic range implied by Case-2 or coccolith saturation\n\nchallenges,\nradiance\n\nLu(665) to minimum expected Lu(665). In any event, this situation will require specially designed\nradiometers\n(see also "Red and Near-Infrared\nWavelengths" below). It is not necessary that every\nradiometer\nused for satellite ocean color sensor validation operate over the full dynamic ranges given in\nTable 5.3. A radiometer is merely required to maintain the above performance specifications\nover the\ndynamic ranges of irradiance and radiance existing at locations and associated illumination\nconditions\nwhere it is used for validation or algorithm development.\n\n51\n\nIn\n\nOcean ptics rotocols\nO\nP\nforSatellite cean olor ensor\nO\nC S\nValidation,\nRevision\n3\nTable\n5.3:.

This is a challenging\ngoal, but one which must be met if the\nequally challenging\ngoal of achieving 1% uncertainty in absolute calibration is to be meaningful.\n\nSampling\n\nResolution\n\nSampling frequency\nshould be compatible\nwith the profiling technique being used. For the preferred\nmultispectral\nfilter radiometers\nand spectroradiometric\n(dispersion)\ninstruments\nusing array sensors, the\nminimum sampling frequencies\nare determined\nby the profiling rate and the depth resolution required. In\ngeneral,\n\nfive or more samples\n\nper meter should\n\nbe obtained\n\nat all wavelengths.\n\nAll channels\n\nof Ed(z,X),\n\nEu(z,L) and Lu(z,_,) at all wavelengths\nshould be sampled within 10 -2 s at each given depth. Alternatively,\ngrating spectrometers\nusing detector arrays to sample all channels\nsimultaneously\nmay be integrated\nfor\nlonger periods to achieve necessary signal-to-noise\nratios.\nThe time response of the instrument to a full-scale (saturation to dark) step change in irradiance should\nbe less than one second to arrive at a value within 0.1%, or one digitizing\nstep, whichever is greater, of\nsteady state. In addition, the electronic e-folding time constant of the instrument must be consistent with the\nrate at which the channels are sampled, i.e., if data are to be acquired at 10 Hz, the e-folding time constant\nshould be 0.2 s to avoid aliasing.

These data shall be recorded with the radiometric\ndata stream for\nuse as a data quality flag.\n\nRed and Near-Infrared\n\nWavelengths\n\nThe fact that red and near-IR channels - e.g. SeaWiFS bands 6, 7, and 8 at wavelengths\nof 665 rim,\n780 nm, and 865 nm, respectively\n- have such short attenuation\nlengths in water requires that special\nattention must be paid to these measurements.\nProblems due to instrument self-shading\n(Gordon and Ding\n1992) and very rapid attenuation\nof Lu(z,_,) must be considered\nat these\ninstruments,\nand radiometers\nmounted\non large instrument\npackages,\nmeasurements.\n\nwavelengths.\nLarge\nare not adaptable\n\ndiameter\nto these\n\nSuggested\nprocedures for making the measurements\nare to use either fiber optic probes carrying light\nback to a remote instrument, or very small single-wavelength\ndiscrete instruments.\nEach of these concepts\nis adaptable to deployment\nfrom a small floating platform,\nCare must be taken to avoid direct shading by\nthe supporting\nplatform,\nbut at these wavelengths,\nthe large attenuation\ncoefficients\nof water makes\nshadowing by objects more than a few meters away irrelevant.\nThe minimum measurement\nscheme would be two discrete (10 nm FWHM) channels\nat 780 nm and\n875nm.\nAdditional\nchannels\nat 750rim\nand\n850rim,\nor more\nelaborately,\nhigh-resolution\nspectroradiometry,\nwould be useful in determining the spectral distribution\nof the upwelling\nlight field in\nthese bands.\nThese measurements\n\nshould\n\nbe performed\n\nas part 0f flaestandard\n\nvalidation\n\ndata acquisition,\n\nbecause\n\nof their importance\nin the atmospheric\ncorrection algorithms.\nIt is anticipated that in the majority of cases,\nand particularly\nin most Case-1 waters, these measurements\nwill show negligible upwelling light. In Case-2\nwaters,\ncases of extremely\nhigh productivity,\nor in coccolithophorid\nblooms,\nreflectance\nat these\nwavelengths\nmay be significant,\nand these measurements\nwill become very important.\nWhen in-water\nmeasurements\nare performed\nat these wavelengths,\nthe deck ceil channels should be expanded\nto include\nbands at 750 and 875 nm (Table 5.1).\n\n5.3 SURFACE\n\nIRRADIANCE\n\nThe spectral irradiance incident at the ocean surface shall be measured at wavelengths\nthat correspond\nto the SeaWiFS spectral bands (Table 5.I), but with 10 nm FWHM bandwidth.\nA total radiation pyrometer\nmay provide helpful ancillary\ninformation, but this is not a required instrument. Instruments mounted\naboard ships must be positioned to view the sky with minimum obstruction or reflections from the ship\'s\nsuperstructure, antennas, etc. Particular care must be taken to prevent sun shadows from antennas falling\non the irradiance-collecting\nsurface.\nGimbal mounting of the deck sensor may be helpful to keep the\nsurface of the sensor horizontal.\nImproperly designed\ngimbal systems,\nhowever,\ncan accentuate\nfluctuations\ncaused by ship motion, and if there is obvious oscillation in the measured\nirradiance, the\ngimbal mechanism should be improved to eliminate the problem.\nAn intuitively attractive technique, which was suggested in previous versions of the optics protocols\n(Mueller and Austin 1992, 1995), would be to measure irradiance with a sensor floated a fraction of a meter\nbelow the sea surface, far enough away from the ship to avoid ship shadows. The flotation assembly would\nbe designed to avoid shadowing the radiometric FOV and to damp wave-induced\nmotions. This type of\narrangement has an additional potential for supporting a small sensor to also measure upwelling radiance,\nLu(z,_,), just below the surface.\nOver the past several years, however, the ocean color community has\ngained experience\nwith this approach, and has encountered\nconsistent and significant\ndifficulties\ndue to\nwave-induced fluctuations in near-surface Ed. Zaneveld et al. (2001) compare theoretical characteristics of\nthe effects of surface waves on near surface irradiance with examples of such measurements\nunder low\nwind speed conditions.\nIn the case of coherent surface waves, these effects become more pronounced and\n\n54\n\nOcean ptics rotocols\nO\nP\nforSatellite cean Sensor\nO Color\nValidation,\nRevision\n3\ndonotaverage\nlinearly time(Zaneveld,\nover\npersonal\ncommunication).\nThein-water\nreference\nradiometer\nmethod nolonger ecommended\nis\nr\nfordetermining Ed(0,3,) or Es(_,).

Saturation irradiances are the same as for Ed(k) (Table\n5.3). The dynamic operating range for these sensors needs to only be 25 db, with a SNR of 100:1, but it\nmust include the nominal calibration irradiance\n(Table 5.3). Linearity must be within +_5 %.\nSampling\nfrequency should match the frequency of the underwater radiometer, which should be 1 Hz or faster, and all\nwavelengths\nshould\nbe sampled\nwithin an interval\nless than or equal to 10 .2 s.\nCosine\nresponse\ncharacteristics\nshould give relative responsivity\nto a eoIlimated source (in air) which matches cos0 within\n2 % for 0 < 0 < 65 \xc2\xb0 , and within 10 % for 65 \xc2\xb0 < 0 < 90 \xc2\xb0 .\nFor some oceanographic\nprocess studies, it may be acceptable to use a radiometer\nmeasuring\nEs(_,) at\nonly a single wavelength.\nIf only a single channel deck radiometer is available, its spectral characteristic\nshould closely match one of channels 2 through 5 (Table 5.1) with a 10 am FWHM bandwidth.\nA\nbroadband,\nor photosynthetically\navailable\nradiation (PAR), radiometer\nshould never be used for this\npurpose.\n\n5.4 ABOVE-WATER\n\nRADIOMETRY\n\nThe performance\ncharacteristics to be specified for an above-water ocean color radiometer will vary,\ndepending on how a particular instrument is to be employed in satellite ocean color sensor validation\nexperiments.\nFor radiometric comparisons\nwith, e.g., SeaWiFS\nand in-water measurements,\nthe\nfundamental criterion to be met is that estimates\nof normalized spectral water-leaving\nradiance derived\nfrom shipboard or airborne measurements\nmust have the same uncertainty specified for those derived from\nin-water measurements\nof Lu(z,_,) (Table 5.3).\nA less accurate\nquantitatively characterize spatial variability near ship stations.\n\nradiometer\n\nmay\n\nbe used\n\nto semi-\n\nIn general, the spectral characteristics\nof above-water radiometers should match those specified for\nLu(_,) in Table 5.1. In some cases, however, it may be acceptable for a radiometer to match the SeaWiFS or other sensor - specifications,\nwhich specify center wavelength\nwithin 2 nm and 20 nm FWHM\nbandwidth.\nRecalling\nthe sensitivity of solar radiometry to the exact center wavelength\nand detailed\nspectral response function (Section 5.1), any use of airborne radiometers must quantitatively account for\nthe different spectral responsivity functions between measurements\nof radiance by, e.g., SeaWiFS, in-water\nradiometers, and above-water radiometers at each channel\'s nominal center wavelength.\nA high-altitude\nimaging radiometer must have a radiometric uncertainty and S,NR in all channels equal\nto those of the satellite ocean color instrument if its imagery is to be used for direct radiometric verification\nof the satellite sensor\'s\nradiometric performance.\nIn some cases, the requisite SN-R may be realized\nthrough pixel averaging to a 1 km spatial resolution commensurate with that of, e.g., SeaWiFS.\nDirect\nradiometric comparisons between aircraft and SeaWiFS radiances, however, also require that the different\natmospheric path effects be carefully modeled, and that the uncertainty in those modeled adjustments be\nindependently\nestimated. This can be done most effectively when the aircraft measurements\nare combined\nwith the full suite of shipboard in-water, atmospheric, and ancillary measurements (Chapter 3, Table 3.1).\nIn this case, direct comparisons between aircraft and ship radiometry may require that both the SNR and\nthe uncertainties\nrealized\nin combined analyses of the two data sets will represent a smaller spatial\nresolution than the nominal 1 km instantaneous field-of-view\n(IFOV) for SeaWiFS and other satellite\nsensors. Finally, the viewing zenith and azimuth angles at the matched pixel must also be nearly the same\nfor both sensors, if uncertainties associated with modeled corrections for the ocean\'s surface and internal\nbidirectional\nreflectance distribution function (BRDF) are to be minimized (Chapters 12 and 13).\n\n55\n\nOcean ptics rotocols\nO\nP\nforSatellite cean olor\nO\nC Sensor\nValidation,\nRevision\n3\nPerformance\ncharacteristic\nspecifications\naresimilarfor ocean\ncolorradiometers to measure\nused\nwater-leaving\nradiance eitherhedeck\nfxom\nt\nofashiporanaircraft\nflownatlowaltitude, 200m altitude\ni.e.,\nor lower.\n\nRadiometric\n\ncharacteristics\n\nshould match the criterion\n\nset forth for in-water\n\nLu(Z,) radiometers\n\nin\n\nSection 5.1 and Tables 5-1 through 5-3. The instrument FOV should be between 5\xc2\xb0and 10 \xc2\xb0 (full angle),\nand all wavelengths\nmust be coregistered\nwithin 10 % of the IFOV.\nAll channels\nmust be scanned\nsimultaneously,\nor within less than 10 .2 s (depending\non the digitizing design), to avoid aliasing due to\nvarying\nwave reflectance\nin shipboard\nmeasurements,\nand to avoid time-space\naliasing\nin airborne\nmeasurements.\nThis constraint precludes\nuse of filter wheel radiometers\nand others which scan channels\nsequentially\nover a time interval greater than 10 .2 s. Sampling over longer periods of time may be done by\neither electronic integration of all channels simultaneously,\nor by averaging multiple scans.\nA radiometer\'s\n\nsensitivity\n\nto the polarization\n\nof aperture\n\nradiance\n\nis critical\n\nfor ocean\n\ncolor\n\nremote\n\nsensing applications.\nPolarization\nsensitivity\nis likely to be present in any radiometer\nhaving mirrors,\nprisms or gratings in its optical path. To measure accurate water-leaving\nradiances using instruments\nof\nthese types, it is necessary to depolarize aperture radiance using either fiber optics or a pseudo-depolarizer.\nShipboard\nand airborne ocean color radiometers\nmust have a polarization\nsensitivity of less than 2 % in all\nchannels.\nThe sole exception to this rule will occur in the case of instruments designed to actually measure\nthe polarization\ncomponents\nof aperture radiance, e.g. the polarization\nchannels of the French Polarization\nand Directionality\nof the Earth\'s Reflectances\n(POLDER)\ninstrument\nand of the hand-held\nSIMBAD\nradiometers.\nEach application\nof a particular above-water\nradiometer\ncolor sensor validation,\nmust be evaluated on its own merits.\nstability, FOV, and spectral characteristics\nmust be evaluated\n\nsystem, if it is proposed\nfor satellite ocean\nThe instrument\'s\nresponsivity,\nuncertainty,\nin the context of the models to be used to\n\ncompare its radiance measurements\nto in-water, or e.g. SeaWiFS, radiance measurements.\nThe suitability\nof spatial averaging to improve SNRs must be evaluated in terms of the spatial variability prevailing in the\nexperiment\nsite, particularly\nwhen in-water and aircraft radiances\nare to be directly compared.\nFiner\nresolution\naircraft imagery, or low-altitude\ntrackline\ndata, will often be essential\nfor determining\nthe\nvalidity of attempts to directly compare in-water and, e.g., SeaWiFS radiances measured at a particular site.\nIn summary,\n\nairborne\n\nand Shipboard\n\nabove-water\n\nradiometry\n\ncan Obviously\n\ncontribute\n\nvaluable\n\ndata\n\nfor validating the radiometric performance\nof satellite ocean color instruments and the algorithms employed\nwith their data.

The calibration facility must\nalso have a variety of specialized\nradiometric and electronic equipment, including: reflectance plaques,\nspectral filters, integrating spheres, and highly regulated power supplies for the operation of the lamps.\nPrecision electronic measurement\ncapabilities are also required,\nboth for setting and monitoring lamp\ncurrent and voltage and for measuring the output of the radiometer.\n\n60\n\nOcean ptics rotocols\nO\nP\nforSatellite\nOcean olor ensor\nC S\nValidation,\nRevision\n3\n\nInstrument\nCharacterizations\nRecurring\n\nspectral\nFunction\nEfl\'_:ivo _.\n&FWHM\nBandwidth\n\n]\n\nity\n\nItradiaace\nr Cah\'brafion\nspectral\n\nTemperature\nSemifivity\n\nClass\n\nCharaeterlzat/on\n\nImmersion\nItradiance\nFactors\n\nRadinam\nCah\'tmaion\n\nTransducer\nPnmm_\n\nCharacterization\nXn_t_System\n\nCollector\n\nRadiometric\n\nlim_x,\n[\n\n[\n\n_omd\n\nSmsor A/D\nPorts\n\ns_ti_\nPolarization ]\n\nNoise\n[ Signal-tol_tio\n\nElectronle\n\nFigure 6.1:\n\nElements\n\nof radiometer\n\ncharacterization\n\nand calibration.\n\nIt is not expected\nthat every investigator\nwill be able to independently\nperform\nradiometric\ncalibrations.\nInstrument\nmanufacturers\nand a few university\nlaboratories\nare equipped\nand staffed\nto\nperform these calibrations\nfor the ocean color research community.\nThese facilities will perform frequent\nintercomparisons\nto assure the maintenance\nof the radiometric\ntraceability to the NIST standard of spectral\nirradiance.\nThe goal shall be to provide reproducible\ncalibrations\nfrom 400 nm to 850 nm with 1%\nuncertainty; the minimum requirement\nfor radiometric\ndata to be used in satellite ocean color sensor\nvalidation is for repeatable calibrations\nwithin less than 5 % (Chapter I).\nThis section describes\nsources\nand methods by which the NIST scale of spectral\nirradiance\nis\ntransferred to calibrate irradiance and radiance sensors. The principal working standards used for spectral\nirradiance responsivity\ncalibrations\nare FEL-type lamps 4 having assigned scales of spectral irradiance\nthat\nhave been transferred\ndirectly, or indirectly\nvia secondary\nstandards,\nfrom the scales of radiometric\nstandards maintained\nby NIST. The spectral irradiance scales of the FEL lamps are in turn transferred\nto\nspectral radiance scales using plaques of known bidirectional\nreflectance,\nor integrating spheres, or both.\nThe SeaWiFS\nProject Office initiated a series of SeaWiFS Intercalibration\nRound-Robin\nExperiments\n(SIRREXs)\nto assure internal consistency\nbetween the laboratories\nthat calibrate radiometers\nfor SeaWiFS\nvalidation (Mueller 1993 and Mueller et al. 1994). In SIRREX-3 (Mueller et al. 1996) and --4 (Johnson et\nal. 1996), it was demonstrated\nthat with properly maintained FEL lamp secondary and working standards,\n\n4 "FEL" is a commercial lamp-type designator.\nThe 1000 W FEL-type\nlamps used for spectral irradiance\ncalibration are modified by welding on a special base, which has much larger terminals than are provided\nwith the stock commercial\nbulbs (Walker et al. 1987). Following this modification,\nthe spectral irradiance\noutput of each lamp is scanned with a high-resolution\nmonochromator,\nto assure that its spectrum _s smooth\nand free from unwanted emission lines. Finally, the candidate calibration\nsource lamp is "seasoned"\nby\ninitially burning\nit for approximately\n40-hours,\nusing a highly regulated\ncurrent source; its spectral\nirradiance\noutput and lamp terminal voltage are carefully monitored.\nLamps that do not achieve stable\nperformance\nduring the seasoning process are discarded.\nSeveral commercial\nvendors offer both seasoned\nFEL-type lamps, and seasoned lamps with a certified scale of spectral irradiance transferred\nfrom another\nFEL-type secondary standard lamp acquired directly from NIST.\n\n61\n\nOcean ptics rotocols Satellite\nO\nP\nfor\n\nOcean Color Sensor Validation,\n\nRevision\n\nthorough training of laboratory\npersonnel in calibration procedures,\nand careful attention\nsetups, it was possible to maintain\nan uncertainty\nlevel of < 2 % for spectral irradiance\nspectral radiance calibrations.\n\n3\n\nto measurement\nand < 3 % for\n\nThe variety of instruments\navailable for validation\nmeasurements\nmakes it imperative\nthat\ncommon\ncalibration\ntraceability\nexists.\nRecognizing\nthat it would be impractical\nto characterize\ncalibrate all oceanographic\nand airborne radiometers\nat GSFC, several remote calibration\nfacilities\n\nsome\nand\nwere\n\nidentified (instrument\nmanufacturers\nand a few laboratories\nat academic and government\ninstitutions),\nand\nworking standards and protocols\nused at these facilities may be traced directly to the NIST scale (Johnson\net al. 1996). This organizational\nstructure is shown schematically\nin Figure 6.2. Methods of standards\nintercomparison\nmay include use of NIST calibrated filter radiometers\nto track and document the operation\nof each facility (radiometer\nwavelengths\nfor this intercomparison\nwill be determined).\nRound-robin\ncalibration comparisons\nof a reference set of field insu\'uments were implemented\nto benchmark the internal\nconsistency\nof calibrations\nperformed\nat the various facilities involved with calibrations\nthroughout\nthe\nocean color community;\nthe first of these (SIRREX-6)\ndetermined\nthat the level of relative uncertainty\nbetween these laboratories\nis approximately\n2 % (Riley and Bailey, 1998).\nIn 2001, the SIMBIOS\nProject initiated a new series of SIMBIOS\nRadiometric\nIntercomparison\n(SIMRIC)\nround-robin\ncomparisons\nof radiometric\ncalibrations\namong the participating\nlaboratories.\nRather than comparing\nlaboratory\ncalibrations of radiance and irradiance sensors designed for field use, as\nin SIRREX-6,\nthe SeaWiFS Transfer Radiometer SXR-II was used to compare the radiance scales of the\ncalibration\nsources at the various laboratories\n(G. Meister, personal comm.).\nThe SeaWiFS Transfer\nRadiometers,\nSXR and SXR-II, were built, and their calibrations\nare maintained directly, by NIST (Johnson\net al. 1998). The SXR-II measures radiance in 6 wavelength-bands\nbetween 411 nm and 777 nm consistent\nwith the SeaWiFS band (Table 5.1 of Chapter 5). Its angular Field of View (FOV) is approximately\n2\xc2\xb0\nFull-Width\nat Half-Maximum\n(FWHM) response.\nThe SIMRIC-1 comparison procedure\nwas to position\nthe SXR-II to view the plaque, or sphere, radiance source(s)\nat each laboratory,\nand the instrument\'s\ncalibrated response in each band was compared to the radiance scale at that wavelength\ninterval as provided\nby the host laboratory;\nlaboratory\nand SXR scales agreed within approximately\n2 % for most wavelength\nbands (G. Meister, personal comm.).\n\nSpectral\n\nlrradiance\n\nRadiometric\n\nCalibrations\ncalibrations\n\nof irradiance\n\nsensors\n\nwill be performed\n\nconformity\nof the sensor angular response to the required\nis satisfactory,\nand the spectral\nsensitivity,\nincluding\nsatisfactory.\n\nafter it has been ascertained\n\nthat: the\n\ncosine function is satisfactory, the sensor iinearity\nout-of-band\nstray-light\nblocking,\nis known and\n\nThe options available for radiometric\ncalibration standards are limited to standard sources or standard\ndetectors.\nThe FEL-type\nlamp standard of spectral irradiance\nis traditionally\nused for radiometric\ncalibration,\nmainly because of its ease of use, compared to the spectral radiance lamp.\nFEL-type\nlamp\nstandards of spectral irradiance are provided by NIST, and FEL-type lamp secondary standards, with NISTtraceable spectral irradiance\nscales, are available from various commercial\nstandardizing\nIaS0ratories\nand\nmanufacturers.\nThe uncertainty\ncited by NIST for these standards is, at best, 1% in the visible and 2 % is a\nmore realistic estimate of absolute uncertainty attainable using lamp standards alone. Over the calibration\nrange from 250 nm to 2,500 nm, the uncertainty\nis approximately\n6 % at the endpoints.\nNIST has\npublished guidelines for the setup, alignment, and use of these standards (Walker et al. 1987). The vendors\nwho manufacture\nand calibrate these lamps also issue guidelines for their use.\nThe irradiance\nfollows:\n*\n\ncalibration\n\nprocedure\n\n(Walker\n\net al., 1987; Johnson,\n\net al. 1996) may be summarized\n\nas\n\nThe irradiance sensor and a suitable lamp fixture for the FELtype\nlamp standard are mounted\non an optical bench. The lamp-sensor space shall be appropriately\nbaffled and draped so that\nocculting the direct path between lamp and sensor will result in a response of less then 0.1%\nof the response to the lamp flux.\n\n62\n\nOcean ptics rotocols\nO\nP\nforSatellite cean Sensor\nO Color\nValidation,\nRevision\n3\n\nNational\n\nInstitute\n\nof Standards\n\nand Technology\n\n(NlSa3\n\nl_,ik_nCric\nC_\'k_on\nProtocols\n\nNIST\nStandards\n\nSeeon_y\nStandards of\n\nSpeen_\nh/adinnce &\nRadiance\n\ni (e,g.sxR)\n\nOcean Color Radiometric\nCalibration\nLaboratories\n\nI\n\nSecondly\n\nRadiometric\n\nCSnn-actcrizat/on\nPnYmc_k\n\nCoddard\n\nSpace Flight\nNASA\n\nSecondary\n\nRadiomeldc\n_o_\nProtocols\n\nRadimmlfic\n$tnndnrds\n\nCenter\n\nItad/omelric\nStandards\n\nRadiometr/c\nSystem\nCah\'bratiom\n\nTnmsfe_\nl_diomete_\n&Standards\n\nPortable\nl_Idiometric\nSources\n\nPortable\nRad/ometric\nSomcn,\n\nFigure 6.2: Organizational\nstructure for radiometfic\ninstrument\nSeaWiFS and SIMBIOS ocean color research community.\n\ncharacterization\n\nand calibration\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAn alignment reference target, having a window with cross\nof the lamp filament, is mounted in the lamp holder.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAn alignment\nLASER beam is directed normal to the target window;\nthis alignment\nachieved when the reflection from the window is directed back on the LASER aperture.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe\n\nsensor\n\nis mounted\n\non the optical\n\nhairs etched\n\nwithin the\n\nbench with the irradiance\n\nto mark the location\n\ncollector\n\ncentered\n\nis\n\non the\n\nalignment LASER beam, which marks the optical axis.

The sphere and exit port must be large enough to place the radiance sensor far\nenough away to prevent significant secondary\nillumination of the sphere Walls due to reflections\noff the sensor\'s entrance optics; if the sensor is too close, the reflected light will both increase and\ndistort the uniformity of the radiance distribution\nwithin the sphere. The spectral radiance scale of\nan integrating\nsphere source may be transferred\nfrom the spectral irradiance\nscale of an FEL-type\nlamp standard,\nand then used to calibrate radiance sensors for field measurements,\nusing the\nfollowing procedure (Johnson et al. 1996):\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAn irradiance scale transfer radiometer,\nconfigured with an integrating\nsphere having a\ncircular entrance aperture of radius r2 as its cosine collector, is calibrated using a FELtype standard of spectral\nIrradiance Callbrations".\n\nirradiance\n\nby the method\n\noutlined\n\nabove under\n\n"Spectral\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe irradiance scale transfer radiometer is positioned with the entrance aperture of its\nintegrating sphere collector parallel to and centered coaxially at a distance d from the\ncircular aperture, with radius r_, of the integrating sphere source.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe spectral\n\nirradiance\n\nE (_,, d, rt, r2 ) of the integrating\n\nsource\'s\n\nexit port is\n\nmeasured\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nscale transfer\n\nsphere\n\nusing the irradiance\n\nAssuming\nirradiance\n\na uniform radiance distribution\nwithin the sphere\'s exit port, the spectral\nscale of the integrating\nsphere is calculated as (Johnson et al. 1995)\n\nL(_,) = E(_"d\'r1\'r2)_d\'\n_r_2\nwhere\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n+ri\' +r:_[I+8+82\n\n+..._,\n\n(6.5)\n\n8 = r1\'r_ ( d\' + rl\' + r_ )-\'\n\nThe radiance\n\nsensor to be calibrated\n\nthe center of the source\nIn either approach,\n\nradiometer.\n\nthe radiance\n\naperture.\n\nresponsivity\n\nis substituted\nIts responses\n\ncalibration\n\ncoefficients\n\nfor the transfer\n\nradiometer,\n\nand views\n\nV, (_.) are recorded.\nof the field radiometer\n\nare determined\n\nas\n\nFL(X) = _,\nand applied\n\nto derive radiance\n\nfrom field measurements\nL(2.)=\n\n6.3 PORTABLE\n\npW cm\'2nm"sr\n\n\' [digital count ]-\',\n\n(6.6)\n\nV (7_) as\n\nFL(_.)V (g), I.tW cm\'Znm"sr \' .\n\n(6.7)\n\nSTANDARDS\n\nThe portable irradiance and radiance reference standard to beused to trace instrument stability during\nfield deployments\n(Chapter\n8) should be placed in position on the sensor immediately\nfollowing\nthe\ncalibration to establish the instrument response to this reference unit. In the field, an instrument should be\nconnected\nto the portable standard and its response recorded daily, keeping a record of instrument\nresponsivity\nthroughout an experiment.\nThese comparison\nrecords provide an essential\nwarning of\nproblems, if they appear.\n\n65\n\nOcean ptics rotocols\nO\nP\nforSatellite cean Sensor\nO Color\nValidation,\nRevision\n3\n6.4 SPECTRAL\n\nBANDPASS\n\nCHARACTERIZATION\n\nOceanographic\nradiometers\nshould\nbe characterized\nto define\nthe nominal wavelengths\nand\nbandwidths,\ndefined as the full width of the passband as measured to the FWHM intensity points.\nThe\nnominal, or center wavelength,\nwill usually be defined as the wavelength\nhalfway between wavelengths\nat\nwhich the normalized response is 0.5, and the channel is characterized by this wavelength and the FWHM\nbandwidth.\nThe determination of the spectral response function, i.e. the passband, will be made for each\nchannel with a scanning monochromatic\nsource, with a bandwidth less than 0.2 am; the source output must\nbe normalized to a detector of known spectral sensitivity.\nThe response function thus measured\nis then\nnormalized to the maximum (peak).\nAlthough the results of this characterization\nare usually represented by only the nominal wavelength\nand FWHM bandpass, the complete normalized response function should be recorded for use in detailed\nwavelength\nadjustments and comparisons with the SeaWiFS and other sensor channel response functions,\nwhich must be charactrized before launch.\nIt is further recommended\nthat the internal instrument\ntemperature be monitored during these tests, and that the test be repeated at two temperatures at least 15 o C\napart, e.g., 10 \xc2\xb0 and 250 C. If a significant shift, greater than 1.0 am, with temperature of either the center\nwavelength\nor bandwidth\nis detected, then additional temperature calibration points are recommended.\nDark offsets must be recorded during each test.\nFor spectral characterizations\nof irradiance diffusers, the entire surface of the diffuser should be\nilluminated by the monochromator\'s\noutput. In the case of radiance detectors, a diffuser should be used to\ndiffuse the monochromator\nslit image and uniformly fill the instrument\'s FOV.\nThe wavelength response of a monochromator-based\nradiometer is calibrated by scanning over line\nsources, with sharp peaks at well-known\nwavelengths.\nSuitable spectral calibration sources, such as,\nmercury,\ncadmium, and neon lamps, are provided by several vendors, together with tabulations of the\nwavelengths\nof the emission lines generated by each source.\nThe width of the slit function of a monochromator may be estimated by scanning over a laser line, e.g.\nhelium-neon,\nat a very small wavelength\ninterval. The instrument FOV must be filled during the test.\nIt is anticipated that the monochromator-based\nspectral characterization will not be able to adequately\nmeasure leakage of broadly distributed out-of-band radiation; therefore, blocking of blue light in channels\nlonger than 540 nm must be routinely tested. Where continuous wave (CW) argon lasers are available, outof-band response should be measured at 488 rim. One recommended test that can be performed during the\nabsolute calibrations at _, < 640 nm is the sequenced measurement\nof three Schott BG-18 filters, each\n1 mm thick, using a FEL-type light source. The procedure is to measure the channel signal using each filter\nseparately,\nthen in combination,\nand comparing\nthe computed\nand measured\ntransmissions.\nIf a\nsignificantly\nhigher combined transmission\nof the three filters, when they are used in combination,\nis\nmeasured relative to the calculated transmittance, then spectral leakage is present. At wavelengths\ngreater\nthan 640 nm, other filters that attenuate the wavelength of interest, with a transmission value of less than or\nequal to 0.1 and which pass shorter wavelength\nlight with significantly\ngreater transmission,\nshould be\nsubstituted for the BG-18.\nConsideration must also be given to unblocked fluorescence by the filters, or other optical elements, as\na possible source of light leaks. Methods to test for fluorescence contamination specifically\nare not well\nestablished\nat this time.\nWhile leakage of blue light into red channels is the most significant oceanographic optical problem, the\nleakage of red and IR light into blue channels can cause significant errors when the instrument is calibrated\nusing a red-rich source.\nA convenient way to measure this leakage is to place a long wavelength-pass,\nsharp-cut, absorbing glass filter that does not exhibit fluorescence between a broadband (e.g., incandescent)\nsource and the sensor. A non-zero response indicates unwanted out-of-band red response and the need for\nimproved red blocking.\n\n[\n\n66\n\nOcean Optics Protocols\n\nSpectral\n\nStray Light Characterization\n\nScientists\n\nat NIST\n\nhave\n\nfor Satellite Ocean\n\nColor Sensor Validation,\n\nUsing LASER-Illuminated\n\nrecently\n\ndeveloped\n\ntunable,\n\nIntegrating\n\nRevision\n\nSphere\n\nmonochromatic\n\n3\n\nSources\n\nsources\n\nthat\n\nenable\n\nthe\n\ncharacterization\nof a sensor\'s spectral responsivity,\nat the <10 -6 level, to illumination\nat wavelengths\nfar\noutside\nits primary\nbandpass.\nThis new NIST facility,\nnamed Spectral\nIrradiance\nand Radiance\nresponsivity\nCalibrations\nwith Uniform\nSources (SIRCUS),\nis based on integrating\nsphere\nsources\nilluminated\nby LASERs; an ensemble of tunable and fixed frequency LASERs are utilized to cover the full\nspectral ranged of interest (Brown, Eppeldauer,\nand Lykke 2000). Very small exit apertures are used to\nprovide\nsources\nof monochromatic\nirradiance,\nand large exit apertures\nare used as sources\nof\nmonochromatic\nradiance, as appropriate\nto uniformly fill a particular sensor\'s entrance pupil. The source\'s\nabsolute scale of spectral irradiance\n(radiance) at each monochromatic\nwavelength\nsetting is transferred\nfrom the scale of a transfer radiometer calibrated, in turn, with a NIST primary standard.\nThus, when the\nsensor under test views the source, its response\nis used to determine\nits absolute spectral\nirradiance\n(radiance)\nresponsivity\nto the source wavelength\nat the sensor\'s\nnominal wavelength\nof interest.\nThe\nabsolute response function determination,\nusing SIRCUS to provide monochromatic\nillumination\nscanned\nover the full spectral range of interest (e.g. 350 nm to 1000 nm) while the sensor\'s responses are recorded\nat all of its resolved wavelengths\nof interest, provides the information\nnecessary for spectral stray light\ncorrections\nwith very low (albeit yet to be determined)\nuncertainty\nlevels.

Since an instrument\'s h\'radiance responsivity is calibrated in air, a correction for this change\nin collector transmissivity\nmust be applied to obtain irradiance responsivity coefficients\nfor underwater\nmeasurements.\nThe change in a collector\'s immersed transmissivity\nis the net effect of two separate processes: a\nchange in the reflection of light at the upper surface of the collector, and internal scattering and reflections\nfrom the collector\'s lower surface. A small part of the light flux failing on the collector is reflected at the\nair-plastic, or water-plastic,\ninterface, and the majority of the flux passes into the collector body.\nThe\nrelative size of this reflectance, called Fresnel reflectance,\ndepends on the relative difference in refractive\nindices between the diffuser material and the surrounding medium.\nThe refractive index of the collector material is always larger than that of either water or air, and\nbecause the refractive index of water is larger than that of air, Fresnel reflectance is smaller at a diffuserwater interface than at a diffuser-air interface. Therefore,\nthe initial transmission\nof light through the upper\nsurface of an irradiance collector is larger in water than in air. The immersed upper surface is, on the other\nhand, also less effective at reflecting the upward flux of light backscattered\nwithin the diffuser body and\nlight reflected at the lower diffuser-air interface in the instrument\'s interior, processes that are not affected\nby immersion.\nTherefore, a larger fraction of the internally scattered and upwardly reflected light passes\nback into the water column than would be lost into air. Because the increased upward loss of internally\nreflected flux exceeds the gain in downward flux through the diffuser-water interface, the net effect of these\ncompeting processes is a decrease in the collector\'s immersed transmissivity.\nExperience\nhas shown that the immersion factors for an irradiance collector must be experimentally\ncharacterized\nin the laboratory.\nSome manufacturers perform this characterization\nprocedure only for a\nprototype of a particular collector design and material specification.\nThey sometimes\nthen provide only\nthese nominal immersion factors for all production radiometers using that collector design. Mueller (1995)\napplied the characterization\nprocedure\ndescribed below to determine irradiance immersion factors for 11\nradiometers having cosine collectors of the same design and material. The measurements were replicated 2\nto 4 times for each radiometer, using independent setups on different days and varying the lamp-tocollector\ndistance between\nreplications,\nto determine\nthat Type A uncertainty\nassociated\nwith the\n\n67\n\nOcean ptics rotocols\nO\nP\nforSatellite cean olor ensor\nO\nC S\nValidation,\nRevision\n3\nexperimental\nprocedure lessthan1%.

These reflections would otherwise artificially increase the transmitted flux,\nand therefore, decrease the apparent immersion effect. The magnitude of this artifact will increase with\ndecreased depth z below some critical limit, which is the order of the diameter of the collector.\nWith very\nsmall diameter collectors, it may be possible to acquire good immersion effect data at values of z < 5 cm,\nbut the absence of this artifact should be demonstrated\nexperimentally\nif this is done.\nThe amount\nfactors:\n\nof energy\n\narriving\n\nat the collector\n\nvaries with the water depth\n\nof several\n\n1.\n\nthe attenuation\n\nat the air-water\n\n2.\n\nthe attenuation\n\nover the water pathlength,\n\n3.\n\nthe change in solid angle of the light leaving the source and arriving at the collector, caused\nby the light rays changing direction at the air-water interface, which varies with wavelength\nand water depth.\n\nUsing Fresnel\n\nreflectance\n\nequations,\n\ninterface,\n\nand is a function\n\nwhich varies with wavelength;\nwhich is a function\n\nthe transmittance\n\nthrough\n\nTs (Z) =\n\nwhere\n\nn,, (Z.) is the index of refraction\n\nat wavelength\n\nand\n\nthe surface is\n\n4n, (Z)\n[l+n.\n(&)] 2\'\n\nof the water\n\nof depth and wavelength;\n\n(6.8)\n_..

This improvement\nis mostly for\nnear-grazing\nangles (0 approaching\n90 \xc2\xb0 to the normal) and is particularly\nimportant when measurements\nof\nthe upwelling underwater\nirradiance are made, i.e., with the collector facing downward.\nIn that case, most\nof the light is incident from the sides, i.e. in the region of these near-grazing\nangles.\n\n7O\n\nOcean\n\nSince\n\nOptics Protocols\n\nE_ (z,_,)\n\nand E u (z,_.)\n\nfor Satellite\n\nOcean Color Sensor\n\nmeasurements\n\nValidation,\n\nare made underwater,\n\nRevision\n\n3\n\nthe tests to determine\n\nthe fidelity\n\nwith which the instruments\ndirectional\nresponse\nfollows the cosine function\nmust be made with the\ninstrument submerged.\nA description of the suitable experimental\nprocedure\nfollows (Petzold and Austin\n1988).\nThe instrument is suspended in a tank of water while supported by a fixture designed to allow rotation\nabout an axis through the surface and center of the collector.\nA tungsten-halogen\nlamp with a small\nfilament is enclosed in a housing with a small exit aperture and placed approximately\n1 m from a large\nwindow in the tank. The collector is placed approximately\n25 cm behind this window.\nA circular baffle\nshould be placed immediately\nin front of the window to reduce stray\nfiltered to the extent that the effects of scattered light are indiscernible.\n\nlight.\n\nThe water\n\nshould\n\nbe highly\n\nThe equivalent\nair path lamp-to-collector\ndistance should be approximately\n1.25 m or greater.\nAt this\ndistance, the fall-off at the outer edge of a 6 cm diameter diffuse collector would be 0.9994, or -0.06 %,\nwhen the diffuser is at 0 = 0\xc2\xb0 with the normal.\nThe net effect over the entire area of the diffuser would be\n0.9997 or -0.03 %. When 0 = 90 \xc2\xb0 , with the diffuser edge-on to the lamp, the distance to the lamp varies for\ndifferent points on the surface. The net error over the entire surface for this condition is 0.99997\nor 0.003 %. All other angles fall between these limiting cases.\nThe\n\n0 = 0 \xc2\xb0 alignment\n\nshould\n\nplace\n\nthe center\n\nof the collector\n\non the axis of illumination,\n\nwith the\n\ncollector surface oriented normal to the axis. One method of effecting this alignment is to pass a laser (or\nautocollimator)\nbeam through the location of the filament to the center of the collector.\nThe collector\nis\nrotated until a mirror held fiat against it reflects the laser (or autocollimator)\nbeam back on itself.\nThe\nrotational indexing scale should be zeroed in this position.\nWith the alignment\nlaser (or autocollimator)\nstill in place, the collector should be slowly rotated to the 0 = 90 \xc2\xb0 ; the beam should just graze the collector\nat 0 = 90 \xc2\xb0 and remain in the center of the collector\nat the intermediate\nangles.\nThe alignment\nand\nrotational apparatus\nshould be adjusted until these angular alignment\ncriteria are satisfied.\nNote that\nsuccess in this alignment procedure also depends on orienting the illumination\naxis normal to the tank\'s\nwindow.\nThe instrument\nrotated\n\nresponses\n\nat 5 \xc2\xb0 intervals\n\nV(_,,0)\n\nare initially\n\nto 0 = 90 \xc2\xb0 , and the instrument\n\nThe V (9_,0) responses\n\nare recorded\n\nrecorded\nresponses\n\nat the beginning,\n\nfor\n\n0=0\n\n\xc2\xb0.\n\nThe instrument\n\nV (_,, 0) measured\n\nthe middle,\n\nalignment\n\nfor each alignment\n\nis\n\nangle.\n\nand the end of each run and examined\n\nas\n\na measure of lamp and instrument stability over the time involved.\nIf the angular indexing mechanism\nallows rotation in either direction, the procedure should then be repeated in the --0 direction to complete the\ncharacterization\nof directional response in one plane perpendicular\nto the collector surface. If the apparatus\nallows rotation in only one direction, then the instrument should be rotated about the optical axis (normal to\nthe collector), and the procedure repeated to complete the plane. At least two sets of such runs should be\nmade about different axes through the surface of the diffuser.\nThe directional response of the instrument\nV(Z,0)\n(for each\ndistribution\n\nazimuth\n\nscanned)\n\nof relative\n\nis expressed\n\nas\n\nerror in a radiometer\'s\n\nV(L,O)\'\n\nwhich\n\ncosine-response\n\nshould\n\nideally\n\nis, therefore,\n\nequal\nV (L,0)\n\ncos0.\n\nv(x,0)cose\n\nThe\n\nangular\n\n-1.\n\nAssuming\nthe average response to the four measurements\nmade at each 0i (four separate azimuth\nangles about the normal to the collector) adequately\nrepresent the overall mean cosine response\nof the\ncollector, then the error, E in measuring irradiance for a uniform radiance distribution\nis approximately\nN\n\n_(O,)sin\n\xc2\xa3=i=0N\n_cos0\n\nO,A0\n1,00=0,0to\ni sin 01A0\n\ni_0\n\n71\n\n....r_ andA0\n2\n\n(6.19)\n2N\'\n\nOcean ptics\nO\nProtocols\nforSatellite\nOcean olor\nC Sensor\nValidation,\nRevision\n3\nusing\nasimple\ntrapezoidal\nquadrature.\nSimilarly, a radiance\nfor\nsimulate\n\nupwelled\n\nirradiance,\n\nthe approximate\n\ndistribution of the form\n\n1+ 4 sin 0, to\n\nerror is\n\nN\n\nV (0,)(1+\ne-\n\n4 sin e, )sin OiA0\n\ni..o_\n\n1, 0 o =0,\n\nON =--_ and AO=_.\n\ncos O_(1+ 4 sin O_\n)sin 0iA0\n\n2\n\n(6.20)\n\n2N\n\ni=0\n\nThe asymmetry\nof the cosine response, _5is equivalent\nto an effective tilt of an ideal cosine\nwith respect to the instrument\'s\nmechanical axis, which can be quantified as\n\ncollector\n\n_eos (0 + 0 t ) sin Od0\n_i= _\n\n,\n\n_cos (0where\n\n(6.21)\n\n0, )sin 0d0\n\nOtis the tilt angle.\n\nThe\n\nmeasured\n\nasymmetry\n\nangles _(0 _>0) and -r_(0\n\nis computed\n\nas the ratio\n\nof sums\n\nof measurements\n\nat opposite\n\nazimuth\n\n< 0) in the same plane, that is,\nN\n\n_V(0,,0)sin0,A0\n5 = i..o\n\xc2\xa3_(\n\n0 i)sin 0_A0\n\n1, O0 = 0, Ou =--_ and AO = _.\n2\n2N\n\n(6.22)\n\ni---0\n\nVariations\nin asymmetry\nfrom channel to channel may be due to the placement\ndetectors behind the diffuser.

In the case of deck cells, the temperature\nrange for testing should be extended to 10 \xc2\xb0C to 45 \xc2\xb0C.\nSensors exhibiting temperature coefficients\ngreater than 0.01% per \xc2\xb0C over this temperature range, should be fully characterized over their respective\nranges to establish the means and precision with which post-acquisition processing can be used to correct\nfor temperature dependency.\nAlthough knowledge of the zero, or dark current, drift is essential for working\nat the lowest radiances or irradiances, it should be emphasized\nthat more significant near-surface errors\nmay be induced by temperature variations in responsivity.\nThese possible responsivity changes must be individually determined across the spectrum.\nIn the\nabove discussion,\nthe temperatures cited are environmental\ntemperatures, but it should be emphasized\nthat\nany correction must use the temperature of the affected element, which is normally in the interior of the\ninstrument.\nThis is best accomplished by routinely using temperature sensors placed at critical locations\nwithin the instrument.\nFor highest precision, dynamic temperature testing involving temporal transients, as\nwell as possible temperature gradients within an instrument, may be appropriate.\n\n6.10 PRESSURE\n\nEFFECTS\n\nPressure\ncan cause radiometric\nmeasurement\nerrors by deforming irradiance\ncollectors.\nPressure\ncoefficients\nassociated\nwith polytetrafluoroethylene\n(PTFE) based irradiance diffusers are known to exist,\nbut they are not uniform and there may be hysteresis\neffects.\nIt is recommended\nthat each type of\nirradiance\ndetector be examined\nfor variations\nin responsivity\nwith pressure.\nIf a significant\neffect is\nobserved,\nthen pressure-dependent\nresponsivity\ncoefficients\nshould be determined\nseparately\nfor each\ninstrument\nand collector.\nThe pressure characterization\nshould also test for, and quantify, hysteresis and\ntemporal transients in responsivity\nunder a time varying pressure load. The characterization\nof pressure\neffects has not previously been common practice, and the requisite procedures are therefore poorly defined;\nnew protocols must be developed.\n\n73\n\nOcean Optics Protocols\n\n6.11 PRESSURE\n\nfor Satellite\n\nTRANSDUCER\n\nOcean Color Sensor\n\nValidation,\n\nRevision\n\nCAL RATION\n\nThe radiometer\'s pressure transducer, which is used to measure instrument depth\nshould be tested and calibrated before and after each major cruise (Chapter 4, Sect. 4.10).\n\n6.12 POLARIZATION\n\n3\n\nduring profiles,\n\nSENSITIVITY\n\nPolarization\nsensitivity is more critical in above-water radiometry than underwater radiometry.\nIf a\nradiometer measures\npolarization components\nof radiance, then its responsivity and rejection of crosspolarization radiance must be characterized for each component channel. For above-water scalar radiance\ninstruments, as with the SeaWiFS and other ocean color radiometers, sensitivity to linear polarization must\nbe less than 2 %, and the actual degree of polarization sensitivity must be characterized for each channel. A\nprotocol for characterizing the polarization sensitivity of a radiometer is described in Chapter 7 (Sect. 7.3).\n\nREFERENCES\nAustin, R.W. and G.

Their fields of view are small,\ntypically between\nI \xc2\xb0 and 3 \xc2\xb0, in order to minimize contamination\nof the transmitted\nsolar signal by\nscattered skylight.\nSome photometers\nare manually aimed at the sun using sun-sighting\noptics, while other\ntypes of photometers\nare fixed in place and are equipped with automatic sun-tracking\nmechanisms.\nMicroTops\nII (Morys et al. 1998; Porter et al 1999) and SIMBAD (Deschamps et al. 2000; Fougnie et\nal. 1999a, 1999b) are two examples of hand-held sun photometers.\nThe fields of view (FOV) of hand-held\nsun photometers\nare typically\nbetween\n2 \xc2\xb0 and 3 \xc2\xb0, which is generally\nlarger than the FOVs of the\nautomatic\nsun-tracking\nphotometers\n(Table 7.I).\nThe wider FOV allows the user to manually aim the\ninstrument at the sun from the rolling deck of a ship. The even wider field of view of SIMBAD (Table 7.1)\nis intended\nto measure\nmarine reflectance\nas well as the solar signal. An improved\nversion, called\nSIMBADA,\nhas been recently\ndeveloped\nand is available\nsince 2001. SIMBADA\nnew features are an\nintegrated GPS and 11 channels.\nExamples of fixed, automated tracking sun photometers\ninclude the CIMEL (Holben et al., 1998) and\nthe PREDE (Nakajima\net al., 1996). The design of a particular sun tracking mechanism\nis dependent\non\nwhether it is to be used on a moving platform (e.g., PREDE POM-01 Mark II), or on a stable station (e.g.,\nCIMEL,\nPREDE POM-01L).\nCIMEL and PREDE instruments\nperform both sun photometric\nand sky\nradiance measurements.\nIn sky radiance mode, these instruments measure sky radiances within 3 \xc2\xb0 of the\nsun in the aureole, and also scan the sky radiance distribution\nin the principal solar plane. The FOV of the\nCIMEL and PREDE instruments\nare less than 1.5 \xc2\xb0 and the instruments are equipped with collimators\nfor\nstray light rejection (O\'Neill et al., 1984; Holben et al. 1998; Nakajima et al. 1996).\nFast\n\nrotating\n\nshadow-band\n\nradiometers\n\nmeasure\n\nsolar\n\nintensity\n\nvalues\n\nindirectly\n\nfrom\n\ndiffuse\n\nand\n\nglobal upper hemispheric\nirradiance.\nThey have a 2re FOV and are equipped\nwith a solar occulting\napparatus. Finally, electronic camera systems equipped with "fisheye" lenses may be used to measure the\nfull sky radiance distribution\n(Voss et aI. 1989).\nSun photometers\n\nand sky radiometers\n\ncommonly\n\nhave several\n\nchannels\n\nfrom 300 nm to 1020 nm and\n\nnarrow bandwidths\n(approximately\n10 nm). Their characteristics\nare summarized in Table 7.1. This chapter\nwill describe\ncalibration\ntechniques,\nand uncertainties\nof the sun photometers\nand sky radiometers.\nMeasurement\nand data analysis protocols and procedures are discussed in Chapter 14.\n\n76\n\nOcean ptics rotocols\nO\nP\nforSatellite\nOcean Sensor\nColor\nValidation,\nRevision\n3\n7.2 CALIBRATION\n\nTECHNIQUES\n\nFOR SUN PHOTOMETERS\n\nTo calibrate\nsun photometers,\nit is necessary to take into account degradation of detectors and\ninterference filters. The absolute calibration using lamp standards is generally not recommended for the\nretrieval of aerosol optical thickness\n(AOT).\nHowever, in case of a strong loss of sensitivity over time,\nSchmid et al.

(1983) use a different\nalgorithm.\nDifferences\nbetween the results are less than 2.5 % in the spectral range from\n300 nm to 1020 nm. The principal uncertainty\nin the Rayleigh optical thickness\nis associated\nwith variability\nin atmospheric\npressure.\nEck et al.

The uncertainties\nof the cross-calibration\nare composed of uncertainties\nin the calibrated reference sun photometer\nand the non-calibrated\nsun photometer.\nThe calibration of the\nreference sun photometers\nis performed by the AERONET\ngroup.

(1998), the uncertainty\nin AOTs obtained for\ncross-calibrated\nCIMEL instruments\nare estimated to be 0.01 to 0.02. The uncertainties\nare higher when\nthe cross-calibrated\nsun photometer\nis not of the same design as the reference sun photometer.\nFor cross-calibrated\nMicroTops,\nSIMBAD and PREDE\nthe TOA voltages\nare determined\nwith\nuncertainties\nlower than 1% (i.e. 0.02 in terms of AOT). Figure 7.2 shows the time series of TOA voltages\nobtained at GSFC since 1998 (in 2001 for the PREDE).\nChannels 440 nm and 870 nm are presented.\nFour\nreference CIMELs were (S/N 94, 37, 27 and I01) calibrated at MLO were used. TOA voltages retrieved in\nall bands are reported in Table 7.2. The decay of calibration over time is generally less than 5% per year for\nSIMBAD and MicroTops.\nA cross calibration every 3 months allows accounting for the decay over time.\nHowever,\na larger decay (10%/yr)\nis observed\nin some of the channels\nof MicroTops.\nThe decay is\nsignificant\nand requires\na change of the corresponding\nfilter and eventually\nthe photodiode\nof the\ninstrument. The main source of error in retrieving AOT using sun photometry is the TOA voltages.\nSince\nVoltz (1959), several papers have discussed different methods to improve the solar calibration.\nSchmid et\nal. (1998) used lamp and solar calibrations in conjunction\nwith each other. O\'Neill et al. (1984) combined\nsolar aureole and solar beam extinction.\nSoufflet et al. (1992) and Holben et al.

Radiative properties of aerosols are retrieved using an\ninversion algorithm of the sky radiances (Dubovik et al. 2000; Nakajima et al. 1996) and of the polarized\ncomponent\nof the sky radiances (Vermeulen\net al. 2000).\nThis section is dedicated to the description of\ncalibration\ntechniques for accurate retrievals of sky radiances.\n\nCalibration\n\nof Unpolarized\n\nSky Radiometers\n\nUnpolarized\nradiometers,\nsuch as CIMEL and PREDE,\nare calibrated\nusing an integrating\nsphere\n(Chapter\n6, Sect. 6.2). The radiometer\nis aligned in front of the sphere (Figure\n7.3, top) and I0\nmeasurements\nare taken for each channel.\nRadiances of the integrating\nsphere are then integrated through\nthe domains of each channel of the radiometer.\nAs a result, ratios of raw radiometer\nvoltages to the\nintegrated\nsphere radiances are obtained.\nThese ratios constitute radiometer calibration parameters Ci:\nVii\n\nCi -\n\n(7.6)\n\n_L(_,)Rin(Z)d,_\n\nwhere\nfunction\n\n_ is the voltages\nof the radiometer\n\nUncertainty\n\nmeasured\n\nin the considered\n\nchannel,\n\nof the Calibration\n\nchannel\n\nand L(L) is the spectral\n\nof Unpotarized\n\ni, R_ (k)\nradiance\n\nis the normalized\n\nspectral\n\nscale of the integrating\n\nresponse\n\nsphere.\n\nSky Radiometers\n\nThe accuracy of the radiometer\ncalibration is dependent\non the calibration\nof the integrating\nsphere,\nsphere\'s\nsize, clarity of the calibration\nprotocols and precision of the calibration\nprocess.\nA two-meter\nintegrating\nsphere\nis\navailable\nand\nmanaged\nby\nNASA\nGSFC\nCalibration\nFacility\n(http:llspectral.gsfc.nasa.govl).\nThe uncertainty\nof the radiances provided\nby this integrating\nsphere is\nestimated\nto be less than 5%.\n\nCalibration\n\nof Polarized\n\nSky Radiometers\n\nThe technology\nto calibrate polarized sun photometers\nis now available to the SIMBIOS Project. The\nmethod was initially designed by the Laboratoire\nd\'Optique Atmosph_rique\n(LOA), Lille, France, for the\ncalibration\nof POLDER sensor (POLarization\nand Directionality\nof the Earth\'s Reflectances),\nits airborne\n(Deuze et al. 1992) and space version (Bret-Dibat T. et al. 1995; Hagolle et al., 1999).\nThe polarization\nbox named "POLBOX"\nis a passive system including neither optical source nor\nelectrical\npower supply.\nPOLBOX transforms natural light to polarized\nlight. The user\'s guide for the\ndevice (Balois 1999) is available at LOA and GSFC. A Lambertian\nsource is necessary to provide the input\nlight to the box, therefore, an integrating\nsphere is usually used. POLBOX is composed\nof two adjustable\nglass blades that have a high refractive index. The blades are placed in a black anodized aluminum alloy\nbox. The box can turn around the optical axis. The degree of polarization\nand the direction of the linear\npolarization\nplane are tunable by the user by adjusting the position of the box and the blades.\nThe\nalignment\nof the blades, relative to the optical axis, is performed by auto-collimation\nusing a basic laser and\na mirror.\nAlignment\nis required each time the blades are cleaned and replaced in the POLBOX.\nThe\nrequired equipment consists of:\nI.\n\nPolarization\n\n2.\n\nCalibrated\n\ndevice\n\nPOLBOX.\n\nlight source\n\n(integrating\n\nsphere).\n\n82\n\nOcean ptics rotocols\nO\nP\nforSatellite\nOceanolor\nC\n3.\n\nLambertian\n\n4.\n\nprocess\n\nfor polarized\n\nsphere or lamp with scattering\n\nRevision\n\nradiometers\n\nis composed\n\nopaline\n\n3\n\nSun photometer.\n\nThe calibration\n\nlight source (integrating\n\nSensor Validation,\n\nof the following\n\nsteps:\n\n1.\n\nPerform the absolute calibration using the calibrated\nchannels, including the polarized ones.\n\n2.\n\nPlace POLBOX between an integrating sphere and the sun photometer (Figure 7.3, bottom).\nintegrating\nsphere is highly recommended\nfor the stability, but its calibration is not essential\ndetermining\nthe relative polarized responses of the instrument.\n\n3.\n\nPerform\n\none measurement\n\nThe degree\n\npolarization\n\n(Figure 7.3, top) for all radiometer\n\nfor each tilt of both blades in POLBOX.\n\nmeasured by the rotating\nopposite directions.\n4.\n\nsphere\n\ndiffuser).\n\nunit.\n\nThe tilt of each blade is identical\n\nof the light transmitted\n\nthrough\n\nA combined\n\nin absolute\n\nthe POLBOX\n\na(n)cos 2 (20i)+ B(n)cos(Oi)+C(n)\nP_ (0i) = D(n)cos2\n2\n(Oi)+E(n)cos(Oi)+F(n)\nwhere A, B, C, D, E, and F are functions\n\nof the refractive\n\nThe\nfor\n\ntilt is defined\n\ndegrees\n\nto the sensor\n\nand\n\nbut shifted\n\nin\n\nis given by:\n\n,\n\n(7.7)\n\nindex n of the blades,\n\nand 0 i is the\n\ntilt angle of the blades (the same but opposite).\n5.\n\nPlot the computed degree of polarization against\nintercept of 0 \xc2\xb0 polarization\nand the slope.\n\nthe measured\n\npolarization\n\nand obtain the\n\nDue to the mechanical\nlimitations\nof the POLBOX\nsystem the maximum degree of polarization\nthat\ncan be reached is 60 %.

To insure accurate measurements,\nthere are\ntwo important elements\nfor FRSR measurement\nprotocol: calibration\nof the instrument circuitry, which\nincludes temperature\nstabilization\nof the detector during measurements,\nand determination\nof the extraterrestrial constants.\nThe following two subsections discuss these elements and establish protocols.\n\nCalibration\n\nof Instrument\n\nCircuitry\n\nand Temperature\n\nStabilization\n\nof the Detector\n\nLaboratory\ncalibration\nis done in two parts: the optical detector and the electronics\nattached to the\ndetector. The electronic gains are combined with the direct-normal\ndetector irradiance\ngains coefficients\nto\nmake a single calibration equation relating direct-normal\nirradiance to the electronic measurement\nin mV.\nInitial values for the detector calibration, band-pass response, and zenith angle correction are supplied\nby the vendor.\nIn addition,\nthe instrument\nshould be periodically\nrecalibrated\nusing the protocols\nof\nChapter 6. Each of the narrow-band\nfilters has a bandwidth\nof approximately\n10 rtm and the vendor\ncalibration provides gains at 1 nm spacing.\nThe zenith angle correction is measured on two planes, one on\na south-to-north\nplane and one on a west-to-east\nplane. The zenith angle corrections\nare determined\nby\nholding the head in a tilting fixture under a collimated beam and tilting the head through 180 \xc2\xb0 in one-degree\nsteps from horizon to horizon in each plane (see also Chapter 6, Section 6.6)\nThe end-to-end\nelectronic\ngains are calibrated\nusing the data collection\nsoftware and a precision\nreference\nvoltage\nsource in place of each radiometer\nchannel.\nOne-minute\naverages\nand standard\ndeviations of voltages for each channel are logged for a full range of input voltages.\nElectronic calibrations\nare repeated at regular intervals and for a variety of ambient temperatures.\nCalibration\nof the electronics\nis\nperformed before and after each deployment.\nA silicone cell photodiode\nhas a small leakage current which is called a "dark current".\nAfter\namplification\nin the electronics a "dark voltage" results, and if the dark voltage is not negligible, it must be\nmeasured and removed.\nIn some instruments,\nsuch as the MICROTOPS\nII hand-held sun photometer,\nthe\noperator covers the detector\nbefore taking a solar measurement.\nFor an autonomous\ninstrument\nan\nelectronic design eliminates the dark voltage. For the FRSR, the largest deviation\nfrom a straight-line\nfit is\nless than 0.1% of full scale and no "dark voltage" adjustment is required.\nCalibration\ndrift in the multi-frequency\nhead has caused a great deal of concern in the sun photometer\ncommunity.\nCalibration\nshift is detectable as a permanent change in the apparent extraterrestrial\nirradiance\nEo as computed by the Langley-Bouguer\ntechnique.\nCalibration\nshift is erratic and quite variable; it can\noccur suddenly, over a few weeks, or can degrade slowly over months. The 610 nm and 660 nm channels\nare most prone to drift, though all narrow-band\nchannels are suspect due to gain drift and shifting bandpass\nresponse functions.\nIn earlier heads, the filter material, a stack of laminated\nfilms, apparently\nbecame\ndelaminated as a result of temperature\ncycling and humidity.\nA different filter material became available\nafter approximately\nDecember\n1998 and many researchers are in the process of retrofitting their heads with\nthe new material.\n\nDetermination\n\nof the Extra-terrestrial\n\nConstants\n\nThe Langley-Bouguer\ntechnique works whenever the skies are perfectly clear, no cirrus or other layers\nare present, and if the atmospheric optical depth r is constant over the time duration of the observations.\nIn\npractice, a Langley-Bouguer\ncalibration\ncan be produced\nfrom about one hour of clear sky in the early\nmorning just after sunrise,\n\nor late evening just before sunset when\n\n2 < M (0o) < 6 (i.e. 60 \xc2\xb0 < 0 o < 80\xc2\xb0).\n\nAll\n\nmeasurements\nof Er_, the normal-beam\nsolar irradiance (see section 14.4), are plotted on a log-linear plot\nand a best estimate straight line is fitted to the data.

The engineering design and characteristics of the SQM are\ndescribed by Johnson et al. (1998), so only a brief description is given here. A separate rack of electronic\nequipment,\ncomposed\nprincipally of two computer controlled power supplies and a multiplexed,\ndigital\nvoltmeter (DVM), are an essential part of producing the stable light field. All of the external components\nare controlled by a computer program over a general purpose interface bus (GPIB).\nThe SQM has two sets of halogen lamps with eight lamps in each set; both lamp sets are arranged\nsymmetrically\non a ring and operate in series, so if one lamp fails, the entire set goes off. The lamps in one\nset are rated for 1.05 A (4.2 V\') and are operated at 0.95 A, and the lamps in the other set are rated for\n3.45 A (5.0 V) and are operated at 3.1 A; the lamp sets are hereafter referred to as the 1 A and 3 A lamps,\nrespectively.\nThe lamps are operated at approximately 95 % of their full amperage rating to maximize the\nlifetime of the lamps.\nA low, medium, and high intensity flux level is provided when the 1 A, 3 A, and both lamp sets are\nused, respectively.\nEach lamp set was aged for approximately 50 hours before deploying the SQM to the\nfield.\nThe interior light chamber\nhas bead-blasted aluminum walls, so the diffuse component\nof the\nreflectance is significant.\nThe lamps illuminate a circular plastic diffuser protected by safety glass and\nsealed from the environment\nby o-rings.\nThe diffuser is resilient to ultraviolet yellowing,\nbut can age\nnonetheless.\nThe exit aperture is 20 cm in diameter and has a spatial uniformity of 98 % or more over the\ninterior 15 cm circle. The SQM does not have, nor does it require, an absolute calibration, but it has design\nobjectives of better than 2 % stability during field deployments.\nA faceplate or shadow collar provides a mounting assembly, so the device under test (DUT), usually a\nradiance or irradiance sensor, can be positioned in the shadow collar. The DUT has a D-shaped collar\nfitted to it at a set distance, 3.81 cm (1.5 inch), from the front of the DUT. This distance was chosen based\non the most restrictive clearance requirement of the radiometers used in the different deployment rigs. The\nD-shaped collar ensures the DUT can be mounted to the SQM at a reproducible\nlocation and orientation\n\n91\n\nOcean\nOptics rotocols\nP\nfor\n\nSatellite\n\nOcean Color Sensor\n\nValidation,\n\nRevision\n\n3\n\nwith respect to the exit aperture each time the DUT is used.\nThe former\nminimizes\nuncertainties\n(principally\nwith irradiance\nsensors) due to distance differences\nbetween measurement\nsessions, while the\nlatter minimizes\nuncertainties\n(principally\nwith radiance\nsensors) due to inhomegeneities\nin the exit\naperture light field. In either case, the D-shaped collar keeps these sources of uncertainties\nbelow the 1%\nlevel. A schematic of the original SQM is given in Fig.8.1. The SQM faceplate can be changed to accept a\nvariety of instruments\nfrom different manufacturers.\nRadiometers\nabove a certain size, approximately\n15 cm, would be difficult to accommodate,\nbut the entire mounting assembly can be changed to allow for\nreasonable viewing by seemingly difficult to handle radiometers.\nTo date, three radiometer designs have\nbeen used with the SQM, and there were no problems in producing the needed faceplates, D-shaped collars,\nor support hardware to accommodate\nthese units.\n\nHandle\n--_\n|\n\nGlass\n\nShadow\nCollar\n\nFan\n\nBulk\n\nControl-\'C="\nand\nSignal-_\nConnectiqns_:\xc2\xa2\n\nFigure\n\n8.1: A schematic\n\nI\nJ\n]\nJ\n]\n\nI_i?\nI_,\'_l]itl=\n_._\n\nUght It1111\nI_\n\nrEE - =III\nIfill\n\nI_1\n\nof the SQM showing\n\nLock-\n\nlllrl II:\n\n,--\'He=,,rtln]\nl\n\n_=ized fill II\nI\n\na DUT kinematically\n\nmounted\n\nto the shadow\n\ncollar.\n\nThe SQM light field can change because of a variety of effects; for example, the presence of the DUT,\nthe aging of the lamps, a deterioration\nin the plastic diffuser, a change in the transmittance\nof the glass\ncover, a drift in the control electronics,\na repositioning\nof a mechanical\nalignment,\netc. To account for\nthese changes, three photodiodes,\nwhose temperatures\nare kept constant with a precision\nthermoelectric\ncooler (+ 0.01 K), measure the exit aperture light level: the first has a responsivity\nin the blue part of the\nspectrum, the second in the red part of the spectrum, and the third has a broadband\nor white response.\nAll\nthree internal monitors view the center portion of the exit aperture.\nA fan cools the back of the SQM to\nprevent a build up in temperature\nbeyond that which the thermoelectric\ncooler can accommodate.\nThe\nSQM has an internal heater to help maintain temperature stability in colder climates and to shorten the time\nneeded for warming up the SQM.\nAnother SQM quality control procedure\nis provided by three special DUTs called fiducials:\na white\none, a black one, and a black one with a glass face (the glass is the same as that used with the field\nradiometers).\nA fiducial has the same size and shape of a radiometer, but is non operational.\nThe reflective\nsurface of a fiducial\nis carefully\nmaintained,\nboth during its use and when it is not being used.\nConsequently,\nthe reflective surface degrades very slowly, so over the time period of a field expedition,\nit\nremains basically constant.\nA field radiometer,\nby comparison,\nhas a reflective\nsurface that is changing\nepisodically\nfrom the wear and tear of daily use.\nThis change in reflectivity\nalters the loading of the\nradiometer on the SQM and is a source of variance for the monitors inside the SQM that are viewing the\nexit aperture, or the radiometer\nitself when it is viewing the exit aperture.\nThe time series of a fiducial, as\nmeasured by the internal monitors, gives an independent measure of the temporal stability of the light field.\nThe SQM has been used to track changes in instruments between calibrations\nand on multiple cruises\nlasting approximately\n5--6 weeks each (Hooker\nand Maritorena\n2000).\nAlthough\nthere was some\ncontroversy\nat the design stage about operating the lamps below their rated current (approximately\n95 % of\nrating), there has been no observable\ndegradation\nin the performance\nof the lamps as a result of this-indeed, they have survived long shipment routes (US to UK to Falkland Islands and back) on repeated\noccasions, as well as, the high vibration environment\nof a ship. The SQM is clearly a robust instrument\nwell suited to the task of calibration\nmonitoring in the field at the 1% level (Hooker and Aiken 1998).\nThere are two commercialized\nversions of the SQM: the OCS-5002\nbuilt by Yankee Environmental\n\n92\n\nOcean ptics rotocols\nO\nP\nfor\nSystems\nCanada).\noriginal.\n\n(YES), Inc.

The lamps in the original design were potted\ninto aluminum mounts that held the bulbs in their correct orientations.\nThe mounts were soldered to a\ncircular circuit board and were difficult to replace. In the OCS-5002, porcelain sockets are used for each\nlamp, which are held in place with epoxy in aluminum mounting rings.\nThis design allows for rapid\nindividual bulb replacement.\nShunt temperatures as well as the lamp housing temperatures are monitored during operation.\nA twochannel filter-detector\nand a third unfiltered detector are positioned within the lamp housing to permit\ndirect optical monitoring of the lamp rings and the integrating cavity itself.\nThese three detectors axe\nthermally\nstabilized via a thermoelectrically\ncooled housing to approximately\n35\xc2\xb0C, and their outputs are\ncontinuously monitored during system operation.\n\nFigure\n\n8.2:\n\nA picture of the OCS-5002\n\nwithout a DUT mounted\n\n93\n\nto the shadow\n\ncollar\n\nOcean ptics rotocols\nO\nP\nforSatellite cean olor ensor\nO\nC S\nValidation,\nRevision\n3\n\n8.4 SQM-II\nThe main difference between the SQM-II (Fig. 8.3) and the original unit is the high degree of\nintegration in the former.\nThe entire system consists of two components,\na deck box that provides DC\npower to the SQM-II, and the SQM-II itself (McLean et al. 1998).\nThe latter contains the lamp tings\n(which use the same lamps as the original SQM), heating and cooling subsystems,\ncontrol circuitry, the\nsystem computer, plus display and data storage. The SQM-II system is designed to be self contained and\ndoes not require a computer to operate. Only two cables are required to complete system assembly (an AC\npower cord for the deck box and a DC power cord to link the deck box to the SQM-1T). Although this\nintegration reduces system complexity,\nit comes with increased vulnerability:\na failure in any one of the\nsubsystems\ncan render the entire system inoperable\nwith no opportunity\nfor simply swapping in a new\n(external)\nsubassembly,\nlike a power supply or DVM.\nAs was done with the original SQM, Satlantic\nrecommends\nrunning the SQM-H on an uninterruptible\npower supply (UPS).\nUser input to start and monitor the system is via a simple 4-button keypad and a 4 x 20 fluorescent\ndisplay at the rear of the device. Commands\ncan be entered using the menus on the display or remotely\nfrom a computer.\nA computer can also be connected to the system to log data during a measurement\nsession, or the data can be stored internally in a flash card and downloaded\nlater.\nThe differences between the two SQM units are not restricted to their control architecture.\nThe SQMH has many improvements\nthat use of the original unit has shown to be desirable under different\ncircumstances:\n1.\n\nThe bulbs are mounted at the front, facing away from the exit aperture, which increases\naverage path length of the light emitted by each bulb, and it makes it easier to service\nlamps (individually\nand as a subassembly);\n_\n= -:\n\n2.\n\nThe light chamber is lined\nuniformity is greater; and\n\n3.\n\nAt 490 nm, the SQM-II is about seven times more intense than the SQM (the apparent\nblackbody temperature of the SQM-II is 3,100 K, whereas, the SQM is about 2,400 K).\n\nwith Spectralon,\n\nso the emitted\n\nAlthough the greater flux of the SQM-II is a desirable attribute\nhigh output in the red saturates many in-water field radiometers.\nadding a blue filter to the exit aperture.\n\nFigure\n\n8.3:\n\nA picture of the SQM-II\n\nwith a DUT mounted\n\nflux is higher,\n\nthe\nthe\n\nand the aperture\n\nfor the blue part of the spectrum,\nThis was subsequently\ncorrected\n\nthe\nby\n\nto the shadow collar.\n\n8.5 METHODOLOGY\nTo check the stability of radiometers in the field, and to monitor the performance of\ncalibration evaluation and radiometric testing (CERT) session and a data acquisition sequence\nto be defined.\nIn its simplest form, a CERT session is a sequence of DAS events, which\nfollowing\na prescribed methodology.\nEach DAS represents\nenough data to statistically\n\n94\n\nthe SQM, a\n(DAS) needs\nare executed\nestablish\nthe\n\nOcean\nOpticsrotocols\nP\n\nfor Satellite\n\nOcean Color Sensor Validation,\n\nRevision\n\n3\n\ncharacteristics\nof the instrument involved within a reasonable amount of time. In most cases,\nsufficient.\nA typical sequence of procedures for each CERT session is as follows:\n\n3 minutes\n\nis\n\n1.\n\nThe electronics\nequipment\n(the tamp power supplies and the digital multimeter, the SQM fan\nand internal heater power supplies, the lamp timers, etc.) is turned on I-2 hours before the\nCERT session begins.\nThe total numbers of hours on each lamp set are tracked by recording\nthe starting and ending number of hours on each lamp set.\n\n2.\n\nThe SQM is preheated using the internal electrical heater for 30--60 minutes, depending\non\nthe environmental\nconditions at the time. This is done to achieve a time efficient thermal\nequilibrium\n\nof the instrument\n\nfrom the power dissipation\n\nof the lamps.\n\n3.\n\nIf the mixture of radiometers\nused in the CERT sessions change over time, at least one\nradiometer\n(preferably\ntwo of different\ntypes, i.e., radiance and irradiance)\nshould be\nrecurrently used in all sessions.\nThe first data collected during the CERT session should be\nthe dark voltages\nfor this radiometer\n(usually achieved\nby putting an opaque cap on the\nradiometer)\nand the SQM internal dark voltages (usually acquired by blocking the SQM exit\naperture with a fiducial).\n\n4.\n\nOnce the SQM is powered up at the selected lamp level, it should be allowed to warm up for\nat least 1 hour (and frequently\nfor as long as 2 hours in highly variable environments).\nThe\nwarm-up\nperiod can be considered\ncompleted\nwhen the internal SQM monitor data are\nconstant\nto within 0.1%.\nThe radiometric\nstability\nusually coincides\nwith a thermal\nequilibrium as denoted by the internal thermistors.\n\n5.\n\nUpon the completion\nof the warm-up\nperiod,\nthe individual\nradiometers\nare tested\nsequentially.\nFirst, the previous DUT is removed and replaced with a fiducial.\nSecond, dark\nvoltages for the radiometer\nto be tested and SQM monitor data for glass fiducial are\nsimultaneously\ncollected.\nThird, the fiducial is removed from the SQM and replaced with the\nradiometer.\nFinally, data from the SQM and the radiometer\nare recorded.\nEach time a DUT\nis mounted\n\nto the SQM, the lamp voltages\n\nand internal\n\ntemperatures\n\nof the SQM are recorded.\n\n6.\n\nIf multiple flux levels are to be measured, and the current lamp set is not to be used, it is\npowered down. The needed lamp set is powered on and allowed to warm up for 1-2 hours.\nThe individual\nradiometers\nare tested sequentially\nwith fiducial measurements\ntaken during\ndark voltage measurements\n(step 5).\n\n7.\n\nBefore the SQM is finally shut down, any remaining\nfiducials\nare measured.\nThese\nmeasurements,\nplus the fiducial data acquired in between the radiometer\ndark and light\n(SQM) measurements,\nare the primary sources for tracking the stability of the SQM flux.\nAfter the lamps are powered down, the ending number of hours on each lamp set is recorded.\n\nIt is important to note the warm-up process only involves the SQM and it is done only once before the\nindividual DUTs are measured; the DUTs are not warmed up per se, although, they are usually kept in the\nsame room as the SQM, so they are at room temperature.\nThe point for radiometric\nstability of the internal SQM monitors (0.1%) is usually achieved within 3090 minutes of powering up the lamps, depending on the amount of preheating.\nIn general, the warm-up\nperiod is extended another 30 minutes past this point to ensure that stability can be maintained.\nThe\nradiometric\nstability of the SQM immediately\nafter powering on the lamps (i.e., within 1 minute) is usually\nless than 0.2 % with preheating,\nand as much as 2 % without preheating\ndepending on the environmental\nconditions.\nIf a radiometer\nis subjected to some kind of trauma and needs to be checked as quickly as\npossible for an impending deployment,\nit is usually possible to check it to within reasonable limits using a\nrapid start of the SQM, particularly\nif the SQM is kept in the preheated mode.\nIf CERT sessions are conducted outside, the SQM should be shaded from direct sunlight and ambient\nwind conditions to prevent rapid changes in heating and cooling.\nA major source of noise in the stability of\nthe lamps is vibration, particularly\nif the SQM is used at sea. Vibration damping is recommended\nunder\nsuch conditions and 0.5 in. high density felt has been demonstrated\nto be a good damping material.\n\n95\n\nOcean ptics rotocols\nO\nP\nforSatellite cean olor ensor\nO\nC S\nValidation,\nRevision\n3\n8.6 DATA\n\nANALYSIS\n\nThe approach\nfor presenting\nthe data analysis procedures\nis assumed\nto involve more than one\nradiometer,\nsince most deployment\nsystems involve a solar reference and one or more above- or in-water\ninstruments.\nIn the most general terms, the quantity of interest is a voltage or digital count level associated\nwith a radiometer\n\n(or DUT),\n\ntime of the measurement,\n\nV c (_,i, ti ), where V is the voltage\n\nC is the instrument\n\nof the radiometer\n\nunder\n\ncode of the DUT, _ is an individual\n\nillumination\n\nwavelength\n\nat the\n\nor channel\n\nof\n\nthe instrument,\nand tj is a particular\ntime for the data record.\nThe instrument\ncode is just a simple\nmnemonic\nfor keeping track of which DUT was measured when. A suitable coding scheme is to assign a\nletter for a particular\ntype of radiometer\n(e.g., R for radiance, I for irradiance, etc.) and then to add on the\nserial number).\nAn SQM has two lamp sets, so multiple flux levels are possible.\nUnder most circumstances\nthe lamp\nsets are different, so three basic voltage levels for the SQM monitors and for the radiometers\nwhile they are\nmounted to the SQM are possible: L, M, and H, which correspond to low, medium, and high lamp levels,\nrespectively.\n(In situations where the two lamp sets are identical, it is customary to denote the two levels as\nL and M.) In addition, dark voltages are measured for the radiometers\n(D c) and the SQM internal monitors\n(Ds), For the latter, the S code denotes the internal monitor channel (B for blue, R for red, and W for white\nor broadband.)\nNote the SQM-II has a single internal monitor in the blue part of the spectrum.\nAll of the\ndata for a particular CERT session are acquired at a single lamp level.\nThe process of determining\na parameter\na field deployment\nbegins by first defining\nDAS:\n\nfor monitoring\nthe radiometric\nstability of a radiometer during\nthe average signal level acquired with the radiometer\nduring a\n\n_\'c (_,,,_)\n\n=\n\nVc\n\n,\n\n(8.1)\n\n"s\n\nwhere\n\ngc (Xi, ti ) denotes\n\nis the average\ndefined as\n\na time average\n\nof the total number\n\ntime over DAS time period k.

Because one fiducial is being used repeatedly,\nand two others are being used\nonly once per CERT session, the ability to discern short- and long-term changes in the SQM is available,\nwith the longer-term\nchanges being measured by more than one fiducial.\n\n8.7 FUTURE APPLICATIONS\nFigure 8.4 presents a summary of SQM performance\nduring three at-sea deployments.\nThe data is\nfrom Atlantic Meridional Transect (AMT) cruises (Aiken et al. 2000) AMT-5 through\nAMT-7 plus\nlaboratory\nexperiments,\nand covers a time period of approximately 460 days. It shows the internal blue\nmonitor signal as measured with the glass fiducial as a function of time, but presented as the percent\ndifference with respect to the mean value for the entire time period (i.e., across all CERT sessions).\nA\nconfirmation of the signal is given by the R035 radiometer for the 443 nm channel (which is very similar to\n\n97\n\nOcean ptics rotocols\nO\nP\nforSatellite cean olor\nO\nC Sensor\nValidation,\nRevision\n3\ntheblueinternal\nmonitoror theSQM), ndit verynearly\nf\na\nmirrors\ntheinternal\nmonitor ignal.Thetwo\ns\ndetectors similar ecayates fapproximately %perday, rapproximately\nyield\nd\nr o\n0.007\no\n0.25%fora35day\ncruise. hisisanunderestimate,\nT\nhowever,\nbecause\nthedegradation\nisduemostly\ntolamp\nusage, thisis\nand\nobviously ost ignificant\nm s\nduring andnotduringshippingnd\nuse,\na storage.\nThisis best een yperusing\ns b\nthedata\nfromindividual\ncruises,\nandcomparing toresults\nthem\noflaboratory\nworkdone\nfollowing\nAMT-7.\nThestability ndbehavior\na\noftheSQM\nduring\nA_MT-5 was very similar to its performance\non A.MT-3\nwhen it was first commissioned\nin the SQM flux level halfway\n\nfor field use (Hooker\nthrough the cruise.\n\nand Aiken\n\n1998): the data indicate\n\na stepwise\n\nchange\n\nAll three detectors show the change, and if the three detector signals are averaged together, the emitted\nflux of the SQM decreased by approximately\n0.87 %. The change in flux was due to a partial short in one\nof the bulbs, which resulted in a 1.2 % decrease in the operating voltage of the lamp. The stability of the\nSQM during the periods before and after the change in light output, as estimated by one standard deviation\n(lt_) in the average\n\nof the three internal\n\nmonitor\n\nsignals,\n\nwas to within 0.60 % and 0.53\n\n%, respectively.\n\nDuring AMT-6, the ltr values of the red, blue, and white detectors while measuring the glass fiducial\nwere 0.36 %, 0.46 %, and 0.39 %, respectively.\nThe performance\nof the SQM during AMT-6 was the best\nout of all the cruises; no lamp anomalies were experienced\nand the standard deviation\nin the emitted flux\nwas the lowest ever recorded in the field. The AMT-7 data show a stepwise change halfway through the\ncruise, as was seen during AMT-3 and AMT-5. Although the stability for the entire cruise was very good,\nto within + 0.43 % as measured by the blue detector, the stability improves to + 0.38 % and + 0.28 % if the\ncruise is split into a first and second half, respectively.\nLamp performance\nafter AMT-7 in the laboratory\nwas very similar to\nchanges are all within 1%.

All other water masses have often been loosely lumped into the Case-2 definition, albeit\nwith considerable confusion over how to categorize coccolithophorid\nblooms, and waters in which strong\nconcentrations of Gelbstoff vary independently from pigment concentration.\nBy a strict interpretation of\nthe original definition, both of these latter cases would be classified as Case-i.\nIn the present discussion of sampling protocols, Case-1 will be considered to refer to what might be\ncalled ordinary\nopen ocean Case-1 waters,\nwherein scattering and absorption\nare dominated\nby\nphytoplankton, pigments, and Gelbstoff concentrations,\nand where global blue-green\ncolor ratio algorithms\nfor chlorophyll\na concentration and K(490) work well. Most areas in the deep ocean belong to this case.\nWater masses that do not satisfy these criteria will be grouped under the heading Case-2. Within Case-2,\nby this definition, water masses with a wide diversity of bio-optical characteristics will be found.

Strong absorption at UV, red, and near-IR\nwavelengths requires the use of radiometric techniques similar to those required for Case-2 waters.\nIn addition to determining the bio-optical\ncategory and characteristics of a particular water mass, the\nvalidation sampling strategy must be concerned\nwith spatial and temporal variability.\nSpatial and temporal\nvariability in bio-optical properties will profoundly affect the validity of comparisons between satellite and\nin-water optical measurements.\nA single SeaWiFS instantaneous FOV measurement,\nfor example, will\nintegrate Lw(_) over approximately a square kilometer, or a larger area at viewing angles away from nadir.\n\n101\n\nOcean ptics rotocols\nO\nP\nforSatellite cean Sensor\nO Color\nValidation,\nRevision\n3\nFurthermore,\nthelocation\nuncertainty a single\nfor\npixelmaybeseveral\nkilometers,\nexcept near-shore\nin\nareas here\nw\nimage avigation beimproved\nn\ncan\nbyusing\nland-navigated points.\nanchor\nBio-optical\nprofiles\nmeasured\natasingle\nstationre\na representative\nofaspatial thatisonlya small\nscale\nfraction\nofakilometer. fromagridofseveral\nData\nstation\nlocations berequired\nmay\ntoestimate\nthespatial\naverages opticalproperties\nof\nrepresented a satelliteixel,or a blockof pixels.Because ship\nby\np\nthe\nmeasurements\noverthegridarenotinstantaneous,\ntemporal\nvariability bio-optical\nin\nproperties\ncanadd\nadditional\nuncertainty thecomparisons.\nto\nAircraft adiometric\nr\nobservations\ncan,conceptually,\nbeused\nbothtolocate\ncomparison away\nsites\nfromareasfstrongpatial\no\ns\nvariability nd\na todocument\nchanges the\nin\npattern\nofspatial\nvariability verheperiod\no t\nrequired\nforaship\ntooccupyllstations\na\ninacomparison\ngrid.\nVertical\nstratification wateremperature,\nof\nt\nsalinity,\nanddensity ften\no affecthevertical\nt\nstructuref\no\nvariabilityin bio-optical\nproperties. hisvariability, turn,affects\nT\nin\ntheremote\nsensing\nreflectance.\nVertical\nslratification thewater\nof\ncolumn\nbecomes\nespecially\nimportant\ninmany\nCase-2 aters,\nw\nwhere\nthe\ntopattenuation may\ndepth beasshallow\nas1mto2mand entire\nthe\neuphoric may\nzone beconfined less\nto\nthan10mdepth.It is important,\ntherefore,\ntominimizehip-induced\ns\ndisruption\nofvertical\nstratification\nin\nthe watercolumn.Whenever\npossible, shipshould\nthe\nbemaneuvered little aspossible ith its\nas\nw\npropellers bowthruster, thepracticef backing hard\nand\nand\no\ndown tostop\nquickly\nwhen\nonstation\nshould\nbestrongly iscouraged.wind\nd\nIf\nandsea\nconditions\npermit,\nthepreferred\nmethodfapproaching\no\na station\nistotake\nenoughpeedfftheship\ns\no\ntocoast stop approximately 0.5Km of approach to the\ntoa\nover\nthelast\nstation. The approach should be planned to allow the ship to be turned, preferably using only the rudder, to\nplace the sun abaft the beam, or off the stern, depending on where the radiometers\nwill be deployed.\nIt\nmust be realized, however, that depending\non wind and sea conditions,\nand a particular ship\'s hull and\nsuperstructure\nconfiguration,\nit may not be possible to maintain an acceptable\norientation,\nwith respect to\nthe sun, while the ship is adrift. In these situations, some use of the engines to maintain an acceptable ship\'s\nheading may be unavoidable.\nThe chief scientist should also consult with the ship\'s captain and chief engineer to avoid, or at least\nminimize,\noverboard\ndischarges\nwhile the ship is on station.\nMaterial from a ship\'s bilge or sewage\ntreatment system can significantly\nchange near-surface\nchemical and optical properties\nif discharged\nnear\nthe immediate site of a bio-optical profile, or water sample.\nIn some coastal areas, where a relatively transparent water mass overlies a highly reflective bottom,\nLw(_,) includes\nlight reflected\nfrom the sea floor. These cases require special treatment\nof bottom\nreflectance\neffects, whether the local water mass regime is Case-I,\nCase-2, or a combination\nof both.\nMethods\nof measurement,\nexperiment\ndesign, and sampling strategies to study bottom reflectance\neffects\nare beyond the scope of this revision to the ocean optics protocols.\nThere is a significant current research\neffort focused in this area (Carder et al. 1993, Hamilton et al. 1993, and Lee et al. 1998, 1999), and new\nprotocols in this topic area may be included in a future revision of this document.\nThe bottom reflection of areas with a water depth exceeding 30 m normally does not contribute to the\nwater leaving radiance, Lw(_). Areas with a depth shallower than 30 m are flagged in the SeaWiFS level\ntwo data product.\nPixels covering very turbid waters may, however, even be usable even in shallower\nareas.\nAs a general rule, the water depth should be deeper than 2.5 attenuation\nlengths, I/K(490),\nat all\nocean color algorithm\ndevelopment\nand validation\nstations.\nThe prime exception\nto this rule is in\ndeveloping\nlocal ocean color algorithms where bottom reflectance contributions\nmust be taken into account\n(Lee et al. 1998, 1999).\n\nInitialization\n\nand Validation\n\nData intended\nE_m (_.) determined\n\nfor direct comparisons\n\nbetween\n\nfrom in situ measurements\n\nexact normalized\nand from satellite\n\nwater-leaving\ndata should\n\nradiances\n\nusually\n\n(Chapter\n\nbe acquired\n\n13)\n\nin areas\n\nwhere bio-optical\nvariability\nis known to be very small.\nThis will ordinarily dictate that such data be\nacquired from optically clear and persistently\noligotrophic Case-I water masses. Potentially\nsuitable sites\ninclude\nthe northeastern\nPacific central gyre off Baja, California\n(to the southwest),\nand the central\nSargasso Sea. When planning validation\ncruise locations and timing, seasonal and regional cloud cover\nstatistics\nshould also be considered\nin order to maximize the likelihood\nof simultaneous\nsatellite and\nshipboard\nobservations.\nA Moored\nOptical BuoY (MOBY)\nis maintained\nand operated\nin a semi-\n\n102\n\nOcean ptics rotocols\nO\nP\nforSatellite\nOcean olor\nC Sensor\nValidation,\nRevision\n3\noligotrophic\nsitein theNortheast\nPacific, ear awaii,\nn H\ncomparisons\n\nwith SeaWiFS,\n\nMODIS\n\nand other satellite\n\nL_\n\nto provide\n\ncontinuous\n\n(_,) estimates\n\ntime-series\n\n(Chapter\n\nradiometric\n\n11; Clark et al. 1997).\n\nA series of radiometfic\ncomparison stations should be made over a wide range of latitude in both the\nNorthern and Southern Hemispheres,\nto look for evidence of cyclicthermal\nsensitivity\naffecting a satellite\nocean color sensor.\nThe spacecraft\nand instrument will be heated by sunlight throughout\nthe descending\n(daylight)\ndata acquisition\nsegment of each orbit and will be cooled by thermal radiation while in the\nEarth\'s shadow throughout\nthe remainder of the orbit. This cycling is likely to induce transient thermal\ngradients in the instrument,\nas well as a time varying cycle in the temperatures\nof its detectors and other\ncomponents;\nthese thermal variations could affect the spectral bandpass or responsivity\nof one or more of\nits channels.\nUnfortunately,\na set of stations covering the full range of latitudes cannot all be sited in\nregions where mesoscale variability\nin ocean optical properties can be neglected.\nAs when acquiring data for developing and validating\nCase-1 bio-optical\nalgorithms\n(see below), a\nsignificant\neffort must be exerted to quantify spatial variability\nin normalized\nwater-leaving\nradiance.\nWhen possible, airborne radiometer\ndata, in combination\nwith careful characterization\nof atmospheric\naerosol and cloud conditions,\nshould be employed to augment shipboard radiometry at the stations selected\nfor this aspect of the validation.\nIf aircraft support is not available, semi-synoptic\nshipboard\ntransects\ncovering a 20 x 20 Km 2 grid should\nstation (Clark et al. 1997).\n\nbe used to characterize\n\nspatial\n\nbio-optical\n\nvariability\n\nnear a sampling\n\nThe minimum set of variables to be measured for "match-up"\nvalidation analyses are those identified\nas "Required"\nin Table 3.1. Measurements\nused to calculate normalized\nwater-leaving\nradiance for direct\ncomparison\nto satellite sensor radiances must be made under cloud-free conditions and within five minutes\nof the satellite overpass.\n\nCase-1\n\nWater: Sampling\n\nStrategies\n\nIn open-ocean\noligotrophic\nwater, it is usually practical to assume that a station is in a Case-I water\nmass, although some caution must be taken to detect coccolithophorid\nblooms and suspended\ncoccoliths.\nIn more turbid coastal transition regimes, however, the classification\nof the local water mass as Case-i or\nCase-2 may be less obvious.\nIn this environment,\nmoreover, Case-1 and Case-2 water masses may both be\npresent in the domain sampled by a ship. One example of this situation would be Case-1 water within an\neddy-like intrusion from offshore into coastal areas normally occupied by Case-2 water masses.\nAnother\nwould be Case-2 waters in a major river plume intruding into an ambient Case-1 water mass regime.\nIn\ngeneral, a water mass may be categorized as Case-1 if:\n1.\n\nGelbstoff [Colored\nthan 0.1 m-_;\n\nDissolved\n\n2.\n\nTotal Suspended\n\n3.\n\nmeasured\nLwr_(_.) values, used in the ocean color Case-I\nfluorometric\nchlorophyll\na concentration\nwithin 35 %; and\n\n4.\n\nmeasured\nLw_(7_), used\nK(490) within 20 %.\n\nParticulate\n\nOrganic\n\nMatter\n\n(CDOM)]\n\nMatter (TSM) concentration\n\nin the ocean\n\ncolor\n\nabsorption\n\nat 380 nm, ag (380), is less\n\nis less than 0.5 mg L -!

The model of Gordon et al. (1988) may\nthen be used to estimate LwN(Tt) from the alongtrack chlorophyll\nprofile (Clark et al. 1997). In regions of\nstrong mesoscale\nvariability, concurrent aircraft ocean color, or LIDAR, measurements\nare also valuable as\na guide for selecting the ship\'s location, and as a basis for spatially extrapolating\nthe in-water measurements\nto match the much coarser resolution of the satellite ocean color measurements.\n\nCase 2 Waters:\n\nSampling\n\nStrategies\n\nAlthough coastal and continental shelf areas comprise only I0 % of the total ocean area, they provide\nroughly half of the oceanic new production and most of the sequesterable\nDOC (Walsh et al. 1981). These\nareas are typically higher in phytoplankton\npigment concentration,\nand may include colored terrigenous\nconstituents\nsuch as CDOM and suspended\nsediments.\nIn these Case-2 waters, the global color ratio\nalgorithms break down because twoor more substances with different optical properties are present which\ndo not co-vary with chlorophyll\na concentration.\nThese might be waters with exceptional\nplankton blooms\n(such as red tides), areas discolored by dust transported\nby the wind from deserts into the sea, or coastal\nareas influenced\nby river discharge of mineral and organic suspended\nmaterials, and Colored Dissolved\nOrganic Materials (CDOM, i.e. gelbstoffe) such as humic acids.\nIt is not always easy to decide to which case a water mass belongs.\nAs a starting point, the water\nbelongs to Case-2 if any of the four Case-1 criteria set forth above, are not satisfied.\nFor Case-2 waters\ndefined by any one of these criteria, it remains a further problem to determine\nthe specific bio-optical\ncharacteristics\nthat distinguish it from Case-1. Case-2 sampling must usually include both the "Required"\nand "Highly Desired" variables, as identified in Table 3.1, plus TSM. For example, it may be necessary to\ndetermine\ncomplete\npigment\ncomposition\nand other optically\nimportant\ncharacteristics\nof exceptional\nphytoplankton\nblooms\nfor such planktonic\ngroups\nas Coccolithophorids,\nTrichodesmium,\ndiatoms,\ncyanobacteria,\nor dinoflagellates.\nTo achieve valid comparisons\nbetween the ship and satellite data, sharp horizontal gradients and subpixel patchiness must be avoided, and accurate image navigation requires land anchor points near the study\nsite. Suitable landmarks\nare usually available\nin near-shore\ncoastal waters.\nThe other conditions\nare\ndifficult to meet in Case-2 water masses, where mesoscale\nand sub-mesoscale\nvariability\nis typically\nstrong.\nSub-pixel variations of no more than + 35 % of the mean pixel chlorophyll\nwill be tolerated,\nvariability must be measured and taken into account statistically in the analysis (see below).\nFrom the above\n\ngeneralities,\n\nit is clear that significant\n\nproblems\n\nare encountered\n\nin near-shore\n\nvery\nbut\n\ncoastal\n\nwaters characterized\nby small-scale patchiness and dynamic variability due to tidal currents.\nA particular\nproblem occurs in the shallow areas that are influenced by strong tidal currents - areas that are normally\nwell mixed during part of the tidal cycle. In the slack water tidal phase, however, a vertical gradient of the\nsuspended matter concentration\nmay form, which may cause problems in relating water-leaving\nradiance to\nthe concentration\nof suspended\nmatter.\nDuring calm periods with strong insolation,\neven water that is\nnormally\n\nwell\n\nmixed\n\ncan become\n\nstratified.\n\nIn these cases,\n\n104\n\nthe formation\n\nof very dense\n\nphytoplankton\n\nOcean ptics rotocols\nO\nP\nforSatellite\nOcean olor ensor\nC S\nValidation,\nRevision\n3\nblooms,\nsuch\n\nas red tides,\n\ncan be observed.\n\nSuch\n\nblooms\n\nwill\n\noccur in coastal\n\nseas\n\nwhen\n\nconcentrations\nare elevated by the influx of river water. In these circumstances,\nit is especially\navoid disturbing the vertical stratification\nof the water column with the ship\'s propellers.\n\norder\n\nOne approach to sampling in this environment\nto get a good statistical base, water samples\n\nnutrient\ncritical\n\nto\n\nhas been suggested by R. Doerffer (pers. comm.).\nIn\nare first taken in a random order within the area under\n\nresearch.\nThe concentrations\nderived from the satellite image data are then compared with the ground truth\ndata by statistical parameters,\nsuch as the mean, median, standard deviation, and the shapes of histograms\n(frequency distribution).\nFor this type of statistical comparison,\nonly sections of satellite images that match\nthe area covered by the ship should be analyzed.\nWater samples and satellite\ndata should also be\ntemporally\nconcurrent\nwithin the same tidal phase to avoid biases due to temporal variability.\nIn these\nregimes, analyses to validate algorithms cannot be based on satellite ocean color data directly, but must\ninstead be based on water-leaving\nradiance spectra measured in situ (Chapter 10) or from above the water\nsurface (Chapter\n12). This approach has the advantage that water samples and radiance spectra are taken\nnearly simultaneously.\nUsing either flow-through\npumping systems, or systems towed outside the ship\'s wake, fluorometry\ncan be used to assess chlorophyll\npatchiness\nif frequent,\ni.e. every 10rain\nto 15 rain, chlorophyll\nfluorescence-yield\ncalibration measurements\nare performed.\nTowed absorption, scattering, reflectance,\nand\nbeam transmission\nmeters can also be used to characterize\nspatial variability.\nWithin a few hours of the\noverpass, the ship should occupy several stations at random locations within a 2 x 2 Km 2 area central to the\narea selected for comparison\nsatellite overpass\nmay help\n\nwith satellite data.\nSampling\nstations placed across\nto identify two different water masses, even when\n\na tidal front during a\nthe front has moved.\n\nComparisons\nbetween in situ and satellite data in patchy coastal areas may be enhanced by using horizontal\nradiance profiles measured from an aircraft flying at low altitude (Section 9.9). Subsets of such airborne\nprofiles allow direct comparisons\nwith shipboard data. A corresponding\nprofile may then be extracted from\nthe satellite image data for a direct comparison to the aircraft trackline profiles.\nIn Case-2 situations,\nsuch\ndirect radiometric\ncomparisons\nare valuable for validating\nand tuning local algorithms,\nbut are not\nappropriate for satellite ocean color sensor system validation per se.\nTo validate ocean color atmospheric\ncorrections,\nwater-leaving\nradiances measured\nin situ from the\nship should be compared with those derived from the satellite data.\nSample matching\nproblems\naside,\nCase-2 waters are often characterized\nby strongly varying\npatchiness\nin optical\nproperties,\npigment\nconcentrations,\nand remote sensing reflectance at spatial scales smaller than a single pixel resolution of any\nof the current generation of ocean color sensors. Because of the nonlinear relationship\nbetween absorption\nby\n\npigments,\n\nthrough\n\nbb(_,)la(7_),\n\nand\n\nexact\n\nnormalized\n\nremote-sensing\n\nreflectance\n\nL_(_,)/ffo(_,)\n\n(Chapters 2, 12 and 13), the pigment concentration\nderived from spatially averaged satellite radiance data\nwill systematically\nunderestimate\nthe true spatial average concentration\nby as much as a factor of 2 when\nsub-pixel variability is significant.\nIt is, therefore, essential to describe sub-pixel scale variability\nin Case-2\nwaters both statistically\nand in terms of organized\nstructure.\nSuch a description\nmay be accomplished\nthrough rapid sampling at closely spaced ship stations in combination\nwith airborne ocean color or LIDAR\nmeasurements\n-- for this purpose, trackline data from low altitudes and high-resolution\nimagery from high\naltitudes are both acceptable (Section 9.9).\nAbsorption\ncorrections\n\ncoefficients\n\nare large\n\nenough\n\nto Lu(0, _,), even though the correction\n\nin all Case-2\nmodel\n\nwaters\n\n(Gordon\n\nto require\n\nand Ding\n\ninstrument\n\nself-shading\n\n1992) has been experimentally\n\nverified only for the case where a(L)r is less than 0.1 (Section\n10.4). In extreme Case-2 waters, large\nvalues of spectral absorption may confine the first optical attenuation depth to the top 1 m to 2 m, where it\nis difficult to measure remote sensing reflectance\nin situ.\nSuch short absorption\nscale lengths lead to\ninstrument\nself-shading\neffects in Lu(0",7_) that are correctable\nwithin -5 % only for instruments\nwith\ndiameters no larger than approximately\n1 cm (Gordon and Ding 1992).

Refer to Chapter 2 the brief discussion in Section 4.6 for more\nbackground\non this topic. It is planned to remedy this situation and add IOP protocol chapters to a future\nrevision of Ocean Optics Protocols, but for the present IOP protocols are presented here only as brief\nabstracts of the current state-of-the-art.\nThe main exception to this situation is that detailed protocols for\nspectrophotometric\nmeasurements\nof absorption by particles on filters, and by CDOM in filtrate, are\npresented in Chapter 15.\n\nIn Situ Reflective-Tube\n\nAbsorption\n\nand Beam Attenuation\n\nMeters\n\nFor the development\nof bio-optical algorithms describing the inherent and apparent optical properties\nof the water, and for algorithms\nestimating\nprimary\nproductivity,\nmore stringent\nrequirements\nare\nrecommended\nfor transmissometer\ncalibration\nand characteristics.\nSpectral\nmeasurements\nof beam\ntransmittance\nshould be made with absolute uncertainties\nof 0.1% transmittance\nper meter, or 0.001 m -_\nbeam attenuation\ncoefficient\nc(k).\nIt is always best to determine\noptical properties\nin situ, if possible.\nSampling variability,\nchanges of light intensities,\nfiltration procedures,\nand sample degradation\nover time\nall affect the particulate\nmatter and distort its true optical properties\nas they existed in the ocean, and as\nthey determine the remote sensing reflectance viewed by a satellite ocean color sensor.\nThe reflecting tube method has been used to measure spectral absorption\nin the laboratory\nfor many\ndecades (James and Birge 1938).\nIn recent years, this method has been adapted\nfor use in the ocean\n(Zaneveld et al. 1992). Suitable instruments\nare now commercially\navailable and are coming into general\nuse within the oceanographic\ncommunity.\nDetailed protocols for using these instruments\nare not included\nin this revision of the Ocean Optics Protocols.\nThis is also the situation regarding their calibration (Section\n4.6).\nAs with calibrations,\nprotocols\nfor using the instruments\nand analyzing\nthe measurements\nare\nprovided by the instrument manufacturer.\nThe best known example of this type of instrument is, perhaps\nthe AC9 manufactured\nby WETLABS\nInc.; protocols and methods for using this instrument and analyzing\nits measurements\nare available\nat (www.wetlabs.com).\nAs with the AC9 calibration\nprotocols\n(Section\n4.6), extensions to the manufacturer\'s\nmeasurement\nand analysis protocols are described by Twardowski\net\nal. (1999) and on the web site maintained by the Oregon State University Optical Oceanography\nGroup at\n(http://photon.oce.orst.edu)\n(S. Pegau, Pers. Comm.).\nPerhaps the most critical of the protocols\nand\nprotocol extensions is the absolute necessity of calibrating the instrument daily with optically pure water if\nhigh quality measurements\nare to be made at sea (Twardowski\net aI. 1999; Pegau, Pers. Comm.).\nThe reflecting tube does not perfectly gather all scattered light and transmit it to the detector, and as a\nresult, there is a scattering error on the order of 13 % of the scattering coefficient.\nThis error can be largely\ncorrected\nif the beam attenuation\ncoefficient\nis measured\nsimultaneously.\nIn that case, the scattering\ncoefficient is obtained as b(_,) = c(_,) - a(_). By assuming that the measured absorption\nis due to water and\nscattering error at a wavelength\nin the infrared, and by subsequent correction at other wavelengths\nusing a\nprovisional b(7_), it is possible to correct the spectral absorption\nto within a few percent of the scattering\ncoefficient.\nOnly in waters with very high scattering and very low absorption\nwould this error pose a\nserious absorption uncertainty\n(Zaneveld et al. 1994).\nCorrections for ambient temperature and salinity (Pegau and Zaneveld 1993; Pegau et al. 1995) require\nthat a CTD profile (Section 9.6) be acquired in conjunction\nwith a profile made using an AC9 or similar\ninstrument.\nIt is strongly recommended\nthat a CTD and the absorption\nand attenuation\nmeter be attached\ntogether on the same profiling package. This ambient temperature\ncorrection is in addition to the correction\nfor the instrument\'s\ninternal temperature, as determined\nby the manufacturer\'s\ncalibration (Section 4.6).\nIf the intake port of an AC9, or similar in situ reflecting tube meter, is fitted with a large area 0.2 \xe2\x80\xa2 m\nfilter, the spectral absorption\nof the dissolved component\ncan be measured (Twardowski\net al. 1999). A\npair of reflecting\ntube absorption\nmeters can be used thus to determine\nthe separate constituents\nof\nabsorption due to particulate and dissolved substances - a distinction of fundamental\nimportance\nin relating\nabsorption\nto remote sensing\nreflectance.\nMore traditionally,\nthe filtration\nand spectrophotometry\n\n109\n\nOcean ptics rotocols\nO\nP\nforSatellite cean Sensor\nO Color\nValidation,\nRevision\n3\ntechniques\ndevelopedverthelastdecadelsolendthemselves to thistask.

This level of agreement iS well within the calibration uncertainties\nof the\nparticular prototype instruments\nused for that experiment,\nwhich were approximately\n10% uncertainties\nin\nboth the scalar irradiance radiometer\nand in the reflecting tube instrument.\nLess than 5% uncertainties\nin\nabsorption\nare expected in future experiments,\nassuming the data are properly averaged to remove nearsurface irradiance\nfluctuations\ncaused by surface waves (Zaneveld et al. 2001). In very clear oligotrophic\nwater, moreover,\nuncertainty\nin water absorption values may make it impossible\nto realize this level of\nrelative agreement.\nRadiometers\nequipped with hemispherical\nirradiance collectors, a prerequisite\nto application\nof this\nmethod, have only recently become commercially\navailable (HOBILABS\nInc; www.hobilabs.com).\nTo\ndate, there is insufficient\ncommunity\nexperience,\nin the form of published results based on measurements\nwith this instrument,\nto include more detailed protocols\nand uncertainty\nestimates\nfor this approach.\nExpanded\nprotocols\nfor Gershun measurements\nof absorption\nmay appear in a future revision\nto this\ndocument.\n\nAbsorption\n\nSpectrophotometry\n\nof Filtered\n\nParticles\n\nand Dissolved\n\nMaterials\n\n(Chapter\n\n15)\n\nProtocols\nin Chapter 15, by Mitchell\net aI., describe methods for filtering seawater to capture\nsuspended\nparticles on GF/F filters, and for measuring the absorption spectra of the particle-laden\nfilters\nwith a laboratory spectrophotometer.\nMethods are also described for extracting phytoplankton pigments\nfrom the filters, and measuring the residual spectrum of particulate materials other than phytoplankton.\nFinally, laboratory methods are also described for measuring the absorption spectrum of CDOM in filtered\nseawater\nsamples.\nThe material in this chapter derives from the results of recent experimental\nintercomparison\nworkshops in which the authors participated, as well as from the published literature.\n\nComparative\n\nAnalyses\n\nof Absorption\n\nData from a reflective\nprofiles\nOptical\n\nCoefficients\n\ntube absorption\n\nand beam attenuation\n\nmeter may be analyzed\n\nto obtain vertical\n\nof a(z,k), ag(z,_.), and c(z,7_), and by difference b(z,_.) = c(z,_) - a(z,_.) and ap(z,_) = a(z,_,) - ag(z,_.).\ndensity spectra for filtrate and filtered water samples (Chapter\n15) may be analyzed to obtain\n\nindependent\n\nmeasures\n\nof ag(z,_.),\n\nap(z,_,),\n\nand\n\nad(z,_.),\n\n110\n\nand\n\nby\n\ndifference\n\na_(z,_.)=\n\nap(z,_,)-\n\nad(z,L).\n\nOcean ptics rotocols\nO\nP\nforSatellite\nOcean olor\nC Sensor\nValidation,\nRevision\n3\nMethods merging\nfor\nandcomparing\nthetwo independent of absorption\ntypes\nmeasurements,\nandfor\ninterpreting results\nthe\ninterms fremoteensing\no\ns\nreflectance, subject\narethe\nofcurrently\nactive\nresearch\nby\nseveral\ninvestigators.\nFuture\nrevisions\nthisdocument\nmaybeexpected\ntocontain xtensive\ne\nmodifications\nand\nextensions\noftheserotocols.\np\nSingle-Wavelength\n\nTransmissometers\n\nSingle wavelength\ntransmissometers\nbased on Light Emitting Diode (LED) sources have been in\nwidespread\nuse for more than 20 years.

The use of volumetric concentrations\nis critical\nbecause radiative transfer in the ocean, and absorption by pigments, are volumetric processes.\nOne could\nuse the mass concentration\nvalues preferred by JGOFS, but it would be essential to supplement\nthem with\ndensities computed from CTD data, and make the conversion to volumetric\nconcentrations.\nTherefore,\na\ncomplete set of protocols for HPLC measurement\nof phytoplankton\npigment concentrations\nwas added as\nChapter 13 of Revision 2.0 to the Ocean Optics Protocols (Fargion and Mueller 2000), and an updated\nversion of that chapter appears in the present document as Chapter 16. Chapter 16 provides complete\nprotocols\nfor obtaining water samples, filtering them, freezing the filtered samples in liquid nitrogen,\nsample handling and storage, extraction,\nHPLC calibrations\nand measurements,\ndata analysis and quality\ncontrol.\n\nFtuorometric\n\nMeasurement\n\nof Chlorophyll\n\na Concentration\n\n(Chapter\n\n17)\n\nFor reasons similar to those described above for HPLC pigment measurements,\nit was decided that the\nprotocols for fluorometric\nmeasurement\nof chlorophyll\na and phaeopigments\nwere too briefly abstracted\nin\nMueller and Austin (1995). Therefore, new detailed protocols for this measurement\nwere added as Chapter\n14 to Revision 2 (Fargion and Mueller 2000), and an updated version of those protocols\nappears in the\n\n112\n\nOcean ptics rotocols\nO\nP\nforSatellite cean olor\nO\nC Sensor\nValidation,\nRevision\n3\npresent\ndocument\nasChapter Chapter\n17.\n17providesomplete\nc\nprotocols obtaining ater amples,\nfor\nw s\nfilteringthem,reezing\nf\nthefiltered\nsamples liquidnitrogen,\nin\nsampleandling\nh\nandstorage,\nextraction,\nfluorometer\ncalibrations measurements,analysis quality\nand\ndata\nand\ncontrol.\nIn addition,\nChapter\n17discusses\ngeographic\nandtemporal\nvariabilityn therelationship\ni\nbetween\nfluorometrichlorophyll\nc\nconcentrations\nandcombined\nconcentrations total chlorophyll\nof\npigments\ndetermined the HPLCmethods\nby\n(Chapter\n16). It is botheasier ndlessexpensive measure\na\nto\nchlorophyll and pheopigment concentrations using the fluorometric method, which has the added\na\nadvantage\nof allowing shipboard\nanalyses at sea during lengthy cruises.\nWhen these data are used for\nremote sensing algorithm development\nor validation,\nhowever, regional and temporal (i. e. cruise-to-cruise)\ndispersions\nand/or biases may be introduced unless the fluorometric\ndata are first statistically\nadjusted (on a\nlocal basis) to agree with HPLC determinations\nof the concentration\nof total chlorophylls.\nA cost-effective\nstrategy is to acquire, on each cruise, a majority of filtered pigment samples for fluorometric\nchlorophyll\na\nand pheopigment\nanalysis, supplemented\nby a smaller number of replicate samples for HPLC pigment\nanalysis.\nThe HPLC replicates should provide a representative\ndistribution\nover geographic\nlocation, depth\nand time during a cruise, and will be used to determine\na local regression relationship\nbetween the two\nmeasurements.\nThis approach\nis now required for pigment data submitted for SeaBASS\narchival and\nSIMBIOS validation analysis.\nFinally, Chapter 17 includes protocols for measuring and analyzing profiles of in situ fluorescence\nby\nchlorophyll\na, F(z) (Table 3.1). Together with c(z,660) profiles (Section 9.4), the structure of F(z) provides\nvaluable guidance\nfor selecting depths of water samples,\nanalyses of structure\nin K(z,_,) derived\nfrom\nradiometric\nprofiles, and various aspects of quality control analysis.\nIt is often useful to also digitally\nrecord one-minute\naverages\nof F(z, lat, lon) in water pumped\nfrom a near-surface\ndepth (z- 3 m) to\nmeasure horizontal variability while underway steaming between stations, especially in water masses where\nmesoscale\nand sub-mesoscale\nvariability is strong (Section 9.2). If supplemented\nby frequent fluorometric\nchlorophyll\na samples filtered from the flow-through\nsystem, the alongtrack profile of F(z, lat, lon) can be\ncalibrated\nin units of chlorophyll\na concentration\n(mg m- ).\n\nPhycoerythrin\n\nand other Phycobiliproteins\n\nR_(_)\nmay be enhanced by fluorescence\nby phycoerythrin\n(PE) in a band near 565 nm (e.g. Hoge et\nal. 1998; Wood et al. 1999). The detection from aircraft of laser-induced\nphycoerythrin\nfluorescence\nis\nalready well established\n(Hoge et al. 1998).\nIt is more difficult to detect and quantify\nsolar induced\nphycoerythrin\nfluorescence,\nbut some work has been done in that area as well (Morel et al. 1993; Morel\n1997; Hoge et al. 1999; Subramaniam\net al. 1999).\nVarious phycoerythrins\ndiffer from one another in chromophore\ncomposition.\nAll phycoerythrins\ncontain phycoerythrobilin\ncttromophores\n[PEB; maximum a(_,) near k - 550 nm]; many others also contain\nphycourobilin\nchromophores\n[PUB; maximum\na(7_) near _-500nm],\nwhich extends\nthe range of\nwavelengths\nabsorbed\nby the pigment molecule into the blue regions of the spectrum.\nThe ratio of\nPUB:PEB\nchromophores\nin the PE pigments synthesized\nby different Synechococcus\nstrains greatly affects\nthe absorption\nspectrum of the whole ceils (Wood et aI. 1985). Clearly, the dependence\nof a(_,) on the\nPUB:PEB\nratio of phycoerythrin\nwill affect also Rm(k) in water masses dominated by cyanobacteria.\nThe\nPUB:PEB\nratio for the PE in a given water mass may be characterized\nusing scanning\nfluorescence\nspectroscopy\n(Wood et al., 1999; Wyman, 1992).\nThe measurement\nof phycoerythrin\nis not yet as routine, nor as accurate, as the measurements\nof\nchlorophylls\nand carotenoids.\nThe techniques\nintroduced\nby Stewart and Farmer (1984) work well for\nmeasuring biliproteins\nin freshwater\nand estuarine species, but are less successful for natural populations\nof\nmarine species.\nWyman (1992) reported a linear relationship\nbetween the in vivo fluorescence\nemission\nintensity of PE measured in the presence of glycerol and the PE content of Synechococcus\nstrain WH7803.\nScanning\nspectral fluorescence\nmeasurements\nhave been used to estimate PE concentration\nof extracted\nbulk samples (Vernet et al., 1990). Nevertheless,\nthere are few direct measurements\nof separated PE\nproteins\nfrom natural samples.\nHigh Performance\nCapillary\nElectrophoresis\n(HPCE)\nis a powerful\nanalytical\ntool currently\nused in clinical,\nbiochemical,\npharmaceutical,\nforensic,\nand environmental\nresearch.\nIn HPCE, high voltages (typically 10-30 KV) are used to separate molecules\nrapidly in narrow-\n\n113\n\nOcean ptics rotocols\nO\nP\nforSatellite cean olor ensor\nO\nC S\nValidation,\nRevision\n3\nbore\n(25-100.m),used-silica\ng f\ncapillaries ondifferencesthecharge-to-mass theanalytes.\nbased\nin\nratioof\nHPCE anautomated\nis\nanalytical\nseparation\nsystem\nwithreduced\nanalysis andon-line\ntimes\nquantification\nof compounds,\nideallysuitedto the separation\nandquantification water-soluble\nof\nproteins\n(like\nphycobilins)\nfromseawater.\nHPCE\nmethods\nforseparation\nanalyses\nofphycoerythrin\nfromcyanobacterial\nculturesndnatural\na\nsamples\narecurrentlynder evelopment\nu\nd\nandmay\nbeincluded future\nina\nrevision\nto\ntheoceanptics\no\nprotocols\n(C.Kinkade, Comm.).\nPers.\nSuspended\n\nParticulate\n\nMatter\n\nAll total suspended\nas outlined in Strickland\n\nparticulate\nmaterial (TSM) dry weight (mg L q) will be determined\ngravimetrically\nand Parsons (1972) 5. In general, samples are filtered through preweighed 0.4 \xe2\x80\xa2 m\n\npolycarbonate\nfilters. The filters are washed with three 2.5 -5.0 mL aliquots of DIW and immediately\ndried, either in an oven at 75 \xc2\xb0 C, or in a dessicator.\nThe filters are then reweighed\nin a laboratory, back on\nshore, using an electrobalance\nwith at least seven digits of precision.\nParticle\n\nSize Distributions\n\nParticle size distributions can potentially provide important information about the shape of the volume\nscattering function, which strongly influences\nthe bidirectional\naspects of remote-sensing\nreflectance\n(Chapter 13 and, e.g., Morel and Gentili 1996). Particle size distributions have been measured for many\nyears using Coulter Counters and related to IOP, including c(_) (e.g. Kitchen et al. 1982). More recently,\nseveral investigators\nhave used the Spectrix Particle Size Analyzer to measure particle size distributions.\nAgain, specific\nmanufacturers\nand equipment\nitems ate mentioned\nhere as examples\nonly and no\nrecommendations\nare to be implied. Protocols for measurements\nand analyses of particle size distributions\n(e.g., Chapter 11) are not included in this version of the ocean optics protocols, but should be written and\nadded to a future revision.\n\n9.6 ANCILLARY\n\nMEASUREMENTS\n\nAND METADATA\n\nThe "Required"\nand "Highly Desired" ancillary measurements\nand metadata are listed in Table 3.1.\nAncillary observations are often of key importance in flagging and interpreting apparently aberrant data. In\naddtion, some of ancillary measurements\nare essential for corrections to optical measurements, for example\nthe Temperature and Salinity dependence of spectral absorption by pure water must be used in the\nprocessing and analysis of AC9 data (Pegau and Zaneveld 1993; Pegau et aL 1997). Metadata peculiar to a\nparticular type of measurement,\nsuch as instrument calibration\ninformation,\nserial numbers, etc., are\nspecificied in the protocols for making those measurements.\nThe present section identifies recommended\nmethods for acquiring and recording the information and data of more general applicability.\n\nLogbooks\nThe person, or group, making a particular set of measurements\nnormally maintains a separate logbook\nto record complete metadata unique to a particular instrument, including names of measurement\nand dark\nreference data files. It is the chief scientist\'s\nresponsibility\nto also maintain a master logbook in which\nessential metadata\n(event, time, location) and general environmental\nconditions\nare recorded to link all\nmeasurements\nand samples acquired at each station.\nAt the end of each cruise, the chief scientist should\nalso obtain a photocopy\nof the ship\'s bridge log from the vessel\'s master.\n\nWind Speed and Direction\nIf possible, anemometer\nmeasurements\nof wind speed and direction should be recorded continuously\nthroughout each station, and underway between stations if alongtrack data are recorded.\nAs a precaution,\nthe wind speed and direction should be read and recorded manually in the master and individual instrument\n\ns In previous versions of the Ocean Optics Protocols (Mueller and Austin 1992, 1995; Fargion and Mueller\n2000), it was incorrectly\nstated that suitable protocols were part of the JGOFS core measurements\nprotocols\n(UNESCO\n1994). The JGOFS protocols do not include TSM measurements\nof the type specified here.\n\n114\n\nOcean ptics rotocols\nO\nP\nforSatellite cean Sensor\nO Color\nValidation,\nRevision\n3\nlogentries each\nfor\nmeasurement during station.f theonlyavailablenemometer\nmade\na\nI\na\nis notdigitally\nrecorded, manual\nthese\nlogentries illobviouslyethe\nw\nb\nonlyrecord\navailable.\nBarometric\n\nPressure\n\nSurface barometric\npressure should be read from both the ship\'s barometer,\nand from any barometer\nthat is part of an automatically\nrecorded meteorological\nsystem, and recorded in the chief scientist\'s\nmaster\nlogbook.\nThis information\nshould be manually logged at the beginning,\nend, and hourly during sampling at\neach station. If possible, it is also desirable to digitally record barometric\npressure, along with wind speed\nand direction,\nthroughout\neach station and while steaming\nbetween\nstations,\nif other alongtrack\nmeteorological\ndata are recorded.\n\nCloud\n\nConditions\n\nThe percent of the sky covered by clouds should be logged at the time of each measurement\nevent.\nIdentification\nof cloud types, including such comments\nas "thin cirrus", is "Highly Desired",\nbut not\n"Required"\n(Table 3.1). It is also very useful, for broken and partial overcast conditions,\nto comment\non\nthe relationship\nbetween locations of clouds and the zenith and azimuth angles of the sun and satellite, and\nwhether the sun is occluded.\nFor validation cruises, predictions\nof approximate\nsatellite and solar zenith\nand azimuth angles for given locations and days are available on request from the SIMBIOS Project Office.\nAll-sky photographs,\nusing a digital camera equipped with a fisheye lens are useful documentation\nof\nsky conditions.\nDigital photographs\nof segments of the sky, using a camera with a smaller field-of-view\nlens, are also useful if annotated with zenith and azimuth pointing angles.\n\nWave Height\nThe overall wave height, peak to trough in m, estimated visually by a trained and experienced\nobserver\nis adequate for purposes of these protocols.\nAs is explained in any introductory\ntextbook\non general\noceanography,\nthis type of height estimate closely corresponds\nto Significant\nWave Height, defined as the\naverage\nof the highest one-third\nwaves in a 20 min record\nof measured\nwave _nplitudes.\nMore\nsophisticated\nmeasurements\nof ocean surface wave characteristics\nare beyond the scope of these protocols.\nWhere the protocols for a particular measurement\nrequire it, e.g. above-water\nremote-sensing\nreflectance\nprotocols\n\n(Chapter\n\n12) or computation\n\nof/__\n\n(_,), the wave slope spectrum\n\nis calculated\n\nfrom wind speed.\n\nEstimates of the percent of the surface covered by whitecaps are also useful as comments,\nbut this may\nusually be adequately estimated from wind speed as well. Digital photographs\nof the sea surface conditions\nare useful documentation\nof sea state and whitecap conditions at the time of radiometric measurements.\n\nSecchi\n\nDepth\n\nA Secchi Disk is a white circular disk, approximately\n25 cm in diameter, attached to a line marked with\na stripe at 25 cm intervals and a broader stripe (or double stripe) at each full meter. A lead weight (-5 Kg)\nis attached to the bottom of the rig to maintain the disk in a horizontal orientation as it is lowered and raised\nthrough the water. The disk should be lowered through the ship\'s shadow on the side away from the sun to\nreduce surface glint. The observer pays out the line, lowering the disk until it just disappears from his view\nand then raises it until just the depth where it again becomes discernable.\nThe depth indicated by the line\nmarkings at the water surface when the disk disappears from the observer\'s\nview is recorded\nas Secchi\ndepth in m.\nAt depths shallower than Secchi depth, the high reflectance of the white disk (~90 %) produces a target\nwith strong visual contrast to the lower reflectance\n(-2 %) of the ambient water column.\nAs the disk is\nlowered deeper in the water, irradiance illuminating\nthe disk is reduced and the light reflected\nfrom it is\nalso attenuated\nduring its transmittance\nto the sea surface.\nTherefore,\nthe apparent contrast between the\ntarget and surrounding\nwater is reduced with increasing depth, until at Secchi depth, the contrast disappears\nbetween\nthe target and water column.\nThe reader interested\nin a more quantitative\nanalysis\nand\ninterpretation\nof Secchi depth should begin with the treatment by Preisendorfer\n(1986).\n\n115\n\nOcean ptics rotocols\nO\nP\nforSatellite\nOcean olor\nC Sensor\nValidation,\nRevision\n3\nSecchi\ndepth\nshould\nbetaken\natleast nce\no ateach\nstation\nandrecorded\ninthechiefscientist\'s\nmaster\nlog,andin theseparate\nlogbooks aintained\nm\nforradiometric,\nIOPandCTD-Rosette\nprofiles.It is the\nauthor\'s\nexperience\nthatin optically\ndeep\nwater asses,\nm\nSecchi\ndepths, m, display strong\nin\na\nlinear\ncorrelation K(490) -1, also in m. K(490) is the diffuse attenuation coefficient Ka(z,490) averaged over\nwith\nthe top diffuse\n\nattenuation\n\nlength,\n\nand its inverse corresponds\n\nto the depth\n\nat which\n\nmeasured\n\nEd(z,490)\n\nis\n\n37 % of Eel(0, 490). A useful quality control procedure\nis to plot Secchi depth against K(490) for every\nstation on a cruise. Departures\nfrom a strong linear trend between these variables are indicative of either\nsuspect data, or of anomalous conditions.\nFor instance, if bottom reflectance is significant at a station, then\nthe Secchi depth from that station will be significantly\nless than that predicted by its deep water correlation\nwith K(490) 1. This occurs because the ambient background\nbrightness is enhanced by light reflected by\nthe bottom, and the disk\'s contrast disappears\nat a shallower\ndepth that would have occurred\nin deeper\nwater with the same K(490).\n\nConduct&ity,\n\nTemperature\n\nand Depth ( CTD) Profiles\n\nAlthough Temperature\nT(z) and Salinity S(z) profiles measured with a CTD are listed as only "Highly\nDesired" in Table 3.1, these measurements\nare essential for corrections\nto in situ absorption\nmeasurements\n(see above).\nMoreover,\nthe availability\nof a combined CTD and Rosette-sampling\nsystem strongly affects\nthe quality of discrete water samples acquired to measure phytoplankton\npigment concentrations,\nwhich are\nimportant "Required"\nmeasurements.\nThis is particularly\ntrue if the CTD+Rosette\nsystem is also equipped\nwith a single-wavelength\nbeam transmissometer\nto measure, e.g., c(z,660) (Section 9.4), and a fluorometer\nto measure in situ chlorophyll\na fluorescence\nintensity F(z) (Section 9.5). The recommended\nsampling\nprotocol is to measure, and display in real time on a computer monitor during the downcast, profiles of\nT(z), S(z), the sea water density anomaly ct(z), c(z,660),\nand F(z). The profile of ct(z) provides the best\nindicator of the depth of the mixed layer and strength of the underlying pycnocline.\nStructure in the T(z)\nand S(z) profiles may be used to indicate the presence of interleaving\nwater masses with possibly different\nbit-optical\norigins and characteristics.\nThe F(z) profiles will identify depths of subsurface\nmaxima and\nstrong\n\ngradient\n\nfeatures\n\nin the chlorophyll\n\nprofile.\n\nThe\n\ncp (z,660)=c(z,660)-c,,\n\n(z,660)\n\nprofile\n\nwill\n\nreveal depths of gradients,\nmaxima, and minima in the concentration\nof suspended\nparticulates.\nThis\ngraphical information\ncan be used to quickly select appropriate\ndepths at which water samples will best\nrepresent the bit-optical\nstructure\nof the water column.\nFinally, during the upcast, the CTD+Rosette\npackage is stopped at each selected depth, a selected bottle is closed, and its identification\nnumber and\ndigitally displayed depth from the CTD unit are recorded in the water sample log.\nThe combined\nCTD, transmissometer\nand fluorescence\nprofiles should be measured\nin conjunction\nwith, preferably\nimmediately\nbefore and after, the irradiance\nand radiance profile measurements.\nThis is\nfeasible,\nbecause\nmore than one cast is typically\nrequired\nto obtain enough water samples\nfor all\nmeasurements\non each station. The cp(z,660) and F(z) profiles are very useful as guides for, and constraints\non, the determinations\nof attenuation coefficients\nK(z,7_) from the radiometric profiles (Chapter 10). These\ndata are also useful information\nfor analyses to develop and validate pigment and primary productivity\nalgorithms.\nVertical profiles of CTD should be measured\nto at least the depth of the deepest bit-optical\nprofile. If the station schedule will permit it, sections of CTD casts extending to 500 m, or deeper, will be\nuseful for computing relative quasi-geostrophic\ncurrents and shear that may affect the advection and mixing\nof bit-optical\nproperties during a cruise.\nIf possible, a few deep (1,500 m depth or greater) CTD and bottle sample profiles should be made\nduring each cruise to obtain data for calibrating\nthe L-_fD\'s conductivity\nprobe.\nDuring these CTD\ncalibration\ncasts, water samples should be taken at depths where the vertical gradient of salinity is very\nsmall.\nThis practice\nwill minimize\nerrors in the conductivity\ncalibration\nresulting\nfrom the spatial\nseparation\nof the water bottle and CTD profile. The bottled salinity samples may be stored for post-cruise\nanalyses ashore at a laboratory\nequipped with an accurate salinometer and IAPSO Standard Seawater, if\nsuitable equipment and standard water are not available aboard the ship (Section 4.9).\nEach CTD profile should be prefiltered to remove any depth reversal segments resulting from violent\nship or hydrowire motions.\nThis will remove many instances of salinity spiking, an artifact which occurs\nwhen water temperature\nchanges at a faster rate than the conductivity\nprobe can follow.\nThe CTD data\n\n116\n\nOcean ptics rotocols\nO\nP\nforSatellite cean Sensor\nO Color\nValidation,\nRevision\n3\nshould\nthenbeprocessed\ntoprofilesf\no\n\npotential temperature (\xc2\xb0C), salinity (Practical Salinity Units [PSU]\nbased on the Practical Salinity Scale of 1978, PSS78), and density (kg m"s) using the algorithms that have\nbeen\nendorsed\nby\nthe\nUnited\nNations\nEducational,\nScientific,\nand\nCultural\nOrganization\n(UNESCO)/SCOR/International\nCouncil\nof Exploration\nof the Seas (ICES)/IAPSO\nJoint Panel\non\nOceanographic\nTables and Standards, and also by SCOR Working Group 51 (Fofonoff and Millard 1983).\nAt this stage, each set of CTD profiles should be carefully examined to detect any significant\nstatic\ninstability artifacts resulting from salinity spiking.\nAfter any such major artifacts are removed by editing,\nthe data should be further smoothed by averaging temperature and conductivity\ndata into 2 m depth bins,\nand the final profiles of salinity, density, and other derived parameters\nshould be recomputed\nusing the\nsmoothed CTD profile.\nFor any hydrographic\nstation,\ndescriptive\nhydrographic\nanalyses\nshould\ninclude\nT-S profile\ncharacterizations\nof water masses.\nFeatures in the density profile that appear to be related to physical\nmixing and stability should be compared\nwith features in the corresponding\nbio-optical\nprofiles.\nCTD\nprofiles from horizontal transects (i.e., two-dimensional\ngrids) should be used in the computation\nof twodimensional\nsections,\nor three-dimensional\ngridded arrays, for such variables\nas geostrophic\ncurrents,\ntemperature,\nsalinity, and the density anomaly t_t. These analysis products, together with corresponding\ntwo- or three-dimensional\nrepresentations\nof bio-optical\nvariability,\ncan be used to estimate the relative\nimportance\nof advection and isopycnal mixing in redistributing\nor modifying upper ocean optical properties\nduring a cruise.\n\nMetadata\nFor each water sample and measured variable (of all categories) listed in Table 3.1, it is critical to\nrecord the date, time (UTC), and geographic\nposition (latitude and longitude in decimal degrees to the\nnearest 0.001 \xc2\xb0) of its acquisition or measurement.\nPosition and time metadata should be obtained using a\nGlobal\n\nPositioning\n\nSystem\n\nreceiver,\n\nif possible.\n\nDepths of measurements\nmade with profiling instruments\nare usually recorded electronically\nin the\nprofile data records and files.\nIf measurements\nare made at depths determined\nby means other than a\npressure transducer\nintegrated with the data acquisition system, then the source of that information\nmust be\nlogged (e.g. reference\nto another file containing\ntime synchronized\ndepth records from an independent\ninstrument on the same package).\nIn the case of a visually read depth scale (e.g. line markings, or a rigid\nscale attached above an instrument),\nas is sometimes done to obtain depths with uncertainty < 1 em in very\nturbid Case-2 waters under calm conditions, each individual depth must be identified with the measurement\nand entered in a logbook.\nThe depth from which each water sample is acquired must be recorded in a log, together with all other\ninformation\nrequired for each measurement\nto be made from that sample, including pigments (Chapters\n16\nand 17) and spectrophotometric\nabsorption measurements\n(Chapter 15). This depth is ordinarily read from\nthe CTD system attached to a rosette sampler.\nIf a CTD, or other instrument equipped with a pressure\ntransducer, and rosette sampler are not used (e.g. as with bottles hung directly on the hydro-wire),\nthen the\nmethod used to determine bottle depth on closing must be fully described, together with an estimate of the\nuncertainty\nin each depth, in comments accompanying\nthe data.\nWire angles should be logged at different depths\nThese entries are critically important\nfor radiometric\nsystem is not used.\n\nduring each instrument\nand bottle sampling cast.\ncasts, and for bottle casts when a CTD+Rosette\n\nThe depth of the water column should be read from the vessel\'s fathometer and recorded in the log. If\nthe water depth exceeds the range of the fathometer, the recorded depth should be taken from a navigation\nchart. The distance off the ship of a profiling radiometer, and its direction, and that of the sun, relative to\nthe ship\'s heading provides an important\nindication\nof the likelihood that ship shadow effects may be\npresent in the data. Similarly, the ship\'s heading relative to the sun may help identify possible shading (or\nreflection) artifacts in Es(3.) if the shipboard reference radiometer cannot be mounted higher than all masts,\nantennas, and superstructure\nelements.\nIt is usually adequate to simply enter a sketch in the log showing\nthe sun and package positions relative to the ship.

The protocols used to acquire time series data at the\nhighly specialized MOBY observatory, as a primary reference for vicarious calibration of satellite ocean\ncolor sensors,\nare documented\nhere in Chapter 11.\nOther examples\nof long-term\nmoored\narrays\nincorporating commercially available radiometers of the same type used for underwater profiles (Chapters\n5, 6 and 10) include the bio-optical\nsensors on the Tropical Atmosphere Ocean mooring array (Chavez et\nal. 1998), the Bermuda Test-bed Mooring (Dickey 1995) and a mooring in Bedford Basin (Cullen et al.\n1997).\nExamples of radiometers mounted on drifting buoys, and applications to ocean color science, are\ndescribed in Abbott et al. (1995) and Cullen et aL (1997).\nThe applications of moored radiometric arrays within a satellite ocean color validation sampling\nstrategy axe briefly described in Section 9.3. There is a powerful potential for combining satellite ocean\ncolor imagery with data from moored and drifting radiometers and bio-optical\nsensors for cost-effective\nlong term monitoring of the ocean. A prime example of this potential was the description of the biological\nand chemical response of the Equatorial Pacific Ocean to the 1997-98 E1 Nino observed by combining time\nseries of SeaWiFS and AVHRR imagery with bio-optical and chemical data from the TAO array (Chavez\net al. 1999).\nCullen et at. (1997) and Schofield et al. (1999) discuss the combined roles of optical buoys\nand satellite ocean color image data in proposed systems for monitoring\nharmful algal blooms.\nAlthough\nthe present scope of the Ocean Optics Protocols does not embrace a monitoring\nsampling strategy, it may\nbe appropriate and beneficial to do so in a future revision.\nIt is planned\n\nto add a new chapter to future revision\n\nof these protocols\n\nthat will further address the\n\nspecialized\naspects of radiometric, IOP and fluorometric measurements\nfrom buoys.\nThese special\nconsiderations\ninclude the need to extrapolate radiometric measurements\nmade at fixed near-surface depths\nto the surface, and bio-fouling\nof windows\nand other optical surfaces during extended,\nunattended\ndeployments.\nIn the present version of the protocols (Revision 3), some of these topics are covered in\nChapter 11, as they apply to the MOBY radiometric observatory.\nThe new chapter will address more\ngeneral applications\nand methods associated with long-term deployments\nof moored and drifting biooptical buoys that cannot be tended to as frequently and closely as is MOBY.\n\n9.9 AIRBORNE\n\nMEASUREMENTS\n\nMany references are made in the protocols, for example in Section 9.2, to potential applications of\nairborne measurements\nin validation of satellite ocean color systems and data products.\nUnfortunately,\nprotocols comparable to those in Chapters 5, 6 and 10- 12, describing accepted instruments and methods\nfor in situ ocean radiometry, have not yet been distilled and articulated for airborne remote sensing.\nAn\neffort will be made to enlist the input of such protocols from key members of the aircraft ocean remote\nsensing community\nas an addition to a future protocol revision. For the present, some of the discussion of\nthis topic in Mueller and Austin (1995) is abstracted below.\nAirborne\nmeasurements of fluorescence\nby chlorophyll, CDOM, and phycoerythrin,\nboth by LASER\nand solar excitation, are useful to evaluate spatial and temporal variability near ship and mooring stations\nand to provide independent assessments ofbio-optical\nalgorithms (e.g. Hoge et al. 1998, 1999).\nAirborne\nocean color data may also be used to determine spatial variability in ocean optical properties\nduring shipboard\nalgorithm development and validation experiments.\nOcean color may be measured\nfrom\naircraft using either imaging radiometers\n(usually flown at high altitude),\nor single FOV spectral\nradiometers\n(usually\nflown at low altitude to measure profiles of ocean color beneath\nan aircraft\'s\n\n118\n\nOcean ptics rotocols\nO\nP\nforSatellite\nOcean olor ensor\nC S\nValidation,\nRevision\n3\ntrackline). ircraftmeasurements thehorizontal\nA\nobserve\nvariabilityn ocean\ni\ncolorradiance\nspectran\no\nspatial\nscales\nthataremuch\nsmaller individual\nthan\npixels satelliteceanolorimages;\nin\no\nc\ntherefore,\nthese\ndata\naremore\ncomparable\ntoshipboard\nmeasurements.\nAt aqualitative thisinformation\nlevel,\ncanindicate\nhowwellshipboard\nradiometric\nandbio-optical\nmeasurements\ncanbecompared satellite cean\nto\no\ncolor\ndataat typically\n1Km pixelresolution.n thiscontext,\nI\nairborne\nocean\ncolormeasurements be\nwill\nespecially\nvaluable productive\nin\nCase-1nd\na Case-2 aters,\nw\nwhere\nvariabilityn oceanptical roperties\ni\no\np\ncanbelarge\novermesoscale\nandsmaller\ndistances.\nSynoptic aps ocean\nm of\ncolordistributions\ncanbe\nadvantageously toguide\nutilized\nsampling\nbyships.They\ncanalso\nbeused\ntoplace\nin-water froman\ndata\nindividual\nstation context ithrespect nearby\nin\nw\nto\nvariability,\nandthusprovide basisfor spatial\na\ninterpolation averaging comparing\nand\nwhen\nin-water\nbio-optical\nmeasurements e.g., SeaWiFS image\nwith,\ndata.

Moreover, accurate corrections must be applied for atmospheric and surface\nreflection (sun and sky glitter) effects. Methods for atmospheric correction and estimation of normalized\nwater-leaving\nradiances from high altitude airborne ocean color imagery are nearly identical to, and as\nchallenging as, those methods which must be applied to satellite ocean color sensor data itself (Carder et al.\n1993 and Hamilton et al. 1993).\nThese problems and their solutions lie beyond the scope of the ocean\noptical protocols per se, at least in this revision.\n\nREFERENCES\nAbbott, M.R., K.H.

To accomplish\nthis, the\ninstrument\nmust be deployed from the stern, with the sun\'s relative bearing aft of the beam. Yet a better\napproach is to deploy a free falling, profiling radiometer well away from the ship on an umbilical tether.\nEstimates\ngiven\n\nof the minimum\n\nbelow.\n\nmeasurements,\n\nThe\n\ndistances\n\nthe general\n\ndistance\nare\n\nequation\n\naway\n\nexpressed\n\nfrom the ship, under\nin attenuation\n\nfor distance\n\nlengths\n\naway, _ in meters,\n\nconditions\n\nof clear sunny\n\nto minimize\n\nerror.\n\nFor\n\nskies,\n\nare\n\nE d (z,_L)\n\nis given as\n\nsin (48.4 \xc2\xb0 )\nThe distance\n\nfrom the ship is required\n\nKa (_.)\n\nto be 3IK, (_.) m for E, (z,_,)\n\n(10.1)\nand 1.5/K L (_,) m for L, (z,_,)\n\nmeasurements.\nThese distances should be increased if the instrument is deployed off the beam of a large\nvessel.\nA variety of methods have been used to deploy optical instruments\nbeyond the influence\nof the\nship. During CZCS algorithm development,\nfloating plastic frames were equipped with small winches and\ninstruments\nto obtain near surface optical profiles at some distance away from the ship. An umbilical cable\nprovided power and data transfer. These platforms, while being somewhat difficult to deploy, worked well\nat avoiding ship shadow.\nAlternatively,\nextended booms can be used to deploy the instrument away from\nthe ship and have the advantages\nof allowing relatively rapid deployment\nand simultaneous\nrosette bottle\nsampling.\nAs a point of caution, however, very long booms may accentuate unwanted vertical motions due\nto ship pitch and roll.\nWaters et al. (1990) used an optical free-fall instrument (OFFI) that allows optical data to be obtained\noutside the influence\nof ship perturbation.\nIn addition, the OFFI approach allows optical data to be\nobtained\nindependently\nfrom violent ship motion, which may be transmitted to the instrument\nvia the\nhydrowire,\nespecially\non a long boom.\nOver the past few years, OFFI-like\nradiometer systems have\nbecome commercially\navailable from several manufacturers\nand have found widespread\nuse in the ocean\ncolor community.\nIn comparisons\nbetween several deployment\nconfigurations\n(Hooker and Maritorena\n2000), free-fall\nradiometer systems, in combination\nwith shipboard\nsurface irradiance\nsensors, yielded\nwater-leaving\nradiances with the lowest uncertainties.\nYet another method for the deployment\nof optical\nsensors is via an ROV. Some groups, e.g., Smith (pers. comm.), have deployed a spectrometer\non an ROV\nand obtained data completely free of ship influences.\nThe above criteria for ship shadow avoidance are admittedly\nvery conservative.\nabove cited models and observations\nprovide only approximate\nguidance on minimum\nship reflectance\nand shadow effects\nbecome\ninsignificant\nunder all circumstances.\n\n124\n\nUnfortunately,\nthe\ndistances at which\nTherefore,\nthe\n\nOcean ptics rotocols\nO\nP\nforSatellite cean olor ensor\nO\nC S\nValidation,\nRevision\n3\nSIMBIOS\nocean\nspecific\neffects\n\noptics protocols\ncombinations\nof lighting\nmay become\nunimportant\n\ninvestigator\n\nestablishes\n\nthat\n\nembrace relatively extreme distance criteria, recognizing\nconditions,\nships and optical properties,\nship shadow,\nmuch closer to the ship.\nThe essential\nrequirement\nmeasurements\n\nany\n\nthat in many\nand reflection\nis that each\nsubmitted\n\nof\n\nEd(z,X\n\n),\n\nE u (z,_,),\n\nSIMBIOS validation and algorithm development\nare free from ship-induced\nthis is to adhere to the above distance criterion, which is not difficult when\nsystem or instruments\nmounted on an ROV. In other cases, it is incumbent\ndemonstrate\nthe absence of ship effects, e.g., through analysis of a series of\n\nDepth\n\nResolution\n\nand\n\nL u (z,_.)\n\nerrors. The simplest way to do\nusing either a tethered free-fall\non the investigator\nto otherwise\nprofiles at increasing distance.\n\nin Profiles\n\nThe instrument sampling rate and the speed at which the instrument is lowered or raised through\nwater column should yield at least two, and preferably six to eight, samples per meter.\n\nInstrument\n\nfor\n\nthe\n\nDark Readings\n\nThe dark current of optical sensors is frequently temperature\ndependent.\nAs a consequence,\naccurate\nradiometric\nmeasurements\nrequire that careful attention\nbe given to dark current variability.\nIt is\nrecommended\nthat each optical measurement\nbe accompanied\nby a measurement\nof the instrument\ndark\ncurrent.\nWhen there is a large temperature\ndifference between the instrument on the deck and the water\ntemperature,\nthe instrument\nshould be allowed\nto equilibrate\nwith ambient\nwater temperature\nat the\nbeginning of each cast.\nDeep casts, e.g., 500 m, may permit the determination\nof the dark current in each optical channel at the\nbottom of each cast. Many instruments are not designed to be lowered safely to 500 m, however, and this\napproach\nis usually\nnot feasible.\nFurthermore,\nthere is some intrinsic\nuncertainty\nover possible\ncontamination\nby bioluminescence\nwhen dark readings are obtained in this way.\nIf the instrument\nis\nequipped\nwith a shutter, dark currents can be measured at any depth in the cast. If the dark current is not\ndetermined\nduring the cast, it should be determined\nas soon as possible after the instrument is returned to\nthe deck.\nTemperature\neffects on sensor responsivity\ncan be significant and should not be ignored.\nTherefore,\nsensors should be equipped with thermistors\non detector mounting surfaces to monitor temperatures\nfor\ndata correction.\nOtherwise,\ndeck storage should be under thermally\nprotected\nconditions\nprior to\ndeployment\nand on-deck determination\nof dark voltages.\ne\n\nSurface\n\nIncident\n\nIrradiance\n\nAtmospheric\nvariability,\nespecially under cloud cover, leads directly to variability of the in-water light\nfield and must be corrected to obtain accurate estimations of optical properties\nfrom irradiance or radiance\nprofiles.\nFirst order corrections for this variability can be made using above water (on deck) measurements\nof downwelling\n(1990)\n\nspectral\n\ntheoretically\n\nmeasurements\n\ncomputed\n\nto correct\n\nThe deck sensor\n\nirradiance,\n\nin-water\n\nE s (_.) = E d (0*,_,).\n\nthe irradiance\n\njust\n\nbelow\n\nSmith and Baker\nthe air-water\n\n(1984)\n\ninterface,\n\nand Baker\nE, (0-,_.),\n\nan improved,\n\nversions\n\nfrom\n\ndeck\n\nprofile data.\n\nmust be properly\n\ngimbaled\n\nto avoid large errors\n\nin E s (L)\n\ndue to ship motion\n\nseaway.\nImproper\ngimballing can actually accentuate\nsensor motion under some circumstances,\nand this aspect of a shipboard radiometer system must be engineered with some care.\nIn early\n\nand Smith\n\nof the ocean optics protocols\n\nmore direct determination\n\nof E d (0-,_.)\n\n(Mueller\n\nand Austin\n\nmight be obtained\n\n1992,\n\nhowever,\n\n1995), it was suggested\n\nby deploying\n\na floating\n\nin a\n\nthat\n\ninstrument\n\nto obtain continuous downwelling\nirradiance data just below the air-water interface (Waters et al. 1990).\nOver the past several years, instruments implementing\nthis concept have become commercially\navailable\nand the ocean color community\nhas used them extensively.\nUnfortunately,\nexperience has demonstrated\nthat downwelling\nirradiance\nfluctuations\nassociated\nwith focusing and defocusing\nof sunlight by surface\n\n125\n\nOcean ptics rotocols\nO\nP\nforSatellite cean Sensor\nO Color\nValidation,\nRevision\n3\nwavesenders measurements\nr\nsuch\nfarnoisier measurements\nthan\n\nof E s (_,) made above the sea surface.\n\nA\n\nvariant on this approach, wherein the sensor is floated away from the ship but is elevated a meter or so\nabove the water surface, has proved to be a viable alternative,\nespecially\nin circumstances\nwhen it is\nimpossible\nto install and/or gimbal a deck cell properly.\n\nInstrument\n\nAttitude\n\nAn instrument\'s\nand\n\nE u (z,_,),\n\nattitude\n\nwith respect\n\nand is only slightly\n\nto the vertical\n\nless critical\n\nis a critical\n\nfor L u (z,_,).\n\nfactor\n\nin measurements\n\nRoll and pitch\n\nsensors\n\nof E d (z,L)\n\nmust,\n\ntherefore,\n\nbe\n\ninstalled in the underwater\nradiometers\nused for acquiring SIMBIOS validation data.

Averaging\nover such a\nlarge interval also causes the slopes in sharply defined layers, e.g., regions of high gradients, to be poorly\nrepresented.\nAttempts to reduce these effects by using a significantly\nsmaller depth interval often results in\nunacceptably\nnoisy K(z,2,) profiles.\nAn alternative\nexpressed\n\nmethod\n\nof determining\n\nin terms of diffuse attenuation\n\nK-profiles\n\ndepth (optical\n\nOVlueller 1995)\ndepth)\n\nx(z,L)\n\nis to keep (10.9)\n\nin integral\n\nform,\n\nas\n\nFe(0-)q\nThe K-profile is represented\nanalytically by Hermitian cubic polynomials\nwith unknown coefficients,\nconsisting of K(z_) and its derivative dK(zn)/dz, at each of several discrete depths dividing the profile into\nfinite depth elements.\n[Hermitian cubic polynomials\nare defined in any text on finite element modeling,\ne.g., Pinder and Gray (1977).]\nThe measured set of equations (10.12), corresponding\nto each measured\nvalue E(z) in the profile and depth z in the prof\'fle, are assembled into matrix form and the unknown\nset of\ncoefficients\nK(zn) and dK(z_)/dz are determined\nusing classical least-squares\nminimization.\nE(0") must be\nspecified externally,\nand in the current implementation\nis estimated from the profile itself and adjusted\niteratively to yield a minimum least-squares\nsolution to the overall profile.\nThe complete formulation\nof\nthe method is given in Mueller (1995). Compared to results of the derivative solution, the integral method\nyields significantly\nmore detailed representation\nof very sharp layers in bio-optical\nprofiles\n(when\ncompared to concurrent\nbeam attenuation and chlorophyll\nfluorescence\nprofiles).\nThe integral solution is\nmore robust in handling data gaps, e.g. due to extreme cloud shadows which are not corrected by deck-cell\nnormalization.\nThe integral solution automatically\nextrapolates the profile to E(0-) based on a best fit to the\nentire profile, and not simply to the noisy near-surface\nlayer. On the other hand, the integral method of\nsolution is considerably\nmore difficult to implement than the derivative approach.\nMoreover,\nthe approach\nrequires an interactive\nanalysis of each profile, and is more time consuming\nthan an automated\nanalysis\nusing the derivative\nmethod.\nFor these reasons, the integral solution is not widely used within the ocean\ncolor community.\n\nExtrapolation\nBecause\n\nto the Sea Surface\nof surface\n\nwaves,\n\nit is rarely possible\n\nto measure\n\nE d (z,)_),\n\nE u (z,)_),\n\nand Lu (z,_,)\n\nat depths\n\nthat closely approximate\nz -= 0-.
