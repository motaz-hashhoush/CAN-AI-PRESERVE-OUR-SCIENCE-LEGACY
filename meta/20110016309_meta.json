The program generates a graphical user interface (GUI) that gathers input data from the user. These data include the critical dimensions of the rocket and of any launch-pad structures that may act as acoustic reflectors, the size and shape of the exhaust duct or flame deflector, and geometrical and operational parameters of the rocket engine. For the ignition-overpressure calculations, histories of the chamber pressure and mass flow rate also are required. Once the GUI has gathered the input data, it feeds them to ignition-overpressure and launch-acoustics routines, which are based on several approximate mathematical models of distributed sources, transmission, and reflection of acoustic waves. The output of the program includes ignition overpressures and acoustic pressures at specified locations.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20110016309, "id": "e6e3b03be4a24b938a2824d2b3f7c875", "publicationName": "NASA Tech Briefs, October 2005", "publicationDate": "2005-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20110016283, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "NASA Tech Briefs, October 2005", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20110016309.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20110016309/downloads/20110016309.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20110016309/downloads/20110016309.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20110016309/downloads/20110016309.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
