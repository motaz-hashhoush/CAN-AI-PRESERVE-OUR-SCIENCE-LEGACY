Physical problems where large jumps in the solution amplitude are important features of the response are described, including snap buckling of elastic shells, chemical reactions leading to combustion and explosion, and long-term climatic changes of the earth's atmosphere. A new method of rational functions was then developed which consists of representing the solutions of the jump problems as rational functions of the small disturbance parameter; this method can solve jump problems explicitly.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19800066150, "endDate": "1979-06-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "Nonlinear partial differential equations in engineering and applied science", "location": "Kingston, RI", "id": "a6a2b5769b0040498b499c0bb2556164", "startDate": "1979-06-04T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19800066150, "id": "7052d5f092664a6ba23b2bc1e99294e3", "publicationDate": "1980-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
