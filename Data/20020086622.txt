b"Self-injuryInhibitor\n\n50,000\nhere are autistic and reapproximately\ntarded people in the\nUnited States alone and a\ngood number of them engage in self-injurious\nbehavior, principally compulsive\nheadbanging.\nNew hope for\nthese people is offered by an\nautomated unit called the\nSelf-Injurious\nBehavior Inhibiting System (SIBIS). It\nis based on the space technology of telemetry, the\nwireless relay of coded symbols used for accurate\ncommunication\nbetween\nEarth and orbit.\nSIBIS was developed in a\ncollaborative effort by The\nAmerican Foundation for\nAutistic Children, The Johns\nHopkins University Applied\nPhysics Laboratory (APL)\nand Human Technologies,\nInc., St. Petersburg,\nFlorida.\nThe system performed\nextremely well in clinical trials\nconducted in 1987-88 and\nit is now commercially\navailable by prescription.\nThe accompanying photo\nshows the components\nof\n\nSIBIS. The stimulus\n\nmodule\n\nat left is wom on the upper\narm or leg. The headgear indudes an impact detector\n(top) and a transmitter\n(at\nback of head). When there\nis a blow to the head, it is\nsensed by the impact detector, which generates a coded\nsignal that is automatically\ntransferred to the stimulus\nmodule. The latter unit immediately delivers a mild\nelectrical stimulus to the skin\nfor less than one-tenth of a\nsecond. The stimulus is sufficient to halt the\nheadbanging.\nA microcomputer keeps track of the\nnumber of impacts and\nstimulations,\nallowing measurement of a user's progress.\nBecause self-injurious\nbehavior is potentially life\nthreatening,\nit is often necessary to use physical restraints\nor protective equipment\n(such as a helmet) on these\nindividuals.\nSIBIS allows the\nself-injurious\nto live without\nsuch restraints.\n\n62\n\nHealth\n\nand\n\nMedicine\n\nA predecessor device was\ninvented by Mooza V.P.\nGrant, president of The\nAmerican Foundation for\nAutistic Children and cofounder--with\nhusband Les-\n\nLater, on NASA recommendation,\nMrs. Grant\nasked APL to develop a\nmore compact, state of the\nart device. Under the direction of Robert E.

The device\nimmediately\n\nterminated\n\nher\n\ndaughter's\nheadbanging\nand\nhas continued to do so ever\nsince.\n\nsigned the telemetry-based\nSIBIS.
