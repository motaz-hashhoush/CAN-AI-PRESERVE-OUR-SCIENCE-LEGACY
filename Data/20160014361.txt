OBSERVATIONS DEBRIEFING \n\nHARDEE \t\n\nGentlemen, first of all, we\'d like to welcome the crew back\nfrom a very successful mission.\n\nAnd due to the time con\xc2\xad\n\nstraints, let\'s press on with this.\n\nFirst of all, we have\n\nan attendees\' list that we\'d like everyone to sign their\nnames and\n\nor~nizations\n\nbriefing minutes here.\n\nso they can get a copy of the de\xc2\xad\nAnd we have a slight change in agenda\n\nfrom that published earlier.\n\nWe\'re going to spend a short\n\ntime, maybe 15 minutes or so, discussing the hardware sys\xc2\xad\ntems as a result of some of the things that occurred during\nthe mission.\n\nAnd then we will go by discipline.\n\nDr.\n\nEl-Baz, the PI for the Earth Observation Experiment, will\nintroduce his coinvestigators and will discuss the experi\xc2\xad\nment by discipline at that time.\nFirst of all, I hope that everybody has had an opportunity to\'\nread the Technical Crew Debriefing that the crew had pre\xc2\xad\npared in Hawaii.\n\nI think Dr.\n\nEl-Baz~and\n\nmost of his people\n\nhave had an \topportunity to do that, so in discussing the\nhardware systems we\'d like to approach the subject on the\nbasis of the questions that we have as result of understand\xc2\xad\ning a lot of their comments expressed in this particular\ndebriefing.\n\nAt this point, let me ask Dr. El-Baz to address\n\nsome of the questions he may have and then I have a couple\nof prepared questions from the camera people.\n\nPage 2\n\nEL-BAZ \t\n\nGood morning, everybody.\n\nTom Stafford will be here shortly.\n\nWe have Deke Slayton and Vance Brand and would like to ask a\nfew questions about both the silver camera and the black\ncamera, following the comments made in the crew debriefing.\nVance was of the opinion that the Hasselblad reflex camera\ndoes give you something, because you can see through it, pro\xc2\xad\nvided you use the\n\n50~illimeter\n\nlens.\n\nWith the 250-millimeter\n\nlens, they thought there was too much loss of light, because\nof the transmission characteristics of the lens, and you\ndon\'t see the target.\n\nSo, in general, would you still think\n\nthe reflex camera does something for you, Vance?\nBRAND \t\n\nI think it\'s best with the 50-millimeter lens.\n\nWhen you put\n\non a 250-millimeter lens, you\'re hamstrung by the light loss\nand the length of the camera When you\'re trying to get close\nto the window.\n\nI don\'t know that we had. complete agreement\n\non that, but that\'s the wB;y I felt.\n\nTom and Deke probably\n\nhave their own ideas.\nSLAYTON \t\n\nI agree with you, generally.\n\nI never was able to see any\xc2\xad\n\nthing through that lens; it was just kind of a blur.\n\nI\n\ndidn\'t feel that I was gaining much by looking through it.\nWhat we\'re saying here is that we probably could have done\nabout as well without the reflex system on it.\n\nI understand\n\nyou did get some good pictures despite What we thought we\nwere seeing.\n\nPage 3\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nThat\'s the point.\n\nSLAYTON\n\nWhether they were good because we were looking through versus\n\nYes.\n\nalongside, I\'d hesitate to say.\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nYes, you couldn\'t really see very well, but the pictures\ncame out very nicely.\n\nSo it\'s a matter of your not seeing\n\nthe scene as you get the photograph.\nSLAYTON\n\nI still think it\'s comforting to be able to see your\npicture outlined through a reflex if you don\'t have too many\nof these accompanying disadvantages.\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nThat\'s correct.\n\nAnd you used the\n\nand the photographs from the\n\n35~illimeter\n\n35~illimeter\n\nquite a bit\n\nare excellent,\n\neven though we weren\'t really prepared for either the film\nor the lenses to be used for exterior photography,\nSLAYTON\n\nThere again, I had the same feeling with the\nlens, though, on the 35-millimeter camera..\nis a function of our particular orbit.\n\n3QO!":mi~1:ilneter\n\nMaybe this again\n\nWe were traveling\n\nqui te fast and trying to track anything through that lens\nwas almost impossible.\n\nI always had the feeling that I was\n\ngoing to get image-motion blur.\ndon\'t know.\n\nWhether we did or not, I\n\nPage 4\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nYou had excellent photography and the camera people really\nsaid that the 300-millimeter lens is the only one that you\n35~illimeter\n\ncan use with the\nSLAYTON\n\ncamera for outside photography.\n\nWell, we took it off because we thought we weren\'t getting\nanything, from the way it looked to us.\ntrack a thing.\n\nWe just couldn\'t\n\nWe finally went back to the other lens; that\'s\n\nwhat we shot most of our stuff with.\nEL-BAZ\n\nA couple questions related to the attitude of the spacecraft.\nYou remember we had worked on this attitude and you told us\nit wasn\'t really a very good one.\nattitude for us.\n\nAnd Tom figured out a new\n\nWhy was the first one bad really?\n\nAnd how\n\nwas the second attitude?\nSTAFFORD\n\nUsing the first one, we were pointea toward the horizon too\nmuch and that doesn\'t do any good.\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nWere you able to see the horizon?\n\nYou couldn\'t see the ho\xc2\xad\n\nrizon, though, could you?\n\nBRAND\n\nOh, yes.\n\nSLAYTON\n\nWe could see about that much black sky above it.\n\nWe could.\nThat was\n\nthe problem on the first attitude.\nSTAFFORD\n\nWhen we got right down to the nadir, we couldn\'t get down\nthere that close.\n\nPage 5\nSLAYTON\n\nSo we took that fi\xc2\xb7rst 10-degree increment, thinking that\nmight correct it, and we still were seeing black sky.\n\nSo we\n\ntook the next 20 degrees and that put us in real good shape.\nEL-BAZ\n\nIn the new attitude, were you looking straight down or just\nahead a little bi.t\'?\n\nSLAYTON\n\nYou could still see way out ahead.\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nYou could sti.ll see way out ahead for What you can resolve\nwith the eye as far as your lead-in.\n\nBut this brings us to\n\nanother problem on Which we got a lot of discussion.\n\nWhen\n\nyou look at a specific target in a lead-in, upside down, this\nmakes it extremely difficult to think.\n\nTo lead in, you\n\nshould be right side up, pitched down.\nBRAND\n\nEspecially for identification.\n\nIf you\'re upside down, all\n\nthese years of training and living down here are certainly\nthrown out the window.\n\nYou\'re saying, well, let\'s see, is\n\nnorth to the left or right\'?\n\nLetts see, I followed that\n\nlittle river and if I go north is it left or right or back\nthis way\'?\nSLAYTON\n\nYou have to think everything out.\n\nYou\'ve got a 50-50 chance of being right, but youtre usually\nwrong.\n\nBRAND\n\nAnd you have 15 seconds or 20 seconds to do everything.\n\nPage 6\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nOkay.\n\nAnd was this problem of not being able to see from the\n\nwindow very well something new because of something in the\ncouches or the fact that you,were too far down from the win\xc2\xad\ndows in the old attitude, or is it because you had to get up\ntoo far to look at it?\nSTAFFORD\n\nYou couldn\'t get the nadir.\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nOh, I see.\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nFirst, we were pitched up like that, we had a view out here,\n\nOkay.\n\nbut what you\'re really interested in is shooting closest\ndown here.\nSLAYTON\n\nAnd it was hard to get to.\n\nBy the time you got in Where you could kind of shoot to the\nnadir, the target was almost gone.\n\nAnd we were effectively\n\nlosing 30 degrees of sweep underneath us, which would have\nbeen the optimum angle for shooting pictures.\n\nEL-BAZ \n\n\nThat\'s correct.\n\nEL-BAZ \n\n\nHow about the mapping-camera attitude?\n\nWas this also bother\xc2\xad\n\nsome?\nSTAFFORD\n\nIt wasn It the best.\n\nBRAND\n\nIt wasn\'t optimized at all for visual observations.\n\nPage 7\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nOkay.\n\nVery good.\n\nWe have your comments on the color wheel\n\nand we think we agree with you on this business of the light\xc2\xad\ning inside spacecraft, the comments on the Visual Observations\nBook in the Technical Crew Debriefing, so we\'ll not go over\nthis.\nThere are problems with some of the focus on the film maga\xc2\xad\nzines and we think that some of this is due to leaving the\nextension ring that we used for electrophoresis on the camera.\nCould this be the case?\n\nBecause everytime we used the elec\xc2\xad\n\ntrophoresis and then shot out the window, this happened.\nEvery single time.\nSLAYTON\n\nYou mentioned that yesterday and I haven\'t had a chance to\ntrack back through the Flight Plan and find out.\nbarrassing if that happened.\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nIt\'s em\xc2\xad\n\nI guess it could have.\n\nIt could happen, especially since we had nothing in the pro\xc2\xad\ncedures to tell you to remove that ring after the elec1;;ro\xc2\xad\nphoresis run.\n\nBRAND\n\nDid somebody check the camera when it came home?\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nNo, I don\'t \'think we did.\n\nThe camera people are not here\n\nyet.\nSPEAKER\n\nIt wasn\'t all the way through, Vance.\n\nWe noticed that at\n\nthe end of the electrophoresis roll, for example.\n\nThe few\n\nPage 8\nframes there looked like they were out of focus like it was\nprobably left on, but it wasn\'t all of them.\nSLAYTON\n\nThe only reason I hesitate to think that happened is because,\nif we had done that, we really wouldn\'t have had any reason\nto take that thing off later, either.\n\nAnd it seems to me\n\nlike everything we shot from then on would have been poorly\nresolved.\nSPEAKER\n\nEach time at the end of electrophoresis, the dark slide went\nin and there was a blank at that point, so you had reconfig\xc2\xad\nured the camera some way probably.\n\nSLAYTON\n\nMy only point is, if we\'d made the mistake that Farouk is\nanticipating here, it seems to me we never would have cor\xc2\xad\nrected it through the whole flight because we never had any\nreason to correct it.\n\nWe\'d have been exchanging lenses and\n\nleft that spacer in there forever.\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nThat\'s correct; we used the photography of electrophoresis\nseveral times during the mission and this happened with the\nfilm also, several times.\n\nSLAYTON\n\nBut there was only one split in there, where we switched that\ncamera out and did mapping and back in for electrophoresis.\nWe did all the electrophoresis in 2 days.\n\nPage\n\nEL-BAZ \n\n\nRight.\n\n9\n\nThere are several handheld shots also with the black\n\ncamera that were taken right after the electrophoresis ex\xc2\xad\nperiment and these are out of focus.\n\nAnd the only other one\n\nthat\'is out of focus is F39 that you said something about,\nDeke.\n\nYou said that you thought that this was orange filter.\n\nSo we had no out-of-focus photography with the silver camera.\nSo the reflex can help in that you can see that something is\nwrong.\n\nAnd you mentioned that on the tapes also that there\n\nwas something wrong with the focus and you looked at it and\nit wasn\'t the orange filter but the focus.\nSLAYTON \n\n\nThat\'s right.\n\nEL-BAZ \n\n\nYeah.\n\nVery good.\n\nDo we have any more hardware or camera\n\nquestions?\n\nSPEAKER\n\nLet me ask one.\n\nYou had some comments in ~e Technical Crew\n\nDebriefing concerning the binoculars versus the spotting\nscope.\n\nWe\'d had a couple of questions like that.\n\nWould you\n\nelaborate on your comments there in terms of what your pref\xc2\xad\nerences were?\nSLAYTON\n\nIt\'s my opinion that we should have left everything alone and\nstayed with our good old IO-power glasses, probably.\nwas more than adequate.\n\nThat\n\nOn the other hand, I can completely\n\nunderstand the Skylab guys in the orbit that they were in ar\xc2\xad\nriving at the conclusions they did.\n\nBut I think that the\n\nPage 10\naltitude we were in and as fast as we were traveling, I had\nzero success tracking anything with the spotting scope and\nnever could have seen anything through it at any power.\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nI could track, but it\'s really meaningless unless you had a\nspecific target that you wanted to see and lead into; then\nit\'s going to be very difficult to find it because the field\nof view is so narrow.\n\nSLAYTON\n\nThings are just going so fast.\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nLet me tell you something that was noticeably different.\n\nDid\n\nyou hear my air-to-ground comments on the difference between\nthe Gemini altitudes and this?\n\nThese thunderbumpers look\n\nlike they\'re coming about a quarter of a way up versus being\nabout that big from the Gemini altitude.\n\nAnd the lead-ins\n\nand the angular bearing rates are fau~asti! compared to Gemini.\nBRAND\n\nI\'d go a little further than that.\n\nIf I had the most opti\xc2\xad\n\nmized perfect pair of binoculars or spotting scope available,\nI never would have used it, because I never had time to\nsearch around and get it on.\n\nEven assuming the focus was\n\nokay and everything was perfectly run by a computer in the\nspotting scope, I never would have used it, not once.\n\nWe\n\ncould see pretty well with the eyeball, first of all.\n\nSLAYTON\n\nThat\'s right.\n\nWe had a real good definition with the bare eye.\n\nPage 11\nBRAND\n\nAnd it was just too hard, too little time.\n\nHARDEE\n\nOkay.\n\nThank you.\n\nLet\'s press on then with the discussions\n\nin the various disciplines and, Farouk t will you introduce\nyour coinvestigators there?\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nYeah.\n\nI want to get on with this resolution of the eye and\n\nwe\'ll get all the things that we had there for eye resolution\nout of the way first.\n\nWe\'ll do this with slides and then\n\nwe\'ll have each of the coinvestigators run through through\nsome of the slides and ask questions about the visual obser\xc2\xad\nvation sites.\n\nMay we have the first slide, please?\n\nFor everyone\'s benefit, we had a few targets that were\nscheduled in the Flight Plan just to set the limits of eye\nresolution on the mission.\nat the Bonneville area.\n\nVance, you had the chance to look\n\nWere you able to see the race track?\n\nBRAND\n\nYes.\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nAnd is it the one that we thought it was?\n\nThe Wahsahchas\xc2\xad\n\nses[?] are on the right side there and the Great Salt Lake\nwith the two halves and the Bonneville Lake is the white\npatch.\nBRAND\n\nDid you mark it on the book or something?\n\nFirst of all, the picture I had, pointed out the area and I\ncompared that picture to the ground and I saw what looked\n\nPage 12\nlike a fairly wide linear scratch or stripe on the ground.\nRight at this point, after all this time and without the ben\xc2\xad\nefit of that same picture, I can\'t tell you where it is on\nthat slide.\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nAt the time, I did see it.\n\nWas it darker in color?\n\nDo you think you saw it because it\n\nwas a different color?\nBRAND\n\nWell, I would say it was more of a textural difference.\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nOkay.\n\nVery good.\n\nNext slide please.\n\nWe had the pyramids\n\nof Egypt as one of the targets of resolution because they are\nbuilt from materj.al the same color as the surrounding area,\nbut there will be a textural difference because the pyramids\nare built with large stones.\nBRAND\n\nI don\'t believe now that I saw them.\ntwo passes.\n\nI had the benefit of\n\nThe first pass, I saw two little dots that I\n\nthought possibly were pyramids.\n\nAt that point, I wished I\n\nhad a map of the pyramids on the ground so I could see what\nthey\'re supposed to look like.\n\nI think probably what I saw\n\nwere fields or something like that.\n\nSo, I would say, no, I\n\ndidn\'t see them.\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nOkay.\n\nIn one group of photographs, we can identify the pyra\xc2\xad\n\nmids and there is another batch that we cannot.\nangle may have a great deal to do with it.\n\nSo the Sun\n\nAnd this is the\n\nPage 13\npicture that you can see them. on if you enlarge it very much.\nYou can only see two big ones and a third tiny one.\n\nSLAYTON\n\nWith a low Sun angle, you might have a reasonable chance of\nseeing them..\n\nBRAND\n\nI think you should be able to see them, because we saw things\n\nin that size range.\n\nTom very easily saw the taxiway at El\n\nPaso Airport and a hangar, I believe.\nSTAFFORD\n\nA hangar.\n\nThere was a couple of buildings.\n\nBRAND\n\nThe whole question for the pyramids is how good is the con\xc2\xad\ntrast.\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nYes.\n\nAlso, whether you know what you are looking at; for in\xc2\xad\n\nstance, Tom knew that airport and knew where the hangars were\non the runway and such.\nSTAFFORD\n\nI looked down and there was kind of a desert area with a\ngreen river running through it that I thought looked like the\nRio Grande.\n\nI looked down and there was White Sands over\n\nthere, Biggs Air Force Base with its runway, and the two run\xc2\xad\nways at El Paso, the taxiway, and these two buildings over\nhere.\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nVery good.\n\nNext slide please.\n\nAll right, we had also some\xc2\xad\n\nthing over the intricate patterns of the Nazca Plains.\n\nTom,\n\nyou got pictures and I don\'t whether you saw anything or not.\n\nPage 14\n\nSTAFFORD \n\n\nThe first time the clouds went all the way to the mountains\nand we got nothing.\n\nThis slide was taken on the second pass.\n\nI can\'t say that I saw them.\n\nI remember this little bay in\n\nhere and Vance was helping me lead in.\n\nI saw this little bay\n\nup here and I thought I saw a whi te streak in here, but I\nsnapped the picture and I couldn\'t really say that that was\nit.\n\nI thought I saw something but I sure wouldn\'t say that\n\nwas positive \xe2\x80\xa2\nBRAND\n\nI didn\'t see anything.\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nAnd so, I couldn\'t say that I saw them.\n\nNo.\n\nNow whether it\n\nwas a white field or something in that area, I just don\'t\nknow.\nBRAND\n\nThis is one case where being upside down hurt us.\n\nThe iden\xc2\xad\n\ntification.problem was very hard here.\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nCan you see them on that photograph?\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nI couldn\'t, really.\n\nI know where they are, but I have not\n\nenlarged this or looked at it in detail.\nwhere you would expect them.\nNext slide please.\n\nOkay.\n\nBut this is e:x:actly\n\nThis is that region.\n\nAnd you did say something about\n\nbeing able to see first of all glaciers and then fern lines\n\n.\n\n..\n\nPage 15\non glaciers.\n\nDid you see that over the northwest as well\n\nas over the Alps?\nSTAFFORD\n\nI had the Alps and it was cloud cover; we got nothing on it.\nIt was hazy\xe2\x80\xa2. I couldn\'t see anything but Vance saw sonething.\n\nBRAND\n\nThe best case, I believe, was in the Alberta, British Columbia,\narea.\n\nI very easily saw a fern line on one big glacier up\n\nthere.\n\nSLAYTON\n\nSo did 1.\n\nE~BAZ\n\nHow did you make that distinction?\nable to see that?\n\nWhy\n\ndo you think you were\n\nBecause of a color or texture?\n\nBRAND\n\nTextural and - \xc2\xad\n\nSLAYTON\n\nColor gradation - \xc2\xad\n\nBRAND\n\n- - color and even shinyness, you might say.\n\nSurface texture,\n\nI guess.\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nThe ice being more - \xc2\xad\n\nSLAYTON\n\nKind of a gray compared to pure white.\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nYes, it goes from white to gray.\n\nAnd the fern line wasn\'t\n\njust a straight line; it was kind of jagged.\nclear line.\n\nIt wasn\'t a\n\nPage\n\n16\n\nBRAND\n\nIt was fairly clear.\n\nCrescent.\n\nSTAJi\'FORD\n\nWell, it had kind of a little curve in it.\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nOkay.\n\nSLAYTON\n\nBut I thought I could see texture down below it also, that\n\nThank you.\n\nsort of looked like flow patterns going parallel with the\ngla,ciers.\nBRAND\n\nYou could very definitely.\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nOkay.\n\nVery good.\n\nIt looked like old ice down below.\n\nNow before we start talking about the\n\ndisciplines, we want to summarize some of the results of the\nocean ground truth collection.\n\nDr. Robert Stevenson will\n\nstart this by talking about the ground-truth collection in\nthe Mediterranean and Tasman Sea and so on.\nSTEVENSON\n\nToo bad we didn\'t have other chances to look at that.\nwhat we thought about everything.\n\nThat t S\n\nIt rea;Lly helps to have\n\nrepeat assurances.\nBRAND\n\nThe day before, it was bright and clear.\n\nSTEVENSON\n\nWell, I think before you took off you had same indication of\nthe kind of ground truth backup that was going to take place.\nI made a list of those that have come in to date and I keep\nfinding everyday that some other ship was involved that had\n\nPage 17\nreceived the message before the flight and had not indicated\nthat he was going to do anything until after the flight was\nover.\n\nSo the data are piling up in my office about 3 feet\n\nhigh.\n\nBut I think you can see from that list that certainly\n\nthe U.S. Navy and the fleets and air forces of New Zealand,\nAustralia, and Great Britain were interested enough to become\ninvolved.\n\nTo refresh your mind as to where they are located\n\nand where they are planned, I\'ll go over them.\nThe first one was on revolution 17 and we sure appreciated\nthat fact that you left that in the Flight Plan, running north\nfrom East Cape in New Zealand.\n\nIn that area, the Royal New\n\nZealand Air Force had a P3 they flew the day before.\n\nThey\n\nflew the day launched and then the day after you launched,\nwhich was your visual observation and photographic day.\nThen they flew the third day, and the day after that.\n\n-\n\nDuring\n\nthe same time, the New Zealand Navy also had a research ves\xc2\xad\nsel along that line and I\'ll show you some of those data.\nThey\'re rather interesting, because not only did they run\nwater temperatures, but they also did some sound-velocity\nmeasurements and they caught an eddy and you can see\xc2\xb7 the\nchange in sound velocities in that eddy as we talked about\nbefore you went up.\n\n-\n\nVance, that was one area where you said\n\nyou thought you saw a scum line, but it went by so fast.\nWe\'ll look. later and chat about that later, maybe.\n\nPage 18\nThe second area was along the east coast of the United\n\nStates~\n\nalong several of these revolutions that you eventually made.\nIn that case, Preserver (one of the ships standing by in an\nevent of an immedi.ate abort after launch) went farther north\nand released four drifting buoys with transmitters that trans\xc2\xad\nmitted to Nimbus-F.\n\nThe Nimbus-F was positioning the buoys\n\nabout once a day with the precision of a kilometer.\n\nAnd\n\nthose buoys drifted throughout your entire mission.\n\nThey\n\nworked beautifully, by the way.\n\nHopefully we can tie some\n\nof the photography in with that area.\n\nI don tt know what they\n\ngot of that area, but I think they did get some.\n\nIn coming\n\naround the world, the next line was running southwest from\nthe bight of Spain[?] and in that line we had the U.S. Navy\nresearch vess.el Caine and they ran that line from July 15\nthrough July 22, so they started the day of the launch and\nthey continued to run back and forth along that line for\n\n6 days getting some detailed temperatures and other data.\nThen. again, the day before, the day of, and the day after ~\nyour revolution 73, the Navy flew a P3 along that line dropping\nexpendable bathythermographs (XSTs).\n\nThat was the greatest\n\nsuccess from my point of view because that\'s when Tom suddenly\nbegan to see the internal waves and the boundary; and the\nphotographs are beautiful.\n\nThey\'re really spectacular and\n\nthat boundary was precisely where we had hoped it was.\n\nIt\'s\n\nPage 19\nright across the flight line and the data looked great.\nseen some of the data and they really look\n\ngood~\n\nI\'ve\n\nso that was\n\na spectacular sucess.\n\n.\n\nThe next planned line was the Royal Air Force line that ran\nmore or less east and west from southwestern\n\nEngland~\n\nalthough\n\nthey didn\'t start dropping XBTs until they got just off-the\ntip of Ireland and that was revolution 160.\na 3-day sequence.\nreally fine\n\nOn the day before the\n\nweather~\n\nrevolution~\n\nthey had\n\nthey got good observations, and the\n\ndata looked pretty good.\ncloud covered.\n\nThey again flew\n\nThe day of your pass, it was pretty\n\nThey noticed 10 tenths for two-thirds of the\n\nline and 25 percent and 75 percent for the rest.\n\nAgain~\n\nit\n\nwas the type of situation where operations in one shot over\nthe area is going to hurt if the weather\'s going to move in.\nThen we had two groups come into the picture that came in on\ntheir own more or less, but we certainly welcomed the data.\nThe carrier Roosevelt was on the return from their final\ndeployment -\n\n(Roosevelt henceforth will be used for a train\xc2\xad\n\ning carrier along the East Coast) -\n\nfrom the Mediterranean\n\nto the U.S., so they made a complete transect of the Atlantic\nOcean dropping XBT\' s all the way and making weather observa\xc2\xad\ntions right across.\nSPEAKER\n\nWhat\'s an XBI\'?\n\n-\n\n-\n\nPage 20\nSTEVENSON \t\n\nExpendable bathythermograph.\n\nIt\'s a probe which is dropped\n\ninto the water and it makes a record of the temperature of\n\n..\n\nthe water versus depth to a depth of 1500 feet.\n\nThey\'re\n-the end of the\'\nexpendable because, wen\' tbeprobe comes to\n\nvery fine copper line that attaches it to the recorder on\ndeck, then the probe breaks the line.\n\nThey\'re fairly cheap\n\ndevices, so you don\'t worry about throwing them over.\nthat way, you can throw them from an aircraft too.\n\nIn\n\nYou don\'t\n\nhave to lower something and pull it back up.\nAnyway in two cases, Roosevelt happened to cross at times\nwhen there were visual observations.\n\nAnd I haven\'t seen the\n\nRoosevelt data yet, but I\'m sure they will be useful.\n\nAlso\n\nthe carrier Kennedy, which is now on deployment in the Med\xc2\xad\niterranean, is sending a mass of data that they took during\nthe redocking.\n\nI don\'t know whether you were looking at Soyuz\n\nor at the Mediterranean when you were redocking but there\nwas a beautiful shot of the Mediterranean behind Soyuz and\nthere were two good fronts that showed up well in the video\xc2\xad\ntape.\n\nNow I don\'t know what the photography looks like.\n\nI\n\nhaven\'t seen it, but in the video there were two good fronts\nthat showed up very beautifully.\n\nDid you have a movie camera\n\ngoing at that time here?\nSTAFFORD \t\n\nI had the DAC going at the right window for the redocking.\n\nPage 21\nSTEVENSON \n\n\nThat\'s what we saw yesterday; I guess.\n\nKennedy is our most\n\nsophisticated weather ship, oddly enough, even though it\'s\nan attack carrier.\nthat.\n\nSo, we have some good data comingJrom\n\nWe also have data from three of our defense meteoro- .\n\nlogical satellites, both visual andIR.\n\nThe point of that\n\nis to try to relate the photography and your observations to\nthe kind of degraded information we were getting from those\nmeteorological satellites.\n\nAs I mentioned, New Zealand had\n\nP3\' s out 3 days and they had a ship out.\n\nThe Australians\n\nhad Her Majesty\'s Australian Ship Bombard sitting right in\nthe middle of an eddy for\n\n4 days.\n\nYou remember we did give\n\nyou information of the approximate location of the eddy.\ngot good solid data.\n\nWe\n\nThe report was that it was the most\n\nintense warm-water eddy they had yet surveyed.\n\nIt\'s 80 miles\n\nin diameter, nearly circular, and the first 2 days the ship\nwas there, it was clear sky with a beautiful formation of\ncumulus over the eddy and sitting right in the center were\nabout a dozen Japanese long-line tuna vessels, which created\na navigation hazard for the guys trying to get across and\nmake some temperature transects.\n\nIt was a very good exercise\n\neven though the front moved by and you couldn t t see through\nthose clouds.\n\nAnd then, of course, the Royal Air Force were\n\nflying Nimrods, which are converted Comets.\n\nAt cruising speed\n\nwith all four engines going, they can attain 400 knots.\n\nAnd\n\nPage 22\nyou can\'t drop an XBT at 400 knots, so they shut down two\nengines and put down third flaps and they flew the whole\nline, 600 miles, at 240 knots and got some very fine data.\nUnfortunately again, as I say, the day was cloud covered.\nWell, as you can imagine from that, much of what you reported\nis of real value.\n\nNot having been able to go through\n\nthe data yet, I can\'t comment on all of it.\n\nBut the spec\xc2\xad\n\ntacular one was the Spanish Coast.\nSTAFFORD \t\n\nThat\'s the value of these flyovers.\n\nWhen you fly up and down\n\nthe channel between Los Angeles and San Clemente, you\'d go\none way and you could see some of the waves and some gyres.\nIf you turn around and fly down the other way with a different\nSun angle, there would be nothing but blue.\n\nI was looking\n\nfor all these things and suddenly they popped out within a\nsecond right there.\n\nJust suddenly when the Sun angle changed,\n\neverything was there, the waves and the boundary were all\nthere and we just snapped a series on them.\n\nBut before that,\n\nthere was nothing but just solid blue water and then they\njust suddenly popped.\nSLAYTON \t\n\nThey don\'t last long either.\n\nSTAFFORD \t\n\nNo, they don\'t last long.\n\nSLAYTON \t\n\nYou told me to look about 10 seconds later and they were gone.\n\nPage 23\n\nSTEVENSON \n\n\nSo you have to be ready.\n\nSTAFFORD \n\n\nYou have to be ready and the Sun angle has to be just right.\nAnd it\'s there for just a short period of time and then it\'s\ngone.\n\nSTEVENSON \n\n\nI suppose if you\'re in the right attitude and you can look at\nthe glitter as you\'re moving along, as long as it maintains\nitself in your field of view, then Y9u can probably pick up\nfeatures a little better.\n\nIn this particular case, the\n\nglitter came upon you all of a sudden?\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nYes.\n\nSLAYTON\n\nBut you lose it the same way, as soon as the Sun angle changes.\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nThe Sun angle gets lower and lower and then it\'s gone.\n\nSTEVENSON\n\nWe never got around to comput ing Sun angle.\n\nBRAND\n\nWe might add that, because of this fast change that we come\n\nIt was just instantaneous.\n\nacross so often, that was one reason why we finally shifted\nto trying to get three crewmen looking at once.\n\nWhen I went\n\nover Seattle once, I had a sunglitter great on Puget Sound.\nI could see it all with my eyes.\n\nAfter it was allover, there\n\nwas little time to debrief and I felt like I wanted to paint\na picture.\nof my eyes.\n\nI thought, why didn\'t I use the camera instead\nYou always had to make a choice ahead of time.\n\nPage 24\nSo we finally got, in the mode where we tried to keep both\ngoing at once.\n\nSomebody using his eyes and somebody shooting\n\nthe camera.\nEL-BAZ \t\n\nVery good.\n\nNow we have Dr. Charlie Yentz[?] from Bigelow[?]\n\nLaboratory to summarize the studies of the New England Coast.\nYENTZ \t\n\nWe can summarize by saying there was a lot of fog.\n\nBob sounds\n\nlike he mobilized all the navys of the world to help you\nfellows out.\n\nThe best I could do was to get two of our re\xc2\xad\n\nsearch vessels out and we roamed the ocean essentially from\nCape Cod to Grand Manan Island at the entrance to the Bay of\nFundy.\n\nMost of the time we found ourselves in a considerable\n\namount of fog and overcast.\n\nHowever, about halfway through\n\nthe mission, we did come on a band of discolored water and\nOur mission was\n\nessential~\n\nto try to find where large accu\xc2\xad\n\nmulations of discolored water were occurring in this area,\npartial~\n\nwith reference to Red Tide, partially with reference\n\nto the general problem of water discoloration in the oceans.\nI phoned Farouk. who got in touch with you.\nthat this sighting was confirmed.\n\nLater I heard\n\nIs that true?\n\nWe have no\n\nphotography of it.\nSLAYTON \t\n\nI guess I got mixed emotions about how we confirmed it, be\xc2\xad\ncause what I saw was obviously discolored water, but it was\nfairly close in to the coast; what I would be positive of is\n\nPage 25\nthat there were sedimentary patterns coming out of some of\nthose rivers \tonto the oceans.\n\nSo as far as trying to make\n\na flat statement that that was the sedimentary boundary\nversus something else, I wouldntt do it.\n\nThere was obviously\n\na discoloration difference tliere and I hope we got a few\npictures of \tit, I dontt know whether we did or not.\nSTAFFORD \t\n\nWe shot a lot of pictures of that area.\n\nYENTZ \t\n\nAs you pointed out, the whole problem with water color is\ncomplicated by the fact that sediments, biology, and actu\xc2\xad\nally a group of organic compounds that flow into the ocean\nalso discolor the water.\n\nIf we did get some record of what\n\nwe call wall-to-wall dinaflagellates, red tide, then I think\nin your mission, you\'ll have examples of all three phenomena\nof color, which is quite nice.\n\nI\'ll just sum up by saying\n\nthat I think that, if we do have all three of these examples\nfrom high altitude, this will be a contribution to\noceanography \xe2\x80\xa2\nEL-BAZ \t\n\nWe have also a note from George .Small.\n\nH~\'s\n\nnot here today\n\nyet, but he had NOAA ship one photograph of the Virginia Key\nfrom Miami going all the way to the Yucatan.\n\nThey did find\n\nthat all the Gulf Stream was squeezed between the Yucatan\nPeninsula and Cozumel.\n\nThey did scan the waters of the Gulf\n\nfrom this area all the way to the Gulf and they also had\n\nPage 26\n\nsome twenty NOAA ships working around the Mississippi River \n\nDelta and the coastal waters.\n\nSo whatever information you \n\n\nhad plus the pictures in the gulf waters will be also help\xc2\xad \n\nful; the moral of all that is that, from the oceanographic \n\npoint of view, there was really a lot of good ground support\nand people who are very enthusiastic about what you were do\xc2\xad \n\ning and I\'m sure the photography will be very helpful to all \n\nthese parties later. \n\nI want to go through some of the disciplines, discuss some \n\nof the photographs, and show you some material you may have \n\nnot seen and would like to ask you for more additional com\xc2\xad\n\nments on what you actually saw in flight.\n\nWe\'ll start wi th \n\n\nBill Muehlberger, who will treat structural geology in a \n\ncouple of areas. \n\nMUEHLBERGER \t One thing I would be interested in has nothing to do with\nstructure, but that is the glitter.\n\nAs you came across the\n\nocean onto land, did your eye have to readjust to be able to\ndiscern textural features on land from the glitter all the\ntime?\nBRAND \t\n\nNo.\n\nMUEHLBERGER \t You do it all right.\n\nGood.\n\nI didn\'t want those ocean\xc2\xad\n\nographers to beat us out of our land targets.\n\nWhat I\'d like\n\nto do is work through the Dead Sea/Red Sea strip first and\n\n"\n\n\nPage 27\nthen move into the southwestern U.S.\n\nLee Silver couldn\'t\n\nbe here, so I \t have to plB\\V him for a minute.\n\nThose I\n\nthought were \tsome of the reallY spectacular pictures that\nyou picked up \tthrough this mission.\n\nSome of the other tar\xc2\xad\n\ngets that we \t had taught for you were clouded over too much\nto show a lot \tof neat features.\n\nBut if we are smart\n\nenough, we could ask you questions that might increase our\nknowledge.\n\'-\xc2\xad\n\nLet me start down in the Afar Triangle which is the south\xc2\xad\nern point, but I think it was mainlY cloud covered for you.\nWhat could you discern there in terms of the big fault\nscarps?\n\nThey are the ones that are of particular interest,\n\ntheir linearities or bends.\n\nAre there any features beyond\n\nwhat we tried to show you before the mission that come to\nmind?\n\nIt was a bad day.\n\nThe onlY cloud in all of central\n\nAfrica went over the area at that moment and it was very\nsolid.\nSLAYTON \t\n\nI don\'t remember seeing anything in there.\n\nMUEHLBERGER \t The Sky lab crew had filled in much of the Sinai Peninsula\nand on up into the Dead Sea; the part of particular interest\nis farther north.\n\nYou took a suite of pictures there that\n\nis Just gorgeous, makes a perfect fill-in.\n\nWhen someone\n\nPage 28\nwants to give a lecture on the whole region, he can just.\nrun long here and look at these pictures and illustrate\nall these.\nThat\'s the Levantine Rift and I have two slides that I\'d\nlike to show you and I\'d like to ask Vance about his three\nfaults.\n\nThis is one of the suite that doesn\'t show all\n\nthe northern end, but it does illustrate the three maj or\nfaults that were illustrated in the Visual Observations\nBook.\n\nThen in the debriefing Vance mentioned one going\n\nalmost due east that worries me a little bit and maybe that\'s\nthat upside-down position that gives you a little problem\nwith compass direction.\nBRAND\n\nBecause it.\' s been about 3 weeks, It d like to review\n\nmy\n\ncom\xc2\xad\n\nments and then try to reconstruct it.\nMUEHLBERGER\n\nYou said 1 and 2 were very prominent.\nto the coast as I remember.\n\nOne stayed parallel\n\nI concluded you were talking\n\nabout that one.\nBRAND\n\nThat one stood out very clearly; one that 1\'d never heard\nmentioned before, that headed up the Turkish coast.\n\nMUEHLBERGER At right angles to the direction that wetre looking now?\nEast?\n\nWest?\n\nPage 29\nEL-BAZ\n\nDo\n\nyou really mean the Turk.ishcoastlines or is it Syria?\n\nDo you mean the Turkish coast or the northern end of the\nMediterranean?\nMUEHLBERGER\n\nLet me ske.tch it for you.\n\nTurkey comes around like that\n\nand then the eastern Mediterranean coast goes down here;\nCyprus would be in here.\n\nIs it part of the north-\n\nsouth \xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2 - BRAND\n\nI guess I didn\'t know how far south the boundary of\nTurkey extended.\n\nContinue up the Mediterranean coast\n\ntoward Turkey.\nMUEHLBERGER\n\nPresumably that would be the continuation this way; it\'s\ntrying to make another left kink way up there.\n\nBRAND\n\nThat was very prominent.\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nThe way you described this is that you had a fan-shaped number I went all along the coast, number 2 got lost in the\nmiddle of somewhere, and number 3 headed east-northeast\nuntil it joined a river.\n\nBRAND\n\nLet me talk about number 3 first.\n\nIt looked like a sort of\n\na sedimentary plain down there and it sort of got lost in\nthat plain.\n\nI couldn\'t really see where it ended.\n\nThe\n\nriver cut it off completely as I recall, but it kind of\ndisappeared before it got to that river.\n\nPage 30\nMUEHLBERGER\n\nWas that the Euphrates ~ the main river with all of its\nvegetables down the middle of the floodplain that would\nmake it dark and green?\n\nBRAND\n\nAs to which\n\nriver~\n\nit was off this picture.\n\nWhat I should\n\ndo is refer to a larger map to reconstruct.\nMUEHLBERGER\n\nUnfortunately, I don I t have any picture that looks the\nother way to show you that sort of thing.\n\nBRAND\n\nBut I did not see a sharp end to this and it sort of\nwent into a sedimentary area.\n\nI could not determine a pre\xc2\xad\n\ncise ending for it.\nMUEHLBERGER\n\nThe other one we have mounted is the closer view of this\none.\n\nHere\'s a small lake; the Dead Sea; the Sea of Gallilee;\n\nand this one t s name I can t t remember; but you took a beauty\nof this area which I\'d like to have you look at.\nBRAND\n\nMY overall\n\nimpression~\n\nremembering now, is that, in general,\n\nyou could not see the ends of these things.\nMUEHLBERGER\n\nYou also talked about the twists and turns.\n\nOne of these\n\nother frames shows it very prominently, and, because of the\nlook angle you had, accentuates the bends a little bit.\nThis one, that one, and that one make the bends look very\nangular.\n\nIt m wondering whether they t re really angular or\n\nPage 31\nwhether they\'re long arcing things within the bend.\n\nDo\n\nyou have any remembrances along those lines?\nBRAND\n\nI\'d have to\n\ns~\n\nno, that my overall impression of the\n\nfirst bend was that it was a very Jumbled, beat-up area.\nMUEHLBERGER A mass of arcs trying to be but they were - BRAND\n\nThey were having a hard time making the corner sort of.\n\nMUEHLBERGER\n\nThat\'s.a reasonable answer.\n\nIf your strike slip falls, you\n\nhave trouble going around corners.\nBRAND\n\nI can\'t answer the question the way it was framed in the\nbeginning.\n\nMUEHLBERGER Well, here\'s a high oblique looking southward into the\nsouthwestern U.S.\n\nOne of the questions that was asked\n\nw~s,\n\nwhere is the southwest end of the metamorphic belts in the\nSierra Nevada?\n\nWhich means looking down along this strip\n\nof country and all this picture is supposed to do is jog\nyour memory.\nBRAND\n\nWe had a good pass over that.\nat it and I must\n\ns~\n\nI had a good chance to look\n\nit\'s like from an airplane.\n\ntation overrides so you do not see the\n\ngr~\n\nThe vege\xc2\xad\n\nexcept in areas\n\nthere are roads, perhaps quarries, where something has\ndisturbed the vegetation.\n\nPage 32\nMUEHLBERGER Vegetation overrides the color, differences of the ground\nunderneath it?\nBRAND \t\n\nYes.\n\nWhere the vegetation was cut away, in the northern\n\narea of where this was supposed to be, I could see some gray.\nAt the northern end of the San Joaquin Valley is where I\ncould see this gray cut away.\n\nBut as you looked south to\n\nwhat we\'re really trying to see, the vegetation isn\'t cut\naway anyplace and you just can\'t tell, because the area\nwas covered by golden grass and purplish trees.\n\nI will\n\nsay, though, that as soon as we crossed the Sierras and\ngot into the desert where there wasn\'t very much vegetation,\nI wished to myself that the Sierras on the western side had\nbeen like this, because I could see all kinds of colors.\nEL-BAZ \t\n\nBefore we leave this slide, there are two things that will\ninterest many people here.\n\nFirst of ail, were you able to\n\nsee these sets of fractures west of the San Andreas from\nthe estuary?\n\nWere they clear?\n\nDid you see the San\n\nAndreas escarpment itself?\nBRAND \t\n\nYes, very definitely.\n\nIt was very easy to see.\n\nI forget\n\njust how I reported it, but I did see other fractures.\nBasically I think you can see that from an airplane as well.\n\nPage 33\nMUEHLBERGER \t There\'s an alinement in this picture that really intrigues\nmy\n\neye and I suspect that\'s the one that Lee has been work\xc2\xad\n\ning on for quite a while.\nthe world in there.\n\nIt cuts across the east part of\n\nThe San Andreas is over here.\n\nAnd I\n\nthink that\'s his old fault zone because all the mountain\nranges just completely change their orientation and shapes\nin there.\n\nI remember he\'s been worrying about where it is\n\nsome of these bands of rocks go.\n\nThe\n\ngr~\n\npolonna[?] schists\n\nand things that were supposed to be down in that area are\ncompletely missing.\nEL-BAZ \t\n\nIt\'s the one that\'s supposed to lead into the desert\xc2\xad\nvarnished hills also.\n\nVance~\n\nwere you able to do anything\n\nabout these desert-varnished hills1\n\nWere you able to see\n\nany more in the Mojave or the desert in general?\nBRAND \t\n\nI saw some more hills that looked just like varnished hills.\n\nEL-BAZ \t\n\nIn addition to the four you already knew about?\n\nBRAND \t\n\nYes.\n\nEL-BAZ \t\n\nFine, because we did not hear this on any of the tapes.\n\nAnd I think I called out their locations.\n\nMUEHLBERGER \t Lee was also interested in the Bahia Concepcion Fault which\nis on Baja Peninsula.\n\nNext slide, please.\n\nHere we are\n\nlooking north up through the gulf and here\'s where the fault\n\n,\n\nPage\n\n34\nzone exists. \t Naturally, we. have a cloud on it.\nthoughts concerning this fault zone?\n\nAny\n\nIt may be one of those\n\nold dead spreading centers that presumably is out in the\nbottom of the \tocean now.\nBRAND \t\n\nI tried to get the pictures.\n\nIt-was one of those cases\n\nwhere I think pictures overrode viewing.\n\nAnd the cloud\n\ncover was a little bit bad and I was - \xc2\xad\nMUEHLBERGER \t Another good example of two people really being needed to\ndo the job.\n\nSTAFFORD \t\n\nI think that\'s generally true all the way through.\n\nIf\n\nyou\'re going to try to get a stereo set of\' anything, you\ncan forget looking at it.\n\nThere\'s absolutely no way to do\n\nboth.\nMUEHLBERGER \t Well, I had that feeling before we went and you guys have\nreally clearly demonstrated it.\n\nOne of the recommendations\n\nhad better be a two-man team then.\nBRAND \t\n\nAnd this was early in the mission, before we got into that\ntwo- or three-man mode.\n\nPage\n\nMUEHLBERGER We should have thought of that beforehand.\n\n35\n\nThe strip you\n\ntook across \tLos Angeles is gorgeous, incidentally.\n\nIt\'s\n\nprobably the \tbest set of photographs that we\'ve had and I\ndon\'t remember that we mounted one of those.\n\nI think those\n\nwere the main points I wanted to cover.\n\nEL-BAZ \t\n\nNow Carol Breed will talk to us a little bit about some of\nof the deserts, both in North Africa and Australia.\n\nBREED \t\n\nFirst, I want to thank you for always being willing to look\nout the window one more time to try to get one more picture.\nI know that time was of the essence and yet you always seemed\nvery willing to go on with the earth observations.\n\nIlm also\n\nvery happy that you made as many observations over the des\xc2\xad\nerts as you did.\n\nI was really surprised, considering the\n\nbrevity of your mission, that you could make as many as you\ndid.\n\nI have some slides showing the variety of features\n\nwhich you saw and then there are some pictures which I be\xc2\xad\nlieve are on the rolls here that I\'d like to, if I could\nlater, spend a little time going over with you, because\npictures that I don\'t have are very small features that are\nparticular interest to our project but may not be of general\ninterest to the whole audience.\nFirst slide, please.\n\nWe\'ll start with something to take you\n\nback to where you were and get you thinking about what you\n\nPage\n\n36\ncould see in terms of resolution.\npart of the Simpson Desert.\n\nThis is the southern\n\nThis is where you remarked\n\nthat the dunes looked like straight lines drawn across the\nlandscape.\n\nActually you can only see parts of the dunes\n\nhere and the ones that are really quite straight occur\nfarther to the north.\n\nCan you tell me anything more about\n\nthe dunes in this area other than what you said at the time?\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nWe all looked at it.\n\nYou can see the long lines.\n\nI couldn\'t\n\nremember anything like the crescents such as we saw on the\neast side of the Andes or over in China Mongolia.\nSLAYTON\n\nThey tended to be linear.\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nThese were all linears.\n\nBRA-lID\n\nThe overall structure was linear and, when you looked at the\ndetailed structure, it was lihear too.\n\nBREED\n\nI\'m glad that that\'s the case because that\'s what we know\nabout so far and if you had found something different, I\nwould have been a little concerned.\nsification of that area.\n\nThat confirms the clas\xc2\xad\n\nNow there is a picture on one of\n\nthese rolls of some dunes that look very much like this in\nSouth Africa and Angola.\nDesert.\n\nThis would be north of the Namid\n\nThere were some very narrow linear features there\n\nthat appeared to be taking off f\'rom some dry river beds.\n\nPage 37\nTo me, looking at the pictures, it looked very similar to\nthe ones in the Simpson Desert.\n\nSo far as I know, these\n\ndunes have not been described and I\'d like to know if you\nremember seeing them and, if you do remember seeing them,\ndo you remember noticing any similarity between those dunes\nand the ones in the Simpson Desert?\nEL-BAZ\n\nWe can look at this later.\n\nThe strip of photographs was\n\ntaken with the mapping camera, so nobody was really looking\nat this terrain at the time unless Deke was.\n\nOn revolution\n\n40, when you turned the camera on, it was good weather in\nsouthwest Africa all through.\n\nI don\'t know if he was looking\n\nin that direction or not, but we can look at these pictures\nlater.\nBREED\n\nWell, the reason that this is of interest is because the\nmore southerly parts of the African continent are well known.\nBut this particular place is not and I didn\'t know that these\ndunes were there, I didn\'t expect anybody to see, report, or\nmap them.\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nHow about a comment on the Simpson Desert?\nany of this color is real?\n\nBRAND\n\nIt is redl\n\nDo you think\n\nPage\n\n38\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nIs this the way it looks?\n\nIs it dark red, this red?\n\nDark\xc2\xad\n\nbrownish-red?\nBRAND\n\nWe might have done fairly well with the color wheel on that.\nThe usefUlness of the color wheel was a function of how much\nlight we could get on it from outside.\n\nI know that I tried\n\nonce or twice and might have come up with a fairly good rep\xc2\xad\nresentation of the color.\nSLAYTON\n\nI think the fidelity of the color in those photographs is\npretty good.\n\nI wouldn\'t be uncomfortable about taking a\n\ncolor wheel and matching it against the photograph and say\xc2\xad\ning that\'s pretty good.\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nWas there any other desert that looked as red as this one?\n\nBRAND\n\nNot as red; they were other red deserts but not as red.\n\nBREED\n\nI feel a little bit handicapped in this regard, because\nwe don\'t have all the transcripts and nine of the deserts\nyou observed were later on in the mission and we don\'t have\ntranscripts of the recordings yet.\n\nBRAND\n\nI must say that I expected the African deserts to be redder\nthan they were, just from hearing people talk.\nme as being more yellow than I expected.\n\nThey struck\n\nPage 39\nBREED\n\nOkay, the next slide is the African deserts, and I wanted\nto use it as a contrast.\n\nSLAYTON\n\nThat\'s fossil dunes there?\n\nBREED\n\nYes, these are fixed dunes, stabilized by vegetation, all\nbut their crests which are still active.\n\nThat\'s quite far\n\nsouth in the Simpson Desert.\nSLAYTON\n\nYes, that\'s down in the south; it\'s the first thing we\'d run\ninto actually crossing the coastline.\n\nI remember we ran into\n\nthis kind of structure, then you get into the red material \xe2\x80\xa2\nBREED\n\n.And the material in the center part of the desert and towards\nthe north is considerably redder than all of this, is it not?\n\nSLAYTON\n\nOh yes.\n\nBREED\n\nNow this slide is what I think Farouk is talking about.\nNotice the color difference here in the Egyption Desert.\nyou can see some linear dunes.\n\nHere\n\nI am not sure that you can\n\nsee it, but there is a different dunes pattern up there.\ndoesn\'t show up to well in projection.\n\nIt\n\nIt\'s an entirely\n\ndifferent pattern than these large seep[?] dunes right down\nhere.\n\nThe seep dunes themselves are rather atypical linear\'\n\ndunes because they are a branching, sort of bifurcated\nfeatures.\n\nI noticed right away looking at this that there\n\nPage 40\n\nis a very distinct color difference between these big dunes\nand the background.\n\nI wanted to ask you if that\'s real, do\n\nyou remember?\n\nBRAND\n\nThis is once again a case where I was concentrating on photog\xc2\xad\nraphy or looking for pyramids.\n\nI don\'t recall that the dunes\n\nover in that area stood out all that much.\n\nThat photograph\n\nwas a view taken by the mapping camera out window 5.\n\nBREED\n\nThis is an area in which you were making visual observation,\nbut you did not notice that the dunes stood out in any way?\n\nBRAND\n\nI wasn\'t really looking for them over in that area.\n\nBut\n\nit\'s not something that attracted my attention.\n\nBREED\n\nYou can see this area in the center of the desert is con\xc2\xad\nsiderably redder than the area up here.\n\nAs you know , within\n\na desert where the dunes are all derived more or less from\nthe same source of sand and presumably by the same processes,\n\nwe think relative color differences like that can be used\nto deter.mine a sequence of events; because the longer the\ndunes sit in a subareal environment, the redder they get.\nSo this kind of color difference is interesting, and I just\nwanted to know if you had actually observed this kind of\nthing in the African deserts as a general rule.\n\nAre they\n\nredder in the southern part and lighter as you get closer\nto the Mediterranean?\n\nPage 41\n\nSLAYTON\n\nI think there is little doubt that close to the Mediterranean\nthey seem to be fairly light.\n\nBut some of the material we\n\nsaw down there in the central part was like this, some if it\nwas more reddish.\nhere,\nBRAND\n\nOf course, around the dark hills down\n\nyou see some little darker material.\n\nI couldn\'t draw that conclusion that there is more red in the\nsouthern part at all.\n\nIn the area of the OWeinat Mountains\n\ndown to Lake Chad, it\'s rather yellowish as I recall.\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nActually, Carol, these dunes are a lot more\xc2\xb7 weird than you\nwould expect.\n\nI flew over these and there are star dunes\n\non top of the seep dunes.\nSTAFFORD\n\nOn top of the big long linear ones?\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nYes.\n\nBREED\n\nThese are much bigger than the ones in the Simpson Desert.\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nWhile we\'re talking about the linear dunes with star dunes\n\nThe ones that go north-south.\n\non top, Tom, didn\'t you say something about this in real\ntime?\n\nYou said you were looking at dunes, long linear dunes\n\nwith star dunes on top, maybe over the Gobi?\nSTAFFORD\n\nYes, there was one you could see.\n\nThere were huge long dunes\n\nwi th somethiIlg superimposed on the linear dunes, but I don\'t\n\nremember exactly where.\n\nPage\n\n42\n\nBREED\n\nYou were somewhere in China; you were right over this area\nwest of the Hwang Ho River, the Yellow River, right in the\nChinese part of the Gobi Desert.\n\nDid you take any photo\xc2\xad\n\ngraphs of the area?\nBRAND\n\nWe sure took a multitude of that area, probably on the 35\xc2\xad\nmillimeter film.\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nI think this was late in the afternoon.\nangles, I could probably see it well.\n\nDue to the Sun\nThat was why.\n\na high sun angle, I couldn\'t have seen anything.\n\nWith\n\nThe Sun\n\nangle means everything in certain features.\n\nBREED\n\nNext slide, please.\n\nThis is the Lake Chad area; I wanted\n\nyou to look at this because here we have the other major\nclassification of dunes, the crescentic features, which you\ndid observe.\n\nHere they are stabilized, they are fixed, and\n\nthe curvature is not particularly pronounced, but it IS\npronounced enough that you recognized them as being cres\xc2\xad\ncentic dunes.\n\nIf we could go to the next slide, you could\n\nsee this one in a little more detail.\ncentic dune regions here.\nSTAFFORD\n\nThat IS just super.\n\nNext slide.\n\nYes, I remember that.\n\nBREED\n\nThese are the cres\xc2\xad\n\nThis is a dune field in Argentina.\n\ncan you tell me about it \'l\n\nWhat\n\nPage\n\nSTAFFORD \n\n\n43\n\nOkB\\Y", it\'s right over the edge of the Andes Mountains.\nWhere the mountains end, there is a little area in between\nand those start.\n\nAnd you could really see how they were\n\ncrescents; it looked like occasionally mB\\Y"be the head of\nthe crescent would wash out, and it would tend to be a\nlinear one with lineations on the side.\n\nThere are all\n\nthose other little crescents up on the left.\n\nThat was the\n\narea that you wanted me to look at?\nEL-BAZ\n\nYes, that\'s the only one that we thought existed.\n\nWe didn\'t\n\nknow that there were two dune fields.\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nWe were really taking photographs of that.\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nTom, to remind you, this is the shot with the 250-millimeter\nlens and it\'s beautifully centered.\n\nBREED\n\nThis is really a super picture for many reasons.\n\nThis dune\n\nfield is not well known at all.\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nI\'d remembered that there was some type of linear feature.\nThere were two rB\\Y"s.\nis nearly a linear.\n\nOne was on this edge down here, which\nBut the big thing was those huge cres\xc2\xad\n\ncents; then something else linear caught my eye.\n\nI see what\n\nit is now, those very minor ones in the center left part of\nthe picture.\n\nPage\n\n44\n\nBREED\n\nThis is a particular variety that I haven\'t seen anywhere else\nI have seen a lot of varieties of this generally crescentic\ndune pattern, but nothing where you have these linear dunes\nsuperimposed right on the crescent and they\'re oriented in\nthis\n\nw~.\n\nThat\'s totally unlike anything I have ever seen\n\nanywhere else, so this really is the prize picture as far\nas desert dune observations went.\nSTAFFORD\n\nOn that little field up there, it\'s just the\n\nw~\n\nthe boundary\n\nwas very well defined, as opposed to the other where this\nkind of fades out into like a dry lake bed.\n\nBREED\n\nOne of the things that is very obvious is the relationship\nbetween the edge of the alluvial fan and the beginning of\nthe dune fields; it\'s very, very sharp.\n\nThat\'s not a very\n\nred dune field, is it?\nSTAFFORD\n\nNo, it\'s not.\n\nBREED\n\nDoes it look about like the ones you see in the southwestern\nUnited States in terms of color?\n\nSLAYTON\n\nI would\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nI think it\'s close.\n\ns~\n\nso.\n\nlow Sun angles.\n\nWe had a fairly early morning light.\nWe had early morning light there and\n\nIt didn\'t have the redness like the Simpson\n\ndoes or anything like that.\n\nPage\n\nBREED\n\nWell, that was what I was getting at.\n\n45\n\nThe reason I asked\n\nthat is that this is in a latitude where you might expect\nredder dunes.\n\nWe don\'t have any pictures or any record\n\nyet in the transcript of any area with any star dunes, but\nyou did mention the ones that you saw in the Chinese Region.\nDid you see any other star dunes anywhere?\nSTAFFORD\n\nI didn\'t.\n\nAgain, I said stars; I saw something superimposed,\n\nand I made a guess that it was stars.\nBRAND\n\nIn general, I think it\'s a lot easier to see linear dunes\nthan anything else, because your eye picks them up.\ndunes are rather hard to see at that altitude.\n\nStar\n\nCrescentic\n\ndunes are somewhere in between.\nEL-BAZ\n\nNow, Deke was describing some stars or domes.\n\nSLAYTON\n\nYes, there were some interesting features in what I thought\nwas China or Mongolia.\n\nWe weren\'t too sure where we were,\n\nbut there was something peculiar about that whole area; it\njust had a different appearance about it.\nBREED\n\nIn the transcript, it says "They look kind of like old domes;\nthey\'re not stars and they\'re not linear either."\n\nI presumed\n\nthat what you were talking about here was Africa, but you\ndid see this sort of thing in China also?\nlooked like domes?\n\nSomething that\n\nPage\n\n46\n\nSLAYTON\n\nYes ~ but I would have to go back and refresh my memory on\nthat subject.\n\nI remember every time we came over there I\n\nwas fairly sure that was where we\n\nwere~\n\nbecause the moun\xc2\xad\n\ntains had a real black look about them and had a totally\ndifferent overall appearance, than anything we saw anywhere\nelse.\n\nI think that was in the area where I saw what I would\n\nterm more of a dome-type pattern as opposed to the pure\nlinears.\n\nI hope we\'ve got some pictures in there; I don\'t\n\nknow if we did or not.\nEL-BAZ\n\nI think this mention of the domes was while you were running\nthe DAC, between hills in Algeria.\n\nBREED\n\nI wanted to ask you about one other phenomenon and that is\nthe sand and dust storms that you saw.\n\nSLAYTON\n\nThe first pass we made over that area, I just had the feel\xc2\xad\ning I was looking through a haze layer.\n\nSo all I could\n\nconclude was it was either a very high thin cirrus (which\nI don\'t think it was) or it was a dust storm.\n\nIt was defi\xc2\xad\n\nnitelY a fuzzy-looking phenomenon.\nBREED\n\nYou mentioned that it had a rolling appearance, a layered\nappearance.\n\nCould you see anything that looked like a\n\nregular pattern of\n\nrollers~\n\na cellular sort of structure?\n\nPage\nSLAYTON\n\nNot that I recollect.\n\n47\n\nI just had a very positive conclusion\n\nin my mind, that was what I was looking at.\n\nI couldn\'t draw\n\nany other conclusion from it.\nBREED\n\nWell, Bill Muehlberger brought along a copy of Science\nmagazine and inside there is a picture of part of the\nChinese Desert, the Takla Makan Desert, with a dust storm\nin progress.\n\nMUEHLBERGER\n\nNow that\'s a storm pattern.\n\nBREED\n\nI was wondering if you could see any of that pattern.\n\nSLAYTON\n\nI don\'t recollect it.\n\nBREED\n\nAt your altitude then, it doesn\'t show up.\n\nBRAND\n\nThe only place I remember dust storms is around Aral Sea.\nKazakhstan.\n\nBREED\n\nDid you get any pictures of those dunes?\n\nBRAND\n\nThey were really obscured by the haziness.\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nIt was late afternoon, but you could see the storm was\nreally blowing; the wind was really blowing.\n\nBRAND\n\nYou asked about the color of the desert in the more southern\nparts of Africa, south of Egypt, mid-Africa.\n\nI think that\n\nPage\n\n48\nlast shot showing the Oweinat Mountains was fairly represent\xc2\xad\native of south of Egypt.\n\nE~BAZ \t\n\nVance, are you talking about the strip of sand between the\ntwo hills?\nIt has some reddish tint to it but, by and large, it\'s\n\nBRAND \t\n\nfairly yellow.\nE~BAZ\n\n\t\n\nThat strip of sand between the two hills is rather light\ncolored, very light.\n\nSo this was the color of the desert\n\nfrom Lake Chad all the way to Egypt?\nSLAYTON \t\n\nIt has that real light color track there, a river; then you\nhave that darker stuff which you would expect around those\nmountains.\n\nBREED \t\n\nThen there is a streak of windblown sand here and there are\nsome dunes associated with it that you can\'t see too well.\n\nBRAND \t\n\nWell, you have a fair amount of variation in the deserts\ndown there, but I would say if you would take the lower\nright-hand one-fourth of that photograph, the colors there\nare fairly representative.\n\nBREED \t\n\nWell, you can easily pick out the contrast here between the\ngravel plains and the windblown sand, because you don\'t get\nthe oxidation.\n\nPage 49\nI might say that the black mountains in that picture look\nmuch blacker in real life.\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nYes, they sure did.\n\nBRAND\n\nYou just couldn\'t miss them.\n\nBREED\n\nThis illustrates very nicely too the barrier effect that\n\nThey really showed up.\n\nyou get between an outcrop of this sort and the beginning\nof a major sand deposit of that sort.\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nOne more question here.\n\nVance, we thought that these things\n\nwere igneous intrusions.\n\nWhat did you think?\n\nI know that\n\nyou said something about volcanic nature.\nBRAND\n\nWell, I know that it\'s\n\nalw~s\n\nunsafe to draw big conclusions\n\nlike this in geology, but they looked igneous to me.\n\nIt\n\nlooked to me like a big volcanic pile under the sand that\nhad intrusions, many of which were circular and some were\nnot.\n\nBut it looked like the top of a mountain under the\n\nsand, and these were just some of the things coming up.\n\nI\n\nknow that that\'s just an impression, but it looks like a lot\nbigger area of black rock than just what you see here.\n\nYou\n\nthink igneous becaUse it\'s black, and you see structure.\n\nBREED\n\nOka;y, that\'s all I had, and thank you very much again.\nthink it was quite successful.\ngood material.\n\nI\n\nYou brought back a lot of\n\nPage 50\n\nEL-BAZ \t\n\nDoctor Robert Dietz has a few items on several structures\nand a few things that we have not seen yet.\n\nDIETZ \t\n\nI want to cover both impact structures and some volcanic\nfeatures.\n\nRegarding impact structures, there are two known\n\ntypes, and these give very close contract [sic] with lunar\nfeatures.\n\nAmong impact features are meteorite craters, the\n\n"type" example being the Arizona crater, Lonore in India,\nand some others; and I assume none of these were observed.\nThey are all very small and probably outside your resolution\nunless you knew exactly where they were.\n\nThe other type of\n\nfeature is the astroplain [1.]; these are the ancient impact\nscars, and you did obtain two of these.\n\nThere is a third\n\ntype which we think may exist; I\'ll mention it briefly.\n\nIn\n\n1908, there was the Tungusky event in Siberia caused by a\ncomet head or possibly a carbonaceous chondrite, a friable\nmeteorite that exploded in the upper atmosphere and blew\ndown trees over a radius of 25 kilometers.\ndidn\'t see this; it\'s too far north.\n\nOf course, you\n\nBut it has occurred\n\nto some of us that in desert areas, particularly in the\ngravel plains or regs, that someda\xc2\xa5 we might hope to find\nwe never have - a bleached stellate spot caused by some sort\nof upper atmospheric event of this type in one of the regs.\nThese would turn over the gravels, which are desert varnished;\n\nPage 51\nyou should have a bleached stellate spot.\nthing like that at all?\n\nDid you see any\xc2\xad\n\nLet\'s go into the astroplains.\n\nOne of the targets on the mission was the Sudbury Basin.\nThis was not acquired.\n\nAnother was of two features in\n\nBrazil, and one of these is in the first slide.\nSTAFFORD\n\nI could see it with my naked eye, but when I went again to\nthe reflex, I couldn\'t see; so I just aimed down the barrel\nof the camera and shot.\n\nDIETZ\n\nI\'m glad we got it.\n\nI assume this wasn\'t adventitious, but you did see it and\nphotograph it.\n\nIs that. correct\xc2\xb7?\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nYes, you could see it.\n\nDIETZ\n\nThis is in Goias; it\'s the Serra de Canghala feature, or\nPacksaddle Mountain if we translate, a Mesozoic impact site.\nIt\'s about 12 to 15 kilometers across the central dome and\na ringed depression.\n\nI think it\'s remarkable that you were\n\nable to acquire it and to get this remarkable photograph\nof it.\nSTAFFORD\n\nFrom the spacecraft, I couldn\'t tell you that that was an\nimpact.\n\nYou could see the round structure; but as far as\n\ndefinition goes, I couldn\'t tell whether it was a volcano\nor something else.\n\nThere was a circular structure, and I\n\nwas scanning and I could see a kind of high cirrus in there.\n\nPage 52\nAnd I suddenly picked it out and shot it.\nmillimeter lens.\n\nI could see it with\n\nmy\n\nI had the 250\xc2\xad\nnaked eye, and I\n\njust aimed down the barrel and shot.\nDIETZ\n\nCongratulations on it.\n\nA few minutes before this, over at\n\nMato Grosso, there is even a larger feature which has more\nof a series of concentric rings, 40 kilometers across, the\nAraguania Dome.\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nYes, I saw the two circular structures, and I think I shot\nat both of them.\n\nEl-BAZ\n\nDid you see that?\n\nI\'m not sure whether I got them.\n\nThere is one picture that we have right after this, but I\ncould not see the circular structure in it.\n\nSo this is the\n\nonly one that we have identified yet.\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nI saw the other one.\n\nThe other one was bigger than this,\n\nisn\'t it?\nDIETZ\n\nIt would be prior to this; it\'s to the southwest of this.\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nI remember I saw two; one was bigger than the other one.\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nWas the big one not perfectly circular?\n\nWas it a little\n\noval or ellipsoidal?\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nThere was something about the rings that was more defined.\nThe rings looked harder to me.\n\nI can\'t say whether it was\n\nPage 53\noblong, but it was bigger.\n\nAgain, I tried to hit it with\n\nthe 250-millimeter lens and I probably missed it.\nlucky to get this one.\n\nIt was really frustrating to look\n\nthrough that lens and see\n\nEL-BAZ \t\n\nI was\n\n~othing\n\nout there.\n\nIt\'s amazing that we get a picture like this of a very\nsmall feature that\'s still centered.\n\nDIETZ \t\n\nIt\'s amazing and it\'s very difficult because generally\nthere\'s a very high haze in the area, in the Chapada region\njust south of the Amazon lens.\n\nWe really got a remarkable\n\nday in having a cloudfree day.\n\nAs far as I know, I have\n\nthis on ERTS, but I don\'t have any cloudfree images on ERTS,\nwhich is most remarkable.\nNext slide.\n\nThis is the Kupra [1] Oasis, and the circular\n\nspots are caused by a large pipe moving around once a week\nirrigating the ground.\n\nNear this, we have what is called\n\nthe BP [1] structure, which is a known impact site with\nshock metamorphic effects.\nyou see.\n\nAnd that is located right there,\n\nThese features tyPically have a central dome and\n\na ghost ring.\n\nYou see, here is .the central dome, and there\n\nis the ghost ring.\n\nThis is also about 15 kilometers across.\n\nRight here, there is another part of a ring that looks like\na twin site, which if it is, would be a new discovery.\nhasn\'t been described.\n\nThis\n\nThis is 130 kilometers or so up to\n\nPage\n\n54\nthere.\n\nYou see the central site, and you see the ghost\n\nring.\n\nI haven\'t ever seen that ghost ring before in any\n\nERTS images, so this is much better resolution.\n\nFurther\n\nnorth is an even smaller circular ring, which is unnamed.\nDid you see that?\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nIt\'s another 50 kilometers further north.\n\nI don\'t think they would see this, Bob.\n\nThis is mapping\n\ncamera photography.\nDIETZ\n\nThis was not acquired for the circular structure?\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nNo, this was a continuous strip through the desert.\n\nVance\n\nwas looking through window 3, and this is from window 5.\nSLAYTON\n\nIn terms of resolution, though, that irrigated area down\nthere and those circular things show up with no problem\nat all.\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nOh, you have seen that in flight?\n\nSLAYTON\n\nOh, yes.\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nI see.\n\nDIETZ\n\nWell, this is a very fine slide and remarkable resolution\n\nIt\'s very easy to differentiate.\n\nof that feature, so it certainly is a plus to the mission.\nThese are both two examples to be obtained of these astro\xc2\xad\nplains, these ancient impact sites which are duomic scars\n\nPage 55\nor roof structures which have been etched out by erosion.\nBut they are very important.\n\nThere are very few in the\n\nworld, and they are very important to tie in with lunar\ngeology.\n\nNext slide.\n\ncanic features.\n\nLet\'s look now briefly at some vol\xc2\xad\n\nThis is Mexico in the area west of Puebla,\n\nand it shows a great many volcanic features.\n\nThere are\n\ndike rings [7] and cinder cones, all acidic volcanism.\n\nYou\n\ncan see this little ash ring here; this is Topatszitl [7]\ncrater; this is Los dasdurumbatos [?]; I studied this last\nFebruary.\n\nBut this is a remarkable sequence of volcanic\n\nfeatures, in the Mexican central volcanic zone.\n\nI have no\n\nquestions, but if there are any further comments, we can\ntake those.\nSLAYTON\n\nI think that is all very visible, again, very easy to see.\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nYes.\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nWho took this batch of pictures?\nstereopair of this site.\n\nThey are a very nice\n\nDo you remember who took these\n\npictures, to put them in sequence?\nSLAYTON\n\nI think I took some through here, but I would have to go\nback and review.\n\nBRAND\n\nI think, in this sequence, we had a couple of cameras going.\nWe had the Nikon and we had a Hasselblad going.\n\nPage 56\nEL-BAZ\n\nOkay.\n\nDIETZ\n\nThis is a fine view of the east end of the central volcanic\nzone of Mexico.\n\nNext slide.\n\nThis is the Galapagos Islands.\n\nWe see in here four or five large calderas.\nremarkable photograph, cloudwise and also\n\nIt\'s a most\n\ngeological~.\n\nNow I take it that when you\'re looking at Santa Isabela\nhere.\nSTAFFORD\n\nYou could look down and because of the Sun angle, you can\nsee the shadows down in the calderas.\n\nDIETZ\n\nYou can see the depth.\n\nThere\'s one, two, three, four calderas here.\n\nAnd this is\n\na separate island nested in against Isabela; this is Fer\xc2\xad\nnandina, using the Spanish names, Ecuadorian names.\n\nFern\xc2\xad\n\nandina is probably the third most active region in the world\nafter Hawaii and Iceland.\n\nFernandina was seen to be in\n\neruption on an earlier space mission.\n\nIn 1968, it had a\n\ncaldera collapse, the only one in history where the central\nparts subsided about 200 meters.\n\nMy question is, did you\n\nsee any activity here or any transients elsewhere in the\nworld except Mount Etna, which you have and which is excel\xc2\xad\nlent, of course.\nin the world?\n\nDo you see any volcanic activity anywhere\n\nPage 57\n\nSLAYTON\n\nI did as a matter of fact.\n\nWe were flying over cloud cover,\n\nand we didn\'t know where we were as usual.\n\nBut we saw some\xc2\xad\n\nthing coming up out of those clouds that looked like an\nA-bomb to me.\n\nThat was my first impression of it.\n\nDIETZ\n\nWhere was that now?\n\nSLAYTON\n\nIt was just a big mushroom thing.\n\nWell, we called the\n\nground and gave them a GET; and a couple of hours later,\nthey came back and said, we think you were about on the\nAleutian chain.\n\nBut this was an obvious big billowing\n\ncloud coming up through a lower cloud deck, and there was\na big stream of gray-black smoke running downstream from\nit.\n\nAnd it had to be covering a 150 or 200 miles, probably\n\nmore than that at least.\n\nWe reported it to the ground, and\n\nI hope we got some pictures of it; we tried to anyway.\nWhether they came out I don\'t know.\n\nI have been very curious\n\nbecause I can\'t figure out what else it could possibly have\nbeen but a volcano.\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nWe never saw anything else on the flight. that compared with\nthat, as far as smoke.\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nWe assume that it may have been an explosion anyway because\nthis is a Soviet military testing site or range.\n\nPage 58\nDIETZ\n\nWe have not run this down.\nnor smoke.\n\nVolcanoes have neither fire\n\nThey have ash and they have iridescent lava.\n\nSLAYTON\n\nThey do have smoke that goes with them.\n\nDIEI\'Z\n\nNot really smoke unless they\'re burning a log or something.\nWhat they have is ash clouds.\n\nSLAYTON\n\nRight.\n\nThat\'s what I assumed it was, an ash cloud.\n\nBut\n\nit looked to me like it was a split cloud, actually.\n\nOne\n\npart of it was gray-black and there was another stream\nrunning parallel to it coming out that was more white.\nBRAND\n\nMY impression was of the world\'s biggest grass fire, smoke\ncloud or something.\n\nIt was a tremendous smoke cloud.\n\nSLAYTON\n\nWould it be some classified event or something?\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nIt could very well be.\n\nMUEHLBERGER\n\nThere\'s a strip at the end of the terminator and there was\n\nBill has suggested that he saw ...\n\nsome gorgeous - I just thought they were thunderheads piling\nup in the background.\n\nMaybe that\'s why you took them.\n\nthings come right up out of the stratus and made a great\nbig mushroom.\nSLAYTON\n\nWe took those, I think, down across southeast Asia.\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nThis was blackish.\n\nThe\n\nPage 59\nSLAYTON\n\nIt stood out by itself.\n\nDIETZ\n\nThis area is uninhabited.\n\nIt\'s a good example of what we\n\ncan do from space because when something happens here, no\none knows; it may be for 2 or 3 weeks or even months.\na place like this can be monitored from space.\n\nSo\n\nIt\'s very\n\nimportant to know that, and I\'m sorry you didn\'t get the\nSudbury structure.\n\nI can understand why but if we find\n\nanother Sudbury structure from space, we can hopefully\njustify the space mission economically because this domi\xc2\xad\nnates the world\'s nickel mines.\nBRAND\n\nJust a comment; the first time we passed over Sudbury, there\nwas too much cloud cover.\n\nThe next time, it was a very\n\noblique angle; we just couldn\'t see it, as I recall.\n\nDIETZ\n\nI have no further comments.\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nVery good,\n\nth~\n\nyou.\n\nBob?\n\nNow we\'ll go back to the ocean\n\nobservations and we have Dr. Yentz to talk about the New\nEngland waters.\nSLAYTON\n\nThis goes with volcanics.\nand I didn\'t see\n\nany\n\nof them.\n\nthat was clouded over.\nsee anything.\n\nWe did have the three targets\nMauna Loa was one of them\n\nMount Baker we did see and we didn\'t\n\nPage\n\n60\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nThere was nothing at all on Mount Baker?\n\nSLAYTON\n\nNo.\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nIn Guatemala there is supposed to be an active one, and it\nwas clouded over.\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nWe couldn\'t see a thing.\n\nWe are going to show some slides of the waters of the north\xc2\xad\neast coast of the U.S.\n\nYENTZ\n\nThese are mostly on revolutions that paralleled the coast.\nThe first revolution starts when coming up the east coast\nof North America; its very conspicuous feature being the\nsunken river mouth and the coastal plain area where it enters\nChesapeake Bay.\n\nIt\'s a good example of a situation where\n\nthe interaction of the fresh water outflow and the sea water\ninflow creates all the sedimentary patterns that are sus\xc2\xad\npended in water, and I think that\'s the first slide.\na very excellent\n\nslide.\n\nERTS photography also has some\n\nvery good slides of this sort.\nthe coast.\n\nIt\'s\n\nSo let\'s move right on up\n\nThe next conspicuous feature is the world\'s most\n\nfamous sandspit, I guess - Cape Cod.\n\nNext slide, please.\n\nAnd that\'s a very excellent photograph of Cape Cod, Martha\'s\nVineyard, Elizabeth Islands, coming off here, and Buzzards\nBay in this area, Cape Cod Bay on the other side.\n\nThe gen\xc2\xad\n\neral problem of red tide in New England starts essentially\n\nPage 61\nfrom this bay \tand extends up to the Gulf of Maine, into\nCanada.\n\nThe \tnext slide is a little bit better, or that\'s\n\na better outline of the cape.\nregion.\n\nProvincetown is in this\n\nThe \tvery shallow area is here; here are the deeper\n\nwaters of Massachusetts Bay and you can see some of those\nlittle entrance channels and places of that sort.\n\nThe next\n\nslide is a little bit broader shot of the entire coast.\nThis is Cape Ann, which is the northern cape in Massachu\xc2\xad\nsetts, and the New Hampshire border is right there.\nEL-BAZ \t\n\nExcuse me, Charlie.\n\nI would like to ask Deke a question.\n\nWe have a report from the results of the 14 stations that\nwere set up by the Commissioner of Public Health in the\nCommonwealth along the Massachusetts coast from Cape Cod to\nthe south part of the Boston Harbor, through Gloucester and\nCape Ann.\n\nThey had a very high percentage of chlorophyll\n\nin the water near the coastline and that area in particular\nbecause there has been a lot of rain and the rivers brought\nin nutrients and chlorophyll and so on.\n\nDid you see any\n\nindications of that at all, Deke?\n\nSLAYTON \t\n\nWell, it was obvious that there had been a lot of rain and\nhad all that sedimentary stuff floating along the coast.\nguess I\'m not sure what you mean by chlorophyll.\n\nI\n\nPage 62\nEL-BAZ\n\nI mean it would have given the water near the coast a green\ntint.\n\nThat comment never was sent up to you but it was\n\nsupposed to have been.\n\nAlong with the sediments you would\n\nhave seen a greenish tint to the water at the coastline.\nYou did not notice that?\n\nSLAYTON\n\nWould it have been a greenish-tint boundary between the\nmuddy water and the clear ocean water?\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nThat is right, yeah.\n\nSLAYTON\n\nWell~\n\nthinking back on it, there probably was a little bit\n\nof that but I kind of assumed that that was just a phasing\nthing rather than having a clear-cut boundary where you\nhave a little mixing going on between the fresh muddy water\nand the salt water.\nEL-BAZ\n\nIt could be mixing, but did you have the feeling that there\nwas a greenish tint to that muddy water or the fresh water\ncoming out?\n\nSLAYTON\n\nI\'d have to say I think so.\n\nYENTZ\n\nLow-level haze almost rules out that kind of visual identi\xc2\xad\nfication.\n\nEven from an airplane you have difficulty.\n\nPage 63\n\nSLAYTON\n\nWe certainly didn\'t get it on this pass.\n\nThere was a couple\n\nof passes where we were a little oblique and we had a fairly\ngood view in that area.\n\nI don\'t think we got any good pic\xc2\xad\n\ntures at that time.\nEL-BAZ\n\nThe ones that were taken of Cape Cod with the 250-millimeter\nlens.\n\nThose were the runs that you were supposed to take of\n\nCape Cod and Cape Ann and so on.\n\nI bet that was the run\n\nthat was good for viewing.\nSLAYTON\n\nThat run, as I remember, was clear around the Cape Cod area\nand then got cloudy as you got farther north.\nwhere we got the good Cape Cod pictures.\n\nI think that\'s\n\nI think it was a\n\nlater pass where we got the stuff farther north.\nYENTZ\n\nYes, I think that\'s in the next slide, the shots of the Bay\nof Fundy.\n\nSLAYTON\n\nNext slide, please.\n\nThat\'s qui te a bit farther north.\n\nI hope we got some in\n\nbetween there.\nYENTZ\n\nThis is Prince Edward Island.\n\nAll of these red discolora\xc2\xad\n\ntions are really due to red clay.\n\nThere are lots of deposits\n\nthere and the high tidal activity keeps the water stirred up.\nIt\'s kind of interesting to be able to follow these and see\nwhere the water clears up.\n\nPage 64\nSTAFFORD \n\n\nI didn\'t get much chance but it seems like those little\nthings came out a little redder than what that photographed.\nIt seemed like the redness of that stuff near there was more\nlike a clay.\n\nDeke, what do you and Vance think?\n\nBRAND\n\nThere was a lot more contrast.\n\nYENTZ\n\nI think\n\nm~be\n\nthe next slide is a little bit better.\n\nPer\xc2\xad\n\nhaps not.\nSLAYTON\n\nThat covers the area pretty good all right, but that\'s hazy\ntoo.\n\nYENTZ\n\nIt was a lot clearer eyeballed than that shows.\n\nThe next slide gives a good example of the sort of organic\noutflows that I was telling you about.\ntotally different material.\n\nNow this is a\n\nThis is organic acid that\'s\n\nmade by the heavy vegetation in these delta areas.\n\nThis\n\nis the Orinoco River outflow and that is really a beautiful,\nbeautiful section.\n\nI personally have been interested to\n\nknow how far out you can detect this material.\nSTAFFORD\n\nWe gave you a mark.\n\nIt goes way out in the Atlantic.\n\nBRAND\n\nLet me qualifY one thing.\n\nYou know we were talking about\n\nit all the way out there, to where the ena of the brown\nwater was; but later I kept watching and I decided that\nmaybe we said it was a little too far out because you can\ndetect a little bit of brown in sunglint.\n\nPage 65\nEL-BAZ\n\nTom, if we go by this we didn\'t know whether you were giv\xc2\xad\ning us the old GET or the new one.\n\nDo you remember?\n\nWe\n\nwere 2 minutes off or whatever because when we plotted\nthat on the map it was way out in the Atlantic.\n\nNow can\n\nyou remember, where was Barbados in relation?\nSTAFFORD\n\nOh, it was past Barbados, because Deke got a stereopair of\nBarbados.\n\nSLAYTON\n\nI took a whole series clear across here.\nthink we went across Cuba and Bermuda.\n\nOn that run I\nThat pictures that\n\nwhole area I hope.\nEL-BAZ\n\nWe have very good pictures of Jamaica, Cuba, and so on but\nwe are talking about this discoloration in the water from\nthe Orinoco River delta, whether it actually did go beyond\nBarbados.\n\nSLAYTON\n\nOh, yes.\n\nBarbados was in fairly close but I sure agree\n\nwith Vance, because in the sunglint it does have a tendency\nto look a little tan or something.\nor the Atlantic.\n\nBut you could look out to the side and it\n\neven went way past Barbados.\nEL-BAZ\n\nIn any place, the Pacific\n\nThat\'s the question.\n\nPage\n\n66\n\nYENTZ\n\nTo the oceanographer, this is a very interesting situation\nbecause this is like doing a huge dye experiment and putting\nit into the water and being able to trace it.\n\nIt doesn\'t\n\ndecompose very rapidly so that it takes on the characteris\xc2\xad\ntics of the water motion along the coast.\nBRAND\n\nI think it was one of the most dramatic ocean effects we\nsaw.\n\nSLAYTON\n\nIt was really something.\n\nAnother one similar to that was off of the coast of China\nthere where a river, is that the Yangtze, drains into the\nChina Sea there.\n\nYENTZ\n\nThat was the same kind of a thing.\n\nBob, one of the Chinese rivers has one of the highest loads,\nyou were mentioning?\n\nSTEVENSON\n\nYes, the Ganges has the highest sediment load, I think.\nthe Yangtze is way up there and so is the Orinoco.\n\nBut\n\nBut the\n\nAmazon is quite clear.\n\nrENTZ\n\nIt\'s kind of interesting as sort of a sidelight that this\nyellow water going by Barbados is a signal to the fishermen\nout there to start up their flying fishing industry.\n\nIt\'s\n\nkind of correlated, indicating that that does have some sort\nof a biological significance.\n\nPage\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nThank you very much.\n\n67\n\nNow, Deke, getting back to your com\xc2\xad\n\nments about the New England coastline.\n\nI don\'t think we\n\nhave seen any pictures from about Cape Ann until you come\nto the northeast part of Maine.\n\nUnless it is in a magazine\n\nthat has not been processed yet, we have not seen photo\xc2\xad\ngraphs of Boothbay Harbor.\n\nSLAYTON\n\nThe whole particular area was just about all clouded over.\nThe one pass when we got the Cape Cod area was clouded over\njust north of there.\nmy\n\nBut that\'s what I was thinking; maybe\n\ngeography is off a little bit.\n\nI thought we were getting\n\nBoothbay there in that area, that last one with all that\ncoastal outline.\nEL-BAZ\n\nIt\'s farther north than that.\n\nThat\'s the Bay of Fundy.\n\nSLAYTON\n\nMY geography was off and we never did get any good stuff\ndone around the Cape,\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nThe comment that we wanted fed up to you was lion this par\xc2\xad\nticular pass, try to get a continuous strip all the way from\nBoston to New Brunswick.1!\n\nI think it was Crip that read the\n\nnote and he emphasized the Boothbay Harbor, and you picked\nup the Boothbay Harbor or you thought it was at the Bay of\nFundy because of all the sediment in the water.\n\nPage\n\n68\n\nSLAYTON\n\nI thought that we were in the Boothbay area there; we must\nhave been farther north.\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nIt was a poor attitude.\n\nSLAYTON\n\nWe were kind of at an odd angle and I remember looking over\nit like this to see it.\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nThat attitude was not optimized for visual observations.\nWe were piggybacking on some other attitude.\n\nSLAYTON\n\nIt was okay for looking.\n\nI could see fairly well, but I\n\ncouldn\'t get any photography because it was a very oblique\nangle down through the window.\nEL-BAZ\n\nBut you don\'t recall whether you were looking down at Booth\xc2\xad\nbay Harbor or not?\n\nSLAYTON\n\nI thought I was, but I probably wasn\'t.\n\nThat whole area up\n\nthere was usually clouded over or at least large enough\nportions of it so that it was pretty hard to differentiate.\nI remember that one pass when I picked up Long Island;\n\nI\n\nthought I was already at Cape Cod and I shot some shots.\nthink we were really right on the edge of Long Island.\n\nI\nWe\n\ngot a few pictures before we got to Cape Cod that should be\non that same strip.\n\nPage 69\nEL-BAZ\n\nVery good.\n\nNow, Bob Stevenson will continue with the addi\xc2\xad\n\ntional ocean scenes.\nSTEVENSON \n\n\nI don\'t have a lot of specifics.\n\nI do have a couple, but\n\nI am more interested in your telling us the constraints\n\nthat you felt in trying to find these\nand describe them in real time.\n\n~eatures\n\nin the ocean\n\nWe already heard from Tom,\n\nwhere he pointed out that the sun glitter comes in a hurry\nand disappears in a hurry.\n\nBut in a more general way, you\n\nremember my point was "if you\'re up there and you\'re trying\nto describe the scene to either a tactical force on the\nsurface or maybe even a fishing :fleet on the surface."\nWhat were the constraints that you felt in trying to do this?\nSTAFFORD \n\n\nWell, the Sun angle to start with on certain features is\nreally the dominant factor; say if there was no clouds as\nfar as obscuring it, I think you can work it out.\n\nYou know\n\nit really correlated with those flyovers you did over the\nWest Coast.\nhelped.\n\nThose flyovers up and down that channel really\n\nAs far as the eddies and gyres, the big thing that\n\noutlined those to me, and I think to everybody else, were\nthose little clouds right around the edges of them.\ncan really see that.\n\nAnd a current bound\'ary, too.\n\nclouds define it often.\n\nYou\nThe\n\nAnd I couldn\'t see any difference\n\nin the coloration - at least at Sun angles I looked down\n\nPage 70\nat those eddies.\n\nDid you see any difference in the color?\n\nI couldn\'t see \tany difference in color.\nBRAND \t\n\nGenerally, you had a cloud rim which precluded you from\ndoing that but if you tried and, if you looked at gaps in\nthe cloud rim, you couldn\'t see a difference.\n\nSLAYTON \t\n\nIf you\'re asking how do you optimize Earth observations for\nthe kind of things you are talking about, in my opinion we\ncould talk about this among ourselves, too.\n\nI think we\'re.\n\nat a.very good altitude to do it but the penalty you P8\xc2\xa5\nfor that altitude is a fast motion over the surface.\n\nThe\n\nonly way I know to beat that is to build yourself a nice\nbig bubble off the side of your satellite here so you can\nsit right here in the bubble and you can look ahead and\npick up What you want; and once you\'ve got it, just track\nthat thing right through until it\'s gone by.\n\nIf you could\n\ndo something like that you could get some phenomenal stuff.\nEven with all three of us working on things, we still had\nproblems.\n\nThings just go so fast, there\'s no way you can\n\nsit and look at it and think about it and Btill take pic\xc2\xad\ntures.\nBRAND \t\n\nIt\'s just impossible to do those two things in parallel.\n\nAnd to go on further, suppose you have another problem, that\nof pinpointing where an eddy is.\n\nI alw8\xc2\xa5s felt very uncom\xc2\xad\n\nfortable because I\'d see an eddy and I\'d s8\xc2\xa5, "Farouk and\n\nPage 71\nBob want to know where that is, I\'ll just give them the\n\xc2\xb7GET."\naround.\n\nBut we can see for hundreds of miles all the way\nSo while you\'re sitting in that bubble Deke\'s\n\ntalking about, you need one of those eyeball gunsights or\nsomething so that you can look over there and say MARK and\nso you can get the azimuth off the guy\'s mask device or\nsomething.\n\nYou also need to know the spacecraft attitude.\n\nYou could, of course, give him a little sighting device to\nuse, but he\'d have to spend all his time getting that thing\nlined up and he would have wasted good viewing time.\nSTEVENSON \n\n\nI\'ve gathered from what all of you have said that sighting\ndevices at that altitude are really pretty useless and even\nmaybe binoculars are not all that useful.\nview, you can recognize thoroughly.\n\nYou\'ve got a good\n\nTom mentioned he saw\n\n15 ships coming out of Gibraltar at least.\nSTAFFORD \n\n\nOh, you could see them down there.\n\nSTEVENSON \n\n\nSo with the visual acuity of even fairly small objects,\nthere\'s no problem that I can see there.\n\nBRAND\n\nIn midocean, you can plan on getting most of your data from\nclouds and only once in a while getting it from sunglint\nwhen you are especially lucky.\n\nPage 72\n\nSTEVENSON\n\nI also gather that you felt much more comfortable in observ\xc2\xad\ning and trying to describe the scene rather than trying to\nphotograph or point at the same time.\n\nSLAYTON\n\nis that right?\n\nSay you\'ve got an objective of taking a stereo tree of an\nobject.\n\nIf you do that right, that takes you 15 seconds.\n\nB,y the time you get in to where you can really shoot that\n\nthing and use 15 seconds, it\'s gone.\n\nAnd you haven\'t\n\nlooked at it.\nBRAND\n\nThey\'re starting to do one or the other.\n\nSLAYTON\n\nThey asked us to comment on a lot of these pictures.\n\nThere\n\nisn\'t any way to do it because, if we got you good pictures,\nwe didn\'t really see it.\n\nSTEVENSON\n\nThat\'s right.\n\nBRAND\n\nAnd comments may come easily one time and hard the next.\nFor example, you may see something that you can describe\nvery well.\n\nYou may say, !II see a circular cloud structure\n\nand I can see that it\'s 20 kilometers across the MARK, the\ntime I see it as such and such."\ncolor maybe.\n\nAnd you can describe the\n\nThe next time you may come up on sunglitter,\n\nyou\'ll see a pattern, you\'ll see a gyre perhaps in there.\nAnd there\'s no way you can describe that, and you wish you\n\n..\n\nPage 73\n\nhad taken a picture or you\'ll wish that you had a pad that\nyou could draw on to fill in.\n\nFor instance, if you had an\n\noutline of Puget Sound showing Seattle and two or three\nprominent landmarks and a pencil in your hand, you could\ndraw in what you see.\n\nYou need something like that.\n\nYENTZ\n\nYou also need the Maine coastline already predrawn.\n\nBRAND\n\nYes.\n\nSPEAKER\n\nWhat you need is outline maps?\n\nBRAND\n\nYes.\n\nBecause there are times when the flight planners have\n\nyou hitting several sites in a row, too, and you don\'t have\ntime to do that sketch and so you say to yourself, "I don \'t\nhave time to debrief this one; I\'ll debrief all five of\nthem when I finish."\n\nAnd then you get to the end of that\n\nand you\'re coming up on the next event and you don\'t have\ntime to spend 10 minutes debriefing things that you\'ve\npartially already forgotten.\nEL-BAZ\n\nThese are all problems.\n\nWe should have kept you up there for a couple of months so\nyou would get a couple of chances?\n\nBRAND\n\nYou need repeated passes over things too because if you have\none pass, there\'s a good chance that something will be bad.\nBut if you have three or four passes, you\'ve got a very good\n\nPage 74\nchance of getting a lot of data on it, or if you have two\npasses even.\n\nAnd you shouldn\'t be very oblique.\n\noblique, that\' s\n\nIf you\'re\n\ntough~\xc2\xb7\n\nSTEVENSON\xc2\xb7\n\nUnless it\'s a major feature.\n\nBRAND\n\nWell, yes.\n\n~be\n\na series of gyres going off to the horizon. \n\n\nThat\'s oks\\y, but if you\'re wanting to get Puget Sound, you\'d \n\nbest be right over it. \n\nSTEVENSON\n\nBut now, the first observation pass was the dS\\Y after launch, \n\nabout 26 hours or something like this, coming up across New \n\nZealand.\n\nWith New Zealand\'s cloud, cover, you didn\'t see \n\n\nCook Strait. \n\nBRAND\n\nThat\'s right.\n\nSTEVENSON\n\nOks\\y.\n\nBut it was the first time that you really seriously\n\nlooked out other than to maybe occasionally ss\\y, IIThere I s\nthe passing scene. 1I\n\nCan you think back through all of the\n\nevents and then think ahead maybe after the undocking when\nyou then began to do visual observations again, do you feel\nmore confident as this mission went on?\nBRAND\n\nThere\'s a learning curve.\n\nSLAYTON\n\nI think, again, it was the time constraint.\n\nSpeaking for\n\nmyself, I had a couple of passes early during the joint\n\nPage 75\noperations period which was our only chance to get it (that\none rev) and we knew we were going to be busy through there\nbut as usual we were about four times busier then we really\nexpected to be.\n\nWe just felt like we didn\'t really have\n\ntime to properly prepare for it, we didn\'t do it right, we\nwere just up against the stops all the way on these early\nones.\n\nI don\'t think we did very well on them at all.\n\nOnce\n\nwe got through the joint activity period, where we could\nall three work the problem together, help the guy that had\nthe primary task by looking out the window and we changed\nour attitude, I think we got reasonably good results from\nthen on.\n\nBut I frankly think that anything we did prior to\n\nthat was not very good.\n\nIf it was, we were just lucky.\n\nI\n\nthink, on the other hand, if we are talking about 5 years\nfrom now and you want to do Earth observations from a space\nstation; if that was one of your objectives, we could build\na beautiful Earth observation module that you could do a\nsuper job with.\n\nYou could couple in this great visibility\n\nalong with a couple of hand controllers.\n\nYou could tie all\n\nyour bank of cameras in and a couple of push buttons here\nto select a 250 there and an IR here, and get some beautiful\nstuff.\n\nThat\'s what the Shuttle\'s all about, isn\'t it?\n\nPage 76\nBRAND\n\nMan\'s greatest utility up there is as an identifier of\nsights and the way this eyeball can be used to describe\nthings, but he can be very useful in pointing things.\n\nAnd\n\nthen describe them, maybe in addition.\n\nSLAYTON\n\nYou can discriminate and you can pick the right thing to\ndo the right job for you in real time and do it fast.\n\nI\n\nthink that\'s the big thing.\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nYou\'d also like to have this observation device in a heads\xc2\xad\nup reference, too.\n\nSLAYTON\n\nI think that\'s been pointed out before.\n\nIf a person is out there in a big bubble, so he can pick\nhis own attitude, he can\'t go wrong.\n\nSTEVENSON\n\nNow do you think it\'s useful to consider some kind of device\nthat instantaneously tells you where you are or what part\nof the Earth you are over?\n\nMany times you say, "Where am I?"\n\nSTAFFORD \n\n\nYou could have a data printout.\n\nSLAYTON \n\n\nWe had this thing onboard which we never got around to using.\nWe thought about it a few times but it\'s one of those things\nyou have to update to be valuable.\n\nWe had the other map\n\nthat we did pullout and stuck up here; we kept referring\nto that and that was very helpful once we got it out and\nused it.\n\nYou\'d be surprised how many times you\'d come up\n\nPage 77\nover a coastline and you wouldn\'t have the vaguest notion\nwhether you were over Africa or Australia or the U.S.\n\nSTEVENSON\n\nMainly because you haven\'t been doing visual turns all along.\n\nSLAYTON\n\nYou\'re wrapped around the axle with crystal growth, or\nsomething.\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nIs this the map that you are referring to?\n\nBRAND\n\nThat\'s a good map.\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nThat\'s a good one.\n\nThe only thing you might do though; all\n\nthe numbers are down at the bottom.\n\nThey need to be up at\n\nthe top too because you have to start way down here and turn\nthe map over and thumb over to here.\n\nSLAYTON\n\nThat\'s why I think this would be good if we\'d ever had a\nchance to get it updated and use it.\n\nAlso, we got the time\n\nticks on it.\nBRAND\n\nDeke mentioned the time ticks.\n\nI think it might have been\n\ngood enough to put just some representative curve on there\nshowing representative time ticks that you could translate\nto any one of those curves.\n\nYou could take your finger\n\nand say well this is 6 minutes.\n\nPage\n\n78 \n\n\nSLAYTON \n\n\nYou could look at that quick and say "Well, I got 10 minutes\nfrom Hawaii to the West Coast."\n\nBRAND\n\nSomething like that if it were kind of automated so you\nhad a quick visual reference without manhandling anything.\n\nSTEVENSON\n\nWell, you\'re talking now about the Soyuz baIlor the\nMercury ball.\n\nSLAYTON\n\nWe had one on Mercury that did exactly that.\nold clock globe.\n\nIt was an\n\nAll you did was wind it and turn it on\n\nand put in the right coordinates at the right time.\n\nIt was\n\na little gross, but it pretty well did the same thing.\n\nYou\n\ncould refine that.\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nWell, with the data displays that you\'re going to have on\nthe Shuttle, the CRT\'s that we have now you could have them\nread out a latitude and longitude in just continuous strip\non the thing.\n\nBRAND\n\nI must say though, that a ball is much quicker.\n\nThere are\n\nsome times when I think of 159 west, that doesn\'t mean much\nto me.\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nYou don\'t need it in the basic cockpit, but for the Earth\nobservations it would really be handy to have that.\n\nPage 79\nSTEVENSON\n\nSo inside the bubble or on the bulkhead of the bubble where\nthe guy is going to be sitting, you\'ve got this ready ref\xc2\xad\nerence, right?\nAnd we talked also about how do you mechanize the bubble.\nTom suggested a big mirror and Deke and I were. also thinking\nof perhaps, instead of a mirror, a tracking arrangement where\nthe whole seat would move like a turret or something.\n\nIf\n\nyou really wanted to get exotic, you could just go to the\nend of the world on fancy devices.\nSLAYTON\n\nYou put the bubble on an arm and you got a hand controller.\nJust fly the thing around and you\'re tracking through the\nwhole arc.\n\nBRAND\n\nIt might be done either\n\nSLAYTON\n\nWork it like a turret.\n\nw~.\n\nLike a ball turret.\nEL-BAZ\n\nAre you guys going to write a note on this?\n\nBRAND\n\nI think Bill Pogue is working on something like that as a\nmatter of fact right now.\nsome of our ideas.\n\nPerhaps he could incorporate\n\nPage 80\n. STEVENSON \n\n\nIn some of the observations, and I guess I\'m now thinki.ng\nof the ones that you made Tom of the front off Spain as\nyou were coming up.\n\nAll of a sudden it comes up.\n\nit is and this is great.\n\nThere\n\nAt least we know it\'s there.\n\nIf\n\nyou were placed in a position of having to give some sort\nof ready reference as to where it was physically located,\nthat would not have been a problem.\n\nIn other words, here\n\nyou saw this front and all the internal waves.\n\nThe only\n\nplace for this kind of reference of magnitude or location\nwould be when you\'re well away from any coastline or any\nisland or anything of this sort, where you\'re really not\nsure where you are.\nSLAYTON\n\nNot quite.\n\nI was looking out at same islands down here in\n\nthe south; we weren\'t sure where. we were; just shooting\nsome "gee Whiz" pictures and all of a sudden I\'m in StUl\xc2\xad\nglint and there were some internal waves right along these\nislands and we didn\'t have the vaguest notion where we were.\nAnd it turned out we were down arotUld New Guinea, somewhere\nin there.\n\nBut we had to call the grotUld and ask them.\n\ndidn\'t know.\n\nI don\'t know whether those pictures came out\n\nor not either.\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nWe\n\nYes, them came out.\n\nPage 81\n\nSTEVENSON\n\nYes, those were spectacular.\n\nThose are the ones with the\n\n35-millimeter camera.\n\nSTEVENSON\n\nYes, I think Dick Underwood needs to sit down with you\ngentlemen.\n\nWhere were you when you took this picture?\n\nwhat were you doing other than taking pictures?\n\nOr\n\nOkay, I\n\nneed one more thing before we look at some pictures.\n\nAgain\n\nI would rather have your opinions right now, as you recall,\nof the problems and the constraints in some detail.\n\nBut\n\nthis one early in the mission, revolution 17 again, and\nVance saw a scum line.\nthat scum line?\nBRAND\n\nDo you want to discourse some on\n\nCan you remember it?\n\nLet\'s see, am I right in thinking that I\'d just passed over\nNew Zealand?\n\nSTEVENSON\n\nThat\'s right.\n\nBRAND\n\nThere were a lot of clouds over New Zealand, I remember the\nmountains sticking up through the clouds, and I guess what\nI was looking for was a red tide, or plankton blooms.\n\nSTEVENSON\n\nYes, you said, "I don\'t think it\'s the time of year for\nplankton; looks too cold down there."\n\nBRAND\n\nReal objective.\n\nAll I can say is that I was looking for plankton blooms,\nand I saw a line beyond the island that did not look like\n\nPage 82\n\nit was vegetation.\n\nI mean it did not look like it was\n\nbiological, and I think that is why I asked.\n\nYo~\n\ndo see\n\noccasionally, especially from airplanes, trash lines on\nthe water.\n\nAnd it was kind of a dark, wavy line, and that\'s\n\nabout all I can give you.\n\nSTEVENSON\n\nThe thing that\'s making me wonder are data of the New Zealand\nair crew on that day.\n\nHere\'s their cloud-line flight-line\n\nplot from New Zealand going northeast.\n\nThey plotted the\n\ncloud types and roughly their heights, every few minutes.\nSo this is about two-thirds of the way out the line; the\n\nline was 400 miles long, so let\'s say this is like 250 miles\nnorth of East Cape.\n\nSo you\'re beyond the islands and the\n\nclouds, presumably, are reasonably broken out there, very\nscattered, .and they got this very. distinct discontinuity\nin the water.\n\nDistinct change in wave heights; so the\n\nappearance of the sea should have changed.\nBRAND\n\nIt should have changed in color or texture on either side\nof this line?\n\nSTEVENSON\n\nTexture.\n\nBut, you see, if it did change, also in the motion\n\nof the water, this could have been a scum line.\nBRAND\n\nAll I can say, Bob, is that I don\'t recall so much a textural\nor a color difference in the sea but I do remember seeing\nthis line.\n\nPage 83\n\nSTEVENSON\n\nAnd it was beyond the islands, clearly?\n\nBRAND\n\nYes.\n\nSTEVENSON\n\nNot immediately adjacent?\n\nBRAND\n\nThat\'s correct.\n\nAnd at our altitude we didn\'t really see\n\ntexture and color differences unless the light was just right.\nSTEVENSON\n\nBut if you\'re going to see a scum line, it\'s going to be a\nfairly sizable feature.\n\nBRAND\n\nYes.\n\nI agree.\n\nSTEVENSON\n\nIt\'s not going to be one of these Galveston Bay scum lines.\nOr something m8\xc2\xa5be that isn\'t too wide but it\'s long.\n\nSo\n\nthinking back, that\'s kind of what you think you saw, long\nlinear feature.\nSLAYTON\n\nIt would not have to be too wide because we could differen\xc2\xad\ntiate roads.\n\nBRAND\n\nThat\'s right.\n\nIt wouldn\'t have to be very wide.\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nWas that the area where we looked down and it looked like,\nsomething like plankton but it was probably sedimentary out\neast or northeast of New Zealand, or some place.\n\nWe were\n\ndescribing and said, "Is that plankton or is that sediment?"\n\nPage 84\nEL-BAZ\n\n"Or is that bottom?"\n\nI remember that.\n\nYou were talking\n\nabout that maybe you were seeing bottom because it was a\nlittle greenish, and maybe that\'s not plankton bloom be\xc2\xad\ncause you were seeing bottom.\nBRAND\n\nWe did see bottom, we\'re pretty sure.\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nBut then this is farther off the island; there are pictures\nof something that looks like plankton bloom.\n\nI think we\n\nhave the slides.\nSPEAKER\n\nFrame 37.\n\nAbout the time you were talking about the sctUD.,\n\nyou got this nice big bloom.\nSTEVENSON\n\nBut again that\'s reasonably close to shore, if that\'s the\none I\'m thinking about.\n\nRight?\n\nBecause the frame immedi\xc2\xad\n\nately before showed the shoreline and then you could see\npart of that feature.\nBRAND\n\nLater on it might be helpful to look at the pictures.\n\nThat\n\nwould trigger our memory.\nEL-BAZ\n\nWe do have some pictures.\n\nSTEVENSON\n\nRight in that area, here\'s the sound velocity profile.\n\nYou\n\ncan see the low velocities jammed up toward the surface\nthere.\n\nSometime later we\'ll go through the photographs and\n\nwe can go back through this.\n\nThat\'s the kind of features\n\nPage 85\nwe like.\n\nDeke, you mentioned that you, north of Hawaii,\n\ncame past Hawaii and one day sawall the eddies standing\nout about 200 miles long, you thought, south of Hawaii.\nJust a minute or so later, you saw linear cloud lines and\nyou mentioned what you thought looked like a big front in\nthe ocean.\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nCan you describe that a little bit?\n\nWe have the pictures of that, Bob, at the end.\npicture of the front.\n\nWe have the\n\nThe mapping camera was photographing\n\nat this time, and we do have the slides.\n\nSTEVENSON\n\nI don\'t think it was contrast.\n\nSLAYTON\n\nI don\'t have any more comment on it.\n\nBRAND\n\nI took the pictures and remember it fairly well.\njust weird.\n\nIt was\n\nI\'d never seen anything like it before, it was\n\na tic-tac-toe type pattern.\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nWe\'re talking about two different things now.\ning about the highways?\n\nYou\'re talk\xc2\xad\n\nI was talking about the bunch of\n\neddies, or Benard cells, or whatever they may be, and then\na very solid front of clouds.\n\nSLAYTON\n\nRight?\n\nYes, I remember that when we discussed that, and I saw it.\nThe cloud pattern was unusual; one was one way and one was\nanother coming into it or something.\n\nPage 86\nEL-BAZ\n\nWe have the pictures.\n\nBRAND\n\nOh ~ I remember now.\n\nPart of it was circular and it had a\n\nlinear thing coming into it.\n\nSLAYTON\n\nYes~\n\nBRAND\n\nI think you would have to rely on the\n\nSTEVENSON\n\nWe don\'t have that part of the tape yet.\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nWe don\'t have the tapes of the latter part of the mission;\n\nthere was something linear going into it.\nwhatever we said.\n\ntape~\n\nwe\'re still looking for them.\n\nSTEVENSON\n\nThis was a real-time transmission you\n\nDeke.\n\nmade~\n\n"Hey ~ gee there\'s a big front down there."\n\nYou\n\nsaid~\n\nAnd you mentioned\n\nthat it looked as if there were turbulent eddies along the\nboundaries.\n\nAnd that\'s all we got SO far.\n\nI don\'t know if\n\nthere\'s a picture; I haven\'t seen a picture.\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nAs we go through the\n\nSLAYTON\n\nI can\'t tell you any more off the top of my head.\n\npictures~\n\nmaybe that will remind them.\nWe saw\n\nso many interesting cloud features over that ocean you can\'t\nbelieve it.\n\nIf we had about another 500 frames of 70\xc2\xad\n\nmillimeter film we\'d have shot her up over\n\nthere~\n\nbut we\n\nthought we were running short and we were holding our horses.\nThere were all kinds of interesting clouds.\n\nPage 87\nBRAND\n\nInfinite variety of patterns.\n\nSTEVENSON\n\nOk~,\n\none last general question.\n\nI have already talked to\n\nVance about it, but maybe Tom and Deke can remember the\nlast day.\n\nWas it revolution 136, the one across the North\n\nAtlantic?\n\nAt the end of that revolution you all looked out\n\nand saw the green Ireland.\n\nYou mentioned Ireland really is\n\ngreen, that you could see it through the breaks.\n\nOkay,\n\nthat was the RAF pass; on most of that pass, the Nimrod\ncrew had 100 percent cloud cover out to 400 miles west, and\nthen they got into some broken scattered clouds.\ndid see some distinct changes in water color.\nquestion is this:\n\nAnd they\n\nSo my main\n\nLooking through that kind of cloud cover,\n\nwhat sort of comments can you make about looking at the\nocean through that kind of stuff?\n\nDo you remember seeing\n\nanything other than the fact that there were breaks in the\nclouds?\nSLAYTON \n\n\nAs I recollect that particular pass, we were pretty much\nover cloud cover for an extended period of time and all of\na sudden we found this break, and there was that green down\nthere and we figured, trajectorywise, that would be about\nwhere Ireland was.\n\nAnd as a matter of fact we then saw\n\nsouthern England, and on into France and then we picked up\nsome more cloud cover through middle Europe again.\nit was pretty solid overcast before that.\n\nI think\n\nPage\n\n88\n\nSTEVENSON\n\nSo when the clouds do open up, even reasonably good, then\nare you not prepared,\n\nSLAYTON\n\nOr are you sa:ying, "It\'s pretty solid?"\n\nI think you can tell pretty well, when you are looking out,\nwhen you are getting enough breaks in it so you expect to\nsee something.\n\nBut when you have something like five-tenths\n\ncloud cover, you don\'t see very much obliquely.\n\nIf you\'re\n\nlooking straight down through them, you can pick up some\ndefinition.\nBRAND\n\nThe shadows don\'t help the situation at all, in the clouds.\n\nSTEVENSON\n\nWhite caps.\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nYou don\'t really see white caps too much.\n\nBRAND\n\nNo.\n\nSPEAKER\n\nWhen you\'ve got that many clouds, your geographic orientation\nis going to be poor, too.\n\nBRAND\n\nThat\'s right.\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nWe sure saw some icebergs though, up in that North Atlantic.\n\nSLAYTON\n\nDid you ever get a picture of that?\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nIn the 35-millimeter, yes, there are some pictures.\n\nPage\n\nSLAYTON\n\n89\n\nThere was that one iceberg sticking right up through that\ncloud deck, or fog deck, that was leaving that wake right\nbehind it.\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nSpectacular.\n\nThere was a picture of some icebergs, one big one and maybe\na few small ones, with not a speck of clouds.\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nThere was one you could see the tip of the iceberg, and it\nlooked like a shockwave behind it.\ning behind it.\n\nThere were clouds flow\xc2\xad\n\nIt was just a "V", like this.\n\nAnd here\'s\n\nthe iceberg sticking up through it and the clouds were\nflowing like that.\nEL-BAZ\n\nOkay, I haven\'t seen that.\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nI hope it came out.\n\nSTEVENSON\n\nNo white caps though?\n\nYou don\'t remember seeing any white\n\ncaps.\n\nSLAYTON\n\nI don\'t know, maybe around some - \xc2\xad\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nYou could sure see the wakes of ships though.\n\nThose will\n\nreally stand out.\n\nSLAYTON\n\nMaybe on some shorelines you might have seen the surf.\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nYes, possibly, but I can\'t remember identifying it.\nmain thing are the wakes of ships.\n\nThe\n\nPage 90\n\nSLAYTON\n\nAt least, that\'s where it ought to be, but whether we\'re \n\nactually seeing it or not \xc2\xad\n\nBRAND\n\nI think you would have to see it as textural difference, \n\nrather than white caps. \n\n\nSLAYTON\n\nYes, right. \n\n\nSTEVENSON\n\nLet\'s quickly run through these slides.\n\nNow I think that \n\n\nthis is the one that everyone is talking about off New Zealand. \n\nSLAYTON\n\nYes, that\'s it.\nabout.\n\nSTEVENSON\n\nThat light material is what we\'re talking \n\n\nIs it sediment or is it plankton or bottom?\n\nLet\'s go to the next one, because that\'s the same feature.\nNow that\'s not your scumline.\n\nThat must have been a dif\xc2\xad \n\n\nferent camera or different lens. \n\nSPEAKER\n\nNo, this is taken I think about 4 minutes later.\n\nHe was \n\n\nalmost to Cook Islands when he took this. \n\nSTEVENSON\n\nBut that\'s the same feature there, or something.\nback that one up?\n\nCan you \n\n\nThere it is. \n\n\nSLAYTON\n\nThat\'s the same feature. \n\n\nSPEAKER\n\nThere\'s four frames in between, though. \n\n\nSLAYTON\n\nOk8\\V, you had to change lenses to get that difference. \n\n\nPage 91\nEL-BAZ\n\nYou have to change lenses and we had one mapping camera\nbusy, and we could not have been using two cameras either.\n\nSLAYTON\n\nBut there was stuff like this out to the northeast of\nNew Zealand. \n\n\nSPEAKER\n\nThis camera doesn\'t have a Reseau plate on it. \n\n\nSTEVENSON\n\nOk~,\n\nSLAYTON\n\nHas that got a Reseau on it? \n\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nIt\'s the same pattern, but it cannot be the same feature, \n\n\nlet\'s go to that next one then. \n\n\nbecause we had one camera going.\n\nAnd there are several\n\nframes between the one we saw and this one.\nSLAYTON\n\nThat has to be 250-millimeter lens there to have the same\nscale effect. \n\n\nBRAND\n\nWe didn\'t change lenses. \n\n\nSLAYTON\n\nWe sure didn\'t change lenses that fast. \n\n\nSTEVENSON\n\nOk~,\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nHey, there\'s some with internal waves. \n\n\nSTEVENSON\n\nAnd I\'m guessing that these are the internal waves you saw. \n\n\nSLAYTON\n\nYes, sir. \n\n\nthe next slide, please.\n\nPage 92\nEL-BAZ\n\nVery nice.\n\nIs this the same view?\n\nSLAYTON\n\nYes, exactly.\n\nDo you remember it? \n\n\nI may be wrong, but that was my immediate \n\n\nimpression, that those were internal waves, and I shot them. \n\nI don\'t know if\' you guys agree if\' that\'s what they are or not. \n\nSTEVENSON\n\nI think there\'s no doubt about that. \n\n\nSLAYTON\n\nThey\'re certainly very big structures. \n\n\nSTEVENSON\n\nSo as you came across this f\'ield of\' view, you got a glitter \n\npattern and there\'s the internal waves. \n\n\nSLAYTON\n\nThat\'s what I mean about them just springing out at you all \n\nof\' a sudden.\n\nWe were just kind of\' cruising along there \n\n\nenjoying the scenery and all of\' a sudden, there they were. \n\nSTEVENSON\n\nSo you have, about 5 seconds, you think? \n\n\nSLAYTON\n\nProbably. \n\n\nSTEVENSON\n\nSo if\' you\'re going to say anything about it, you\'re not \n\ngoing to shoot a picture. \n\n\nSLAYTON\n\nThat\'s right. \n\n\nSTEVENSON\n\nOkay, the next slide. \n\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nThat\'s the Mediterranean.\n\nThere it is. \n\n\nPage\n\nSTEVENSON \n\n\n93\n\nNow, if you can remember before the mission, there was a\nSkylab shot, and in that shot that front was lying right\nopposite that river mouth.\n\nNow you were coming up on a\n\npath roughly about so.\nSTAFFORD\n\nYes, up to the north, because we were right by a big flight\xc2\xad\nline that runs from Spain.\n\nSTEVENSON\n\nAnd you also looked over here.\n\nNow is this where you saw \n\n\nthe ship\'s wakes? \n\nSTAFFORD\n\nRight in that area, right there. \n\n\nBRAND\n\nI saw those too. \n\n\nSTEVENSON\n\nSo the glitter pattern then came moving this way toward \n\nyou.\n\nIs that right? \n\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nNo, this way. \n\n\nSTEVENSON\n\nSo you saw this feature first? \n\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nAt first, it was just a solid shade of blue, nothing there. \n\nSuddenly it just popped like that. \n\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nAnd you noticed that we have not seen these ships or the \n\nship wakes in the pictures. \n\n\nSPEAKER\n\nThere\'s no glitter picture down in there. \n\n\nPage 94\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nBut you can see ship wakes if you don\'t have glitter, too.\n\nBRAND\n\nYou can, yes.\n\nSLAYTON\n\nYou\'re right.\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nThey were looking at ship wakes before they got the\nglitter there.\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nAnd these ships are like little white dots all down in there.\n\nSTEVENSON\n\nYes, that\'s a beauty; there\'s no\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nBob; what\'s this dark water, or is this the boundary\n\nq~estion\n\nabout that.\n\nbetween the two currents?\n\nSTEVENSON\n\nThere\'s a distinct difference in the motion of the water\non either side of the boundary.\n\nYou see rougher water on\n\none side than you have on the other, and it makes a dif\xc2\xad\nference in the reflective pattern.\n\nYou can see the slicks.\n\nTom, that\'s the first thing that struck your eye, I guess.\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nYes.\n\nThe whole contrast looked like it had a gyre spinning\n\noff of something out there too.\nright in this whole area.\n\nI shot a bunch of them\n\nThere were also some internal\n\nwaves that were coming out someway.\n\nWe have a couple of\n\nother shots that we could look at individually, later.\n\nPage\n\nSTEVENSON \n\n\n95\n\nBoy, that scene comes pretty fast for you to describe all \n\nthe features you saw, right? \n\n\nSTAFFORD \n\n\nYes, it does. \n\n\nSTEVENSON \n\n\nNext slide, please. \n\n\nSTAFFORD \n\n\nThat\'s Sicily.\n\nYou can see those waves.\n\nThat\'s the south\xc2\xad \n\n\neast coast. \n\n\nSTEVENSON\n\nNow you mentioned the cloud line several times, and I\'m \n\n\nguessing that this is it. \n\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nThat\'s what it is.\n\nYou can see it\'s superimposed on top \n\n\nof a wave right there. \n\n\nSTEVENSON\n\nSo that was fairly easy to see, I guess. \n\n\nEl-BAZ\n\nThis was very clear on the TV that we saw during the \n\nundocking.\n\nSTEVENSON\n\nThat was a beautiful line right there. \n\n\nYes, at the undocking and the redocking there was a \n\nfantastic cloud line.\n\nAre those cloud lines helpful as \n\n\nyou come up on them and as you get into a glitter pattern \n\nand then begin to see the features behind? \n\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nYou can do a lot with clouds as far as giving some clue. \n\n\nPage\n\n96\n\nSTEVENSON\n\nThe Mediterranean was mainly clear from all I remember\nduring the flight.\n\nAnd you did look at it several times,\n\nand there weren\'t a lot of clouds, but still the features\nstood out, did they?\nSLAYTON \n\n\nWe were coming down across the other way through, it seemed\nto me.\n\nOf course, that\'s most of the Adriatic, but that\n\nwas pretty well clouded over, in the eastern Mediterranean.\nSTAFFORD \n\n\nThat was a descending pass where this was kind of ascending.\n\nSLAYTON \n\n\nAscending passes seemed to be clear.\n\nWhen you\'re trying\n\nto get that stuff .... ....\nBRAND\n\nWhen we were trying to that Adriatic Sea stuff, we had a\nlot of clouds over the Alps.\n\nIt seems to me we had them\n\nover the Balkans, and down to Venice and then it would\nclear out over the water.\nSTAFFORD\n\nThe Alps also had a lot of haze up in the air, haze and\nclouds.\n\nWe got some of the surroundings, you could see\n\nsome of the snowline, but it was just very hazy there.\nEL....BAZ\n\nWas it air pollution in little areas and valleys and so on,\nor the whole thing?\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nNo, the whole thing was pretty hazy.\n\nPage 97\nSPEAKER\n\nWas there any more, or was that all the slides? \n\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nHere are some cells.\n\nWe used to see those every once \n\n\nin a while. \n\n\nSTEVENSON\n\nThat\'s in the mid-Pacific, right? \n\n\nBRAND\n\nGenerally, you didn\'t see so many cells. \n\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nThey were bigger and fewer, weren\'t they? \n\n\nBRAND\n\nYes, in all different sizes. \n\n\nSPEAKER\n\nWas that all clouds? \n\n\nSTEVENSON\n\nIt\'s cloud, these are convective cells over the Pacific. \n\nIt\'s a fairly constant feature of the tropical ocean, at \n\nleast in that area. \n\n\nSPEAKER\n\nBob, about your internal waves off\' New Zealand.\n\nNow, the \n\n\ninternal wave has to be normal to wind direction at speeds \n\nless than about 11 miles per hour, or 13 miles per hour, \n\notherwise you have Langmuir circulation and your siicks run \n\nparallel to wind direction. \n\n\nSTEVENSON\n\nThat f S right.\n\nSPEAKER\n\nOff\' Brazil, which is it, internal waves, or Langmuir circu\xc2\xad\nlation or do you know?\n\nPage 98\n\nSTEVENSON\n\nIn that photograph we saw, I think there\'s no question that \n\nit was internal waves.\n\nI can show you some Langmuir circu\xc2\xad \n\n\nlation and it doesn\'t have anywhere near that appearance, \n\nfrom that altitude. \n\nSPEAKER\n\nBut it was off New Guinea. \n\n\nSTEVENSON\n\nI think the next slide has another cell.\n\nAnd that\'s a \n\n\n35-millimeter shot and my guess is that, Deke, you took \n\nthat.\n\nYou mentioned that you didn\'t usually see so many \n\n\ncells together and here\'s one that\'s pretty isolated.\n\nSo \n\n\nI guess my question is, "Is this fairly common\'?" \n\nSLAYTON\n\nYes, very common.\n\nAnd many of them were exactly like that, \n\n\nthey have a fairly large cloud structure on one side and then \n\nthere was kind of lower clouds around the rest of the rim. \n\nSTEVENSON\n\nAre those easy to pick up\'? \n\n\nSLAYTON\n\nYes. \n\n\nBRAND\n\nNo problem. \n\n\nSTEVENSON\n\nI have one more question, which is really for the whole crew. \n\nWe were hoping you were going to see some bioluminescence. \n\nI remember on that one pass when Deke said, "Hey, somebody \n\ngoofed up; it\'s still da\\Y\'-light here." \n\n\nPage 99\n\nSLAYTON \n\n\nWe were in daylight; the ground was in dark.\n\nBut once we\n\ngot the spacecraft into the darkness, there was a cloud\ncover, I\'d have to guess.\n\nI could see oil fires burning\n\nup through there, but it was obvious from that that there\nwas somewhere between five and eight tenths cloud cover and\nI couldn\'t even tell where water was, to say nothing about\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nwhere bioluminescence might have been.\nSTEVENSON\n\nSo you never had any during the whole flight?\n\nSLAYTON\n\nNo, sir.\n\nIf it had been clear as a bell down there and it,\n\nin fact, existed, our odds of seeing it were pretty poor,\nI think, because we\'d just come out of that bright sunlight\nand suddenly you\'re in the dark and no dark-adaptation time\nat all.\nBRAND\n\nIf you ever try that again, you\'d really want to have a long\ndark-adaptation time, and you\'d want to think about moonlight\nand things like that too.\n\nThat moonlight has quite a big\n\neffect on what you can see.\nSTEVENSON\n\nYou had a good Moon.\n\nBRAND\n\nYes.\n\nSTEVENSON\n\nI have one more thing to say.\n\nAs you remember, the Chief\n\nof Naval Research, Admiral Dick VanOrden, came down here\n\nPage 100\nprior to the \tmission and you guys were all on simulation\nthat day, so \the didn\'t get to see you.\n\nThe Office of Naval\n\nResearch c.Onsiders this whole effort to be Of extreme sig\xc2\xad\nnificance to \t heir research program as well as to future\nt\nNavy operations.\n\nThe admiral has since retired, as of\n\nAugust 1, and \the wanted me to extend his best wishes to all\nof you and thank you for your efforts.\n\nHe has had put to\xc2\xad\n\ngether some certificates which on his behalf I\'d like to\npresent to you now.\nEL-BAZ \t\n\nWe have maybe 5 to 10 minutes more with a few more pictures\nof the clouds and meteorology.\n\nUnfortunately Pete Black\n\ncannot be here today, but we\'ll show some of the slides that\nhe wanted to talk about.\n\nLook at a couple of cloud patterns\n\nand here, Bob, this is one of those places where you have in\nthe Pacific these tremendous Benard cells or the cells of\nclouds; then you get to that edge of the cloud front.\n\nI\n\nthink Vance also commented about that and so did Deke; that\nin the Pacific and for miles ahead of these you had these\nseparate patterns.\nBRAND \t\n\nWe ought to really sort out Benard cells from what we\'re\ncalling eddies.\n\nI guess those look like Benard cells.\n\nBut\n\nthe things that we\'re calling eddies are bigger features,\nnot all of the same diameter, and sometimes scattered.\n\nPage 101\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nCan you see a few of them?\n\nThere are not as many as what\n\nyou see right here?\nBRAND\n\nSometimes you\'ll see only one.\n\nOr you may see three, but\n\nin kind of random groupings.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nI remember one time, we looked obliquely and these were\ngreat big things, but they went practically all the way to\nthe horizon, like one, and here\'s another one, and disap\xc2\xad\npeared.\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nWe\'re talking about m9\\Ybe four cells, eddies total.\n\nSo the stuff that you were describing, Vance, near Hawaii,\nwas it like this, or like what you think the eddies may be,\nthe fewer?\n\nBRAND\n\nIt was not like this because this is an area of cells.\n\nWhat\n\nI saw was a line of circular structures going to the horizon.\nAnd it occurred to me that perhaps it was the edge of a cur\xc2\xad\nrent, but then I couldn\'t justify that idea, because it\ndidn\'t look like gyres, or spinoffs.\n\nIt looked like pure\n\ncircular cells, more or less in a line.\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nBut it did look like you were\n\nfollo~~ng\n\na meandering cur\xc2\xad\n\nrent that was going off across the ocean, didn\'t it?\nyou were going to try to establish a pattern to it.\nBRAND\n\nIt looked like it followed a boundary.\n\nIf\n\nPage 102\nSTAFFORD\n\nYes.\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nOk~,\n\ngood.\n\nNext slide please.\n\nOkay, herets your highways\n\nin the sky, a very fantastic picture.\nthat these\n\n~ay\n\nSome people have said\n\nbe contrails and you said they are a little\n\ntoo big to be this\n\nw~.\n\nAnd I think we had comments coming \n\n\nfrom some of the Skylab guys, that they had seen these linear \n\npatterns in the clouds before, but this is a very dramatic one. \n\nSLAYTON\n\nWe saw an awful lot of contrails over the North Atlantic and \n\nit\'s nothing like that.\n\nThey just don\'t get that big. \n\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nThat\'s right.\n\nBRAND\n\nWhen you look at this in a picture, you say, "ObViously that\'s \n\ncontrails,"\n\nThey were lots thinner than that. \n\n\nbut when you remember back to how wide thElY were, \n\n\nat the bases \n\nSTAFFORD\n\nYou see that little thing right there?\nsize of a contrail, at the maximum.\n\nThat\'s more like the \n\n\nThat would be a big \n\n\ncontrail right there. \n\nBRAND\n\nContrails were lines; these are wedges practically. \n\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nAlsO, it was interesting in the way that this pattern stopped. \n\n\nBRAND\n\nI\'m not sure.\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nThat\'s very good, next slide. \n\n\nAt the time I didn\'t think so. \n\n\n..\n\n.. Page 103 .\n\nSPEAI)J!!R . \t\n\nRemember from Skylab, when they took a picture and they\nthought it was the hot air coming from a ship going through\na very low scattered deck about like that, and there was .a\nplume\n\n~oing\n\nright across the apparent trend cf the clouds.\n\nDo you think that maybe that was this same thing?\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nBRAND\n\nIt\'s a possibility I suppose but at the time it looked\nnatural.\n\nSPEAKER\n\nDid you get any perception of depth on it?\n\nOr did it look\n\nlike \tit was all of the same depth?\nBRAND\n\nMore \t or less the same depth.\n\nSPEAKER\n\nEspecially the two that crossed?\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nCan we get that slide back for a minute?\n\nSPEAKER\n\nThey \tdi dn \'t look as wi de.\n\nBRAND\n\nLet me\n\ns~\n\nthis, the base of the wedge was extremely wide,\n\nI\'d say miles and miles.\n\nNow do you think there\'s anything\n\nnatural that would give that width of I don\'t know how many\nmiles?\nSLAYTON\n\nlou could put a scaling factor on that.\n\nBRAND\n\nIt could be determined.\n\nPerhaps 10 or 20 miles.\n\ncontrail or ship\'s wake do that?\n\nWould a\n\nPage 104 \n\nSTAFFORD \n\n\nHere\'s something else.\n\nIs it\n\ndown below this is all blue\nEL-BAZ\n\nb~cause\n\nan~\n\nof sun heating that.\n\nthe discontinuity?\n\nOka;y, I think we\'ll have to leave this to meteorologists\nand we\'ll see what comes out.\n\nThis iSQne very good pic\xc2\xad\n\nture or the convective thunderstorms or\n\nthuri~erclouds.\n\nYou were aware of these things as they went by, the\n\ndiffer~\n\nence, the distinctive difference?\nSTAFFORD\n\nWe got a bunch of those in various places too, but I don\'t \n\nknow how they came out. \n\nThat\'s very typical. \n\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nThis is a typical view, is it?\n\nVery\n\nBRAND\n\nWe\'ve seen just scads of those. \n\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nAnd this is just the right exposure for the meteorologists \n\n\ngoo~. \n\n\nbecause they can see the texture in all the cloud here. \n\nThis is what they would like to see in cloud pictures. \n\nSTAFFORD\n\nWe lucked out, this is going into sunset. \n\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nSo, to me, I thought it would be a very underexposed picture, \n\nbut this is the way they like it so that they can start \n\nseeing the texture in the cloud.\n\nNext slide, please. \n\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPage 105\n\nSLAYTON\n\nMost of them that we shot intentionally were probably \n\noverexposed. \n\n\nEL-BAZ\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nWhat\'s this one, Vance? \n\n\nBRAND\n\nI believe that was an attempt to show an eddy. \n\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nThis is not the developing storm? \n\n\nBRAND\n\nNo.\n\nThe one that was developing was so big that if we had \n\n\ntaken a picture of the center of it, all you\'d see was \n\nwhite on that frame. \n\nEL-BAZ\n\nThe developing one, the one that you got at the very end \n\nof the mission? \n\n\nBRAND\n\nYes, it took minutes to cross it. \n\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nYes, hundreds of miles across that bear. \n\n\nSLAYTON\n\nWe had to shoot a panorama through almost 180 degrees to \n\ncover that whole thing. \n\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nThat\'s it, that\'s the one. \n\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nAnd why did they call this developing?\ngood movement to it. \n\n\nThat has a very \n\n\nPage 106\nBRAND\n\nIt looked like a hurricane, it really did; it had spiral\narms.\n\nThe only thing is you didn\'t see the eye in the\n\ncenter, but you saw things that could have been the eye\ncovered over, or you saw something that you could imagine\nthat\'s where the eye was.\xc2\xb7\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nYes, out of foclle.\n\nSTEVENSON\n\nDo you remember where that previous slide was taken, Vance?\n\nBRAND\n\nI think I called down a MARK; I tried to on all these; tried\nto give a GET.\n\nAll I can\n\ns~\n\nis that I\'m sure it was the\n\nPacific and can we switch back to it? \n\nEL-BAZ\n\nYou had five very nice pictures in that sequence of it; we \n\nhave magnificent stereo. \n\n\nBRAND\n\nI think that\'s a very good picture of what we call an eddy. \n\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nOk8\xc2\xa5. \n\n\nS\'l;\'AFFORD\n\nThe earlier one. \n\n\nBRAND\n\nThe one before this. \n\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nYes.\n\nBRAND\n\nNow you can see on the bottom of that structure a continua\xc2\xad \n\n\nThat\'s what we term an eddy. \n\n\ntion around, and clouds on the edge that are normally\n\nPage 107\n\ncumulus-type buildups, but not going very high.\n\nSometimes\n\nin the center there are clouds, like you see; and sometimes\nin the center, no clouds at all.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nOften, I\'d say at least 50 percent of the time, the center\nhad no clouds at all.\n\nSLAYTON\n\nI thought that was the difference between a cold- and warm\xc2\xad\nwater eddy.\n\nOff the top of my head, I\'d say that was a\n\nwarm-water eddy.and the clear ones were cold-water eddies.\nI don\'t know if that\'s right or not.\nSPEAKER \n\n\nI think you\'re right.\n\nSPEAKER \n\n\nI\'m convinced that\'s warm water and if it is where I think\nit is, it\'s a perfect representation.\n\nSLAYTON \n\n\nThat was what I said about all those.\n\nEL-BAZ \n\n\nOkay, very good.\nhere.\n\nNext slide.\n\nWe have a couple of pictures\n\nIs this a ship wake or an oil slick?\n\nis in the gulf.\n\nThis I think\n\nWe may go through this sequence in detail\n\nand see.\nSTAFFORD\n\nOften you would see stuff like this over here, and I don\'t\nremember seeing that.\n\nDoes somebody remember seeing it?\n\nWe just lucked out and got it.\n\nPage 108 \n\nSLAYTON \n\n\nI remember, once coming across the gulf, that we did see\n\nwhat I thought was a pretty clear boundary line there, but\nwhether that\'s it or not, I frankly don\'t remember.\nSTAFFORD\n\nThat\'s right in the Gulf of Mexico.\nline.\n\nThere was a boundary\n\nDown here.\nthe. next one please.\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nOk~,\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nThat looks like part of the Amazon Basin.\n\nSee that river?\n\nThat\'s the Amazon Basin.\nEL-BAZ\n\nOk~.\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nThat\'s interesting, because we haven\'t brought that out\nbefore, but in part of that Amazon Basin, what I thought\nwas the main Amazon River, was real brawn muddy water; it\nstood out just like a brown line running through the green\njungle.\n\nThen there were some rivers to the north of there,\n\nand this is one of them, I think, that was clear bright\nblue, nice clean looking water.\nEL-BAZ\n\nNorth of the Amazon?\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nI never was sure whether it fed into the Amazon as a tribu\xc2\xad\ntary or not.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPage 109\nSPEAKER\n\nThe part which is dirty comes from the Andes and you have\nclear water coming in north and south.\n\nThe dirt from the\n\nsouth is very black because it\'s high in humic acids.\n\nThe\n\nRio Negro is called Negro not because it\'s muddy, but be\xc2\xad\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\ncause it\'s high in humic acids.\nBRAND\n\nIt\'s very black.\n\nWhere we saw those two rivers come together, it was jungle\nand it looks strange to see the water look clear, going\nthrough jungle terrain.\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nOk~,\n\nvery good.\n\nHere are a couple more pictures that we\n\ndon\'t know the location of.\n\nNext slide, please.\n\nwe have an idea about, but we\'re not really sure.\n\nThis one\nYou see,\n\nthis is snow cover on top of the mountains, and see the\nsolid cloud.\nSTAFFORD\n\nThat could be the Andes but I don\'t remember\n\nany\n\nthing\n\ndetached like that in this other thing.\nSLAYTON\n\nIt could be the Himalayas.\n\nOne pass we made over there.\n\nit was all cloud covered and I just remember we had a few\nsticking out the top there once.\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nYou could see things sticking out through the clouds?\n\nSLAYTON\n\nWhether that\'s it or not, I don\'t remember.\n\nPage 110\nEL-BAZ\n\nWe\'ll come back to this, maybe.\ndetached piece.\n\nThis one is the same little\n\nAnd that\'s low Sun angle and most likely\n\nit is the Andes, because of the geometry.\nTom, when\n\nyo~\n\nDo you remember,\n\nhad two revolutions at the southwest over\n\nSouth America (one of them revolution 88 and the other\nabout 120)1\n\nMaybe one of the revolutions was where the\n\nclouds came all the way up to the mountain, where you did\nnot see a coastline, where you could not see the Nazca Plains.\nSTAFFORD\n\nThat could be it.\n\nIt would be on the earlier pass.\n\nOn the\n\nsecond pass, the clouds were not as - EL-BAZ\n\nDid not keep to the mountain.\n\nThese is very low Sun, so\n\nthat\'s why I\'m saying it is the Andes.\nSPEAKER\n\nBetween Concepcion and Santiago is this detached mountain\nrange that goes up almost 9000 feet off the main Andes.\nAt the lower right corner, Santiago would be under those\nclouds.\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nYou think the last one was over that same area, too?\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nIt\'s the same area.\n\nSPEAKER\n\nYou can see those Argentine sand dunes in the background.\n\nGo back to the last slide.\n\n.. \n\n\nPage III\nSTAFFORD\n\nOkay there they are.\nthe bottom?\n\nSo the Pacific Ocean is down here at\n\nThat\'s the Andes.\n\nThey have a kind of peculiar\n\ncharacteristic of their own.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nVery good, and then the last slide, please.\n\nThat\'s about\n\nthe only one that I recall with an iceberg in it.\nt\n\nI don\'t\n\nknow whether these white pieces are also ice pieces or not.\nSTAFFORD\n\nIs that with a 351\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nYes.\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nThat was in the North Atlantic.\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nYes.\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nThere\'s the one with the cloud pattern, but also we saw\n\nAnd there are no clouds.\n\nsome that weren\'t that big, kind of in groups of threes.\nThey were more something like that.\n\nThere were three and\n\nthen three one time that we shot.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nSo you did see icebergs on two or three revolutions?\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nYes.\n\nEL-BAZ\n\nVery good.\n\nIs this the last slide?\n\nIn conclusion, I want\n\nto thank you very much for a terrific job.\n\nI want to thank\n\nyou first for spending the time for the training required\nfor this experiment and also for your help in getting most\n\nPage 112\nof that stuff in the Flight Plan and certainly for your\ntremendous effort in trying to get most of the stuff.\nsure we will put it to good use.\nhere~\n\nI\'d like to thank you.\n\nI\'m\n\nOn behalf of everybody\n\nDo you have something to say?\n\n,.\nSTAFFORD\n\nI\'ve got a question.\n\nI don\'t know whether anybody\'s seen\n\nanother two or three pictures I hope we\n\nof some struc\xc2\xad\n\ngot~\n\nture which I think is in China or Mongolia.\nwhether I mentioned that to you or not.\n\nI don\'t know\n\nIt looked like a\n\ngreat big riverbed coming out of the north and fanning out\nover a very large area.\n\nIt just looked like a sandy, dry\n\nriverbed coming down and spreading out this way.\nquite a bit north of our orbit\ntance~\n\nand~\n\nIt was\n\nconsidering the dis\xc2\xad\n\nit had to be a very mammoth structure of some kind.\n\nI shot three or four pictures of it, I think.\n\nDid you see\n\nanything that looked like that?\nSPEAKER\n\nIt\n\nBREED\n\nWas this in the northern part of China?\n\nSTAFFORD\n\nThat would be my guess as to where it was.\n\nBREED\n\nI think I know what you mean.\n\nm~be\n\nof it.\n\non that one roll we have left.\n\nYes.\n\nI hope you did get a picture\n\nL\n\nPage 113\nSTAFFORD\n\nIt was a very unusual looking thing.\n\nConsidering the size \n\n\nof it, if I was looking at it from 10 000 feet I\'d have \n\nsaid, "That\'s a mammoth old dry riverbed."\n\nBut from that \n\n\naltitude, it would really have to be mammoth.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nof fanned out.\nBREED\n\nIt just kind \n\n\nIt just looked like a sandy river bottom\xe2\x80\xa2 \n\n\nThat\'s exactly it.\n\nI have an ERTS image over that area. \n\n\nI can\'t quite pick out what those things are.\n\nSo if you \n\n\ngot a picture, that would be really a picture we could use. \n\nEL-BAZ\n\nVery good.\n\nHARDEE\n\nOkay.\n\nNat, do you have anything further? \n\n\nI had about three comments.\n\nOne, again I\'d like to \n\n\ncongratulate both the crew and Farouk\'s team, the visual \n\nobservations team, for a very successful experiment and \n\nfor all their hard work.\n\nAnd alsQ I\'d like to thank the \n\n\nLSI for all their fine hospitality shown here today.\none note of
