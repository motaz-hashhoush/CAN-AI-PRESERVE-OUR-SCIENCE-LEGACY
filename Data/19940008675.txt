EDWARD\n\nC. STONE\n\nDirector,\n\nJet Propulsion\n\nNational\n\nAeronautics\n\nLaboratory\nand Space Administration\n\nOn behalfofNASA\'s\nJet Propulsion Laboratory,\nit\'s\na great pleasure to welcome\nall of you to the Ninth\nAnnual NASA/Contractors\nConference\non Quality\nand Productivity.\nThis conference\nprovides an excellent forum for the\nmembers\nof the NASA community\nto share their\nexperience\nand expertise in an effort to continuously\nimprove the quality of the U.S. space program.\nAs all of you are aware, we have entered a post cold\nwar era in which there is now significant cultural and\nstructural\nchange underway.\nAt the moment, this\nchange includes a number of negative factors, such\nas a stubborn\nrecession\nand a high unemployment\nrate.\nHowever, many American\nindustries are responding\nto this changing\nenvironment\nby restructuring\nto\nbecome more streamlined\nand more efficiently run\norganizations\nthat are responsible\nand responsive\nto\ntheir customers\'\nneeds. Companies\nand government\nagencies are adopting the Total Quality Management\napproach\nspecifically to accommodate\nthis changing\nenvironment.\nAt JPL, we have initiated\n\nthree\n\nmain activities.\n\nDr. Edward\n\nFirst,\n\nC. Stone\n\nimplement.\nSome of the most successful companies\nhave been practicing TQM for 10 to 40years or more.\n\nwe are providing training classes for every employee\nwhere they learn to speak a common vocabulary and\nhow to improve\nboth\nindividual\nand team\nperformance.\n\nThis conference\nis an indication\nthat the concept of\nquality and excellence\nis not just a passing fad at\nNASA. This is, after all, the ninth annual conference\non quality.\n\nSecond, we have put in place a number of process\naction teams where small groups of employees focus\non staff processes\nthat need improvement.\nAnd,\nfinally, we have developed\nour vision, mission, values,\nand a set of strategic goals for change by which we\nwill be guided.\nJPL is committed\nto making TQM a\npart of our culture.\n\nThis year\'s theme,\n"World Class Excellence:\nThe\nJourney\nContinues,"\nemphasizes\nthat NASA will\ncontinue to strive for excellence in everything it does.\nOver the past 30 years, I have worked with the people\nat JPL and NASA and with many of the NASA\ncontractors\nand have first-hand\nknowledge\nof the\ncommitment,\ndedication,\nand excellence\nthat exists\nin this space community.\nI know that the people in\nthis community\nare motivated\nbya challenge and will\ncontinue\nto set the standards\nin the area of quality\nand productivity.\n\nOf course, TQM has been criticized\nas just another\nfad that will be replaced by something else in a few\nyears.\nHowever,\nany organization\nthat is serious\nabout developing TQ M attitudes must accept the fact\nthat this is not a revolutionary\nprocess,\nbut an\nevolutionary\none that will take many years to fully\n\n5\nPRECEDIN6\n\nPAGE\n\nBLANK\n\nNOT\n\nFILMED\n\n\' IASA\'S APPROACH\nTO CONTINUAL\nINTEGRATION\nAND COOPERATION"\nLAURIE\nAssociate\n\nA. BROEDLING,\nPH.D.\nAdministrator\nfor Continual\n\nNational\n\nAeronautics\n\nIMPROVEMENT:\n\nImprovement\n\nand Space Administration\n\nOne of the benefits that a space program brings to\nthe world is a sense of perspective.\nA space program\nnot only allows us to look out into space, it also lets\nus look back at earth. From the perspective\nof space\norbit, earth looks like a small place. The perspective\nis one of all of humanity having to share a planet and\ntherefore\nto work cooperatively\nto make the best use\nof the earth\'s resources.\nAt a national level, we also must recognize\nthat we\nare mutually dependent.\nIn the face of economic\npressures,\nwe should recognize\nthat a rising tide\nraises all ships.\nA win-win\napproach\ninvolving\nmutual cooperation\nrather than internal competition\nis a preferable\nway to bolster U .S. competitiveness\nin\nthe new world marketplace.\nWithin\nNASA\'s\nenvironment,\nwe realize\nthat a\nvariety of world and national changes dictate that we\nfind a significant\nway to do more with less. Our\nsolution is to adopt an approach called continual\nimprovement,\noften\nknown\nas Total\nQuality\nManagement\n(TQM).\nFor\nthe\nfirst\ntime,\nNASA\nhas\nbegun\na\ncorporate-wide,\ntop-down,\napproach\nto the\nimplementation\nof a formal continual\nimprovement\ninitiative internal to NASA itself. While in the past\nthere\nhave been a variety of individual\nquality\ninitiatives\nwithin parts of NASA, there has never\nbeen a systematic approach across all of NASA. This\nis reflective of NASA Administrator\nDan Goldin\'s\npersonal\n\ncommitment\n\nto the TQM\n\nphilosophy.\n\nThere are several aspects to the new NASA-wide\napproach.\nOne is to develop quality policies and\nconcepts that will be used across the Agency. Second\nis to develop and execute a strategic plan for the\ncontinual improvement\ninitiative. Third is to develop\nand integrate\norganizational\nquality structures\nto\ncreate and implement\nquality policy and plans. We\nhave formed a Quality Steering Team, with members\n\nDr. Laurie\n\nA. Broedling\n\nfrom the highest levels of NASA management,which\nhas begun the effort. The Quality Steering Team will\nbecome linked to other existing quality structures,\nsuch as the Headquarters\nContinual\nImprovement\nCouncil\nand Field Center\ncouncils,\nfor policy\ndevelopment.\nFourth,\nwe are putting\na lot of\nemphasis on education and training, especiallyoftop\nmanagement.\n/\n\nTQM education\nand training is a critical factor for\nsuccess\nin organizational\nquality transformation.\nTop management\neducation\nto date has included\ntwo-day\n\'_Eontinuous\nProcess\nImprovement\nBoot\nCamp," which was experiential\ntraining, a recent day\nspent with Dr. Deming, and a half-day session with\nDr. Rubenstein\non creative\nproblem-solving\nas it\npertains to quality management.\nTo establish\na theme\nfor NASA\'s\napproach\nto\ncontinual\nimprovement,\nwe are taking a page out of\nDr. Deming\'s book. The most important\nconcept he\nconveyed to us is that, because an organization\nis a\n\nsystem, needsobemanaged\nit\nt\nassuch. hismeans\nT\nfostering\ncooperationmong\na\nvarious\nunitsof the\norganization\nanddiscouraging\ncompetitionmong\na\nunits.Lefttotheirowndevices, willtendto try\nunits\nto optimize themselves.\nThis contributes\nto overall\nsystems suboptimization\nbecause the units tend to\ncompete\nwith other units.\nIn fact, organizational\nunits\nare linked\ntogether\nas a set of internal\ncustomer-supplier\nchains,\nand they should\nbe\ncooperating\nto achieve overall organizational\ngoals.\nIn the U.S., we have a long way to go in achieving a\nmanagement\napproach\nwhich truly fosters systems\nintegration\nin our organizations.\nThe cornerstone\nof\nNASA\'s\ncontinual\nimprovement\neffort will be to\nachieve this paradigm\nshift.\nTurning\nattention\nto the other part of the "NASA\nteam," we realize that all organizational\nenterprises\nare dependent\nupon the qualityoftheir\nsupplier base.\nNowhere is this truer than in NASA. The success of\nNASA\'s mission is dependent\non the quality of the\nproducts\nand services\nthat our suppliers\nprovide.\nThese products\nand services range from scientific\nfindings\nand information\nto satellites\nand space\nshuttles.\nWe at NASA understand\nthat, in order to\nimprove the qualityofwhat\nwe receive, we must work\ncooperatively\nand collaboratively\nwith our suppliers.\nWe must be willing to exchange timely and factual\ninformation\non the work processes;\nto shift from an\ninspection-oriented\nto a prevention-oriented\napproach;\nand to work together\nto build in quality\nup-front during our planning and design phases.\nI\nhave been very pleased to discover that NASA is not\nstarting\nfrom an empty\nslate\nwith respect\nto\ncooperation.\nI have generally been quite impressed\nwith the relationships\nbetween\nNASA\nand its\ncontractor\nbase. The fact that this conference\nhas\nbeen sponsored\nfor the past nine years is one\ntestament\nto the cooperation\ncharacteristic\nwithin\nthe NASA team of government\nand contractors.\nWithin\n\nthe\n\ncontext\n\nof\n\nNASA\'s\n\ncontinual\n\nimprovement\nimplementation\nplan, a part of the plan\nwill be dedicated\nto ways to encourage\nsuppliers\nto\ncontinually\nimprove\ntotal quality\nand enhance\ncollaboration\nwith our supplier-base.\nIn fact, some\nspecific\ninitiatives\nare already\nunderway\nin this\nregard.\nBefore addressing\nsome of these initiatives, I want to\nmention\nthe findings of a study that was recently\ncompleted\nbythe Private Sector Council (PSC). This\nstudy addressed\nsome significant changes and trends\nthat are occurring in customer-supplier\nrelationships\nin the private sector.\nThese trends are expected\nto\nhave a strong impact on purchasing\nstrategies\nand\ncontract\nmonitoring\nin the next decade.\nFindings\nrelated to purchasing\nstrategies\ninclude policies that\nare increasingly focused on purchasing\nfor best value,\n\ni.e., the total cost associated with a product or service\nover its life cycle. Factors such as quality and past\nperformance\nindicators\nare being incorporated\nin\npurchasing\ndecisions.\nIn addition, there is movement\nto reduce the size of vendor bases, to begin working\nmore cooperatively\nwith suppliers,\nand to develop\nlong term alliances with selected proven suppliers.\nPSC findings related to contract monitoring\nindicate\nthat buying activities will be working up front with\nvendors to better clarify requirements,\nfocusing on\nprevention\nrather than inspection,\nworking together\non\nproblem-solving,\nestablishing\nprocess\ncapabilities,\nand\nimplementing\nprocess\nimprovements.\nThere will be increased information\nsharing as buying activities begin to view vendors as\nan extension of their internal operations.\nFinally, the\nstudy concluded\nthat there will be more emphasis on\nTQM\nin future\nacquisition\nand procurement\npractices\nsince TQM will drive continuous\nquality\nimprovement.\nWith this scenario in mind, I want to mention a few\ninitiatives and directions\nwhich NASA is starting to\ntake. There are three areas I will address.\nThese are\nfront-end\ndesign,\nsource\nselection,\nand contract\nmanagement.\nWith respect to the first area, if we want to improve\nthe quality of our aeronautical\nand space systems,\nthen we must work quality issues directly up-front\nduring\nthe design\nand development\nphases\nof\nacquisition.\nUnfortunately,\nin most\nU.S.\norganizations,\nboth government\nand private sector,\nthere has been relatively little institutional\nfocus on\nthe design phase of acquisition;\nmost has been on the\nproduction\nand operations\nphases.\nThis must\nchange.\nWe want to encourage\nbuilding quality into\nsystems\ndesign\nas early a possible\nrather\nthan\nattempting\nto detect and correct quality problems\nin\nlater stages.\nWhen these early problems\nslip past\nreview\nand oversight\nmechanisms,\nthey affect\nperformance,\nreliability,\nmaintainability,\naffordability,\noperability,\nand producibility.\nWhy is designing in quality so significant?\nProblems\ncreated\nin the early stages\ncreate\nincreasingly\nsignificant\nproblems\ndownstream.\nA commercial\nexample\nof the impact\nof design\nproblems\nwas\nreported\nby Mr. Hiroshi Hamada,\nthe president\nof\nRicoh Company, Limited.\nMr. Hamada\nstated that,\n\'_Soon after we introduced\none model of our copier\nin the United States, we found a malfunction\nin the\nproduct.\nWe had to fix all the machines,\nincluding\nthose already sold and installed.\nThat malfunction\ncost us $590,000.\nIf we had resolved the problem\nbefore shipping the product from our plant, we could\nhave fixed\nit for $17,000;\nbefore\nbeginning\nproduction,\nonly $368; before procuring\nparts, $177;\n\nand before making the first components\nlist at the\ndesign phase, the cost would have been only $35. \'_"\nNow, if we consider design problems\nof such things\nas aeronautical\nand space systems, the potential cost\nsavings are staggering.\n\nAnother\nexample is a process\naction\nteam that\nexamined our grant award process.\nThis process\nprovides\nresearch\ngrants\nto universities\nand\nnon-profit\norganizations.\nThe team made 41 process\nimprovement\nsuggestions,\nthe majority of which have\nbeen implemented.\nThe result has been a reduction\nin time to grant awards from roughly 100 days to only\n10 days.\n\nConcurrent\nEngineering\nis one approach\nto\nimproving\ndesign\nquality\nwhich\nwe want\nto\nencourage.\nIt is vital that the design of downstream\nprocesses\nrequired\nto manufacture,\noperate,\nand\nmaintain the end product be included early in the\noverall systems design. Concurrent\nEngineering\nis a\nmethodology\nfor bringing all functional disciplines to\nbear during the design engineering\nphase.\n\nA very recent\nHeadquarters\ninitiative\nis the\nContractor\nMetrics Process\nAction Team (PAT).\nThis PAT will establish contractor\nmetrics to assist\nin more effective\ncontract\nmanagement.\nA joint\nNASA/industry\nteam has been established\nto survey\nbest practices and establish a set of NASA contractor\nmetrics.\nThis will provide\nour contractors\nwith\nimproved and timely feedback on their performance\nand will serve as a basis for dialogue between us and\nour contractors.\n\nAnother\nexample\nis the Acquisition\nStreamlining\nWorking Group which has been gathering customer\ninformation\non impediments\nand obstacles\nto the\ncurrent acquisition process.\nThis working group has\nalready\nidentified\nseveral\nareas for immediate\ntesting. With this customer\ninformation\nin hand, the\nworking\ngroup is now embarking\non a systematic\napproach\nto defining\nand analyzing\nsome of the\ncritical sub-processes\nwithin our acquisition\nsystem.\n\nWe are especially\ncommitted\nto helping\nNASA\'s\nsmall business suppliers\nbecome more competitive\nthrough implementing\nTQM. Dan Goldin has made\nan organizational\ncommitment\nto increasing\nopportunities\nfor small, women-owned,\nand small\ndisadvantaged\nbusinesses.\nIn further\npromoting\ncooperation,\nI want to encourage\nour prime\ncontractors\nhere\ntoday\nto involve\nyour small\nsubcontractors\nin your TQM education\nand training\nefforts\nas well as your process\nimprovement\ninitiatives.\n\nSecond, if we expect our suppliers to improve quality,\nwe have to be prepared\nto recognize\nand reward\nfirms that are truly enhancing\ntheir overall quality.\nOne of the most effective ways we can do this is\nthrough the supplier selection process.\nIn selecting\nour suppliers,\nwe should be looking for those who\ndemonstrate\nhigh levels of total quality as well as\ncontinual\nquality improvement.\nPast performance\nwill play a more important\nrole in source selection.\n\nWith respect to the George M. Low Trophy, we will\nbe spending the next six months enhancing the award\nprocess to insure that it is aligned with our quality\nimprovement\npolicy and that it assists our supplier\nbase\nin understanding\nour expectations\nfor\ncontinually\nimproving\nquality.\nWe want the total\naward process to be a constructive\nexperience\nfor all\nthose submitting\napplications\nor using criteria\nfor\nself-evaluation\nregardless\nof whether\nthey are\nultimately\naward recipients.\nOur Quality Steering\nTeam has agreed on an award cycle which will begin\nin April 1993, with winners announced\nin April 1994.\n\nOne effort that NASA is pursuing\nis the Contractor\nPerformance\nSystem which is establishing\na data base\nor library of past performance\nreports on all NASA\ncontracts over $25 million. This data base is available\nto all NASA source\nevaluation\nboards.\nWe are\nplanning on expanding this effort to eventually cover\nall of our award\nfee contracts.\nWithin\nthe\nDepartment\nof Defense,\nthe Defense\nLogistics\nAgency\n(DLA)\nhas also\ndeveloped\nand\nis\nmaintaining\nuniform\ndata base on contractor\npast\nperformance\nfor Service\nand DLA procurement\nactivities.\n\nLet\n\nme\n\nturn\n\nnow\n\nto the\n\nthird\n\narea,\n\ncontract\n\nmanagement.\nA good example of a public sector\ninitiative\nis the Defense\nContract\nManagement\nCommand\'s\n(DCMC)\nIn-Plant\nQuality Evaluation\n(IQUE)\nprogram.\nDCMC\nprovides\ncontract\nmonitoring\nservices to NASA as well as DoD. Their\ndecades-old\nin-plant\nquality assurance\nprogram,\nwhich\nemphasized\nreview\nof contract\nquality\nprocedures and inspection\nafter manufacturing, has\nbeen replaced\nby a program\nfocusing\non early\ninvolvement\nin the manufacturing\nprocess to prevent\ndefects, rather than detect them.\nThe intent is to\nensure that effective process control techniques\nare\nin place as items are manufactured.\nYou will be\n\nWe have other examples.\nMid-range\nprocurements,\nranging from $25K to $500K, constitute\n80% of our\ncontract\nactions.\nOur mid-range\nprocurement\ninitiative is focusing on simplifying and reducing the\nprocess time of these procurements\nand establishing\nauthority\nfor these procurements\nat the lowest\npossible level. At the Marshall Space Flight Center,\nan initiative\nis underway\nto test and evaluate\nconducting\n"Parallel\nNegotiations."\nParallel\nNegotiations\nis an approach\nto improve\nour\nnegotiation\nprocess\nby fostering\nimproved\ncommunication\nwith our suppliers.\n8\n\nhearing ore\nm aboutt fromGeneral\ni\nKlickfirstthing\ntomorrow\nmorning.\nPartnering\nisalso\nanapproach\ntoimproving\nquality.\nIt hasbeen\nagreat uccess theArmyCorps\ns\nwithin\nof\nEngineers,\nandit is currently\nbeingtested\nwithin\nNASA for the Advanced\nSolid RocketMotor\n(ASRM)production\nplant at YellowCreekand\nGoddardSpace\nFlight Center\'splannedEarth\nObserving\nSystem Information ystemacility.\nData\nS\nF\nPartnering\nestablishes\nmutualobjectives\nup-front\nbetweenustomers\nc\nandsuppliers. leads\nIt\ntolower\noverall\ncosts,ower erformance\nl\np\ntime,andreduced\nlitigation. Partnering\nhasbeenveryeffective\nin\nreversing adversarial relationships by creating\nthe\n\nastronauts was as follows:\nThey watched\nand fail; try and fail; try and succeed.\n\nmutual\n\nobjectives\n\nWithin\n\nNASA,\n\nWell,young\nyet.\nIf we\nimprovement\nto continue\nrockets, into\n\nand a cooperative\n\napproach.\n\na PAT has been formed\n\nto examine\n\nthe process\nfor managing\nand\ncontrolling\ngovernment\nfurnished property.\nThis area has been\na difficult and time-consuming\narea for NASA and\nour contractors.\nOne focus of the PAT will be to\nestablish clear definitions\nand common terminology\nfor dealing with government-furnished\nproperty.\nLastly, this Annual NASA/Contractors\nConference\nis another\nway that NASA\nreaches\nout to our\nsuppliers\nand stakeholders.\nNASA\'s\nQuality\nSteering Team will be providing direction to design\nfuture conferences\nthat are supportive\nof our overall\nmission, vision, and strategic direction.\nSpecifically,\nwe intend to have a NASA quality conference\nthat\ngives us a forum to exchange information\non internal\nNASA continual\nimprovement\nefforts as well as a\nforum to continue to exchange information\nwith our\nsuppliers.\nIn order to plan this new approach\nour\nQuality Steering Team has decided to have our next\nconference\nin April 1994. This will also enable us to\nkeep the conference\nin synchronization\nwith the\nGeorge M. Low Trophy process.\nIn concluding,\nI want\nthat\nare\ncritical\n\nto stress three\nto NASA\'s\n\nrequirements\nsuccessful\n\nimplementation\nof continual improvement.\nThe first\nis the need to design and carry out a systematic\napproach.\nThe second\nis the need to align the\norganization to a common vision, mission,and\nvalues.\nThe third is to work on fostering cooperation\nboth\nwithin NASA, and with its supplier base in order to\nachieve this alignment.\nNone of this will be easy.\nDan Goldin tells a story related by his sister, who\nteaches\nin a New York City public school.\nHer\nstudents did not know who her bother was at the time,\nin May, when our Space Shuttle astronauts recovered\nthe satellite in space.\nTogether, over a three-day\nperiod, they watched TV in wonder.\nAccording\nto\nher, what they learned\nfrom watching\nthose\n\nthem\n\ntry\n\nAt NASA, we recently received a copy of a letter that\na boy wrote. The letter is as follows:\n\n\'I read\n\n... that\n\n[the]\n\nWhite\n\nHouse\n\nhas\n\nrecently said that the U .S. will not build any\nmore Space Shuttles.\nTax dollars will be\nspent on unmanned\nrockets instead.\nEver\nsince I was five I wanted to be an astronaut.\nIs it really true?\ncareernow7"\n\nDo I need\n\nto change\n\nmy\n\nman, don\'t change your career plans just\nare successful\nin our continual\nefforts, we can stretch limited budgets\nputting humans,\nas well as unmanned\nspace.\n\nPresident\nKennedy\nsaid that we chose to go to\nmoon, "not because it was easy, but because it\nhard."\nGoing\nto the moon was principally\nachievement\nof those in the public sector.\nWe,\nNASA government\nteam, were, and still are, in\nvanguard\nof exploring\nspace and we can be in\nvanguard of the quality transformation\non earth.\n\n* \'Quality Progress,"\n\nNovember\n\n1991\n\nthe\nwas\nan\nthe\nthe\nthe\n\n"COMMIaWIENT\nLIEUTENANT\nUnited States\nCommander,\n\nTO TOTAL\n\nGENERAL\nAir Force\n\nTHOMAS\n\nAir Force Aeronautical\n\nQUALITY"\nR. FERGUSON\nSystems\n\nIt\'s a pleasure\nto be here\nas part of such a\ndistinguished\npanel, especially\nto talk about my\nfavorite subject - Quality.\nAs I thought about the\npanel\ndiscussion\ntitle,\n\'q\'he\nImportance\nof\nCommitment\nand Leadership\nin Implementing\nTotal\nQuality," I couldn\'t help but think that imp.lc.mr, aiiag\nTQ is only half the battle - maintaining\nthe TQ thrust,\nthe forward\nmomentum,\ncan sometimes\nbe the\nbiggest challenge a leader or CEO faces.\n\nCenter\n\nimprove quality and at the same time save money ...\nwe really didn\'t understand who the customer was.\nDo you remember the shampoo commercial\nwhere\none person tries the product and likes it so she tells\ntwo friends, and they tell two friends, and so on?\nThat\'s literally how we found out about TQ. Early in\n1987, director of our Propulsion Systems Program\nOffice, Jim Hintz, became aware that one of his\nindustry partners,\nPratt & Whitney, was engaged in\nan organizational\ntransformation\ncalled _Q+ ." To\nhelp themselves,\nPratt and Whitney had hired the\nCumberland\nGroup to implement\na Total Quality\nManagement\nculture.\nThey improved\n... and we\nnoticed.\nOur Propulsion\nSPO followed suit. Then\nthey told two friends. When those SPO directors saw\npositive\nresults,\nthey recommended\nthat the\ntechniques\nbe adopted by the entire Aeronautical\nSystems Center.\n\nI was reading\nan article\nin Newsweek\nlast month\ncalled The Cost of Quality\nabout how American\nbusinesses\nhave soured\non TQM.\nBasically\nthe\nauthor notes that A merican management\nplans oRen\nhave the shelf life of cottage cheese. Does American\nmanagement\nhave the patience\nto implement\nTQ ...\nand then to wait for the results?\nTQ requires\npatience\n... discipline\n... because\nit deals\nfundamentally\nwith\n_\nimprovement.\nUnfortunately,\nwhat we do best is put out fires.\n\nGeneral\nBill Thurman,\nthe commander\nat the time,\ncommitted\nAeronautical\nSystems Center to TQ by\nhiring\nthe Cumberland\nGroup\non a three-year\ncontract\nto provide training and consultation.\nLet\nme tell you, friends, that was no small commitment.\nSpending\nmillions of dollars to train ten thousand\npeople\nin a government\nbureaucracy\nwhich has\ndecades\nof ingrained\npractices and policies was a\nmajor leadership\ndecision!\nBut General\nThurman\ncommitted\nhimself, the manpower,\nand the dollars\nneeded to train the work force and put in place a TQ\nstructure.\n\nSo I would say to this audience, most of whom already\nembrace TQ, that you must :itax with it to get results.\nThrough\ndifferent\nleaders,\nthrough\nhard times,\nthrough whatever lies ahead.\nBefore\nI proceed,\nlet me give you a little bit of\nbackground\nabout the kind of a team Aeronautical\nSystems Center is and what we do.\nOur job is to\nresearch,\ndevelop and acquire weapon\nsystems for\nthe Air Force ... now we\'re also managing systems\nthroughout\ntheir entire life cycle.\nThese systems\ninclude airplanes\nlike the B-2 Stealth Bomber,\nthe\nF-22 Advanced\nTactical\nFighter\nand the C-17\ntransport\nas well as missiles and other smart bombs.\nI should add, we develop\nthese systems with our\nindustry partners\n\nWhen General\nMike Loh\nCommander\nto Commander\n\nmoved\nfrom the Vice\nof the Aeronautical\n\nSystems\nCenter,\nhe committed\nto keep the TQ\nprocess\ngoing.\nNow we had the beginnings\n...\nawareness ... and our people were being educated on\nhow to use the TQ tools and methods.\nGeneral Loh\nand the senior leaders of the Aeronautical\nSystems\nCenter created a common vision of who they were\nand where they were headed.\n\nQuality\nhas been a management\nprinciple\nfor\nbusiness and government\nfor a long time.\nWe all\nespoused\nthe virtues of quality but no one\nunderstood\nuntil people\nlike Deming\nand Juran\nbegan to get their message across.\nMaybe I should\nsay until Toyota began to demonstrate\nthese new\nquality\nprinciples\nwhere\nit counts\n- in the\nmarketplace.\nAnd the same is true of Aeronautical\nSystems Center - we really didn\'t believe you could\n\nIn addition,\nit wasn\'t\nenough\nthat\nleadership\nwas committed\nto TQ organization\nhad to commit as well.

ASC had three leaders\nduring this TQ venture ... each has added to the play\nbook.\nThey created goals to further focus on what\nASC should strive to accomplish.\nSo now with the\nvision, the principles,\nand the goals combined,\nASC\nhad a description\nof what we were, what we wanted\nto accomplish,\nand how we were going to get there.\nThis description\nprovided\na framework\nwhich\nallowed\nall of our ASC organizations\nto become\naligned\nin their TQ efforts.\nIt also provided\na\nfoundation\nfor setting\npriorities\nand making\ndecisions for the entire organization.\n\nup on those as well.\nMy point is this, the environment\nis constantly\nchanging so no matter how well along the TQ path\nyou are, the leadership\nchallenge is to adapt, but stay\nfocused on process improvement.\nThe Air Force is\nundergoing\nthe most dramatic\nchanges\nsince we\nbecame a separate service after World War II. As we\ndownsize, consolidate,\nand live with fewer resources,\nTotal Quality has helped us at ASC adapt to these\nchanges.\nAnd it will work for the Air Force at large,\ntoo!\n\nThen I became the new coach for ASC, inheriting\neverything from Generals Thurman and Loh. And of\ncourse,\nI accepted\nthe now well-established\nTQ\nculture\nand methodology.\nNow this is very\n\nJerry Bowels, author of Beyond Quality, says that TQ\nis something\nthat is successful\nover the long haul.\n"Most Japanese\ncompanies\nbegan their quality\nimprovemont\nefforts in the early 1950\'s and stuck\nwith them religiously, although\nthey didn\'t begin to\nsee significant payoffs until the late 1970\'s." It took\ntime folks! That says leaders better have staying\npower\n... they need to put new structure,\nnew\nmethods, in place ... it\'s a culture change!\n\nimportant!\nWhen you change quarterbacks\nin the\nmiddle of the game, you don\'t throw out the old play\nbook!\nAt every leadership\nchange,\nthe people\nwatched to see if we were serious about TQ ... about\nthose principles.\nWhen I came on board, all that was\nneeded were some new plays to further our winning\nstreak. We had a vision of who we were and where\nwe wanted to go, we had principles\ndidn\'t\nhave adequate\nmeasures\n\nsteering us to a Quality Air Force, QAF. QAF is "A\nleadership\ncommitment\nand an operating\nstyle that\ninspires\ntrust,\nteamwork,\nand\ncontinuous\nimprovement\neverywhere\nin the Air Force."\nWhen\nthe Air Force came out with their vision, we at\nAeronautical\nSystems Center adopted\nit as our very\nown. As the Air Force comes up with its principals\nand goals, we at the ASC will adapt.\nEven as we\nspeak, Headquarters\nAir Force is considering\nits own\nmetrics for use across the entire service.\nWe\'ll pick\n\nDid you listen? A culturalchange!Customer.\nEnable\n\nAnd what\'s the next play for TQ at the Aeronautical\nSystems Center?\nOur major challenge now is,believe\nit or not, waiting for much the rest of the Air Force\nto catch up. The Air Force has now embraced\nthe\nconcept of Total Quality, but they\'re just starting out.\nAir Force Chief of Staff, General\nTony McPeak, is\n\nI \'d leave you with one last thought ... leaders must be\nenthusiastic\nabout TQ ... Tom Peters might say be\nzealots ... or the change will not occur. Here\'s a little\nthought I really like: Every morning in Africa, a\ngazelle wakes up. It knows that it\'s going to have to\n\nand goals, but we\nto indicate\nour\n\nprogress.\n\n11\n\nrun faster\n\nthan\n\nthe fastest\n\nlion or it will be killed.\n\nEvery morning a lion wakes up, and it knows that it\'s\ngoing to have to outrun the slowest gazelle or it will\nstarve.\nIn business,\nas in nature,\nwe fundamentally\nunderstand\nthat only the fastest, the strongest, the\nsmartest will survive. It reallydoesn\'t\nmatter whether\nyou\'re a lion or whether you\'re a gazelle. When the\nsun comes up, you had better be running.\nI think\nthat\'s exactly what TQ is. It is a decision to run hard\nevery day. I would say that\'s my concept of what\nenthusiasm and zealotry really are.\nORIGINAL\n_I..ACK\n\nAND\n\nWHITE\n\nPAGE\nPHOTOGRAPN\n\nTop Leadership\nPanel: Dr. Laurie A.

I asked if she could make sure I\nwouldn\'t\nfollow an Air Force Lieutenant\nGeneral.\nAnd you can see what effect that\n\nlarge organization,\nwe could not afford to stumble.\nWe couldn\'t\nafford to fail.\nManagement\'s\nmost\nimportant asset is credibility.\nOnce spent, it\'s gone.\nSo we looked around and see who had been there?\nWho had reinvented\nthemselves?\nIt\'s not hard to find\n\nhad!\n\ncompanies\nthat\nFord, Toyota.\n\nAlliedSignal\nis three\nbusinesses:\nAutomotive,\nEngineered\nMaterials and Aerospace.\nYou\'ve heard\nus as Fram, Autolite, G arrett, Bendix, and, maybe as\nAllied\nChemical.\nA year and a half ago we\nexperienced\na leadership\nchange at the chairman\nlevel. Prior to the change we had solid performance.\nOur customer\nsatisfaction\nwas, by and large, pretty\ngood. Our employee satisfaction\nwas, by and large,\npretty good. and our financial performance\nwas, by\nand large, pretty good.\n\nBut it\'s not\nthemselves.\nprocess\nbelieve\n\nis a significant\n\ndriver\n\nto our\n\nThe air transport\noriginal build cycle was peaking\nand clearly going to be headed down, as we are seeing\ntoday. And obviously\ndefense\nspending\nwas on a\ndownward\npath.\n\non customers.\nWe needed, first of all, to define the\nvalues for which we as a company of 100,000 people\nstood.\nIn order to reinvent\nourselves around\nthe\nan encompassing\n\nSo we laid out a process\nto define\nour values\n-- customer,\nintegrity,\npeople,\nteamwork,\nspeed,\ninnovation -- all in support of performance.\nAnd we\nset out to position ourselves around this set of shared\nvalues.\nWe could have decided\nto the experiences\n\nto do this without\n\nof other\n\ncompanies.\n\nMotorola,\n\nenough\nto just say they reinvented\nWhat was the core?\nWhat was the\n\nthose organizations\nwe knew the answer.\n\nand others used?\nIt\'s Total Quality!\n\nWe\n\nBefore we continue, however, let me give you a quick\nsummary\nof AlliedSignal\nAerospace,\nwhere the\ndemand\nfor results\nand the need to change\nhad\nbecome increasingly\nurgent.\nWe are a company of\nabout 40,000. We are the number one supplier to the\naerospace industry.\nWe have 15 separate businesses\nfrom engines\nto avionics,\nto wheels and brakes.\nThree-quarters\nof our sales come from product\nmarket segments\nwhere we are number\none or a\nstrong number\ntwo. We have about a half-billion\ndollars\nin sales each year to NASA\nfrom such\nprograms\nas the National\nReference\nSystem, life\nsupport,\nmission\ncontrol,\nand facility\nsupport\nthrough\nAlliedSignal\nTechnical\nServices\nCorporation.\n\nIn light of those conditions\nwe determined\nthat we\nhad no choice but to reinvent ourselves with a focus\n\ncustomer, there had to be a sharing,\nof our employees.\n\nXerox,\n\nOf course, Total Quality is not new. In many ways,\nwe had been using TQ in various business units over\nthe prior five or six years.\nBut as I went candidly\nthrough some self-assessment,\nwe saw that whatever\nwe were doing wasn\'t enough. We weren\'t getting the\nfull measure\nof expected\nresults.\nWe needed\nto\nrefine the process and step up the pace.\n\nWhat we saw was that the world was speeding up and\nthe future seemed\nto offer new challenges.\nAuto\nsales were fiat at best.\nHousing\nstarts were off.\nConsumer\nconfidence\nwas weak.\nEach of those\nindicators\n\nprofile:\n\nTQ became the process we used to drive -- and this\nis the key word here -- results.\nI\'m going to develop\nthat theme over the course of my talk: results with\nrespect to customer\nsatisfaction,\nresults with respect\nto employee satisfaction,\nand results with respect to\nfinancial performance.\n\nBut was it good enough? Was it good enough to meet\nour objective\nof becoming\na premiere\ncompany,\ndistinctive and successful in all that we do?\n\neconomic\nbusiness.\n\nfit the\n\nIn fact, Technical\nServices,\npreviously\nknown as\nBendix Field Engineering\nCorporation,\nhas about\n3,600 people\ninvolved in NASA support\nat three\nmajor sites: here in Pasadena where we have several\n\nreference\n\nBut with the\n13\n\nhundred people, at Goddard\nSpace\nand the Johnson Space Center.\n\nFlight\n\nCenter,\n\ncustomers,\nmore satisfied\nemployees,\nprofits. That\'s what we\'re all about.\n\nWe did not compete for the George M. Low Trophy\nin 1991 and 1992 as we were refocusing our resources\non specific results.\nBut we were finalists for the\naward in the last three times we competed\n... in \'88,\n\'89, and \'90. And we are veryproud\nthat we have won\nthe Goddard\nSpace Flight Center Excellence Award.\nWe\'ve also just finished our latest AIA quality audit,\nand for the third year running we received the highest\naward ever given by AIA up to that point.\n\nhigher\n\nTQ is at the center of our company as we reinvent\nourselves.\nHere are the goals that we show to\nstakeholders\nthroughout\nour entire organization;\nand\nwhether\nthey\'re\nshareholders,\nsecurity\nanalysts,\nsuppliers, customers or employees, we keep the goals\nstraightforward.\nThey\'re not simple, but they are\nstraightforward:\nMake the numbers.\nto our commitments.\n\nAlliedSignal\nAerospace\nis dedicated\nto quality, and\nwe have host of experiences\nin managing TQ. Some\nof them are good, some are bad. What I want to tall\nabout with you today are the lessons we\'ve learned\nand the new lessons we learn every day. But I would\nlike to present this material to you as a fellow traveler,\nnot as one who has reached the destination.\n\nWe\'re\n\ngoing to live up\n\nMake TQ the foundation\nof productivity.\nWe\'ve set a goal of 6 percent\nproductivity\neach year, and that\'s a challenge.\nTQ is the\nfoundation\nof productivity.\nMake growth a part of our commitment\neach one of our constituencies.\nEach\n\nFirst, using the principles\nof TQ, let\'s define our\nterms.\nTotal quality is delighting\nthe customer.\nThat\'s more difficult than it seems, because in order\nto delight the customers,\nyou have to anticipate\nthat\ncustomer\'s\nneeds and then be there to respond\nto\nthem. The problem is that the customers\nthemselves\nvery often neither know their needs nor can articulate\nthat which they do know.\n\nthem deserves\nemployees.\n\nit, most\n\nimportantly\n\nto\nof\nour\n\nSo, TQ is the impetus behind change, which does not\nhappen as a matter of course.\nChange always must\nbe led.\nAnd that\'s the main point of my talk:\nleadership\nand commitment\nin the TQ environment.\nIt\'s up to the leaders to create a sense of urgency by\ncreating a vivid awareness\nin the employee\nbase of\nwhere we\'re going to go if we don\'t change.\n\nSecondly, it\'s valuing employees.\nI chose the word\n"valuing" for a purpose.\nOther words or phrases that\ncome to mind are respecting,\nlistening, training as a\nprocess,\nand continuously\nimproving\n-- which also\nimplies a constant state of rising expectations.\nThink\nabout what that means.\n\nWe also have to create\n\na vivid awareness\n\nof who our\n\ncustomer is. It may seem obvious to you in this room\nwho your customers\nare, but we have 40,000\nemployees,\nand it\'s not obvious to each of them who\ntheir customers\nare.\nAnd we need to create that\n\nIt means a never-ending\nimpatience.\nIt means an\ninstitutional\ntension\nbecause\nyou can\'t\nhave\ncontinuous\nimprovement\nwithout\na continuous\ndissatisfaction,\nimpatience\nor tension.\n\nawareness personally and in detail. We facilitate that\nby showing employees\nthe data customers\ngive us.\nWe encourage\nour customers to come and tail to our\nemployees.\nAnd occasionally\nwe also need to take\nour employees from all levels to the customer.\n\nWhile it is important\nto understand\nwhat TQ is, so\nthat the rest of my discussion\nhere makes sense to\nyou, we also need to define what TQ is not.\n\nLeadership\ncreates\nthat sense of urgency,\nthe\nso-called\nburning\nplatform,\nby making\nthe\nconsequences\nof not changing obvious.\nPhil Crosby,\namong others, has been articulate\non the study of\nchange.\nPeople change when they have to. "Stop\nsmoking or you are going to die," is the way Phil says\nit. Institutions\nare people, and institutions\nchange\nonly when they absolutely\nhave no other choice.\n\nTQ is not comfort.\nIt\'s not complacency.\nIt\'s not\nease -- certainly\nnot for the middle managers who\nhave to change habits they have developed\nover the\nduration of their career.\nTQ is not just training, and\nI\'m going to talk more about that. TQ is not just a\nseries of projects, although it includes training and a\nseries of projects.\nTQ is certainly\nnot a buzzword.\nTQ is not nebulous\nactions leading to even more\nnebulous results.\nIt\'s not just awards, although they\nare important\nand are motivators.\nAnd TQ is not\nspeeches, even like this one. Most fundamentally,\nfor\nour view point, TQ is not input.\nTQ is the means to output.\noutstanding\nresults,\nwhich\n\nand\n\nAs I mentioned\nbefore, TQ has been underway\nin\nearlier versions at AlliedSignal\nAerospace\nfor several\nyears. But only in four divisions, could I say as of 18\nmonths ago, was there real change.\nWas it worth it? We trained hundreds of people,and\ngave hundreds\nand hundreds\nof speeches,\nbut most\nof our operating\nunits had nothing to show for the\nefforts.\nThere were projects.\nThere were courses.\n\nAnd it\'s the means to\nlead to more satisfied\n14\n\nBut was\nresults?\n\nthere\n\nfundamental\n\nchange?\n\nWere\n\nthere\n\nWe conducted\na complete employee survey recently.\nWe shared the results -- warts and beauty together.\nI must have received 50 letters from employees\nwho\nwere shocked\nthat we shared\nnews that was not\n\nThere\nwas one common\nthing\nin those\nfour\norganizations\nthat did change:\nthey were on the\nbrink. Iftheydidn\n\'t change, theywouldn\'t\nhave made\nit. It wasn\'t a particularly\nhigher purpose.\nIt was, in\ntheir cases, desperation.\nSo they changed.\nAnd if\nyou learn from your failures, then you as a company\nare highly educated.\nI thing we learned from our\nfailures.\n\nuniformly\npositive, even though they already were\naware of it. I find it surprising\nthey thought we\nwouldn\'t\nshare it. Like I said, they already knew it,\nso why not share?\nShow employees\nyour operating\nmetrics, show them\nthe results of the business, and give them the tools to\ndeal with the problems.\nThe tools are critical.\nWithout them, we\'ll fail. But TQ is not just a set of\ntools.\n\nThe lesson\nlearned\nis simple:\nChange\nor fail.\nEvolutionary\nchange\ndoes not meet the rate of\nchange required of our customers\ntoday. One of the\nmost dramatic changes in the aerospace\nindustry the\nlast two years is that technology has become a leveler\nrather\nthan the discriminator.\nYou clearly have\nstrong,\ndynamic,\nvital, fully competitive,\neven\nstate-of-the-art\ntechnology.\nYet, that alone no\nlonger is good enough.\n\nAt AlliedSignal\nwe have a four-day workshop called\nTotal Quality Leadership.\nNinety-thousand\npeople\nare being trained in about 16 months.\nAs far as we\nknow, it\'s the most rapid roll out in the industry, l\'ve\nbeen through\nthe workshop\ntwice now because\nI\nguess they thought\nI needed\nit twice as badly as\nothers.\n\nDelighting\nthe customer\nevery day and then also\nhaving the lowest cost is now required.\nAnd the\n\'_now" cannot be over stressed given the implosion of\nmany of our markets.\n\nBefore I went through the eight days, I spent about\nanother\nfive days with the top management\nhelping\ndesign the program.\nAnd now that the roll out is in\nplace, we are proud of our curriculum.\nWe think it\'s\npowerful.\nBut, as you all know, it\'s not rocket\nscience.\nThere\'s no hidden wisdom or magic in it.\nEverything is fairly fundamental.\n\nLeadership\nanticipates\nthese requirements\nand then\nhumanizes\nthem, putting them into the context of\nwhat they mean to individuals\nas employees.\nAnd\nthey also have to be put in the context of what they\nmean\nto employees\nwhen the organization\nis\ndownsiziag\nby 20, 25 or 30 percent.\nThat is the real\nworld, and we have to manage the TQ revolution even\nin the face on-going downsizing.\nNo one said it would\nbe easy.\n\nOne of the strengths\nin our course is that our training\nis based on real business issues. Natural teams come\nin for training with issues that have been defined\nthrough\na previous\nprocess.\nAnd the ability to\nresolve those critical and significant\nbusiness issues\nis the result of undergoing\nthe four-day\ntraining\ncourse.\nThey come out with a preliminary\nproblem\nstatement\nand a statement\nof work with interim goals\nthat is signed offby the boss.\n\nSpeed is your friend. It\'s your competitive\nweapon.\nAnd, if well-managed,\nspeed can knock down all of\nthe institutional\nbarriers\nthat are thrown into your\npath constantly.\nSo the lesson is to create that sense\nof urgency.\n\nThree months later, the results are reviewed by the\nboss.\nIn another\nthree months\n-- hopefully,\nsix\nmonths is the general range of time -- the team is\nmeasured\nand assessed on solving its problem.\nSo\nthis is training,\nbut in reality\nis behavioral\nmodification\nfocused around the real-world business\nissues.\n\nHere\'s\nanother\nlesson.\nEverybody\nin the\norganization,\nespecially\nthose in the lower ranks,\nalready knows what is required\nfor a company to be\nsuccessful.\nThey\'re waiting for us. I can\'t tell you the\nnumber of times I\'ve heard employees\nsay to me, "So\nwhat took you guys so long?" Or, "It\'s about time."\nOr, and I love this, "Why didn\'t you just ask?" I know\nevery one of you has experienced\nthat in one form or\nthe other.\n\nAnother\nlesson learned is to demand breakthrough\nresults. Don\'t be shy. It\'s been shown time and again\nthat empowered\nteams set more aggressive\ngoals in\nthemselves\nthan their managers\nwould.\nWhat does\nthat tell you? To me it says demand breakthrough\nperformance.\n\nAnother\nlesson is sharing data.\nEvery one of our\nemployees should know what we are doing, even the\nembarrassments.\nInvite specific customers\n-- even\nthe ones that might be mad at you -- to tell the\nemployees\nthe reasons\nfor their feelings.\nTell\nemployees what the customer\'s\ndata says to you about\ntheir satisfaction.\n\nPeople ask me what am I doing to further TQ. The\nfirst thing I tell them is that I demand outstanding\nresults. That focuses attention.\nSo do the facts, goals\nand measurement.\nMeasure, measure, measure.\n15\n\nBe visible on TQ and give on-the-spot\nreward and\nrecognition.\nFor those of you who are in the private\nsector,\nif it\'s achievable,\ngive money,\ngive stock\ncertificates\nor stock options right on the spot.\n\nNow all of that is interesting,\nbut what do you do\nabout it? If you buy into all of this, how do you move\nforward from wherever you are? First, constantly\nincrease your demands. Continuous improvement is\na difficult task master.\n\nYou\'re going to be constantly tested to prove that you\nbelieve in TQ. I can\'t tell you how many times I get\nasked, Wes, I know all of this, but do you really\nbelieve?\nDo you really support it?" And it\'s not so\nmuch the words and the way you answer. It\'s your\nbehavior.\n\nDon\'t be patient.\nYou\'ll get a little bit of discussion\nhere. We were patient earlier with respect to results.\nAnd I think we suffered\nbecause of it. We don\'t\nexpect miraculous\nresults coming\nbut we are holding the business\ngoals in order to focus attention.\n\nout of each project,\nunits to ambitious\n\nSo, from our experiences\nwe_\xc2\xa2e concluded\nthat TQ is\nnot input. TQ most certainly is common sense. TQ\nis measured by the results of the organization.\nTQ is\na means to the end. It\'s a means to performance.\n\nI start every single business meeting with a review, not\nof numbers\n-- we get to it at the end -- but of TQ\nmetrics.\nEvery organization\nhas a complete\nset of\nmetrics that get at a number of issues, including cycle\ntime reduction,\nemployee\nsatisfaction,\ncustomer\nsatisfaction,\nnumber\nof suppliers,\naverage quality\nlevel on a supplier base, on and on.\nWe review those results.\n\nIn each of those\n\nmetrics,\n\nThank\n\nwe\n\nshow not only our history, but world-class\ngoals.\nThose, in many cases, aren\'t going to be achieved for\ntwo, three or four years; but we still show them. And\nwe continually\nredefine\nas we become\nmore\nknowledgeable\nabout our processes.\nWe broaden\nour perspective\nin the external world as we go, and\nwe constantly\nbenchmark\non those processes.\nSo,\nour world-class\ngoals are constantly\nmoving upward.\nI conduct\nevery meeting\nin which it is appropriate\nusing TQ tools. I personally lead three TQ teams.\nUnless the leader is personally\nleading the TQ team,\nI don\'t think he or she is going to pass the muster with\nthe employees.\nOf the team on which I\'m working,\none is a corporate-wide\nteam on career development,\nanother is a team within Aerospace\non growth, and\nthe third,\nagain\ncorporate-wide,\nfocuses\non\nintegrating\ntechnology\nand strategic planning.\n\n16\n\nyou very much.\n\n\'ORGANIZATIONAL\nWILLIAM\n\nTQM"\n\nK.

There are numerous\nfolks\nwho think that all theyhave\nto do is give the order and\nit will be followed out. That is necessary for some.\nIn fact, sufficient for some to change, but absolutely\nirrelevant to other people.\n\nThey don\'t use the same words, but the concepts are\nthe same.\nAll change takes place on three levels:\nphysical, logical, and emotional\nlevels. The biggest\nmistake any of us could make in trying to change an\norganization,\ntrying to help an organization\nchange,\nis to think that because you\'re particularly\nfond of one\nof those levels that it works for you, that it\'s going to\nwork for everyone\n\nK. Scherkenbach\n\nThe policies,\nthe mission\nstatements,\nabsolutely\nrelevant to a number of folks and irrelevant to others.\nIf you\'re physically\noriented\nwhen you look at the\npoficies and the procedures\nand the orders and the\ncommands\nand the lists and the check\nsheets,\nabsolutely\nnecessary\nfor some folks, but as I said,\nirrelevant to others.\nSo if you\'re physically oriented\nand you\'re coming up and you\'re trying to change an\norganization,\nit may work for you to have a mission\nstatement,\nbut don\'t make the mistake to think that\nmission statements\nare going to impact everyone else.\nThey will not.\n\nelse.\n\n17\n\nIf you\'relogically\n\noriented -- this is a meeting of\nleaders and scientists and explorers\nand a lot of you\nfolks are logically\noriented.\nYou just put the\nequation\non the board, and that\'s sufficient for a lot\nof you to change.\nAbsolutely\nirrelevant\nto the\nphysical folks. You need to understand\nwhy. You\nneed\nto understand\nthe logic.\nYou need\nto\nunderstand\nsome of the questions.\nAnd that\'s what\nI \'m going to leave with you, because this group is able\nto handle the logical content of what I \'m going to talk\nabout.\n\nwill cause the whole to be far greater than the sum of\nits parts, and that\'s what you\'re looking for. And\nanother slight change might zip it down so that the\nwhole is a lot less than the sum of its parts.\nThis is greatly oversimplifying\nthe world we live in,\nbut it shows that you can directly change people\nphysically.\nYou can directly change logically, and\nyou can directly change emotionally.\nThere\'s\nno\nseries, or prescribed\nsequence\nthere. And you need\nto consider that. Your plans for change must include\nthose three levels whether you feel strong at it or not.\nWhether you think it works for you or not, you have\nto recognize that it\'s bigger than you.\n\nYou also have the emotional\ncontent.\nPeople talk\nabout the heart.\nThe hand, the head, and the heart.\nThat\'s a metaphor\nthat you\'re all, I\'m sure, familiar\nwith. The emotional\ncontent is very, very important\nto some people, and absolutely\nirrelevant\nto others.\nAnd so when you\'re looking at how to get things done,\nyou have to look at your people in your organization\nas your customers.\nCertain\nthings will work with\ncertain people, and absolutely\ncreate the opposite\neffect in other people.\n\nNow, I\'m going to talk about logic. One of the very\nimportant\npieces of information\nthat 1 can give you,\nand I\'ll build up this flow, is that the thought that\nquestions are cheap.\nIt\'s the answers that cost a lot\nof money. And you as leaders,you\nas question askers\nhave got to begin to take stock of the questions that\nyou ask.\nOne of your areas for improvement\nis to improve your\nquestions.\nAnd if you do that, I think you can\nimprove\nyour organization.\nNow, how do you\nimprove the questions?\nIf you improve the reports\nthat you see, you\'re going to be able to improve your\nquestions.\n\nYou cannot do anything on the average. A leader has\nto be keen, extremely\nperceptive\nabout what their\nindividual\ncustomers\nneed at a particular\npoint in\ntime in their life. What works with one person today,\nwon\'t work with that same person perhaps tomorrow\nbecause we change. That\'s one of the most important\naspects of leadership\nthat I could pass on to you. You\nneed to understand\nthat your plans for change have\nto include\nactions\non all three\nof these levels;\notherwise,\nyou are missing major constituencies\nin\nyour organization.\n\nOn this logical level, it\'s fairly simple. I\'ve found that\nwith CEO\'s\nand presidents\nand chief operating\nofficers, when I can change the reports that they see,\nI can pretty much change the questions that they ask.\nAnd those questions for those logical people that are\nin the organization\nwill change immediately.\nIt\'s an\nextremely powerful way of proceeding.\n\nThere is not a hierarchy here. You do not go from\nphysical, then to logical, and then to emotional\nin\norder to effect change. It\'s not a series relationship.\nIt\'s not in sequence.\nThere is no hierarchy.\nAnd the\nbest way I\'ve found to portray\nthat is use a yen\ndiagram.\nYou can see the physical,\nlogical, and\nemotional\nthere.\nAnd I\'m going to absolutely\nsimplify philosophy\nfor all those who slept through\nthose courses, too.\n\nSome folks mentioned\nthis morning the importance\nof measurement.\nGeneral Motors is in the process\nthese past two years of going from an organization\nthat\ntried\nto measure\neverything\nand the\naccompanying\nstaffs that it required\nto measure\neverything.\nIn fact, 2,500 measures\nas the company\nevolved, as the bureaucracy,\nas the size grew over the\nyears\n-- 2,500\nmeasures\nwere\nreported\nto\nheadquarters\non a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.\nThat is one heck of a lot of measures.\n\nYou can think of the intersection\nbetween\nthe\nphysical\nand logical as science.\nThe intersection\nbetween\nphysical\nand emotional\nas art.\nFor the\nintersection\nbetween emotional\nand logical go, to the\nroot of the word \'psychology."\nLogic of the soul.\nEach\nof these are very, very important\nsubject\nmatters that you must have expertise in. And in the\ncenter, l\'ve got where all of them operate together.\nI\'ve got harmony.\n\nTwo years ago, we formed a top-level committee\nto\ntake a look at the measures,\nand to see if we could\nrun the company without 2,500 measures and all the\npeople that it took to manage, ask the questions\nfor\n2,500 measures,\ncome up with answers for the 2,500\nmeasures,\nand process them. Thousands\nof people\nare required to do that.\n\nWhat eastern cultures\nwould call harmony.\nWhat\nMaslow\nin the western\nculture\nwould call peak\nexperiences.\nThis is a very tenuous\narea where all\nthree of those come together, because slight changes\nin the combination\nof physical, logical, and emotional\n\nLast year the committee\nsaid that we should be able\nto reduce the number of measures\nfrom 2,500 down\nto about 60. The important thingabout\nthe measures\nis if you looked\nat them\nindividually,\nthey\'re\n18\n\nparticularlynremarkable.\nu\nyour organization\nthe organization.\n\nexception.\nAnd if you\'re managing by exception,\nyou\'re missing out on a whole new way of really\nmaking your organization\nsing.\nYou manage\nthe\nsystem.\n\nEach of you might run\nor have some of these measures in\n\nWhat is important, the important thing I think for you\nto take back is that if you\'re\ngoing to measure\nsomething,\nyou have to recognize that no measure\nstands alone.\nThere is an interdependent\nset of\nmeasures.\nYou cannot at one point in time say,\n\'knock off overtime" in order to save costs. And at\nthe same\nhappened\n\ntime, maybe\nto schedule?"\n\nEach of the measures,\n\ntwo weeks\n\nlater,\n\nIn any event, a lack of a negative never has and never\nwill connote\na strong positive.\nThe systems and\nprocesses\nyou have in place to make sure that there\nare no problems are not the same ones that you put\nin place to make sure that there\'s value. You take\naway all the waste, and what\'s leR over is not value.\n\nsay, "what\n\neach of the 60 measures,\n\nNow, a question each of you can start to ask perhaps\nthis aRernoon as you speak to your people.\nBefore\nyou ask any question, whatever the subject matter of\nit is, ask yourself, "What am I going to do with the\nanswer?"\nThe answer\nto your question\nis your\nincoming\nmaterial.\nYou have an obligation\nas a\nprocess manager to add value to it and pass it on to\nyour customer.\nIf you cannot see a way to add value,\nI would suggest stronglythat\nyou not ask the question.\nRephrase\nthe question.\nThink it through.\n\ndoes\n\nnot stand alone.\nThey are an interdependent\nnetwork.\nSo if you\'re going to measure something,\nyou had better put together the process flow diagram\nthat shows that cost and quality and delivery and the\ngreatness\nof what it is that you\'re producing,\nall are\ninterrelated.\nAll are linked together.\nAnd that if you\naffect one or change one, you\'re going to affect the\nother.\n\nThe organization\ndoes not -- the folks are not sitting\naround waiting for you to ask questions.\nOnce you\'ve\nfigured out that you can add value to the question,\nand you\'re allowed to change your mind depending\non the answer,\nat least you thought\nit through,\nbecause too many questions are floating around here\nand there are not enough people to answer them.\nAgain, the questions are cheap. It\'s the answers that\ncost a lot of money.\n\nNow, it\'s going to be fairly obvious to you systems\nthinking folks, but at the business level, at the board\nroom level, I assure you that it\'s not obvious.\nEach\nof these people has had a favorite key characteristic\nthat they have used\nin order\nto manage\nan\norganization.\nSome people are concerned\nabout the\ncleanliness\nof the floor. And if the floor is clean in\nthe plant floor, then they know you\'ve got a good\norganization\nthere. Neither good nor bad, but you\'ve\ngot to recognize\nthat that is not an independent\nmeasure.\n\nThis gets to the third question, "What are you going\nto postpone\nor cancel\nin order\nto answer\nthis\nquestion? NYou have just, by your question, reset that\nperson\'s priorities.\nAnd as I said earlier, they\'re not\nsitting\naround\nwaiting\nfor you or at least they\nshouldn\'t\nbe sitting around\nwaiting\nfor you to\npontificate\nand ask a question.\nTheyare\nnot going to\ndo something\nor they\'re\ngoing\nto reprioritize\nsomething.\n\nNow, for the questions.\nThe first question in a set of\nsix questions is, "Do you really know what it\'s going\nto take in order to get your customers\nto brag about\nowningyour\nproduct or service?" Some of the people\nspoke about that this morning.\nAnd it\'s old hat now.\nTen years ago when we came up with that at Ford,\nthat observation\nthat a lack of a negative doesn\'t\nconnote a strong positive.\nThat the focus of quality\nas the elimination\nof negatives,\nthe elimination\nof\nwaste, will only get you at most halfway\nthere.\nIt\'s\nthe addition of positives, getting your customers\nto\nbrag. Getting them to take delight,joy\nin what you\'re\ngiving them is absolutely\nwhat sells.\nIt\'s not the\navoidance\nof a negative. It\'s the addition of positives\nand values.\n\nYou need to, as a manager,\nif you can get them to\nanswer this question, you have a golden opportunity\nto begin to take something\noff the plate. There are\ntoo damn many projects\nand programs\nand things\nthat are put on our people\'s plate, and management\nis not taking anything offof them.\nI addressed\na management\ngroup last month, and one\nmanager came up afterwards\nand said, "You know, I\nrecognize\nthat we are filling up the plate, but the\nsolution is give them another plate."\n\nSo what we have found throughout\nindustry is that\nyour market research probably does a fairly good job\nat corroborating\nwarranty.\nYour market research\nprobably does a very good job of keeping track of the\nnegatives,\nthe defects\nthat could be an adverse\nvariance in a budget review. It could be a warranty\ncomplaint.\nIt could be a complaint\nletter. It could be\na whole number\nof negative things.\nManaging\nby\n\nI said, "No, no, that\'s\n\nnot my idea of improvement."\n\nYou have an opportunity\nhere if you can get this\nquestion answered.\nAnd it may be that you got fear\nin the organization\nand you might not get an honest\nanswer.\n19\n\nYou might ask the people\nto go back and take\ninventory of what perhaps\nis falling off the plate, as\nyou ask these questions.\nAnd if so, then you\'ve got a\ngolden\nopportunity\nto begin to step up to your\nresponsibility\nto take some of these programs offthe\nplate ifyou see that they\'re falling offalreadyand\nyou\ndon\'t even know it.\n\nAnd when we compartmentalize\nthe solutions\nor\ntunnel in on the solutions,\nwe many times create\nproblems for other areas of the company, because we\ndo not look at what we\'re managing as a system. And\nso a very quick way, a very powerful question is, \'_\xc2\xa2hat\nare the tradeoffs?"\nYou say this will work. What\'s\nthe down side? What are the tradeoffs?\n\nA fourth question, an extremely important\nquestion.\nYou ask the question,\n,By what process\nwill you\nanswer my question?"\nDr. Deming tells a very simple,\nhomely story. He said, "You cannot clean this table\nunless I know what you\'re going to do with it. You\ncannot ask me to clean that table and I can\'t clean the\n\nThere are obvious tradeoffs in cost, and quality, and\ntimeliness,\nand greatness.\nA very simple question,\nbut absolutely one you need to ask every time you\'re\nin discourse.\n\ntable unless I know what you\'re\ntable atter I clean it."\n\nAnd, finally, the last question,\n"Do I know what it\'s\ngoing to take to get myemployees\nto brag, to take joy,\nto take delight in what\'s going on?" In one of the few\ncause and effects relationships\nthat I see anyway, you\ncannot talk about outside customers being delighted\nunless\nyou first talk about\nyour people\nbeing\ndelighted,\nbragging about working here, working for\nyou and with you.\n\ngoing to do with that\n\nAs simple a request as that. If you\'re going to eat off\nof it, I can look at it, save you a lot of money and dust\nit off, and it\'s clean enough to eat on. That\'s the\nprocess I use. You need to understand\nthat if you\'re\ngoing to eat offofthis\ntable.\n\nWhat is it that\'s going to get my employees to take joy\nin what they do?\nAnd this is where Dr. Deming\nspeaks a lot about the appraisal system. About every\nmanagement\nprocess that\'s in place, that was put in\nplace for a very good reason.\nWe all had very good\nreasons why we put these management\nsystems in\nplace.\n\nIf, on the other hand you\'re going to do surgery on\nthe table, that\'s a completely\ndifferent use for that\ntable.\nI have to use a different\nprocess in order to\ncome up with that answer in order to clean the table.\nAnd you had better not do surgery on it unless you\nunderstand\nthe process that I used to clean the table.\nYou can get into a lot of trouble.\n\nBut with different\ntheory, with looking at it from a\ndifferent perspective,\nyou can see that many of these\nsystems, even though they were well-intentioned,\nare\nbarriers.\nThey stand in the way of helping our people\ntake joy in working for us and with us. One of the\nbigger barriers that there is.\n\nIt may be clean enough to cut people on, but if you\'re\ngoing to do microchip assembly, it\'s not clean enough\nto do that. That requires\na whole different process\nto clean the table.\nAnd so you really have to\nunderstand\nby what method was this table cleaned,\nby what method did you go about bringing me this\ndata or these data so that I can use the answer. I need\nto understand\nthat process,\nso I know what\nstrengths are and what the weaknesses\nare.\n\nThis gets you into looking at all the management\nsystems.\nThis gets you away from the shop floor\ntrying to worry about\nimproving\nthose processes.\nThis gets you into the financial management\nprocess,\nthe budgeting\nprocess, the people processes.\nAll of\nthose processes\nthat are barriers\nand could be\nenablers\n--just\nbecause you remove\nthe barriers,\ndoesn\'t mean that things are going to go well. Again,\nthe lack of a negative\ndoesn\'t\nconnote\na strong\npositive. You need to look at changing these systems\nand putting systems in place where you can\'t help but\nencourage\neach of your people to take joy and take\ndelight in what they\'re doing.\n\nthe\n\nYou\'re\ngoing to begin to build that pattern,\nthat\nprocess flow of who does what and how things get\ndone in a large organization\nif you begin to ask this\nquestion.\nWhat you\'re going to be able to do with the\noutput will be dramatically\nbetter as well.\nI had implied when we didn\'t see the big process flow\nwith all the interdependent\nrelationships\non the\nperformance\nmeasurement\nand feedback system that\nGeneral\nMotors\nis implementing\nright now, but I\nimplied a very valuable\nquestion.\n\'%Vhat are the\ntradeoffs?"\n\nI had mentioned\nphysical, logical, emotional,\nprimarily spoke about the logical aspect.\n\nIf you sit down, if you\'re in the board room, every\nproblem that the board has ever faced and perhaps\nwill face, they have already faced at some point in\ntime, and in solving one problem\nunfortunately,\nthey\'ve created 20 other problems.\nWhether\nit\'s in\nthe board room, whether it\'s a shop floor, we have all\nthe time, compartmentalized\nthe solutions.\n\nand I\n\nI want to make a brief comment\nabout teamwork,\nabout an equallycompelling\nside of the human being,\ntwo equally compelling\nsides of the human being if\nyou look at how you\'re\ntrying to reach people.\nCertainly,\non the physical,\nlogical, and emotional\nlevels, being able to determine\nwhere each of your\npeople is in that spectrum.\nBut you have to recognize\n20\n\nthatthathas\ntobesuperimposed\nontwo--letmesee\nhere, think1have\nI\nthishere.I don\'twantto make\nthisoverly\ncomplex.\nButonthephysical,\nlogical,\nandemotional\nlevels,\nin\nyour lans\np forchange,you tohave push\nneed\na\nsystem\nto get you out of a dependentrelationship\n--essentially me,each\nfeed t\nme,love\nme.When\nyou\nwere\nfirstborn,you ere\nw completelydependent\nupon\nyourparents.When\nyouwentto school,\nyouwere\ncompletely\ndependently\ninitially\nupon\nyourteachers,\nupon\nthatsystem.\nLikewise,\natwork.\nIn yourplans change,\nfor\nyouneedin those\nthree\nareas,physical,logical,andemotional, n the\no\ndependent\nsidetasks,assignments pushyour\nto\npeople\noutof dependency. thesame\nAt\ntime, ou\ny\nhave\ntohave\napullsystem\nthatontheothersixlevels\nofindependence\nandinterdependence.\nIt\'soneach\nofthese\nlevels,\nyou\'re\nlooking\natwayso strengthen\nt\nthefactthat| doit,I didit,I understand I did,\nwhat\nandI feeldarnimportant\nabouthat.\nt\nAt thesame I have\ntime,\nanequallyompelling\nc\nneed\nto saywedid it.

You go to your informal life and look\nto be a part of a family. You join groups where you\ncan feel a part of a family.\nPeter Drucker has said the largest growing sector in\nthe U.S. right now is the volunteer sector. And you\nsee that, because you don\'t get the sense of family in\nyour work place.\nIf you look at it systems-thinking\nwise, if you\'ve got to go home to feel a part of a family,\nthen both your work suffers and your home life\nsuffers.\nIn the far east, what do we see? In the formal systems,\nit\'s the team, it\'s the family, it\'s the society that\'s first.\n21\n\nIn their informal systems, you see them looking for\nways to stress that individuality.\nI don\'t want to get\ninto sports analogies,\nbut golf. Very, very popular.\nYou couldn\'t pick a more individualistic\nsport in this\nworld. You see people in informal settings over there\nsaying\nthis is my idea.\nI am important\nas an\nindividual.\nAnd they have to go off line to do that.\nWe have an opportunity,\nand this is why 1 feel very\ngood about what\'s happening\nover in this country.\nI\nsee a growing number of people recognizing\nthat we\nneed to balance\nthe individual\nand that sense of\nfamily in the formal organizations.\nin your informal life as well.\n\nYou might try it\n\nI do not see that sense of change,\nthat sense of\nurgency, that perception\nthat the formal systems over\nin the eastern\ncultures\nshould\nbe anything\nbut\nstressing\nfamily.\nI think that we\'ve shown what\nindividual\nstress or stressing\nthe individual\n-- take\nthat both ways -- can do. And they\'ve shown us what\nstressing the team and the family can do. If you\'re\nable to find a wayto balance them both, I think you\'re\ngoing to blow the doors offofwhat\nreally can happen\nin this world.\nMany times I\'m asked the question,\n\'_low long is it\ngoing to take?"\nThis question\nwas one of the\nquestions\nI paraphrased\nthis morning.\nMy answer\nhas been consistent.\nOver here when I\'m asked that\nquestion, I say it will take a long time. It\'s going to\ntake about 20 years.\nWhen I\'m asked that question\nover in Japan and in China, I say it won\'t take long at\nall. About 20years.\nIt depends on your perspective.\n\n\' RECOGNITION\nFINALISTS"\nAARON\n\nOF THE 1992 LOW TROPHY\n\nCOHEN\n\nDirector\nLyndon\n\nB.

(JACK)\nPresident-Elect,\nand Manager,\n\nWEST\nAmerican\n\nInternal\n\nSociety\n\nfor Quality\n\nAssessment,\n\nWestinghouse\n\nIt feels very special to be here this evening.\nI\'ve\nalways admired the communityofNASA\ncontractors\nand the fantastic achievements\nof the NASA people.\n\nSystems\n\nThe ASQC has been privileged\nto serve as the\nadministrator\nof this award since its inception.\nIn\nthose years, many of you have come to us and\nexpressed\nhow helpful it\'s been to go through\nthe\napplication\nprocess\nand to be able to provide\nfeedback to your own people on what you\'ve learned.\nThat\'s\nhelped\nto rededicate\nthe work force\'s\ncommitment\nto excellence\nand to improve\nthe\nproductivity\nand quality of your products.\n\nIt is an unwavering\ndedication\nto quality that has kept\nthe aerospace\nindustry at the forefront of quality, and\nthus the undisputed\nleader in American\nindustry.\nHowever,\nas I\'m sure you all know, our position\nis\nunder attack and maintaining that preeminence\nis a\nmajor\nchallenge\nfacing\neach one of us in the\naerospace\nbusiness.\n\nExcellence just carries forward, because it requires\nsetting\nhigh standards,\nhigh goals,\nand then\nmeasuring\nperformance,\nachieving the results, and,\nof course,\nrepeating\nthat Total Quality\nprocess.\nBecause\nof those efforts and commitments,\nTotal\nQuality in the aerospace\nindustry has become vastly\nmore than a buzz word. It\'s a movement\n... sweeping\nthe country, and it\'s a mind set. It\'s also a culture that\nwe all hear about so much. Total Quality becomes a\ncorporate\nphilosophy,\nand more important,\nit\nbecomes the way we live.\n\nOrganizations\nsuch as yours have clearly\nbeen\nleaders.\nYou\'ve\nexemplified\nand accelerated\nthe\nimprovement\nprocess\nthrough\na dedication\nto\nexcellence that\'s been the hallmark of the George M.\nLow Trophy.\nAs the first national quality award to be presented\nin\nthis country, the George M. Low Trophy has led by\ndemonstrating\nthe importance\nof quality\nand\nexcellence,\nas strategic, national\nimperatives.\nThis\naward\ncommunicates\nto the whole\nworld your\nunwavering\ncommitment\nto those tenants.\n\nI believe the next thing that will happen in the quality\nmovement\nis for quality to become\npart of our\npersonal\nhabits,\nan integral aspect of our internal\nhuman processes where everydaywe\nwant to improve\neverything\nthat we do.\nThe ASQC\nis a major\nproponent\nof that mind set and that behavior\nas\npersonal improvement\nbecomes a part of the Total\nQuality culture.\n\nThe success of the award program can be seen by the\nphenomenal\nattendance\nwe have here this evening\nand all through the communityofNASA\ncontractors.\nAs you have demonstrated,\njust the act of applying\nfor the award,\nthe self-assessment\nthat you go\nthrough\nin the examination\nprocess,\ndemonstrates\nboth a sense of personal and professional\npride that\'s\nunmatched.\nsense, this award benefits\n\nElectronic\n\naerospace\ncommunity\nand helps each of us learn\nfrom one another.\nThat\'s one of the most important\naspects of any award process, because those benefits\naccrue\nnot just to the people who have won the\naward, but to the entire aerospace\ncommunity.\nThat\nis one of the reasons why the ASQC has been very\nproud\nto be a part of this, because\none of our\nfundamental\ntenets is being able to share quality\ntechnologies\nacross various industries.\n\nAs President-Elect\nof ASQC,I\nget to talk to a lot of\ngroups who are practicing\nquality improvement.\nI\ncan tell you that none of them gives me more personal\nor professional\npride than being here with you. The\nGeorge M. Low Trophy has come to symbolize the\ndedication\nof the entire aerospace\nindustry and their\ncommitment\nto the quality,\nproductivity\nand\ninnovation.\nThose are features of our competitive\ndistinction.\n\nIn the broadest\n\nControl\n\nWe\'re proud to have played a role in the development\nof the NASA award.\nThe Low Trophy\nis a very\nsignificant\naward.\nWe\'re all proud of what you\'ve\ndone. Again, the importance\nof the award just can\'t\nbe overstated.\nIts most important\nfacet is promoting\n\nthe nation,\n\nbecause it allows us to use all the things that we learn\nabout\nquality\nimprovement\nthroughout\nthe\n24\n\nqualityand\nsharing\n\nthe advances\nthat come\nwith the rest of the community.\n\n"ANNOUNCEMENT\n\nwith\n\nMy congratulations,\n\nit and\n\nand best wishes\n\nto all of you.\n\nOF 1992 LOW TROPHY\n\nRECIPIENTS"\nAARON COHEN\nDirector\nLyndon\n\nB. Johnson\n\nSpace\n\nCenter\n\nThe Low Trophy is the tangible symbol of a dream.\nNot only the dream of receiving an award, but the\ndream of being the very best that an organization\ncan\nbe.\n\nmodule. But George knew we couldn\'t afford to wait\nthe extra months required\nto ready the space craft,\nand after careful thought he proposed\na singular\njourney.\nIt was George Low\'s idea to send the Apollo\n8 crew\nto the\nmoon\non\nthe\nfirst\nlunar\n\nThe Low Trophy stands for quality and excellence.\nIn the words of George Low, its namesake,\n"It is only\npeople who bring quality to things that must work."\nThis award program was initiated in 1984 and was\nrenamed\nin honor of George M. Low in 1990. It is\nthe most coveted productivity\nand quality award in\nthe aerospace\nindustry, and we are proud that the\nstandards are high and the competition\nis rigorous.\n\ncircumnavigation\nwas to be the\n\nusing the command\nmodule only. It\nfirst manned\nflight of the Marshall\n\nSpace Flight Center Saturn\nfirst time that humans would\ngravitational\ninfluence.\n\nV, and it would be the\nslip the bonds of earth\'s\n\nThat epic journey\nwas successful\non two levels.\nTechnically,\nit allowed us to prove our concepts,\nour\nhardware,\nand our techniques.\nBut in a larger sense,\nit also allowed us to galvanize the program and leap\nbeyond adversity to achievement.\n\nWe think such standards are befitting of the memory\nof George Low, one of the most respected\nleaders in\nNASA\'s long and distinguished\nhistory.\nI used to\nwork for George\nLow, and I think by telling you a\nlittle bit about him it might be possible to convey just\nhow deeply we at NASA feel about this award.\n\nIt was Apollo 8, perhaps more than any other single\nevent, that allowed us to reach the moon by the end\nof the decade.\nYes, we certainly\ndo honor the\nmemory of George M. Low at NASA.\n\nGeorge Low is a personal hero of mine, and he was\nfantastic boss and a good friend. When we worked\ntogether\non Apollo\ntogether,\nI was chief of the\nsystems engineering\non the Apollo Program and he\nwas managing\nthe entire program.\nHe taught me a\ngreat deal about management,\nabout the importance\nof making timely decisions,\nand about the need to\ntrust\nthe capabilities\nof our people\nand our\ntechniques.\nHe showed us all how to be bold.\n\nWhen organizations\nachieve great things, we must\nremember\nthat it was people who made the things\nwork.\nTonight,\nwe must remember\nthat it was\nindividuals who made the recipient companies\nwhat\nthey are today.\nBefore making the announcement\nthat all know you\nall are waiting to hear, I want to make the point once\nagain\nthat\nthe Low Trophy\nprocess\nis not a\ncompetition\nbetween\norganizations.\nIt is a\ncompetition\nagainst a standard.\nThe criteria for the\nLow Trophy\nset a standard\nagainst\nwhich each\napplicant\nand finalist\nis measured.\nWhen this\nmeasure is applied, the best of the best are selected\nas recipients.\n\nIt _vas George Low who, in the summer of 1968, made\nwhat is still probably\nthe boldest\ndecision\nof a\nmanned space flight program.\nFaced with delays in\nthe lunar module schedule, George was watching the\nclock hands sweep ever closer to the end of the\ndecade,\nthe deadline\nfor meeting\nPresident\nKennedy\'s\ngoal of a first lunar landing.\n\nThis\n\nmeans\n\nlosers. There\nwon, because\n\nAfter\nApollo\n7, the first manned\nflight of the\ncommand\nmodule,\nthe plan was to test the lunar\n25\n\nto me that\n\nnot winners\n\nand\n\nare only winners.\nEvery company\nthey have continuously\nimproved\n\nthere\n\nare\n\nhas\nand\n\nhave potential\nthe\n\nto improve even more in the future.\nEveryone recognized\ntonight has set very high goals\nfor themselves,\nand in most cases, have achieved\nthem. We applaud their effort and encourage them\nto continue.\n\nThe second\nrecipient\nis IBM Federal\nSystems\nCompany of Houston.The\nselection\nof IBM marks\nmany firsts for the George M. Low Trophy Program.\nKnown in 1987 as IBM Federal Systems Division, this\norganization\nwas one of the first two recipients of the\nNASA\nExcellence\nAward\nfor Quality\nand\nProductivity.\nSince then, the award\nhas been\nrenamed\nthe George M. Low Trophy, and IBM has\nalso changed its name.\n\nI am now very pleased and proud to announce the\ntwo 1992 recipients for the George M. Low Trophy.\nThe first recipient is the Space and Strategic Systems\nOperation\nof Honeywell\nIncorporated.\nWe have\nalready heard how Honeywell\nplays an important\nrole in each launch of the Space Shuttle. I can assure\nyou that space flight simply would not be possible\nwithout Honeywell\'s\ncontribution to the team.\n\nIBM Federal\nSystems Company becomes\nthe first\nrecipient\nto reapply for the quality and excellence\naward, the first former recipient\nto be selected as a\nfinalist, and now the first repeat\nrecipient\nof the\naward.\n\nIt also seems important to note that Honeywell\nhas\nbeen persistent in their improvement efforts. This is\nthe third time that Honeywell has been a Low Trophy\nFinalist.\nI\'m pleased to announce\nthey are now a\nrecipient.\n\nCarl L. Vignali, Space Systems\nHoneywell Inc.\n\nI want to assure you that IBM was not selected on its\npast record, but on its current\nperformance.\nOur\nevaluators saw continual improvement\nfrom the 1987\nlevel and\nmany new and exciting\nprograms\nimplemented\nsince that time. This company simply\ndoes\na super job of managing\nthe staggering\ninformation\nsystems needed to support space flight.\n\nGroup,\n\nAnthony\n\nMacina,\n\nIBM Federal Systems\nHouston\n\n26\n\nORIGINAL\nBLACK\n\nAblD\n\nWHITE\n\nCompany\n\n-\n\nPA_E\nPHOTOGRAPH\n\n\'THE CHANGING\n\nFACE\n\nOF AEROSPACE\n\nCONTRACTING"\nBRIGADIER\n\nGENERAL\n\nUnited\n\nAir Force, Commander\n\nStates\n\nDefense\n\nContract\n\nJEAN E. KLICK,\n\nManagement\n\nDistrict\n\nWest\n\nprogram officers, and the ultimate customer.\nwe\'ve tried to do is to make a team.\n\n1 am glad to be here, because I think this is probably\nthe one of the largest group of people that effect my\njob. I believe my 5,000 people effect all of your lives\nin your jobs.\nToday I intend to talk a little about\nTwo years\nago the Department\nconsolidated\nall of the contract\n\nmy organization.\nof Defense\nadministration\n\nadministration\npeople and the contractors.\nYou\nmight recall, not very long ago there was a lot of\nmoney, programs,\nand growth in the industry. That\'s\ncertainly not the case now.\nOur job is to build teamwork between the contractor,\nour business, program\npeople and offices, and you\nthe ultimate user. In this case, people like NASA, the\nAir Force, Navy, and the Army.\nI have an interesting\ncommand,\nbecause\nwe have\nconsiderable\nspace business.\n1 know there\'s been\nsome concern\nabout the competition\nbetween\nthe\nUnited\nStates\ngovernment,\nthe United\nStates\nmilitary, and NASA.\nI imagine you have discussed\nthat duringyour\nmeetings here for last couple of days.\nI deal with not only the military side, but the NASA\nside as well. I believe you recognize that those plants\nhave representative\noffices\nfrom the Western\nDistrict.\nWe have several big programs,\nnot just\n\nManagement\nReview\nall the\ncontract\n\nadministration\npositions\ninto one command.\nI\ncommand\nthe Western\nDistrict, which has the eight\nwestern states, plus Hawaii and Alaska. Over a year\nago, when I took command we had more than 100,000\ncontracts to administer\nwith a face value of over $300\nbillion.\n\nI had about\n\n5,300 people\n\nWhat\n\nBefore I came here, I was in the procurement\nside of\nthe business. We worked the satellites for the United\nStates Air Force. We worked both with the contract\n\nfimctions into one Contract\nManagement\nCommand\nunder the Defense Logistics Agency. Prior to that we\nhad a lot of different people with a lot of different\nrules in your plants. We had Air Force, Navy, Army\nplant reps, and a Defense Contract\nAdministration.\nit was not very efficient.\nWe got a lot of gripes from\nthe field, because\nthe rules were different,\nthe\npaperwork\nwas different,\nand the objectives\nwere\ndifferent.\nAs a resMt, we made a Defense\nDecision\nto consolidate\n\nUSAF\n\nto do the job.\n\nspace.\n\nWhen I speak with corporate\nCEO\'s, theyalways talk\nabout\ndownsizing,\nand invariably\nask why the\ngovernment\ndoes not follow suit. Well, that\'s not true\nin contract management!\nIn the 15 months I\'ve been\nthere, we\'ve gone from around 5,300 people to 4,300,\nand our target for next year is 3,800.\n\nSome of the bigger programs\ninclude a good part of\nthe F-22, the Air Force\'s\nAdvanced\nFighter.\nIn\naddition, we administer\nthe Apache and the Apache\nLongbow down in Mesa. We also handle the C-17 in\nLong Beach, the D5 Missile for the Navy, as well as\nthe Bradley Fighting Vehicle up in San Jose.\nWe\nhave a varied\nnumber\nof contractors,\na diverse\nnumber of customers.\n\nOur contract value and contract numbers have gone\ndown. In fact of government\ncontracts in the western\npart of the United States, we have lost 1 percent of\nface value of contracts\nper month for over the past 30\nmonths. During the last three years, we\'ve lost almost\na third of the contracts\nor the contract value at any\nrate. That affects you; it affects me.\n\nWhat do we do about that?\nLet me tell you a little\nabout\nmy job, because\nsometimes\nthere\nis a\nmisconception\nof what we do for a living. It\'s really\npretty\nsimple.\nWe assure\nthat the contractor\ncomplies with cost, delivery, technical,\nquality, and\nother terms of the contract.\nIt\'s our people who\ninterface\nbetween\nyour program\nofficers and the\ncontractor.\n\nOne of the things that we have to do to meet the\nchallenge to turn a contract into useable hardware\nis\nto determine\nbetter ways of doing business.\nHow\nwe\'re\ngoing to work with the contractors,\nthe\n27\n\nWeaccept\n\nthe products and services on behalf of the\ngovernment.\nPrimarily, it\'s my people who sign the\nDD250\'s.\nAdditionally,\nwe inspect the products\nbefore they get into the user\'s hands.\nOne of the\nlatest things we\'re doing is getting into program and\ntechnical support.\n\nAs I alluded\nto earlier,\nwe\'re\ntrying to build\nteamwork.\nWhenever\npossible, the program offices\nand contract\nadministration\npeople meet together\nwith the contractor.\nThis assures we all know the\n\nUntil my command came into being, we were strictly\nan administrative\norganization.\nIn the last two years,\nwe have tried very hard to beef up our engineering\nstaff to enable\nus to provide\nengineering\nand\ntechnical\nsupport to the program officers.\nThis\npermits us to tell program officers what is going to\nhappen to their programs before it actually takes\nplace.\n\nNow, when you go to program\noffice meeting and\nencounter\nsomeone,\nusually in uniform,\nwho is not\nfrom the program\noffice it\'s probably\none of my\npeople.\nWe think that\'s important.\nWe want to be\nan honest broker for each.\nWe do not want to give\nbad or different sets of information.\n\nmission,\naction.\n\npieces\n\nof\n\nIt isn\'t easy for us to change in the government,\nas I\'m\nsure you\'re all aware. However, I can assure you that\nthe old system of appearing\nto be adversaries\nis over.\nThat is definitely the situation in my command,\nand\nwithin DLA. Our goal is to work with our customers\nfor quality programs.\n\nWhat are we trying to accomplish\nin the Western\nDistrict,\nand throughout\nDefense\nContract\nManagement\nCommand\nand Defense\nLogistics\nAgency? How do we meet your business needs? The\nfirst thing is our focus on the customers.\nI recall when\nI was in Systems Command\nI didn\'t believe wry many\npeople were interested\nin helping me. It was bad\nenough when the Congress\nwent one way, and our\noperational\ncommanders\nwanted to go another.\nConcurrently,\nit always appeared\nthat contractors\nwanted to go some place else! No one was asking me\nwhat I needed.\n\nIf we serve\nour customer\nand obtain\nquality\nprograms, we\'ve done our job. What we want to do\nis work smarter\nto ensure\nquality.\nOne of our\nconcerns is the old idea of inspecting in quality, which\nhas been a mainstay\nof the government\nfor many,\nmany years.\nWe\'re trying to get away from that.\nWhen I was the Inspector\nGeneral\nfor Air Force\nSystems Command,\nit was definitely\nproved to me\nover and over again that you can\'t take a historical\ndocument,\nlook back, and inspect in what should\nhave been done in the process.\n\nWe sent out focus teams. I realize a number of you\nare tired of people visiting and asking what your\nrequirements\nare, what you need, and how can we\nserve\nyou better.\nInstead\nof sending\nout\nquestionnaires,\nwe sent a team.\n\nIn DLA, in DCMC, we are pushing a program called\nIQUE,In-Plant\nQualityEvaluation.\nThis is where we\nspend time when we help the contractors\non the\nprocesses\nof quality.\nWe want to look at how the\nproduct is being built. Very tight tolerances.\nVery\nclose tolerances.\nVery realistic tolerances.\nIf we\nachieve these in processing and manufacturing,\nwe\nwill not have to rely on government\ninspections.\nWe\nhope this system will work in all of our companies.\n\nFor a month,\na team of five individuals\nwent\nthroughout the country to do face-to-face\nanalysis of\nwhat we needed to get your job done. We gathered\ninformation\nand we\'re now working it into metrics.\nThis will allow us to grade ourselves\nagainst the\ncriteria you\'ve set.\n\nI feel the corporations\nare much more open to this\nthan NASA has been. NASA ,just like the Air Force\nand the other military organizations,\nhas its chieftains\nand war lords.\nAlthough,\nwe are getting a lot of\ncooperation\nfrom some of NASA divisions to work\nthe process\nas well as the inspections\nin the final\nproduct.\nWe\'ve been trying to work with NASA\nHeadquarters\nthrough\ntheir Safety and Mission\nQuality Office, the quality people,\nas well as the\noperations\npeople, to make sure that we\'re looking at\nthe right things.\nWe are trying to design\nthe\n\nI\'m trying to tell you, if you\'re a contractor, the things\nwe are expecting you to produce are the very same\nthings the program offices want you to produce. You\nshould view government\nas an entity. We should be\ntelling you the same things. We should be a hand in\nglove with the program offices.\nWe hope this cuts\nsome of the confusion\nthat occurred\nwhen two\npeople told you what to do based\nsets of requirements.\n\nand the individual\n\nOne of the areas that we\'re closely observing\nis\nquality.\nWe absolutely\nbelieve\nin TQM, Total\nQuality\nManagement.\nWe\'re\nunequivocally\ncommitted to it, as is the is the rest of the government,\nthe other services, and most of industry now.\n\nWe\'re trying to step from our historical\nrole of\nexplaining cost overruns and why things went wrong\nto a proactive\nrole which anticipates\nproblems\ncoming up on the scope.\nFrom the contractor\'s\nperspective,\nprobably the most important role we\nperform is we act as the paying agent for the DOD ...\nwe\'re the people\nwho authorize\npayments\non\ncontracts.\n\ndifferent\ndifferent\n\nthe objectives,\n\non two\n\n28\n\nprocesses, metrics\nput\n\nthe American taxpayer. We can do that without a lot\nof corporation\nbashing.\nWe must move away from\ntwo and three government\ninstitutions\ndoing the\nsame job, and working with more than one set of\ndirections.\n\ninto the process, use statistical\nanalysis to ensure we\'re making the product correctly\ninstead of waiting for an inspection\nstation.\nI have one plea, it\'s for the government\n... and that\'s\nnot only NASA but my service and the others ... to\nmove away from inspecting\nin quality to designing\nquality processes.\nI believe we\'re working very hard\non that. I am certainly not trying to single out or poke\nNASA in the eye, though we do have some problems\nwith some of the divisions, but we do need to move\n\nMy intention\nis to have one American\nproduction\nteam for quality\nproducts\nin space and military\nhardware.\nWe\'re trying to be an honest\nbroker\nbetween the program offices and the contractors.\nI\nexpect my people to take the initiative and set up\ncross-feed\nnetworks\nthat can use proven methods\nthroughout\ngovernment\ncontracting.\nAlthough,\nthere will be fewer dollars, people, and programs,\n\nthat way.\nThat is not to say that we don\'t need inspections\nor\nthat we are not going to do any inspections.\nI merely\ncontend\nthat we can do fewer inspections\nof the\n\ntogether,\n\nproduct,\nif we do more statistical\nanalysis of our\nprocesses.\nThat is the direction we wish to pursue in\nthe future.\nProcess-oriented\n\ncontract\n\nadministration\n\nis another\n\narea of quality that we totally believe in and feel is\npart of TQM.\nWe want the contractor\nand the\ngovernment\nto be a team. We would like to study the\nprocesses\nthat you use in your\nfactories\nand\nmanufacturing\nshops, so we can decide\ntogether\nwhich processes\nare important, and what the metrics\nshould\nbe. We would like you to measure\nyour\nprocesses,\nand let us monitor it.\nI would like to be able to use my dwindling\n\nresources\n\non what\'s important\nto both me and the customer.\nI\nwant to be able to monitor processes.\nI want to be\nable to look at data and statistical\nanalysis\nto\ndetermine\nwhether\nwe\'re getting the product to the\ncompany,\nto the corporations,\nand from the\ncorporations\nto our program\nmanagers.\nThe\ncompanies\nneed to do that.\nI believe\nwe\'ve had way too much government\ndirection\nin the past.\nWe have stopped\na lot of\ninitiatives, and made it difficult to make changes.\nIt\nis a great time to begin since all of us in this country\nare looking at quality as the number one objective in\nAmerican\nindustry.\nWe want to allow you to make\nthose kinds of decisions,\nto design processes\nthat\nwork, and let us monitor\nthem.\nWe would like to\nwork with you to either fix the processes or help you\nestablish new ones.\nTo summarize, a lot has been changed in contract\nadministration.\nI can promise you that we are trying\nto transform\ncontract administration\nin the western\narea of the United States, as are my counterparts\nnation-wide.\nIf you and your companies,\nas\ncustomers,\ndetermine\nthat we are not doing that, give\nme a call. I want to know about it. I want to be able\nto change\n\nit.\n\nMy goal and the goal of my District is close teamwork\nto cut costs and achieve the best possible quality for\n2O\n\nwe can make it happen.\n\n\'THE JOURNEY\nBILL\nVice\n\nCONTINUES"\n\nA. JACKSON\nPresident,\n\nBechtel\n\nAlliance\n\nManagement\n\nDepartment\n\nCorporation\n\nIt\'s a real honor and a pleasure to be here today with\nNASA and your contractors.\nYou are taking a very\nproactive\nleadership\nrole\nin Total\nQuality\nManagement.\nIn many ways, you are doing more and\nbetter than the private sector.\nI will talk a little bit\nabout that today.\n\nthey met with several executives\nfrom San Francisco\nfrom the banking and the construction\nindustries to\ntalk about investing in the Soviet Union.\n\nI think\nthe term,\n\'The Journey\nContinues,"\nis\nabsolutely\nappropriate.\nYou are beginning\nto %valk\nthe talk." As I looked through\nyour agenda today\ncoming down on the airplane,\nI saw words like\nleadership,\nempowerment,\nand partnering.\nThese\nare all things that are super critical to an effective\nTotal Quality Management\ninitiative.\nOur world is changing very rapidly.\nWhat was ain\'t,\nand what is,won\'t be for long! Innovation\nwill be the\nkey to improvement\nin our world\ncompetitive\nposition\nin the future.\nI think in the government\nsector and in NASA, you have opportunities\nto be\ninnovative\nand creative,\nand there is a difference\nbetween the two.\nSometimes\nin your organizations\nand ours, we\nto see more barriers\nto creativity,\ninnovation,\nthere really are. I would encourage\nyou as you\nthis journey\nto be as innovative\nas possible in\nwork processes\nand the elimination\nof waste.\n\ntend\nthen\ntake\nyour\n\nBill A. Jackson\n\nAs 1 considered\nwhat I wanted\nto say at this\nconference,\nI decided\nto talk about the changing\nbuyer/seller\nrelationships,\nand give you an overview\nof some results of a recent Private Sector Council\n\nWe spent the afternoon\nand into the night, at lunch\nand dinner, discussing working relationships\nwith the\nSoviets. So, when you say, \'kvhat was ain\'t, and what\nis, won\'t be for long", that is a perfect example.\nWho\nwould have believed two, three years ago that a boy\nfrom Northeast Texas would be having meetings with\nthe folks from the Soviet Union?\n\nstudy\ndone\nfor the Department\nof Defense.\nAdditionally,\nI would like to share with you some\ntrends developing\nin the private sector. I believe it is\nimportant\nto discuss\nthe changing\nbuyer/seller\nrelationship\nfor just a few minutes.\nI want to talk to\nyou from the heart, because I think this is an issue of\ncultural\nchange.\nIt is something\nthat you have to\nbelieve in to make happen.\n\nThey asked at the end of dinner ifl would make a few\ncomments\nabout my perceptions\nof how the meeting\nhad gone. I did not have a prepared\ntext. As I walked\nto the front of the room, I thought about what I would\nlike to say to that group of 25 Soviets.\nI related to\nthem that as a kid growing up in Northeast Texas, we\nlived in continual fear because the world powers were\npoised for confrontation.\nWe worried about nuclear\nholocaust\nand destruction.\nToday the super powers\nare poised for cooperation.\nWe must learn to trust\neach other and share our resources and technology.\n\nTwo months ago, I had an opportunity\nto visit with\nabout 25 delegates\nfrom the former Soviet Union.\nThese were businessmen\nand government\nofficials.\nThey were here in the United\nStates to sell their\nassets and their resources.\nThey wanted to sell 51\npercent of their refineries\nand chemical\nplants. So,\n30\n\nORIGINAL PAGE\ngJLACK AND WHITE PHOTOGRAPH\n\nAs I look around the industry and examine what\ncompanies are doing in continuous\nimprovement\nand\nTotal Quality Management,\ntoo often I find a cotton\ncandy approach\nto leadership.\nDo you know what\nthe cotton candy approach\nto leadership\nis? When I\nwas 10 or 12 years old, I used to go to the Dallas fair.\nThe highlight of that trip was to visit the cotton candy\nmachine.\nI don\'t know how many of you have eaten\ncotton candy, but it\'s not very filling. You can eat it\nall day because it is nothing but air and sugar.\n\nWe must get the politicians out of our way, because\nthey don\'t add much value to the process and more\noften add barriers\nto it. (I know you don\'t have\npoliticians\nto deal with!)\nI noted that the real peace dividend was in that room\nwhere the American businessmen\nwere talking to the\nformer\nSoviet\nUnion\nbusinessmen\nabout\ncooperation.\nThe peace dividend is not how much\nless we can spend on defense or give away in the\nwelfare system.\nIt is investing in our markets and\ninvesting in our world economy. The peace dividend\nwas in that room. I said we cannot afford to go back\nto where we were. Some would have us do it, but we\ncannot\n\nafford\n\nToo often our quality management\napproaches\nare\ncotton candy. They\'re air and sugar, and, at the end\nof the day, we get sick! I see too much of that in the\nindustry.\nWe cannot\ngo back to that kind of\nmentality.\n\nto have that happen.\n\nWhen I finished my talk, a Soviet official wanted to\nmake some follow-on comments.\nHe went to the\nfront\ntalk\nwho\nis an\n\nLet me share with you a couple of other points, and,\nby the way, 1 speak my mind when it comes to quality\nmanagement.\n1 believe\nwe must be critical\nof\nourselves\nbefore we can improve.\nWe have many\nmanagers in our company, and there may be some in\nthis room today or in your organization,\nwho are\nquickly spreading\nblood on their door, hoping the\nangel of Deming will pass. They hope that this thing\ncalled quality management\nis not for real, and we can\nget back to making bottom line decisions.\nThat is not\ngoing to happen.\n\nof the room, and through a translator,\nbegan to\nabout trust. One of his colleagues\nnext to me,\ncould speak English, turned to me and said, "that\namazing transformation."\n\nSo, 1 guess we can all change. You might ask, what is\nthe relationship\nbetween\nthe story I just told you\nabout the Soviets and the buyer/seller\nrelationship?\nFor the 18 years 1 have been associated\nin our\nindustry\nwith procurement,\nwe have had an\nadversarial\nrelationship\nbetween buyers and sellers.\nWe have been poised for confrontation.\nAs a result,\nwe\'ve wasted a tremendous\namount\nof our time,\nmoney, and effort,\neach other.\nToday\nmuch\n\nbecause\n\nthrough TQM, we\'re\nlike the Americans\n\nwe simply\n\nAt a conference\nin Washington,\nI made the comment\nthat not everyone\nwas on board in our company.\nThey are probably not in yours either, but 1 hope you\nare starting the process.\nThere are people who work\nfor me who are on the 20 yard line. There are others\nwho are on the goal line trying to get on the field.\nThere are some trying to climb the goal post while\nothers are on the sideline sitting on the bench. There\nis another\ngroup in the locker room trying to find\ntheir shoes. Then there are those who are in their\n\ndo not trust\n\npoised for cooperation,\nand the Soviets.\nIn\n\nbuyer/seller\nrelationships,\nwe must learn to trust each\nother, share our resources,\nour technology,\nand our\npeople.\nWe must eliminate\nthe waste in our work\nprocesses\nthrough joint improvement\nefforts.\nWe\nmust get the lawyers,\nthe politicians,\nand the\nnon-committed\nto TQM either out of the way or on\nboard to help us win.\n\ncars trying to find the stadium, while some are at\nhome watching the game on TV. Finally, there are a\nwhole lot of folks that don\'t know there is a game\ngoing on! What we must do is get this team pulled\ntogether so we can win.\n\nThe real peace dividend\nbetween\nthe buyer/seller\nreiationship\nis in this room today with NASA and\nyour contractors.\nWe can\'t lose that peace dividend\nin this relationship.\nWe cannot\ngo back to a\nmanagement\ngetting out the wash mentality:\na 9/1\nattitude of Attila the Hun. We simply cannot afford\nthat kind of leadership\nin the future.\n\nI listened to a speaker\nchief executive officer\n\nrecently who is chairman and\nof Basic American\nFoods. H e\n\nmade an interesting comment.\nHe said that after five\nyears of TQM he asked his managers if they felt they\nwere pushing it hard enough.\nThey replied, "Yea,\nboss. We\'re really pushing it hard. Look at all the\ncharts?\nWe\'ve sent all our people through training:\nthe critical masses have been educated.\nWe\'re right\non track." He then asked them how many people had\nquit because they had to work under a new system.\nThe answer was that no one had quit. His response\nwas that he would believe the system was being\npushed hard enough when the first person quit!\n\nTotal Quality Management\nis not complex. I think at\ntimes, we try to make it that way.\nIt is simply\ncontinually\nimproving\neverything\nyou do everyday\nforever, and knowing that the changes you have made\nare working.\nWe have to help our people, and we\nmust turn our people lose to help us. This will require\na new leadership,\nbut that leadership\nis in this room.\n\n31\n\nTotalQuality anagement\nM\nisnotoptional.t should\nI\nnotbe. Wewillnottolerate\npeople\ncoming\ntowork\nlate in the morning, r shoddy\no\nperformance,\nor\ndrinking\nonthe\njob. Whyshould\nwetolerate\npeople\nnotworking\ninthisnewsystem? isnotanoptional\nIt\nissue.\n\nwithin your company, but externally.\nWe wanted to\nsee how companies\nwere factoring\nperformance,\ndealing with process quality, customer\nsatisfaction,\nand product\nquality.\nIn addition,\nwe looked for\ntrends in Total Quality Management,\nand whether\nthere were any legal or regulatory\nboundaries\nbeing\nencountered.\n\nAboutsix months\nago,on an airplane from\ntrip\nHoustonoSan\nt\nFranciscofound\nI\nthefirstexecutive\nwhoquitbecause\nhehadtoworkwithTotalQuality\nManagement. is not necessary mention\nIt\nto\nthe\ncompany,\nbutthey\narein theaerospace\nbusiness.\nI\nasked abouthisjob, and remarked that his\nhim\n\nUntil about four years ago, when I put the private\nsector\nunder\na Total\nQuality\nManagement\nmicroscope,\nI believed that the government\nsector\nhad more waste than the private sector. Today, I\'m\nconvinced\nthere is more waste in the private sector.\nWe have to work to eliminate that.\n\ncompanywas\nwayahead\nin TQM. His response was,\n\'I know that, and I\'m quitting."\nI asked him why he\nwas quitting.\nHe said, \'Tm 52 years old and I can\'t\nstand that stuff, and I \'m not going to work with Total\nQuality Management."\nMy hat goes off to Harris\nCorporation\nfor pushing Total Quality Management\nto that level! (I did mention the name.)\n\nA key conclusion\nin the study on the buyer/seller\nrelationship\nwas that relationships\nwere becoming\nless adversarial.\nIn addition, we found that people\nwere not building on their past failures, and that goals\nand objectives were very similar.\nYou know, once\nyou put a supplier,\na contractor,\nand an owner\ntogether and start talking about what is important,\nyou suddenly\nrealize that we agree.\nWhy have we\nbeen so adversarial\nfor the last 20 or 25 years?\n\nNot long ago,I was on a panel with one of the leading\nsenators\nin our country.\nI don\'t know why he\'s\nleading, but he is! Among the comments\nhe made to\nthat group was that as a nation we must learn to die\nwith dignity. I do not think dying with dignity is the\nissue. We have led the industrial world for 50 years.\nI am convinced\nthat Total Quality Management\nwill,\nand is, putting us in a world competitive\nposture for\nanother 50 years. I believe that is the issue.\n\nI had an opportunity\nto visit with a dozen labor\nleaders. It has always been pretty much a fact that\nlabor and management\ncan never get together,\nbecause\nthey do not have the same objectives and\nmission.\nWe spent a day with 12 prominent\nlabor\nleaders.\nAt the end of the day we had a common\nmission and a vision statement\nto move forward in a\n\nI found\nsome\nrecent\ndata in our engineering\nconstruction\nindustry showing that the man-hour cost\nin Europe was $102 versus $56 in the United States.\nIsn\'t that is a good indicator\nof what has happened\nover the last five or six years as we began to get\ninvolved in quality management\nand productivity?.\nWe have driven\nour costs down, become\nmore\nproductive,\nand eliminated\nwaste in the system.\nConcurrently,\nEuropean\ncosts have gone up. We do\nnot need trade legislation.\nWe need competition,\nbecause people like you are poised for it. That is\nwhat will cause us to win in the future.\nI still hear\n\npartnering\nrelationship.\nToday, our company has\nsigned the first quality partnership\nwith a national\nlabor union in the history of this country. I think that\nproves\nthat labor\nand management\ncan come\ntogether.\nWhy can\'t the buyer and seller come together\nin a\nrelationship\nof mutual trust? We found that there is\nmore\nsharing\nof information,\nresources,\nand\ntechnology\nwhen they do. Further,\nthe buyers and\nsellers are able to assess risk better.\nRisk is the\nunknown.\nWhen you lay all your cards on the table,\nyou can minimize risk in your transaction.\nSo, why\ndo we continue to hide things from each other?\n\npeople\nsay that we are behind\nthe world\nin\nproductivity\nand quality. That is simply not true. We\nstill have the best American\nwork force in the world,\nand quality management\nis the vehicle that will help\nus win in the future.\n\nThe other day, I had a client on a $400 million project\nshare with me the details of their selection criteria,\npoint system, and how they planned to evaluate our\nproposal to the nth degree.\nThis was a first in our\nindustry!\n\nI would like to speak for just a minute about the\nPrivate Sector Council study, and some conclusions\nthat we reached.\nTen companies\nparticipated\nin that\nstudy; Hammerteeh,\nBell South, Boeing, Florida\nPower\nand Light, Ford Motor\nCompany,\nKraft,\nUnited Technologies,\nWestinghouse\nEleetrie, X erox,\nand Corrospeetal\nCorporation.\n\nAs you know, clients will neither tell you what they\nare looking for nor the value or the weight they are\ngoing to give to it. So, what do we do as contractors?\nWe tryto guess what they want. Why not open it up,\nand honestly share this kind of information?\nThat\nway, as an owner, you will elicit the kind of response\nthat meets your requirements\non a less costly basis.\n\nThe study objectives were to identify best practices\nin industry.\nAs you know, quality management\nshould allow you to share best practices,\nnot only\n32\n\nWealsoencountered movetowarda reduced\na\nsupplier ase, ndthis is somewhat\nb\na\ncontroversial.\nOne\ncontractor\nindicated\ntheywereoing\ng\nfrom5,000\nto 200.
