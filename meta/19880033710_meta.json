Potentially significant fuel savings are to be expected from laminar flow control (LFC) with suction surfaces on a CTOL subsonic transport; fuel savings from 25 to 40 percent are possible, depending on stage length. NASA has developed advanced computational design tools and methodology, subsonic and transonic NLF (natural laminar flow) and LFC airfoils, practical laminar wing construction techniques, and practical leading-edge treatments applicable to civil and military transports. It is concluded that skin-friction and induced drag approaches can combine to make a 50 percent reduction a reality for commercial and military aircraft of the future.", "title": "Dragging down fuel costs", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-13T14:30:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19880033710, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Hefner, Jerry N."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Langley Research Center", "location": "Hampton, VA, United States"}}, "id": "360439bc93e843eb8ec5b7974e4b0cd7"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19880033710, "publications": [{"volume": "26", "submissionId": 19880033710, "issn": "0740-722X", "id": "da01c8b8886345d0b680042446199c11", "publicationName": "Aerospace America", "publicationDate": "1988-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
