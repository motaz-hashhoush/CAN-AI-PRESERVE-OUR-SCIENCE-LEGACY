(2) Currently, NASA is commercializing low-Earth orbit using commercial companies to transport supplies and scientific experiments to the ISS. NASA is working closely with them to launch American astronauts to the station from American soil soon. (3) ISS is our platform to better understand living and working in space. NASA paved the way for commercial companies to take over that work so that we could focus on human exploration of deep space. (4) NASA will establish a Lunar Orbiting Platform \u2013 Gateway to establish an outpost near the moon. It will enable us to  get to Mars in a step-by-step fashion, with lessons learned in each phase of the process informing the next steps. SLS is the only launch vehicle with the power to get Orion and an in-space propulsion system to an orbit and a speed capable of enabling travel to the moon and beyond.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20180005413, "id": "143b9306f3fb4bdfbc7b4b700e7dfef7", "publicationDate": "2018-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
