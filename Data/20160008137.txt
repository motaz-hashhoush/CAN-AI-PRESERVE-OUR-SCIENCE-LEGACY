b'APM for a Constellation Intersatellite Link \xe2\x80\x93 EM Qualification and\nLessons Learned\nFrank H\xc3\xa4rtel * and Horst Kozilek *\n\nAbstract\nFor an Intersatellite Link (ISL) of a future constellation program, a study phase was initiated by ESA to\ndesign a mechanism for Radio Frequency communication. Airbus DS Friedrichshafen (ADSF) proposed a\ndesign based on the Antenna Pointing Mechanism (APM) family with modifications that met the stated\nneeds of the constellation. A qualification program was started beginning in September 2015 to verify the\nlaunch and thermal loads and the equipment performance (Radio Frequency, Pointing, Microvibration and\nMagnetic Moment). Technical challenges identified with the Engineering Model will be discussed within\nthis paper.\nIntroduction\nThe heritage of ADSF for Antenna Pointing Mechanisms is more than twenty years, with a series of\ndifferent pointing mechanisms. Those mechanisms were designed to deploy and point large dish\nantennas as well as small antenna horns for the X- and Ka-Band.\nGenerally the requirements of such mechanisms include the velocity (<10 deg/sec), the lifetime (of more\nthan 5 years), and the accuracy (<0.2 deg). These requirements are not too demanding, as the Antenna\npoints towards the ground station and the satellite is in a low-Earth orbit.\nFor the current constellation, these requirements are more demanding. As the Intersatellite Link shall\nestablish the RF communication between two MEO satellites, a very fast pointing velocity is needed\n(> 60 deg/sec). A higher precision of <0.125 deg and an overall lifetime of 12 years are also required.\nThese changes had a significant impact on the heritage design. The actuation chain had to be modified\nwith larger motors and bearings. This led to an intensive redesign process with an increased mass. The\nimpacts of these modifications have been verified within the qualification program, which will be\npresented, including results, within this paper.\nIntersatellite Link Antenna Pointing Mechanism Background\nFor a constellation program, RF Intersatellite Links between single satellites can support ranging and\ncommunication for uploading mission data or tele commands. These data shall be uploaded from one\nsingle ground station to the next reachable satellite and transmitted by the Intersatellite Link (see\nFigure 1) to further dedicated satellites. For this function each satellite has to be equipped with two\nAntenna Pointing Mechanisms for data transfer in the K-Band.\nTo establish such a constant network, the APM has to be able to point in each vector direction of the\nhemisphere. Additionally the movement towards a new pointing destination has to be very quick in order\nto enlarge the time for the data link communication. ADSF has a substantial heritage in building APMs for\ncommunication to ground applications. ADSF follows the approach of elevation over azimuth axis pointing\nsystems. These systems have proven their high reliability and robustness over a multitude of different\nmissions and accumulated a time in orbit of more than 35 years.\n\n* Airbus Defence and Space, Friedrichshafen, Germany\nProceedings of the 43rd Aerospace Mechanisms Symposium, NASA Ames Research Center, May 4-6, 2016\n\n247\n\nFigure 1. Intersatellite Link \xe2\x80\x93 Principle\nFor constellation programs, the components\xe2\x80\x99 cost have a higher impact than in nominal single satellite\nmissions. A consequent design-to-cost approach was followed using open-loop stepper motors and as\nmany standard off-the shelf elements as possible. In Figure 2 the different elements can be seen.\nAn elevation over azimuth axes approach was used for the APM design. An indirect (using gear wheels)\nactuation principle was chosen to ameliorate the power (holding current reduction) and pointing (gear\nratio) budget. The Azimuth axis is supported by a bearing in O-configuration. In the azimuth axis there is\na slip ring installed, transferring the power and signals to the elevation stage. The RF signal is transferred\nusing a waveguide and two rotary joints (one to the spacecraft and one to the elevation stage). On top of\nthe azimuth stage a stiff supporting structure (Yoke) is installed, providing the interfaces for the Elevation\nAxis with its Antenna Supporting Bracket, the elevation actuation chain (comparable to Azimuth actuation\nchain), and the interface for the HRM. The HRM is locking all relative movements of the Azimuth and\nElevation Stage by transferring the loads into the spacecraft structure.\n\nElevation Stage\n\nAntenna Inertia Dummy\nElevation Rotary Joint\n\nMLI\nNEA\nHRM\n\nAzimuth Stage\n\nWaveguide\n\nBase\nbracket\nSlip Ring\nAzimuth\nStepper Motor\nElevation Rotary Joint\nFigure 2. Intersatellite Link Mechanism\n\n248\n\nCompared to the heritage projects, the motor size had to be significantly increased in order to achieve the\ndemanding velocities and motor torque margins according to ECSS. Besides this, the reference sensor of\nthe azimuth axis had to be changed (2.7 million activations) from a mechanical precision switch to a Hall\nsensor switch. A demanding change was also the adaptation of the thermal management. As a\nconstellation by nature has an orbit with a very high sun illumination and an orbit with almost no sun\nillumination; the variety of the thermal environment is more complex than for a sun-synchronous orbit.\nAll described changes led to increased masses and therefore higher vibration loads. The Hold Down and\nRelease Mechanism and the bearings had to be adapted in order to handle these increased vibration\nloads.\nQualification Approach\nAn Engineering Model (EM) philosophy was decided. The EM qualification approach is shown in Figure 3.\nThe qualification test program was accompanied by a bearing breadboard test and a life test with a\nsimplified life test model. This life test was started in an early project phase. The life test verifies the\ndemanding life time requirement of 12 years active in-orbit time with 2.6 million revolutions.\nAs a cost saving action for the life test, it was decided that the life test model will be driven by Commercial\nOff-the-Shelf (COTS) electronics.\n\nFull Electrical Test\nEGSE\n\nStart-Up ASM &\nEGSE\n\n01 ASM\nPhysical properties Measurement of\nWeight, CoG, MoI,\nmeasurement\n(GISL-7)\n\n06 ASM\nVibration/Shock\nTest\n\n02 ASM\nRF performance\nverification\n\nRF Power, RF\nFrequency Band,\nInsertion Loss,\nmaximum, VSWR\n(GISL-6)\n\n02 ASM\nRF performance\nverification\n\nRF Power, RF\nFrequency Band,\nInsertion Loss,\nmaximum, VSWR\n(GISL-6)\n\n03 ASM\nFunctional\nPerformance Test\n\nAccuracy, Stability,\nvelocity profile,\nmotor current\n(GISL-1,2,3,4,13)\n\n03 ASM\nFunctional\nPerformance Test\n\nAccuracy, Stability,\nvelocity profile,\nmotor current\n(GISL-1,2,3,4,13)\n\n07 ASM\nTV-Cycling Test\n\nDegradation test of\nEM under TV\ncondition (GISL-21)\n\n04 ASM\nMagnetic Moment\nTest\n\nMagn.

An overall mass of 10.8 kg (as designed) was verified during the\nphysical measurements.\nTesting\nAll testing was to be performed in the Friedrichshafen testing facility. Due to availability at the vibration\ntest facility, it was decided to perform the vibration test at Airbus DS Ottobrunn. After a non-conformance\nreport, the test was continued in Friedrichshafen.\nBearing Characterization Breadboard Test\nAs the chosen bearings were increased in diameter compared to the heritage design, a breadboard test\nwas performed to measure the impact on torque with the required velocity and temperature inputs. A\ncustomizable (all different types bearings used for the APM can be installed) bearing breadboard test\nsetup was developed and manufactured. The test setup provides the ability to compare the influence of\ndifferent bearing types, lubrication, materials and combinations. Performing the bearing characterization\ntest as a breadboard test supports monitoring the quality of the procured components and provides the\ninput data for the torque margin and the bearing analysis.\n\nTorque Sensor\n\nBearing Setup\n\nTVAC chamber\n\nConductive\nheater/cooler\nActuator\nFigure 4. Bearing Characterization Test Set-up in a TV chamber\nISL bearing characterization was performed at seven different velocity levels (1 rpm, 3 rpm, 17 rpm,\n25 rpm, 35 rpm, 45 rpm and 100 rpm) and four different temperature levels (-40\xc2\xb0C, 0\xc2\xb0C, 25\xc2\xb0C and 65\xc2\xb0C).\nEach characterization was started with a run-in test, turning the bearing clockwise and counter-clockwise\nfor several minutes. After the run-in, the different velocity levels were repeated multiple times, deriving\nmultiple resistive torque measurements.\nComparing the results of the measurements (see Figure 5), it can be concluded that the bearing\nperformance was as expected in the torque margin analysis. The worst case torque assumed in the\nanalysis was 75 N-mm and verified by a measurement of 72 N-mm (-40\xc2\xb0C measurement). At a lower\nvelocity level a higher, but still acceptable, deviation of 6 N-mm between analysis and measurement was\nfound.\nAn interesting phenomenon was the higher rate increase of the resistive torque for hot and fast\nconditions. This was not investigated further, but viscous effects could be a possible source of such a\nbehavior.\n\n250\n\nBreadboard testing gives Airbus DS GmbH the confidence of having a sufficient torque margin and that\nthe friction behavior of the preloaded bearing configuration is modelled correctly.\n\nFigure 5. Results of the Bearing Characterization measurements\nLife Test\nThe initially planned life testing at the end of the qualification campaign was skipped in favor of a separate\nlife test program with a simplified model running in parallel to the EM test campaign. The aim was to\nprovide a life-tested mechanism at the end of the 1.5-year EM design and qualification phase.\nCost savings for the life test were realized by performing the test with the azimuth stage only. This\nsolution was selected as the loads for the azimuth bearings (environmentally and in-orbit) were\nconsidered to be the worst case. The azimuth motor and both gears have the higher number of revolution\nduring in-orbit life.\nPrior to life testing, a proper environmental conditioning was essential for the credibility of the life test.\nThis environmental conditioning consists of a vibration test and a thermal settling. The thermal settling in\ngeneral is not a problem, and was performed directly before the start of the life test under the specified\nacceptance temperature level in a thermal vacuum chamber.\nA higher effort was the task to set up the proper vibration level of the Life Test Model. The applied load\nlevels for the life test model vibration test were not known or they had a low confidence level. This was\nthe case due to the reconfiguration of the elevation axis and due to the early stage of the development\nphase. This conflict leads to a very high effort in the estimation of the vibration test levels for the life test\nmodel. The goal was to load the single components as high as possible (identical to the EM), but not to\ndamage the bearings.\nThe decision was made to estimate the test levels for the center of gravity. With those test levels it was\npossible to predict the loading of the bearings and the actuator during the vibration test.\nBearing loads were applied with an elevation stage dummy mass implemented in the test setup. Initial\napproach to leave the dummy mass unsupported at the Hold-Down and Release Mechanism (HRM) led\nto unacceptable high bearing loads. An additional support structure became necessary and was\nimplemented in the test setup. Designing and implementing a support structure, different from the EM\nlaunch lock design, required much more effort than expected. The additional change of the initial motor\nlocation induced further changes of the life test set-up. Those changes consumed the schedule margin for\nlife testing.\nDuring the performance of the accelerated life test, the time span of no motion (27 sec), due to\ncommunication, was removed. This was necessary to perform the 12-year in-orbit operation within about\n\n251\n\n7 months. Active cooling of the motor was necessary as the motor was continuously operating during the\nlife time test without any interruption. Without cooling the motor would heat up too much.\n\nDummy Mass\nAzimuth Stage\nSupport structure\n\nFigure 6. ISL Life Test Model Vibration Test Setup\nThe life test motion set was derived from the current link budget analysis. The motion set of 25 positioning\ncommands was to be repeated during the whole life time test while the environmental condition was\nchanged. The life test also verifies the rotation capability of the motor bearings, the correct function of the\nplanetary gear stage and the spur gear. According to ESSS no significant degradation during the required\nlifetime was allowed.\n\n400\n\n10\n9\n8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n\n350\n300\nCurrent (mA)\n\n250\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\n\nResistancy (Ohm)\n\nFour main parameters were measured (Figure 7).

The starting motor current, slip ring resistance and motor coil\nresistance did not show any non-tolerable performance change.\nPerformance Test\nTest setup for performance testing (see Figure 8) allows a stiff installation of two high-resolution absolute\nencoders to avoid additional measurement errors.

The maximum pointing error is\nshown in Figure 9 \xe2\x80\x93 left side (25 nominal positioning commands in a time span of 100 sec are plotted).\nThe power consumption of a single motor is about 14 W per motor. Power consumption for one APM with\ntwo axes is estimated to be 28 W. Due to the long transmitting time in relation to the motion time an\naverage power consumption of about 6 W is estimated.\n\n0.1\n0.1\n\n88\n\nMean Error Azimuth = 0.01308 deg\nand STD = 0.0028098 deg\n\n66\n\n0.05\n0.05\n\nPowerinin Watt\nPower Watt\n\nPositioning Error in deg\n\nPositioning Error in deg\n\n77\n\n55\n\n0\n0\n\n44\n\nMeasurement\nMeasurement\nMeasurement\nMeasurement\nMeasurement\nMeasurement\n\n-0.05\n-0.05\n\n-0.1\n-0.1\n2\n2\n\n4\n4\n\n6\n6\n\n8\n8\n\n10\n10 12 14 16 18\n12 14 16 18\nMotion\nMotion\n\n20\n20\n\n22\n22\n\n33\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\n22\n11\n00\n-30\n-50\n-40\n-50 -40 -30\n\n24\n24\n\n10\n0\n-20\n-10\n-20 -10 0 10\nTime in Sec\nTime in Sec\n\n20\n20\n\nFigure 9.

ISL APM EM Return Loss (left) & insertion Loss (right) Test Results over the complete\nmotion range\nAll in all the performed work from MIRAD AG was fully in line with the required RF performance of the\nsubsystem.\nVibration Test\nThe specification for the launch loads was given as 20G from 5 to 60 Hz and 6G from 60 to 100 Hz for the\nSine Vibration and 0.12 g\xc2\xb2/Hz x (M+20 kg)/(M + 1 kg) for Random Vibration. The Vibration Test was\nperformed at Airbus DS in Ottobrunn and Friedrichshafen. The vibration was controlled via base force\nnotching. The base force was directly measured by four force sensors installed underneath the mounting\ninterface (see Figure 12). The base force limits are defined via the quasi static design loads. In order to\nprotect the Azimuth main bearings and the Actuator from over testing, secondary notches were used. The\n\n254\n\nbearings were limited to a peak Hertzian stress of 3360 MPa (including all ECSS ratings) and the\nActuators were limited to 40 G acceleration at the center of gravity.\nThe X and Z axes could be qualified successfully with just minor usage of secondary notches. The Y axis\nwas qualified to an input level of 5G. A load dependent behavior was found in intermediate testing (1/4\nlevel limited to 10g response of the motor). The load dependent effect was investigated (see Figure 13).\nThe ISL heritage design had to be adapted due to the more demanding requirements. The heritage HRM\nsystem did perfectly work for X and Z axis of the ISL, while enabling a frictionless release. In the Y axis,\ndue to the design changes, too much load was transferred over the HRM Base interface. The\nenhancement of this interface, combined with some minor structural strengthening, will enable a\nqualification up to 20G load input.\n\nAPM in locked\nconfiguration\n\nLoad cells for Base\nForce notching\n\nVibration Adapter\n\nFigure 12.

ISL APM EM Y- Axis Vibration Test (Acceleration on Elevation Motor)\nAs a series of subsequent qualification tests had to be done, the rework will be realized after the\ncompletion of the qualification test campaign. The residual risk for this rework and the final vibration\nqualification of the Y axis up to 20 G load input is limited. In summary, the EM vibration testing has\nproven its importance by identifying the need for the rework, while the equipment has nevertheless\nproven its viability for the usage in the constellation program.\n\n255\n\nX-Axis\n\nY-Axis\n^\n\nZ-Axis\nFigure 14.

TVAC\ntest is about to be started, results will be part of the AMS presentation. During the TVAC test, a nonoperational cycle will be performed, followed by a set of seven operational cycles. During the seven\noperational cycles the EM will be driven with a standard pointing profile extracted from the global pointing\nbudget. As the ISL will also be activated during transient phases in space, this test is of major importance\nto guarantee the functionality under extreme thermal conditions. At dedicated inspection points the\nstarting current and the power consumption will be measured in hot and cold conditions. These\nmeasurements will also verify the bearing characterization breadboard tests.\n\nMicrovibration Test\nThe micro vibration test was successfully performed in the mechanisms group test facility. The test setup\nwas developed and continuously improved during the last years (principle shown in Figure 16). The micro\nvibration test sensors logs the forces acting over a time period. This data is subsequently analyzed using\na Fast Fourier Transformation algorithm to identify the frequencies and amplitudes of the emitted\nvibrations. Details regarding the analysis method can be found in [2].\nEGSE\nAPM\n\nControl Laptop\n\nVibration Adapter\n\nKistler Table\nAmplifier\n\nMechanical Isolation\n\nXPC Data\nAcquisition\n\nFigure 16. ISL APM EM Microvibration Test Setup\nBoth axes were tested separately with different velocities from 10 deg/sec to 90 deg/sec. The test results\nfor the rotation of the azimuth axis at 70 deg/sec can be seen in Figure 17. A second test method was to\nperform a motion profile with both axes operating in parallel.\nTest results evaluation showed that the required microvibration levels below 0.1 N and 0.1 N-m from\n0-2000 Hz could not be met with the current stepper motors and motion profiles.\nAdditionally, an impact from the COTS electronics was seen. Tests comparing a COTS electronics and\nthe flight electronics showed an improvement by a factor of 2 for the flight electronics. Dedicated micro\nvibration reduction designs were developed at Airbus DS [3] in the past. Those design improvements can\nsignificantly reduce the microvibration. Further technical optimizations to reduce microvibration at\nspacecraft level are ongoing at Airbus DS GmbH.\nMagnetic Moment Test\nThe Magnetic Moment Test is used to identify the influence of the magnetic components installed within\nthe ISL APM EM on the satellite. Results of the EM can also be used to optimize the position of the APMs\nat spacecraft level. The two major sources of magnetic field emission are the stepper motors.\nIn order to identify the field emission the ISL APM EM was installed in a Helmholtz Facility. Firstly, the\nremanent (non-powered) magnetic field emission was measured (360 measurements around the ISL\nAPM EM). Secondly, the field was measured in powered condition (standard motion profile).\n\n257\n\nResidual Force Spectrum Fx\n\n10\n\nResidual Torque Spectrum Mx\n\nENERGY: RMS = 3.6708 N and ST D = 2.4647 N and\nAMPLIT UDE: Mean = 0.0051732 N and Max = 1.2224 N at\n16.5998Hz\n\n0\n\nTorque in [Nm]\n\nForce in [N]\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n10\n\n10\n\nENERGY: RMS = 3.4492 N and ST D = 2.7444 N and\nAMPLIT UDE: Mean = 0.0017662 N and Max = 0.59225 N at\n16.5998Hz\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-6\n\n0\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n0\n\nFrequency in Hz\n\nResidual Torque Spectrum My\n\nENERGY: RMS = 3.051 N and ST D = 2.69 N and\nAMPLIT UDE: Mean = 0.004955 N and Max = 1.0883 N at\n60.7994Hz\n\n0\n\nTorque in [Nm]\n\nForce in [N]\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n10\n\n10\n\nENERGY: RMS = 4.7481 N and ST D = 2.7929 N and\nAMPLIT UDE: Mean = 0.0018038 N and Max = 0.76115 N at\n16.5998Hz\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-6\n\n0\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n0\n\nResidual Torque Spectrum Mz\n\nENERGY: RMS = 45.8118 N and ST D = 1.3815 N and\nAMPLIT UDE: Mean = 0.0038868 N and Max = 1.8626 N at\n276.6972Hz\n\n0\n\nTorque in [Nm]\n\n10\n\n10\nFrequency in Hz\n\nResidual Force Spectrum Fz\n0\n\n2\n\n10\n\n10\nFrequency in Hz\n\nForce in [N]\n\n10\nFrequency in Hz\n\nResidual Force Spectrum Fy\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-5\n\n10\n\n10\n\nENERGY: RMS = 0.73947 N and ST D = 0.62162 N and\nAMPLIT UDE: Mean = 0.0010917 N and Max = 0.85138 N at\n276.6972Hz\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-6\n\n0\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n10\n\n0\n\n2\n\n10\n\nFrequency in Hz\n\n10\nFrequency in Hz\n\nFigure 17.

Variation of the magnetic moment is given over the motion of the motors towards each\nother. The maximum calculated Magnetic Moment is at 4.2 Am\xc2\xb2 and the lowest calculated Magnetic\nMoment is at 2 Am\xc2\xb2.\nMeasurement and calculation does not meet the required values of 0.2 Am\xc2\xb2. The high Magnetic Moment\nis caused by the motor size and the mass and force of the magnetic material used in the motor. The\ncurrent situation could be improve by changing the motor size or materials as well as shielding. But\nfurther discussions with the contractor showed that the stated non-conformance report can be accepted.\nConclusions\nGeneral\nIt can be stated that the chosen technical solution fulfills all major requirements. The required orbit lifetime\nof 12 years could be proven by an accelerated life test. The pointing performance is well within the\nneeded requirement and the RF performance allows a successful communication. In order to fulfil the\ntorque budget a powerful stepper motor was chosen. This stepper motor leads to certain violations of\nrequirements like the magnetic moment and the microvibration.\nConclusion after all tests is that the ISL APM EM is successfully qualified (status after vibration test). All\nnon-conformance reports for the current Engineering Model phase have been closed successfully and\nsome further improvements for the APM have been identified to increase the performance and to gain\nsome mass reductions.\nAirbus DS Friedrichshafen delivers the ISL APM EM to Airbus DS Portsmouth after just 18 months of\ndesign, manufacturing and assembly/integration/test activities including a dedicated life test.\n\n259\n\nLessons Learned\nFor each qualification test the major lessons learned are:\nThe Bearing Characterization Breadboard Test provided at an early project state a series of very\nimportant results (lubrication verification, correct torque budget inputs, possible bearing working profile).\nAs a lesson learned, this test will be standardized within the mechanism department to be used for all\nupcoming projects, in order to improve the internal bearing lubrication and torque database.\nThe adequate Life Test conditioning proved to be challenging when using a simplified Life Test Model.\nTherefore for further projects, if possible, the EM will be used instead of a simplified model. A lot of effort\nin the extra assessment and testing can be saved.\nThe Performance Test showed that the chosen technical solution (stepper motor, backlash-free gear\nwith a low medium gear ratio and a bearing in O-configuration) can provide the needed accuracy of\n0.1 deg without any challenges.\nThe RF Test demonstrated the possibility to reduce cost and time to integration by selecting a novel\nsupplier. The RF performance was outstanding. This shall support an open supplier selection for the\nfuture.\nThe Vibration Test qualified the X and Z axes for a load input of 20G. Y-axis was qualified up to for 5G\nload input, as the load dependent effects had to be investigated in detail. The vibration test also showed\nthe high value of such EM testing in order to reveal design challenges, occurring due to changes from\nheritage design solution. Functional analysis within the mechanism development process, connecting\nfunction to design elements could also help for future projects. With the proposed and investigated minor\nstructural improvements the APM has proven its viability for the usage in the constellation program.\nThe lessons learned of the TVAC Test will be presented at the AMS conference.\nThe Microvibration Test and the Magnetic Moment Test are demonstrating a conflict of requirements.\nOn the one hand side a certain velocity and accuracy is demanded. On the other side the motor sizing\nleads to the violation of the microvibration and magnetic moment requirements. This conflict of goals has\nto be assessed with the contractor. If the violation of the two named requirements cannot be accepted a\nmore complex motorization concept has to be chosen (e.g., closed-loop Brushless DC Motor).\nAcknowledgment\nThe author thanks the co-authors and the whole Intersatellite Link Study team for the support and the\nshared effort.
