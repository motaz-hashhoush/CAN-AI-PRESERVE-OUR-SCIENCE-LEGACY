Increasing the effective aerobraking area of a spacecraft (without significantly increasing spacecraft mass) results in a corresponding reduction in the time required for aerobraking. For example, if the effective area of a spacecraft is doubled, the time required for aerobraking is roughly reduced to half the previous value. The dedicated deployable aerobraking structure thus enables significantly shorter aerobraking phases, which results in reduced mission cost, risk, and allows science operations to begin earlier in the mission.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20100028884, "id": "8a061695ef764b38aee083a02c79ceeb", "publicationName": "NASA Tech Briefs, August 2010", "publicationDate": "2010-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20100028859, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "NASA Tech Briefs, August 2010", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20100028884.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20100028884/downloads/20100028884.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20100028884/downloads/20100028884.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20100028884/downloads/20100028884.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
