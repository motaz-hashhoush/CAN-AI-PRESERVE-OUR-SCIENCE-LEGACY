Meyer\nInstitut Francais du Petrole, Paris (France)\nI will end this series of conferences by discussing the pos- 041\nsibilities of utilizing this algae and the problems created by such\nutilization. I think it is necessary to briefly review production\nvalues.\nIn the laboratory, it is normal to obtain growth rates which,\nunder the best conditions, can reach 20 g of dry algae/m 2/ day.\nThis, naturally, occurs when all climatic conditions, basically\ntemperature and light conditions, are under control.\nIn the case of an outdoor culture, as it has been shown, these\nare parameters which cannot be completely controlled.\nFor example, in the case of cultures grown in Antibes, when in\nthe morning there was enough light for photosynthesis, the temperature of the culture was about 25 0 ; the temperature later reached\na maximum of 33 0 , then it diminished slowly.\nAs far as spirulines are concerned, optimal growth conditions\nare around 30 0 , between 30 and 35 0 . It will be, therefore, advisable to introduce the culture in regions where, at sunrise, a temperature greater than 25 0 will have been reached in the basins. This\npresents \'a. culture introduction problem.\nWe can hope to ;effect the temperature parameter on the one\n1\t\n\n;\n\nhand through the greenhouse effect, which we discussed earlier,\nby operating with a closed basin which makes it possible to limit\nevaporation, cooling and night radiation and, on the other hand,\nthrough the thermal inertia of the culture, that is -to say, the\nvolume of the culture, with the limitations that this implies.\nThe testa we are going to conduct in Algeria will help us establish these points.\nUnder the present condition of our testing, we can speak of 042\nthese production rates.\nWe have worked in Antibes with actual crops for a period of\ntwo months, July and August, 1966. It was a more or less normal\nsummer with a stormy period lasting a few days toward the fifteenth\nof August.\nWe obtained an average production rate of 10 g /m 2/day with\npeaks of 14 g /m2/day.\nIn Mexico, we obtained the same rates. Temperature conditions\nin the basin are very similar to those we had in Antibes.\nTo estimate cost price, we have taken as a basis a growth rate\nof 12 g /m2 /day. We started from technological data we had accumulated in Antibes and which made it possible , by means of an \t\nextrapolation which for now remains quite theoretical, to establish\na pre-project for algae culture corresponding to a production of\n10,000 t/year. The culture should be introduced in a region where\nthEre are favorable climactic conditions and where it can operate\n340 days/year; this leads us to consider a culture surface of 230\nhectares.\nThese 240 hectares of cultures will be divided in four 60\nhectare basins. These basins will be made up by the juxtaposition\n2\n\nr\n\nr,\n\nof the elements discussed by M. Van Landeghem, and each one will\nmeasure 600 m by 1 km.\nWhy did we choose such size? It is because this size corresponds\nto optimal conditions, in particular in regard to the atomizer\nwhich will be used to dry the algae. There will be, in fact, an\natomizer which will operate continuously and will be capable of\ndrying the whole production; harvesting will be done with drum filters, of the same type you have just seen, at a rate of one filter\nper basin.\nWe have made certain hypotheses in regard to the water used\nfor the culture, in regard to its quality and evaporation, which\nhave shown it to be on the order of 3mm/day. The chemical products\nnecessary for a culture are essentially sodium bicarbonate and sodium\nnitrate, as well as a certain number of mineral elements needed for\nall plant cultures. These are technical chemical products which\nare found in industry.\nThe carbon gas necessary for the culture is supplied by motors\nwhich operate the installation. The motors are basically-diesel\nmotors, generating sets and the gas turbine which serves to supply\nenergy for the atomizer. The combustion gases of these different\nmotors are recovered and sent into the culture. In other words,\nthe fuel discharge serves to supply both the energy and the carbon.\nUnder these conditions, we obtained a cost price of 1.36 fro 043\nper rg of dry algae.\nI can detail for you the different components which make up\nthe cost price.\nof cost price\n\t\n14.5\n-fuel\n\t\n15\n-chemical products\n\t\n8.5\n-labor\n3\n\na\n\n-legal depreciation\t\n-interest\t\n-maintenance\t\n-taxes - insurance\t\n\n33\n11.5\n14.5\n3\n\nOn the basis of all this, it is interesting to see where\nthe algae fits within the market.\nIt is necessary to speak of the market for a product of this\nkind, although one would first consider the utilization of this\nalgae in order to contribute to resolving the problem of hunger\nin developing countries. However, even in these countries, there\nis competition with other products and the algae will not be utilizable if it is too expensive,\nOn the other hand, to reach a sufficiently high level of development, substantial financial means are needed. It is, therefore,\nnecessary to interest both internationa ,. organizations and industry.\nl\nPresently international organizations devote most of their financial\nresources to the improvement of classical methods of animal and\nplant production. The portion of these resources used for new protein sources, oil yeasts or algae.* is extremely small.\nIt is necessary then to turn to industry; therefore, competition\nproblems arise.\nHaving made this point, what are the features of this algae?\nWe have said that it is an algae rich in proteins; it contains 65%\nprotein, and this makes it better than chlorella which generally\ncontains between 50 and 55/ protein.\nIn addition to protein, it contains glucides and some lipids;\nit also contains vitamins and some pigments, for example, xanthophyl which can be needed for certain uses.\n4\ni\n4\n\n4\t\n\n;.\n\nCu\n\nIt can be introduced in two different markets, that of animal 044\nfeeding and that of human feeding.\nAs far as animal feeding is concerned, presently the tendency\nis to feed animals industrially by giving them a balanced nutrition\nof proteins supplied essentially by soy flour or fish flour. The\ncost price of soy and fish flour expressed in francs per kg of protein\nvaries between one franc to one \t\n30, according to their origin.\nThe cost price of spirulines ieaches 2.10 francs per kg of proteins.\nTherefore: on the basis of its protein content, spiruline cannot compete with these products. On the other hand, the fact that it\npossesses certain pigments such as xanthophyls enables it to\ncompete in certain markets such as the poultry market, since\nxanthophyls tend to give a yellow color to poultry meat or egg\nyolks and these attributes are much in demand in certain countries.\nAs far as human nutrition is concerned, there is hope. Actually,\nprices for soy flour vary between 1.30 francs and 2.50 francs/kg\nof proteins and for fish meal between 2.50 francs and 3.50 francs.\nSpiruline can, therefore, become more competitive. On the commercial plane, this gives us a certain hope.\nAs far as nutrition is concerned, the quality of this algae\nis still to be explored. The protein value given by a chemical\nanalysis is not sufficient. And it must still be established\nhow these proteins are assimilated by the organism.\nPreliminary tests were carried out with algae cultures obtained\nin Var and Antibes. These tests were limited to specialized laboratories. They consisted in feeding a group of animals, rats\nor chicks, on the one hand, with a controlled well balanced food\nration and, on the other hand, with a ration identical to the controlled ration, specifically with the same amount of protein, but\nin which a portion of the protein of the control ration was substituted with the algae. Various criteria can be examined this\n5\n\nu\n\nway, for example, the weight gain of the animal in relation to the\namount of food it consumes. With more refined tests, we can determine the nitrogen balance, by measuring the amount of nitrogen retained by the organism .\nI can give you some figures for some of the tests that have\nbeen completed, For example, with chicks, the nitrogen balance\nhad a value of 50% for the nitrogen retained with spirulines, T-rriereas with a control ration based on soy this value is 409.\nTesting on animals is a first stage. If we want to use these 045\nproteins for human nutrition, it is obviously necessary to continue\ntesting on humans.\nIn this case, we must carry out the two types of tests described above. These tests should be carried out in specialized\ncenters such as hospitals and, generally, with infants.\nAnother kind of test which must be carried out is the acceptability test, since it is a well-known fact that, from the\nnutritional point of viewp acceptability is an extremely important\nnotion. We must be able, therefore, to introduce a new food product so that it is acceptable in the countries where it must be\nintroduced.\nI believe\nYou have just spoken of tests carried out in Chad. \t\nthat presently in Chad, tests are being carried out along these\nlines with the populations of Chad and with algae which has been\nobtained in natural waters.\nDiscussion\nMr. Robinet\n\nWe cannot say that there is anything new since the population 046\n6\n\nt.\n\nof the Kanem region has consumed these algae for a long time.\nThere are, however, two aspects, the side dish or nutritional\nsupplement aspect, traditional and without determinable origin, and\nthe famine aspect. Periodically, in Kanem, due to climatic reasons\nthere have been times when the millet harvest was bad and it was\nnecessary to supplement the food diet. We found that at these times\nthe rich people\'s granaries were quite full of millet, whereas the\npoor had nothing but these algae which they obtained from the sea.\nThis is obviously the origin of the dual character nutritional\nand supplementary, shown by the algae in the market. In the Kanem\nmarket, the nutritional aspect is dominant, whereas in the Fort\nLamy market, the supplementary aspect is dominant.\nPresently, I would like to speak about the diplomatic conflict\nwhich has originated between the Chad government on the one side\nand certain French organizations directly or indirectly represented\nin Chad. It seems that the Chad government does not want our\nhelp since it has never requested experts to assist it in resolving\na nutritional problem.\nActually, there is no nutritional problem endemic to Chad,\nexcept for classic deficiencies which can be seen in children at\nthe time of weaning. Their intestines do not adapt immediately\nto the large consumption of starchy foods of vegetable origin after\na diet of maternal milk. There is a phase when illnesses develop,\nsuch as the appearance of certain edemas.\nWe know that the government of Chad has, nevertheless, been\nsensitized to this question of the algae and that it has delegated to\nthe F.A.O. and to local experts, some sent by F.A.O,, others belonging\nto Chad organizations, the responsibility for collection and improvment of the product. Basically, this involves improvement of the drying process; since production is normally from the sea, the drying\n7\n\nprocess is not carried out any longer on the sand as we have seen\nin the film, but rather in baskets, on beds of leaves, or according\nto other procedures which make it possible to eliminate the high\namount of sand which lowers the nutritional value of the product.\nTests have also been carried out on animals.\t\n\n/047\n\nTo my knowledge, they are not to be carried out on man. They\nhave been done, they are known, they are constant.\nDuring periods of famine, poor people have resorted to this\nproduct that we call "die", while the rich use it in classical manner as a condiment, as a sauce, since these algae, due to their\ngelatin content, when oiled with meat or other food products, constitute a normal side dish with a certain nutritional value.\nThis is all I can concretely say on the subject.\nI want to pose the following question. In comparing the prices\nthat you have given us and adding that ruminants, which are the\nessential source of protein in these countries, are not its consumers\nit does riot seem advisable to give them this food product, since\nthey are cellulose transformers. We cannot transform cellulose and\nfind it transformed in consumable animal protein. Under these conditions, the chances of utilizing these algae proteins in the underdeveloped Sahel countries where cattle raising is practiced are\nextremely low. They are infinitely greater, more encouraging and\nrealistic, perhaps, in the countries where it is more possible to\nraise cattle or ruminants; this is the case of the coastal countries\nwhere tripanosodiasis prevents all extensive animal raising but does\nnot prevent intensive raising of cattle which consumes the industrial\nsub-products of agriculture. We can imagine, in the Ivory Coast, the\nconsumption of bananas which are not exported in the south of Chad,\nthe consumption of cotton meal on the condition that we can eliminate\ngossipol.\n8\n\n.\nWe can consider peanut consumption. There is an interminable\nlist of classical sources presently wasted and K>ub-products of agricultural or industrial food product origin wh , cli can be made the\nobject of an extremely economic transformation for cattle and ruminants, in -the form of a stock farming which is not extensive as\nin the Sahel but which is semi-intensive, both traditionally in\nfree range land, as in Madagascar, and indus ,\'L.-rially. All these\nprojects are based on ensilage, and the recovery of these sub-products on corn culture, on penicetol culture, btc.\nMs. Meye r\n\nThe culture of algae does not pretend obviously to take the\nplace of all these traditional sources. It is an alternative possibility which can be suitable for certain areas.\n048\n\nMr. Robinet\t\n\nI understand that. In the case of Chad, it is certain that\nthe physiological and sociological aspects of the use of these\nproducts do not come up, since it is not new.\nHowever, in Niger, where I have lived for a long time, I have\nnever seen the inhabitants consume such algae or import them from\nChad, because the standard of living of the population did not\nrequire resorting to this product. On the other hand, we must not\nthis is a product of famine,\nlose sight of the fact that in \t\nthat it is consumed when the famine creates a physiological need,\na protein. deficiency visible in the adult. It is also a supplement\nwhich complements a more or less balanced nutrition, but which the\ninhabitant of Chad does not necessarily need.\nMs. Meyer\n\nIt is clear as Mr. Moyse just explained, that the algae is not\n9\n\na particularly appetizing product. If one must choose between the\nalgae and another more appealing food product, he will choose the\nlatter.\nMr. Robinet\nThe\nwhen the\ntaste is\ndoes not\n\ntaste of the algae is not unappreciated, on the contrary,\nalgae is dried in these countries and consumed dry, its\nnot bad, since, given the long exposure to the sun, it\ndeteriorate.\n\nThis is one of its advantages. In periods of famine, those who\ncan store the algae can use them as a nutritional product instead of\na supplement.\nThis is all I can say regarding this question.\nMs. Clement\nI would like to add that we are in contact with Mr. Autret,\nwhom you certainly know, he is the director of the nutrition division\nof F,A.0. and he keeps us informed of all the new work and testing.\nMr. Robinet\nBased on this report, it does not seem that he anticipates a\ngreat future.\nMs._ Clement\n\n\t\n\n049\n\nFor the present, he does not anticipate any industrial utilization. Based on what he has said., he will not invest much money. For\nnow, he is content with carrying out tests among populations of different a es $ adults and young people, and of different social origins.\nIn the middle of December, 5,000 to 6,000 meals had already been\n10\n\nserved. The algae were sold in 250 g bags and it seems they were\neasily marketed.\nMr. Robinet\nYes, there is a market problem. As long as the market is not\nsaturated and prices remain within certain limits, namely within\nthe possibilities of the family budget, there is not doubt that in\nChad there will be no problem in placing this product on the market. The same cannot be said as far as the taste appeal of the product\nis concerned, when it is transported in the countries where there are\ngreat deficiencies, namely Congo Brazzaville, Minchasa, in those corners where there is a nutritional problem far greater than that of\nChad, but where this product has not been tasted.\nMs. Clement\nIn Asia or Latin, America for example. \t\n\n\'\n\nMr. Robinet\nI\'d rather not leave the framework of Africa, since I don\'t\nknow the other aspects of the question.\nIt is certain that in Africa, competitiveness between existing\nprotein sources, available in short or medium term, that is to say\nintensive stock farming in cities such as Abidjan, Dakar, Lagos,\nMinchasa and the possibility of introducing algae as a food product\ndo not favor the establishment of large African plants for the production of spirulines.\nMr. Mouse\nI think that among the questions that have been presented, Mr.\nRemenieras has proposed: relative position of protein derived from\n11\n\nn\n\ncultures of algae versus oil derivatives, technical and ecomonical\npoints of view.\nI don\'t know if very precise information is available regarding\nthe cost price.\nMs. Meyer\t\n\nZ250\n\nFrom the economic point of view, we can cite the price announded by the B.P. society.\nMr. Van Landeahem\nWith reservations, however. Economic calculations made at\nI.F.P. regarding cost prices of yeast leave an extremely wide\nmargin con:\'erning the valorization of the oil gas derived from the\nprocedure. The oil gas is dewaxed and proteins are produced. Based\non the valorization rate given to the dewaxing, we can establish\na high\nany cost price we want for the proteins. In other words, \t\none, as long as we don\'t know too well how the decision has been\nmade and what were its motives.\nMr. Delsol\nThi- is the typical and frequent problem regarding the cost of\nproducts which are related and for which the establishment of cost\nprice presents considerable difficulties.\nI think that the price announced by the B.P. society is on the\norder of about 0.70 francs per kg (compared with 1.36 francs).\nMr. Van Landeahem\nIt is still the same factor 20 There is no doubt, based on\nour predictions, that since I.F.Y. has developed a yeast procedure\n12\n\nthe yeasts will be marketed be t ter. How much better? We do not know\nexactly, because yeast production presents separation and drying\nproblems which are not found with algae. Specifically, there is\ngreat reticence among possible consumers regarding aromatics, noted\ncarcinogenic agents which will possibly remain in our product.\nMr. Moyse\n\nTrunk you very much Mr. Van Landeghem.\nDo you want to pose other questions?\nMr. Lenain\n\nI would like to ask a question regarding the nutritional medium\nyou use for your cultures.\nWhat is its basic chemical composition?\nMs. Meyer\n\n\t\n\n05s\n\ncannot give you exact figures. It is a medium characterized\nby a high level of sodium bicarbonate. It is, therefore, an alkaline\nmedium, with 9 to 9.5 pH.\nGenerally, the growth rate depends very little on the concentrations of the nutritional elements.\nThe nutritional medium can be composed, more or less as \'we wish.\nFor a better industrial culture, we have used a medium not highly charged in salts,but controlled by continuous readjustment of the\nconsumed salts. This method facilitates washing the algae when they\nare harvested.\nThe concentrations can be varied, These algae can withstand\n13\n\n3^ Vii.\t\n\n.^^^\t\n\n^\'}^\'\xc2\xb0-\t\n\n__\n\n\t\n\n..-.\n\nvery different salinities.\nMr. Lenain\nHave you used urea?\n\nMs. Meyer\nIt would be quite interesting to utilize urea, which costs^\xe2\x96\xba.ess\nthan nitrates. However, it presents problems due to the discharge\n\nof ammonia.\nMr. Mouse\nThere are pH and temperature limits which can never be exceeded\nwhen using urea.\nWith pH8 0 in particular, if the temperature exceeds 40 0 , there\nis decomposition with formation of ammonia damage to the plants.\nMr. Delsol\nT\'d like to ask some technological questions.\nHave you thought of using devices such as immersed combustion burners which make it possible to use liquid or gas fuels with high\nefficiency, since the bubbling of the combustion product makes it\npossible to stir directly the considered medium?\nMr. Van Landeahem\n\n\t\n\n052\n\nWe have not considered this. There are certain aspects of the\nproblem which have not been completely considered because the utilization of fuels that are very light or gaseous depends on how they\nare directed and the place where they must be introduced. This is why\n14\n\nthe estimate mentioned by Ms. Meyer was made on a relatively neutral\noil gas base, which can be found everywhere. Light fuels and gases\ninvolve heavy transportation. It is necessary to be situated near\na gas depot or oil field.\nFor the present, we have put these solutions aside.\nWith established plants in Algiers we have tried to use other\nfuel sources with more efficient uses.\nMr. Delsol\nIt is true that in the case of Algeria or other African countries\nwhere there are substantial oil and gas deposits for example natural\ngas, methane, the combustion of this methane in underwater burners\nseems rational and economic.\nOn the other hand, as Professor Moyse just indicated, it is\nnecessary to relate the productivity of the spirulines with insolation. Is it possible to measure the incidence of this insolation\nparameter and can we express productivity g /m 2/day as a function\nof light or insolation?\nMr. Moyse\nI think that, given growth rates the crop values you have per\nm2 and per day are more or less the same as -those obtained with\nchlorella and correspond to efficiencies based only on the light\nfraction, on visible radiations. Efficiencies must be on the order\nof 4 to 6/, corresponding to quantitative requirements of about 100\nquanta per molecule of assimilated carbon gas.\nMr. Trombe\nI would like to ask Mr. Moyse what is the maximum CO 2 which\n15\n\nIt -\n\nmust be introduced for maximum efficiency?\nMr. Moyse\nConsidering only internal restrictions constituted by the organism\' s capacity for photosynthesis, it is on the order of 0.1% in air.\nIn the liquid phase, taking into account the consumption rate and 053\nthe solubility factor, air injection is at about 1%, corresponding\nto an atmospheric equivalent of 0.1% since a substantial amount of\ngas does not dissolve.\nCirculation time is not sufficient due to the shallowness of\nthe cultures.\nMr. Delsol\nAs a result, the interest in underwater combustion burners.\nMs. Clement\nThe thermal problem is quite important. We had large basins,\n30 0 is right.\nMr. Trombe\nIf you had 40 0 , how would that be?\nMs. Clement\nNo, 40 0 is too much if the temperature is maintained permanently.\nMr. Van Landeahem\nThe covering of water droplets constitutes already a filter against infrared rays.\n16\n\nMr. Trombe\nThat alters the possible balance, especially in regard to\npolyethelene.\nMr. Moyse\nWould you like to ask other questions?\nIf you allow me, I would like to draw some conclusions.\nThese cultures originated from the need to create new nutritional\nalternatives in regions with agricultural potential.\nThey originated also from a desire to utilize better a form of\nenergy which is freely distributed and usually wasted.\nThe first problem which we encountered, as with all cultures, 054\nwas that of crop quality.\nThis problem of quality presents several aspects. First of all,\nthere is composition. These unicellular organisms have shown to be\ngood nutrients based on their high number of protein, greater\nin spirulines than in chlorellao They have also proved to be good supplements in those regions of the globe where food crops are products which are essentially carbohydrate. It is in the countries\nwith rice that these cultures may be of the most interest, since\nin these countries, it is quite difficult to obtain protein and vitamin supplements.\nIt is not for regions where people consume the algae, as the\nChad population, and where no deficiencies are manifested, as\nMs. Brandily has shown. On the contrary, it is for those regions\nwhere there are protein deficiencies, the Indies, the Far East,\nJapan; it is not by chance that the Japanese are interested in\n17\n\nchlorella.\nAnother problem is that of taste. It is a personal business.\nAs the I.F.P. engineers, I have gotten used to eating spirulines\nin Antibes; there isn\'t much to be said about it. It is not bad.\nObviously, if we had to choose between steak and algae,\nwe would not hesitate, but we must consider that not everybody\ncan afford steak everyday.\nIt must be noted that these cultures have a certain "Jules\nVerne" character. This is not meant in a derogatory way, on the\ncontrary. They are to be viewed within the framework of population\ngrowth, of the ever greater difficulty in finding usable surfaces\nand introducing economically feasible cultures on such surfaces or\nin the ground and, eventually, in water. The amount of lost water\nis partially recoverable and not as large as the amount of water lost\nwith cultures produced in the ground in semi-arid countries, where\ninfiltrations with evaporation constitute a very great source of\nwaste.\nIn reviewing the history of these cultures, thinking back to\n1948-49 to the first report in 1953 entitled "laboratory algae culture\nin pilot plant", we see that we have come a long way.\nEstimates made in 1955 by Arthur D. Little were, if I remember\ncorrectly, ten times greater as far as cost price is concerned than\nthose presently made.\nRegarding taste, what occurred with the potato can occur here.\nBefore Parmentier, the potato was already known in Europe. However,\nit was considered an inedible legume.\nNevertheless, it played a role in the lives of North Central 055\nEuropean countries. Among all the possible means which can be employed in fighting nutritional deficiencies; algae constitute one of\nthe most interesting ones. The starting point is mixed, agriculture\n18\n\nw\'\nand utilization of solar energy.\nWe still do not know the arrival point. What we can estimate\nis the progress within a period of 20 years.\nThe main progress has been made not through more powerful\ntechnology - the most powerful technology is that of Arthur D. Little\nand it led to failure - but through simplification by using organisms\nwhich are better adapted to readily available culture conditions and,\nprobably, by combining, as you have done with spirulines, the technical problems of the cultures, the supplying of carbon gas and light.\nFor the present, it is essentially an economic and technological\nproblem. The algae could serve as animal nutrition, although off\nhand this may seem a luxury (at least in my opinion). I think that\nthe true use of the organism will be as direct supplement for people\nwhose nutrition is unbalanced due to their high intake of carbohydrates.\nIn conclusion, I would like to thank everyone and in particular\nthe individuals and engineers of Institut Francais du Petrole,\nMr.Balaceanu to whom I would like you to communicate our thanks,\nfor having cooperated in this study session, Ms. Clement, Ms. Meyer,\nMr. Van Landeghem, without forgetting those who are absent and\nthinking of Mr. Rebeller, Mr.Trambouze and all those who have\ncarried out for a number of years these studies in Provence and\nAntibes, before continuing the project in Mexico and Algeria.\n\n19\n\n'
