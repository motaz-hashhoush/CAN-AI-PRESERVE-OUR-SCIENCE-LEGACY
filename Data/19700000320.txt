The nutating motor,\nFigure 1, consists of an output gear which is free to\nrotate only, and a nutating gear that is free to nutate\nor wobble only. The nutating gear is actuated by eight\nbellows around its periphery. When four adjacent bellows are pressurized, the nutating gear is tilted into\ncontact with the rotating gear. Sequencing the bellows\'\npressurization pattern causes the nutating gear to nutate. Since the nutating gear has 181 teeth, and the output gear 180 teeth, the output gear is forced to rotate\n2\xc2\xb0 for each nutation of the input gear.\nA flueric logic circuit, Figure 2, composed of 24\nflueric amplifiers was developed to control the nutating motor. The purpose of the logic circuit is to store\nthe actuator bellows\' pressurization pattern and to\nsequence it in either a forward or backward direction,\ndepending on the direction of the input command\npulses. Forward pulses enter the circuit at eight locations marked T f , and backward pulses enter the circuit at eight locations, T h . The outputs labeled A A\nto D D actuate power amplifiers which, in turn, provide high pressure and flow to the eight bellows of the\nnutating motor. The heavy lines in Figure 2 indicate\nthe signal lines which would be pressurized when bellows A, B, C, and D are pressurized. The application\nof one forward pulse to the eight T 1 ports would advance the pattern to A, B, C, and D.\nAn integrated version of the logic circuit was developed in which the entire flueric circuit was contained in a solid block 2 in. x 2 in. x 3 in. The block\nwas composed of copper laminates fused together by\ndiffusion bonding.\nTest results indicate that the flueric circuit could\ndrive the nutating motor at a speed of almost300 steps\n\nBellows\n\nGimbal\nRing\n\nOutpu\n\nOutput Gear\n\nDynan\n\nN utat i ng\nGear\nInlet Port\nto Bellows\n\nFigure 1.

The output torque at zero speed was approximately 80 in-lb.\nThe complete system constitutes a reliable, open\nloop actuator system with inherently high output stiffness, reasonable slewing speeds and small step size:\nAlthough the stepping motor uses more air than an\nequivalent piston actuator driven by a flapper valve,\nthis high air use might be accepted for some applications in order to gain simplicity, reliability and high\noutput stiffness.\n\nReferences:\n1.
