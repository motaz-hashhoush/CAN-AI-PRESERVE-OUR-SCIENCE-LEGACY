The height above\nthe limb and the brightness (reflectivity) of these clouds have been\ndetermined in a selected group of these images. Despite a number of\nconstraints, we attempted to find suitable images representing different seasons, phase angles, latitudes, longitudes, and filter colors.\nThis paper represents the results obtained from 57 Viking Orbiter\nimages. Graphs of the results illustrate the possible influence of\nvarious parameters.\nWe show normalized individual brightness profiles of three\nseparate traverses across the limb of each image. The most notable\nfinding is that some of these clouds can be very high. Many reach\nheights of over 60 km, and several are over 70 km above the limb.\nStatistically, the reflectivity of the clouds increases with phase\nangle. Reflectivity and height both appear to vary with season, but\nthe selected images spanned only one Martian year, so the role of\nseasons cannot be isolated. Limb clouds in red-filter images tend to\nbe brighter than violet-filter images, but both season and phase\nappear to be more dominant factors. Due to the limited sample available, the possible influences of latitude and longitude art less\nclear. The layering of these ^.louds ranges from a single layer to five\nor more layers. Reflectivity gradients range from smioth and gentle to\n\nW\t\n\n.\n\nV\n\nRT\xc2\xa3\nPage 4\n\nsteep and irregular. This study provides further evidence for a\nchangeable and complex Martian atmosphere.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nClouds on Mars have been observed for over a century using\nEarthbound telescopes. Dust storms, polar hoods, seasonal clouds,\ndiurnal zlouds, reoccurring clouds, cloud motions, hazes, dark clouds,\nand clouds visible only through blue or violet filters have been well\nknown and studied long before the earliest spacecraft flew.b; Mars\n(Slipher,\n\n1962; Capen, 1972).\n\nThe primary purpose in P r.rcival Lowell\'s\n\nfounding of his observatory was to study Mars; and in\n\n1969, when\n\nthe\n\nInternational Planetary Patrol was established at Lowell Observatory\n(Baum et al.,\n\n1970),\n\nthe primary purpose was to intensively photograph\n\nMars and thereby to increase our knowledge of these atmospheric\nphenomena. By establishing a network of observatories around our\nglobe, we were able to monitor Martian clouds continuously on a nearly\nhourly basis. Mariner\n\n9\n\nand the Viking Orbiters not only confirmed\n\nthese Earth-based observations but reaolved many smaller and fainter\nclouds (Briggs et al., 1\n\n977;\n\nFrench et al.,\n\n1981).\n\nMost of the\n\nbrightenings on Earth-based photographs that we had thought might be\nclouds were indeed clouds (Martin,\n\n1983). Mars\n\nis generally much\n\ncloudier than most astronomers had previously suspected.\n\n(+) I\nPage 5\n\nThe Viking Orbiters took a number of picturcz c.\xc2\xb0 the Martian limb\nand therefore provided an opportunity to investigate the vertical\ndistribution of clouds by observing them edge-on. More precisely, of\ncourse, we are viewing an overlaid stack of spherical shells in the\nMartian atmosphere, so the edge-on brightness at the limb does not\ndirectly represent the vertical distribution of scatte\xc2\xb0ing particles.\nTo obtain the latter, one must adopt a scattering theory (for example,\nLumme et al., i\'.18 1a), make assumptions about the horizontal uniformity\nof cloud layers, and perform an "inversion" of the observed edge-on\nlimb brightness profiles. The theory and the inversions a. , e not dealt\nwith in the present paper.\nThere vere several limitations in the data sample available. Only\na very small percentage of frames taken by the two orbiters included\nthe limb, and such frames were scheduled only sporadically during the\nmission. Moreover, many of the limb pictures were not usable for this\nstudy because the position of the limb could not be determined, the\nphase angle was too low, or the clouds were overexposed.\nOne of the main tasks in this study was to find out where the\nsurface limbs are, so that the heights of cloud layers could be\nspecified on a scale with a known zero point. In all limb frames the\nsurface limb is obscured by clouds or haze, and in most of the frames\na visual estimate of the surface limb locus could easily go wrong by\n10 or 20 km. The metho6 we chose for locating the surface limb beneath\n\nPage 6\n\nthe cloud blanket was based on measuring the positions of a number of\nforeground craters that were identifiable members of the control net\nestablished by Davies et al. (1978). This choice systematically\nexcluded the use of images over the polar caps. It also excluded\nimages taken over areas where the control net was sparse and those in\nwhich the control net craters were too small to be identifiabl y o n tye\nimage. And, of course, images could not be used if the clouds were too\ndense for foreground craters to be visible.\nMeasuring crater positions required specially processed images\nthat were geometrically corrected, and the limb traverses were derived\nfrom special-order computer tapes of geometrically corrected images\npurchased from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The cost of these tapes\nlimited the number of images we were able to select.\nBecause of the problems cited above, our data set is not ideal.\nIt was not possible to sample all combinations of phase angle, season,\nlatitude, longitude, and filter color. Nevertheless, the 57 images\nthat were successfully measured provide a wealth of information about\nthe Martian atmosphere.\n\nPage\n\n7\n\nPROCEDURES\nLocating the Limb\nCalculating, the precise locus of the obscured surface limb on\neach of the seleot a d images began with the identification of control\nnet craters (Davies et al.,\n\n1978; Davies, 1981, 1982)\n\non Jet Propul-\n\nsion Laboratory (JPL) Viking photographs. The centerpoint of each\nidentifiable control net crater was then measured on geometrically \t\n\nJ\n\ncorrected versions of those images. Those measurements were made\neither on gridded photographs (hard copy) or, in some cases, on our\nGrinnell image processor using magnetic tapes of the images to input\nto our DEC PDP-11/55 computer. The gridded photographs and the\nmagnetic tapes of geometrically corrected images were both furnished\nby JPL. Using either method, the measuring proved to be accurate but\ntedious.\nA computer program was developed to calculate the limb locus by\nmatching our crater position measurements with the longitudes and\nlatitudes assigned to them by Davies. We adopted the SEDR height of\nthe spacecraft at the moment of exposure and an assumed radius for\nMars\n\n(3385 km),\n\nwhile permitting other SEDR parameters, such as the\n\nlongitude and latitude of the sub-spacecraft point, to float.\nThis computer program was extensively tested and refined by using\nit on an image (profile set no.\n\n20) that\n\nwas relatively cloud-free and\n\nwhose surface limb locus could be visually estimated quite closely on\n\n-0Page 8\n\nthe gridded photograph. The computer program and its underlying\nassumptions evolved through a series of trial variations whose\nrelative meriL3 were ,judged by comparing the computed limb to that\nseen on the test image.\nIn each image, before doing a least-squares fit to the controlnet craters, a preliminary check was performed on the data. The pixel\ndistance from each crater to every other crater was calculated and\ncompared with the control-net values. If a crater was strongly\ndiscordant\n\nwiL?, the rest, it was rejected.\n\nSome of the selected images had more than 40 usable control\ncraters, while two images had as few as nine. Of course, tiie accuracy\nof the limb is higher for images having a larger number of welldistributed control net craters. Data from images that include large\nchanges in elevation may be affected by factors that are not taken\ninto account by the program. Nevertheless, we believe that the maximum\nerror in the limb locus is no more than 5 km for any image and that\nthe average error is probably less than 2 km. The profiles of the limb\ntraverses (Figures 12-27) appear to confirm this level of accuracy.\n\nProfiles Across the Limb\nThe Lowell computer, image processor, and plotter were used to\nconstruct the profiles in Figures 12-27. These were derived from\n\n7DC\n\nPage 9\n\nmagnetic tapes of the Viking Orbiter images that had been specially\nprocessed at JPL to include shading correction and geometric\ncorrection but were otherwise raw copies of the originals. Unlike the\nphotographic prints used for measuring craters, they did not include\nhigh pass filtering or gridding.\nIn each image, three traverses were made perpendicular to the\nlimb, extending from empty sky background to points well inside the\nlimb. These three traverses were typically on the order of 100 km\napart at the limb. (Five traverses were made on image 37.) Raw\nprofiles were constructed using interpolated pixel values along the\ntraverse. These raw profiles were then brought to common scales in\nboth dimensions. The horizontal scale is in kilometers up from the\nlimb based upon the image scale at the limb fnr each image. The\nvertical scale is reflectance calculated from the solar constant,\nfilter factors, exposure times, gain settings, vidicon calibrations,\nand distances from the Sun.\nAboard the Viking orbiters, the output signal of each of the\nvidicon camera systems was approximately linear with light input, but\nthere was a bias level (or "pedestal") such that the output was\nroughly 20 of full scale at zero light input. Ordinarily, an "offset"\nwas subtracted from the signal with the intention of canceling this\npedestal before the output was transmitted to the Earth. But drifts in\nthe electronics resulted in a slight over-subtraction during most of\n\n4^\n\nPage 10\n\nthe mission, causing low light levels to be clipped and irretrievably\nlost. To avoid losing faint limb clouds, most limb frames were\nobtained with a special uplinking command that inhibited the offset\nand permitted the full signal to be transmitted. Thus, most of our\nlimb profiles are valid all the way out to the faintest limb clouds.\nWithin our data set, there are six cases (namely, images 24-28, and\n47) when the offset was not inhibited. For them, the peak\nref?PCtivities quoted to Table I may be slightly too low and the\nheights of the highest clouds may be substantially underestimated.\n\nTo b^^ I\nThe values given in Table I for maximum reflectance and for\nlatitude and longitude of the limb were generated by the computer,\nwhereas the heights of the highest clouds were determined by visual\ninspection of the profiles. When high, thin cloud layers were close to\nthe noise level of the sky, their reality was checked by inspection of\ncontrast-enhanced images on the Grinnell display monitor.\n\nIn Table I the images are listed and numbered in chronological\norder but divided into two sets so that Viking Orbiter 1 images are\nlisted first (1-37), followed by Viking Orbiter 2 (38-57). The letters\n\n"A" and "B" in the Viking Picno (picture numbers) indicate which\nspacecraft (1 or 2) took the picture. The first three digits of this\n\nD1\n\n^\n\ns\t\n\nPage 11\n\nnumber refer to the revolution numt , -r of the spacecraft, while the\nlast two digits are frame numbers within that orbit, in chronological\norder. Martian season is indicated by L s , which is the areocentric\nlongitude of the Sun measured eastward from its vernal equinox. This\nparameter is also the horizontal scale in Figures 3 and 4.\nThe individual profiles within each frame are designated "a,"\n"b," and "c." Although the order was arbitrary, profile "bit\ngenerally the middle one, and it was always used to generate the plots\nfor Figures 4-11. In cases where two oi , more pictures covered the same\narea, no attempt was made to cross the limb at the same points on\nprofiles from those images. The profiles appear in Figures 12-27, but\nthe numerical order was modified to cry to minimize the number of\nfigures and to group similar cases. In the case of seasonal group C\n(defined in Figure 3), the red-filter images are on one figure, while\nthe violet are on another.\n\n1\'1314.0\nRESULTS\nCorrelations\nFigures 2-11 consist of one map and ten diagrams showing where\ncorrelations may or , may not exist among various parameters associated\nwith the 57 sele^ted images. Within the limitations of the sample, we\ncompare latitude, longitude, season, phase angle, filter color,\n\n-11\n\n4\n\nPage 12\n\nreflectivity of the limb clouds and thei r maximum heights. Some of\nthese diagrams suggest relationships, whereas others suggest that no\nconclusions :an be drawn. Our comments are in the captions.\n\nSeasonal Groupings (Figure 3)\nGroup A is mid-fall in the southern hemisphere. It is represented\nby images 32-36 (Figure 21). These five images have very low phase\nangles, which probably account for their low reflectances. Images 32\nand 33 have the lowest phase angles in this ,zudy. Other parameters\nsuch as season and areographic location were less significant. Clouds\nbeyond the limb that show on limb frames having larger pease angles\nwould have been in darkness on these pictures since the terminator was\njust beyond the limb.\nGroup B includes images 1-30 plus 37, which span L s 85 0 S L s ^\n\n1350\xe2\x80\xa2 This was from the end of northern spring to the middle of\nnorthern summer on Mars. Viking infrared thermal data showed that the\nMartian atmosphere was relatively free of dust during this period\n(Martin, 1981b). Images 1-12 have limbs between\n\n30 0 and 50 0 north,\n\nwhereas the remainder of the group is in the southern hemisphere. 1,\nimages in Group B were taken from Viking Orbiter 1. Red frames\nobtained during this Martian season tended on average to yield higher\nreflectivity values than violet frames. Profile 37d includes the\n\n.r. * if" ..

Images\n\n38-115\n\ninclude three red-filter\n\nframes (Figure 22) and five violet-filter frames (Figure 23). These\nare the earliest pictures selected from Viking Orbiter 2. As a group,\nthey span less than three weeks\' time, and all have phase angles\nbetween 71\n\n0\n\nand 79\xc2\xb0. Furthermore, they all face to the west of north,\n\nalthough to -varying degrees. Both the red and violet images selected\nfor this season can be character!zed as having great cloud heights\n(from 60 to over 70 km). The violet images have low reflectances,\n+a\nwhereas the red-filter images have moderate reflectances (Figure 4).\nThe red-filter images from Seasonal Group C are widely separated in\nlongitude, although only 10 0 apart in latitude (Figure 2). :.11 have\nhigh multilavered clouds above a heavily obscured limb.\nCroup D is in southern summer, following the two planetencircling dust storms of 1977 (Briggs et al., 1979). The locations of\ntriages 46-57 are scattered throughout the southern. hemisphere (Figure\n2). They were taken through red filters; and, except for no. 31, were\nfrom Viking Orbiter 2. Ali except nos. 47 and 31 have high\nreflectances. The images in this group fall into one of two subgroups\nbaeed upon the height of their limb clouds (Figure 4). Four of the\nfive in the subgrG up of lower heights have limbs at areocentric\nlongitudes between 55 0 and\n\n90 0 ,\n\nwhereas the other "D\'s" are outside\n\no ^^\nJ\n\nPage 14\n\nthis range. (No. 31 is the exception, perhaps because of its low phase\nangle and/or because, unlike the others, it faces west.) In the final\nsix images, the image to the south is the more distinctly layered\nmember of each pair. Nos. 56 and 57 have the highest cloud\nreflectivity in their seasonal group.\n\nIndividual Profiles\nMuch of the resulting information may be gleaned from the\nbrightness profiles of clouds in individual images and is not\ndependent on statistics based on incomplete sampling. For this reason,\nan appendix has been included, consisting of notes on many of the\nprofiles that are plotted in Figures 12 through 27. These notes have\nbeen written to avoid repetition and to use individual profiles as\nexamples of phenomena that often apply to other cases as well.\nTheoretical interpretation (Lumme et al., 1981b) of the profiles has\nbeen dealt with separately.\n\nr\',9,s,mss "2-.27\n\nSUMMARY\nClouds on Mars were commonly found up to maximum heights between\n\n35 and 70 km above the limb. Leovy et al. (1972) found cloud layers\nnearly this high using Mariner 9 data, but during the 1971 dust storm.\n\nPage 15\n\nFrench and Taylor ( 1981 ) found evidence for inversion layers at similar altitudes from data derived from the occultation of\n\nE\n\nGeminorum by\n\nMars. Snyder (1979) reported that Barnes had found some clouds to be\n80 km high, based upon shadow measurements. Some time periods seem\nmore likely to have higher clouds than others. These periods may\ndenote seasonal changes, but our sample was not comprehensive enough\nto determine that. Maximum cloud heights appear to correlate with\nlatitude and longitude, but we are unable to say how repeatable that\ncorrelation might be at other times. " study by French et al. (1981)\ncompared cloud locations found by Mariner S and by Viking during\nsimilar seasons of different Martian years Although the sampling was\nuneven in both cases, their maps seem to show a difference between\nyears that is greater than seasonal differences. Extremely low phase\nangles probably also have an effect on apparent cloud detestability\nand therefore on apparent maximum cloud height.\nThe reflectances of limb clouds also vary with time and possibly\nseason. Phase angles, however, appear to be the predominant variable,\nespecially on violet-_ \xe2\x80\xa2 ilter images. The relationship between reflectances ai,d heights of limb clouds also changes with time and probably\nwith other variables, as well. In most cases, the reflectances\ndecreased as the profiles crossed above the limb; however, exceptions\nare seen on figure no. 15.\nThe profiles of individual images and groups of images are\n\n!!00&\n\nPage 16\n\ninformative, showing a wide variation in cloud structure and\ncomplexity. The color comparisons demonstrate that the composition of\nthe clouds is not homogeneous: color differences have been commonly\nused to determine which clouds are dust and which are condensates\n(Huguenin and Clifford, 1982). Although it may still be impossible to\ndetermine how much is dust, how much is water, and how much is CO,,\nthe photometric properties of these clouds can be used for theoretical\ninterpretation (Baum et al., 1977; Lumme et al., 1981). Non-limb\nViking pictures and Earth-based photography also show differences when\nclouds are imaged through different colored filters, so that such\ndifferences are not unexpected on the limb pictures (Briggs et al.,\n1979; Capen, 1972; Martin, 1976, 1981a). They merely added a new\ndimension to these differences.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe wish to thank the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which provided\nthe Viking materials necessary for this project.

------\n\n{\n\nW\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nImages 1 and 2 (Figure 12). The 4-km-greater height given for\nviolet image no. 2 over no. 1 (red) in Table I is die to a tenuous\nupper layer invisible in red and barely detectable on the violet\nimage.\n\nImages 4-6 (Figure 13). It is less than 20 km from 6a to 6c, since the\nframe included only a short section of the limb. Traverse 4a falls\nbetween 6a and b.\nImages 4 and 6 are the farthest north of the selected images.\nBoth the peaks and troughs of the upper cloud layer lie higher in the\nviolet profiles than in their red counterparts. If real, this would\nmean that the clouds are not homogeneous in color. We have seen cloud\ncolor gradients in more vertical views from both Viking and Earthbased\nphotography, so this phenomenon should not be unexpected in limb views\n(Martin 1976, 1981a).\nThe gradation of cloud heights seen on profiles 4a through 4c\ncontinues with 5c through 5a. Note that, of the first six frames, nos.\n\n3 (violet) and 5 (red) have the higher clouds. They differ in time by\nthree days, but both show areas to the south and east of the other\n\nAPPENDIX continued.\n\n\t\n\nPage 25\n\nfour images. This was one of several instances suggesting more\ncorrelation with location than with time.\n\nImages 7-9 (Figure 14). The order of the profiles is arbitrary: 7a is\nin the same direction from the center of the limb as 8c and 9c. The\ndifference between the reflectances of images 8 (red) and 9 (violet)\nis greater than between other red/violet pairs, except nos. 29 and 30\n(Figure 4).\n\nImages 13-16 (Figure 16). These four images have less reflectance than\nthe earlier twelve images, which had slightly higher phase angles as\nwell as being in the northern hemisphere. Figures 5 and 6 suggest that\nphase is the more dominant variable.\n\nImages 21 (Figure 17). The limb position for no. 21 is probably\nincorrect by about 2 km due to the limb being very near to the center\nof the image; that situation affects the accuracy of the computer\nprogram that determines the limb. Several other images whose centers\nwere off the limb were rejected from the study. We believe the peaks\nof these profiles should coincide approximately with the limb.\n\nAPPENDIX continued. \t\n\nPage 26\n\nImage 22 (Figure 17). The bright layer 15 km above the limt on image\n22 is one of the two cases where red-filter images were found to have\napper layers of clouds with greater reflectances than those recorded\nat the limb. The other case is profile 55b. This also occurs on\nseveral violet images.\n\nImage 23 (Figure 18). Like several other violet images, these profiles\nincrease in reflectance going from the planet\'s center toward the limb\nand then level off at the limb. On 23c the peak reflectance is greater\nthan seen at the limb. :among the selected violet-filter images, 23a\nand 23b are the only profiles with reflectances above 0.5 at the limb.\n\nImages 24-25 (Figure 18); Images 26-27 (Figure 19). The shapes of the\nprofiles indicate major differences in the structure of the limb\nclouds. Image 24 has a very bright upper layer with a large gap\nbetween it and the clouds at the limb, while 25 has a more uniform\nband of clouds above the limb in which layering is only minor.\nBoth 25 and 26 are of areas more to the north than 24 and 27, and\nboth show less layering than their more southerly counterparts. The\ntwo pairs are separated from each other by more than 100 0 of longitude\nand six days in time. The multiple layers on traverse 27c produced the\nmost aawtoothed profile of the entire study. Both nos. 26 and 27 have\n\n_:\'\n\nJ* 11\n\nAPPENDIX continued.\n\n\t\n\nPage 27\n\ngreater reflectances above thi limb than at the limb.\nThe camera signal offset was not inhibited on images 24-27,\npossibly affecting the profiles as discussed earlier in this paper.\n\nImage 28 (Figure 19). The height of these limb cloud tops is the\nlowest among the selected violet images. However, the existence of\nhigher clout\' layers cannot be ruled out; if faint, they may have\nfailed to be detected because the camera signal offset was not\ninhibited for this exposure. Error in the calculated location of the\nsurface limb (based on 12 craters in this fram\xc2\xb0) could also play a\nrole, but probably a minor one.\n\nImages 29 and 30 (Figure 20). Of the selected red/violet pairs, these\nhave the greatest differences in reflectance. Image 29 has the largest\nreflectance of those measured and also has the highest phase angle of\nthe selected red-filter images (Figure 6). These images cover\nlatitudes that are known to encompass dust storm activity (Martin,\n1974, 1976).\n\nImage \xe2\x80\xa2? 1 (Figure 20). This Viking Orbiter 1 image was taken 50 minutes\n\n^^, .two\n\nAPPENDIX continued.\t\n\nPage 28\n\nearlier on the same day that Viking Orbiter 2 took image 57. They show\nneighboring areas of Mars but were taken in nearly oppo:.ite directions\n(Figure 2). We suggest that difference in phase angle is the primary\nreason for the large differences in reflectance between nos. 31 and 57\n(Figure 7). This possibly can also acco:int for the 17 km difference in\nheight as well. No. 31 has the greatest cloud height of any image\nselected with a low phase angle. The limb positions for no. 31 could\nbe inexact because only nine control point craters were usable, but\nthat error probably is no more than 5 km.\n\nImages 32 and 33 (Figure 21). The individual profiles 32a-c and 33a-c\nIllustrate the effects of very small changes in either phase angle\nand/cr latitude. The "a" prefilez, nave the higher phase angles and are\nfurther north, whereas the "c" profiles have the lower phase angles\nand are further south. On both images there is a definite progressive\ndecrease in reflectance but only minimal\n\nchanges in height as the\n\ntravE,ses both moved toward the south and their phase angles\ndecreased.\n\nImages 34 and 35 (Figure 21). This is the only red/violet pair in\nwhich the violet profiles peak in reflectance at the limb while the\n\nW\n\nAPPENDIX continued.\t\n\nPage 29\n\nred profiles slope down in reflectance as they cross the limb. The\nprofiles portray the greatest height differences between all selected\ncolor pairs (12 to 27 km).\n\nImage 36 (Figure 21). This is the most southerly image in this study.\nThe phase angles are less than for the above pair, and the individual\nprofiles have progressively smaller phase angles as they increase in\nsoutherly latitude, from "a" to "C." Profile 36c is one case where\nboth the cloud height and reflectivity decrease with a minor decrease\nin phase; however, the latitude could be a controlling variable.\n\nimage 37 (Figures 1 and 22). The limb clouds shown on the Figure 1\nphotograph are possibly the most spectacular in appearance that were\nrecorded during the entire Viking mission and show more variation than\nany of the other selected pictures. They are relatively low in\nreflectivity and vary in height from 25 to 57 km above the limb. This\nis chronologically the last frame in this study and the only one that\nextends beyond the first Martian year of the mission (southern Martian\nwinter). It is the only selected picture that faces almost directly\nsouth (Figure 2).\nProfi:.e 37d traverses the brightest part of the clouds, with "b"\n\nAPPENDIX continued.\n\n\t\n\nPage 30\n\nand "e" close by on either side. No. 37a is east of the main cloud\n(left on Figure 1), while "c"\n\nIs\n\nto the west of it.\n\nImage 43 (Figure 23). From 20 km below the limb to 20 km above the\nlimb, these are the flattest profiles of this study.\n\nImage 44 (Figure 22). Only n\'_ne control craters were used for\ndetermining the limb position.\n\nImage 46 (Figure 24). This picture is the furthest south in Seasonal\nGroup D and is the only selected image south of 45 0 to show cloud\nheights above 50 km.\n\nImage 47 (Figure 24). This frame has both lowest reflectances and\nlowest heights of the selected images in this season (D). This can\nprobably be attributed to underexposure of the limb clouds and\npossibly because the camera signal was offset, as mentioned earlier in\nthis paper. These profiles should be compared to those on Figure 21,\nwhich were also weak but due to low phase angles, rather than\n\nXj\nAPPENDIX continued.\t\n\nPage 31\n\nunderexposure. The shape of the no. 47 profiles gives a bolder\ndefinition to the limb clouds, whereas the Figure 21 profiles portray\nclouds that fade as they rise above the limb. The only profiles that\nlock even slightly similar to no. 47 are those of no. 28, which also\nmay have been affected by camera signal offset.\n\nImage 49 (Figure 25). The brighter clouds go up to only about 35 km\nabove the limb, but with another prominent layer above it that peaks\nnear 40 km. Higher but fainter upper layers appear irregular,\ndisconnected, and difficult to resolve within the noise.\n\nImages 50 and 51 (Figure 25). In this case we believe that the\nlocation on Mars is the primary variable between these same-day\nimages, even though they are not far apart. No. 50 looks across Vallis\nMarineris toward the northwest, whereas no. 51 shows an area to the\nsoutheast. The canyon appeared to have been filled with bright clouds,\npossibly similar to the morning hazes discussed by Briggs et al.\n(1977). These two images differ in cloud height by 14 km but have\nnearly the same reflectances.\n\n.:J\n\nAPPENDIX continued. \t\n\nPage 32\n\nImages 52 and 57 (Figure 26). This pair of images boasts the highest\n\nlimb clouds recorded in the study. The highest cloud is on no. 52c at\n74 km, with no. 53b just 2 km lower.\n\nImage\n\n55 (Figure 27). Profile 55b is an example of a reflectance peak\n\nabove the limb that has more reflectance Chan seen at the limb. See\nimage 22 profiles for the only other clear case of this phenomena.\nAlthough the profiles are generally flat at the limb, there is a\ndistinct trough just below the limb on\n\n55c that is believed to be a\n\ncrater or other topographic feature. On the other hand, the trough\nabove the limb on the same profile represents a break between cloud\nlayers.\n\nImages\n\n55 and 57 (Figure 27). The final pair was taken just 4 minutes,\n\n8 secciir-i apart. These limb cloud differences are assumed to be due\nprimarily to their widely separated locations on Mars. The upper layer\nof clouds shown on the no. 56 profiles is the most prominent amongst\nthe selected images in terms of having the deepest drop in reflectance\nbeneath its peaks. Image 57 has a notably higher reflectivity than no.\n56 and second only to no. 29, which is both facing in the same\nigure 2).\n\nPage 33\n\nFIGURE CAPTIONS\n\nFigure 1. This example photograph illustrates an assortment of limb\ncloud forms. As a single image, it is not really typical of the limb\npictures used in this study, since none of the others has such a\ncomplex cloud pattern on the horizon. The circles denote the control\ncraters that were measured to determine the locus of the surface limb.\nThe large crater in the foreground is Herschel. This is image no. 37\nof this study. Its limb cloud profiles appear on Figure 22.\n\nFigure 2. The tips of the pointers are the limb locations of all the\nimages used for this study. These pointers also indicate the\ndirections from which the Viking orbiters viewed those lints. The\nnumbers of overlapping images have been omitted: No. 1 includes no. 2,\nno. 4 includes no. 6, no. 7 includes nos. 8 and 9, no. 10 includes\nnos. 11 and 12, no. 13 includes no. 15, no. 14 includes no. 16, no. 17\nincludes no. 20, no. 29 includes no. 30, no. 32 includes no. 33, and\nno. 34 includes no. 35. The base map is from the Lowell Observatory\nMap Series (Inge, 1973).\n\nFigure\n\n3. The\n\nlatitude distribution of limbs investigated in this\n\nstudy. Earth-calendar months are shown on the abscissa, starting near\nthe beginning of the orbital mission and ending more than two years\n\nPage 34\n\nlater. Martian seasons are shown across the top in terms of L. .\nBecause of the bunched distribution of the selection, we have grouped\nthe images into seasons lettered "A" through "D." Note that "A" was\nassigned to the numerical beginning of the Martian year (vernal\nequinox). Sea3on B includes parts of two Martian years.\n\nFigure 4. Limb cloud reflectances and maximum heights are plotted\nagainst Martian season, represented by L s . As on Figure\n\n3, they\n\nare in\n\nchronological order, with Earth-calendar months shown across the\n:.ottom. The values used are those for the "b" profile for each image.\nSee Table I for the values for all of the profiles. Image 37 has the\nwidest range of values for both height and reflectance. As a general\nrule, the difference between reflectances in red/violet pairs\nincreases with greater total values in reflectance.\n\nFigure 5. The dependence of reflectance upon phase angle for violetfilter images. All of the violet-filter data are plotted together in\nthis figure, because no evidence is seen for a seasonal variation like\nthat found in the red-filter data plotted in Figures 6 and 7. The five\nimages from Seasonal Group C ire clumped together near 78\xc2\xb0 phase,\nproviding an example of the effects of weak distribution of the\nselection.\n\nPage 35\n\nFigure 6. The dependence of reflectance upon phase angle for redfilter images during the half of the Martian year when 0 0 < Ls a 1800.\nThis plot more closely resembles the violet-filter plot in Figure 5\nthan it does the red-filter plot for the other half of the Martian\nyear shown in Figure 7.\n\nFigure 7. The dependence of reflectance upon phase angle for redfilter images during the half of the Martian year when 180 0 < Ls <\n360 0 . This sample largely represents the "dust storm season" of a\nparticular Martian year. All but three points in this diagram were for\nlocations in the southern hemisphere. Figures 5-7 suggest plausible\nphase functions, but one must bear in mind that effects due to\nlatitude, longitude, and season (except for the division into Figures\n6 and 7) remain buried in these data and are not random with phase\nangle.\n\nFigure 8. Heights of cloud tops plotted against phase angles. The "D"\nseason has been outlined only to identify points by season. This\noutline is not intended to suggest any correlations. The four points\nmarked "high latitude" are all south of -52 0 latitude; three of these\npoints also are from the images having the lowest phase angles.\n\nFigure 9. Cloud reflectance versus latitude. North and south latitudes\n\nPage 36\n\nare superimposed in this figure and in Figure 10. The northern\nhemisphere was poorly represented in our sample (see Figures 2 and 3),\nbut no systematic difference between hemispheres was apparent.\n\nFigure 10. Heights of cloud tops versus latitude. See the caption for\nFigure 9 for additional applicable comments.\n\nFigure 11. Comparing the reflectance with cloud-top heights, we see\nthat higher is not always brighter. The "C" season data are\nidentified, because the points for that season are clustered in one\ncorner of this diagram.\n\nFigure 12. Revolution 5A. Images 1 and 2 overlap. (One of 11 overlapping red/violet pairs.) Image 3 adjoins them.\n\nFigure 13. Revolution 8A. Images 4 and 6 overlap; image 5 adjoins\nthem, but the order of profiles is reversed: 5c is next to 4c.\n\nFigure 14. Revolution 22A.
