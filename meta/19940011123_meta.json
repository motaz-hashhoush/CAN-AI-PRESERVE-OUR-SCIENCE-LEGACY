The NASA CDSLR Network is in the process of upgrading station computer resources with HP UNIX workstations, designed to automate a wide range of operational station requirements. The primary HP upgrade objective was to relocate computer intensive data system tasks from the controller computer to a new advanced computer environment designed to meet the new data system requirements. The HP UNIX environment supports fully automated real time data communications, data management, data processing, and data quality control. Automated data compression procedures are used to improve the efficiency of station data communications. In addition, the UNIX environment supports a number of semi-automated technical and administrative operational station tasks. The x window user interface generates multiple simultaneous color graphics displays, providing direct operator visibility and control over a wide range of operational station functions.", "title": "HP upgrade operational streamlining", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T18:47:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19940011123, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Edge, David R."}, "organization": {"name": "Bendix Field Engineering Corp.", "location": "Seabrook, MD, United States"}}, "id": "7ea4d1965f3a43918d0c6c232477d173"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19940011123, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Emenheiser, Kenneth S."}, "organization": {"name": "Bendix Field Engineering Corp.", "location": "Seabrook, MD, United States"}}, "id": "d6497983b43a4395a2ec8b79eee4ea5c"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19940011123, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Hanrahan, William P., III"}, "organization": {"name": "Bendix Field Engineering Corp.", "location": "Seabrook, MD, United States"}}, "id": "9b765ecbea244af9a59c58a7ecb3ab74"}, {"sequence": 3, "submissionId": 19940011123, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Mccollums, D."}, "organization": {"name": "Bendix Field Engineering Corp.", "location": "Seabrook, MD, United States"}}, "id": "4d2b06d87ec54ede83e785c2fe880d3e"}, {"sequence": 4, "submissionId": 19940011123, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Seery, Paul J."}, "organization": {"name": "Bendix Field Engineering Corp.", "location": "Seabrook, MD, United States"}}, "id": "bda74df3459148f9985f03ca8b6f0264"}, {"sequence": 5, "submissionId": 19940011123, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Ricklefs, Randall L."}, "organization": {"name": "McDonald Observatory", "location": "Austin, TX., United States"}}, "id": "425a1caaf9784fd3bf8a80998910f3d1"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19940011123, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19940011123, "id": "675ff9d735b04840b87b3362be45f1e7", "publicationName": "NASA.
