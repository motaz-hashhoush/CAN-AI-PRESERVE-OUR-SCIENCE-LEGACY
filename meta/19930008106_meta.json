Figure 1 shows three popular hybrid propulsion cycles that are under current consideration. NASA MSFC has teamed with industry to test two hybrid propulsion systems that will allow scaling to motors of potential interest for Titan and Atlas systems, as well as encompassing the range of interest for SEI lunar ascent stages and National Launch System Cargo Transfer Vehicle (NLS CTV) and NLS deorbit systems. Hybrid systems also offer advantages as moderate-cost, environmentally acceptable propulsion system. The objective of this work was to recommend a performance prediction methodology for hybrid rocket motors. The scope included completion of: a literature review, a general methodology, and a simplified performance model.", "title": "Hybrid rocket performance", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T17:49:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19930008106, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Frederick, Robert A., Jr."}, "organization": {"name": "Alabama Univ.", "location": "Huntsville, AL, United States"}}, "id": "e5232d6e0cca4bd386192e284ac3ae5e"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19930008106, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19930008106, "id": "294d9d66d5024950940f06cd82b6f954", "publicationName": "Alabama Univ., 1992 NASA(ASEE Summer Faculty Fellowship Program", "publicationDate": "1992-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19930008090, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "1992 NASA/ASEE Summer Faculty Fellowship Program", "stiType": "CONTRACTOR_REPORT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19930008106.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19930008106/downloads/19930008106.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19930008106/downloads/19930008106.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19930008106/downloads/19930008106.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
