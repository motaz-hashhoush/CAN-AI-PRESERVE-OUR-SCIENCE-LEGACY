For years, astronauts have attempted to describe their experience in space and how they see the Earth roll by below their spacecraft. Thousands of crew photographs have documented natural features as diverse as the dramatic clay colors of the African coastline, the deep blues of the Earth's oceans, or the swirling Aurora Borealis of Australia in the upper atmosphere. Dramatic recent improvements in handheld digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) camera capabilities are now allowing a new field of crew photography: night time-lapse imagery.", "title": "Seeing Earth Through the Eyes of an Astronaut", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2015-03-27T17:06:27.7970000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20150003826, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Dawson, Melissa"}, "organization": {}}, "id": "3796d2ef5d4c4dc393ae907e1d3728fa"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "id": 20150003826, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20150003826, "id": "4ad98a819c144682bc111c6df3eca164", "publicationName": "ARES Biennial Report 2012 Final", "publicationDate": "2014-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20140011750, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "ARES Biennial Report 2012 Final", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20150003826.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20150003826/downloads/20150003826.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20150003826/downloads/20150003826.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20150003826/downloads/20150003826.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
