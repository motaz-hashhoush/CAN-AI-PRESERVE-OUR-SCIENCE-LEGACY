This exposure was 2.5 times longer than the original discovery observation. In addition, a shorter 4,000 s exposure was made in October 1992, simultaneously with a GRO observation of Geminga, in order to verify the absolute phasing of the X-ray and gamma-ray peaks. We verified that the spectrum can be described as the sum of two black bodies, whose temperatures are 6 x 10(exp 5) K and 3 - 4 x 10(exp 6) K, with the latter covering 3 x 10(exp -5) the area of the former. The pulse profiles indicate that the intensity of the two emitting regions peak is approximately 90 deg out of phase in rotation, but that the temperatures are otherwise independent of phase. An improved estimate of the distance can be made from the cooler (larger) blackbody component, yielding d = 440 +/- 120 pc. Another program of this report was to obtain PSPC spectra of an important class of Seyfert galaxies which have narrow lines and stron permitted Fe II emission. Sometines called I Zw 1 objects, or narrow-line Seyfert 1s, they are crucial to our understanding of Seyfert classification and models of Seyfert unification. We observed four new objects and, in addition, obtained data on 17 more from the ROSAT archive. A third program combined PSPC and HRI observations of selected Seyfert galaxies which have unusual and variable spectra. The purpose was to disentangle diffuse X-ray emission from the nuclear source, in order to properly interpret the soft X-ray spectral shapes in terms of partial covering and/or warm-absorber models. The targets of the program are NGC 3516, NGC 3227, and NGC 7314. So far, we have only performed a dtailed analysis on NGC 3516. The fourth program of this report is the NGC 1672, the second brightest Seyfert galaxy and one or the original 'composite' Seyfert/starburst galaxies which have evidence for both Seyfert activity and H II regions in their optical spectra. It is one of the lowest luminosity Seyfert 2 galaxies that can be studied in detail.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19950017175, "id": "f8d46f1462fa45e5b6e9fd3c7a5cefc3", "publicationDate": "1995-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19950017175.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19950017175/downloads/19950017175.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19950017175/downloads/19950017175.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19950017175/downloads/19950017175.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
