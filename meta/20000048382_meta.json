Chandra is the third of NASA's Great Observatories to be launched, following the Hubble Space Telescope and the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory. One of four primary science instruments on Chandra, and one of only two focal plane instruments, is the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer, or ACIS. The ACIS focal plane and Optical Blocking Filter (OBF) must be launched under vacuum, so a tightly sealed, functioning door and venting subsystem were implemented. The door was opened two and one-half weeks after launch (after most out-gassing of composite materials) and allowed X-rays to be imaged by the ACIS CCD's in the focal plane. A failure of this door to open on-orbit would have eliminated all ACIS capabilities, severely degrading mission science. During the final pre-flight thermal-vacuum test of the fully integrated Chandra Observatory at TRW, the ACIS door failed to open when commanded to do so. This paper describes the efforts, under considerable time pressure, by NASA, its contractors and outside review teams to investigate the failure and to develop modified hardware and procedures which would correct the problem. Of interest is the fact that the root cause of the test failure was never clearly identified despite massive effort. We ultimately focussed on hardware and procedures designed to mitigate the effects of potential, but unproven, failure modes. We describe a frequent real-world engineering situation in which one must proceed on the best basis possible in the absence of the complete set of facts.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20000048382, "id": "da4bc9843ca64e65b38e6987448684f8", "publicationName": "34th Aerospace Mechanisms Symposium", "publicationDate": "2000-05-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20000048380, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "34th Aerospace Mechanisms Symposium", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
