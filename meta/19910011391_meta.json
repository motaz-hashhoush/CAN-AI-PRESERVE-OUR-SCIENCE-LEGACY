The use of models of operator function to represent operator activity in the context of changing system events and operator functions is illustrated. Although there are many models, the operator function model (OFM) was used in this research. In addition to representing operator activities, the OFM can be used to design 'intelligent' operator displays and, in real time, control the displayed information so that the operator has the appropriate information, at the appropriate time, and at the appropriate level of abstraction. The OFM was demonstrated in the context of a NASA Goddard Space Flight Center satellite ground control system. To evaluate the effectiveness of the model-based workstation, an experiment was conducted to compare system performance with a conventional operator workstation versus the model based workstation.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19910011391, "id": "695c9e77c7dd4d44acf1478ff058b367", "publicationName": "NASA, Lyndon B.
