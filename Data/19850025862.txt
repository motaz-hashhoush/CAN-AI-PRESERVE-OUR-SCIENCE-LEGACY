throughout the miSSion, a predictIOn on maximum power was made\nThe predictIOn of maximum power for seven years m orbit was based upon Table 5 solar cell parameters\nSmce averaged annual radiatIOn dosage were used m "UNIFLUX", cumulative dosage was proportIOnal with\nthe number of days m orbit EqUivalent fluence levels and damage coefficients for the vanous panels have been\nlIsted m Table 3 Maximum power was determmed for the array\'s electncal configuration at AMO and 301 15 K\n\nThe peak power trackmg mode of the standard power regulator umt (SPRU) was used to calculate the actual\narray power Immediately after eclIpse, the SPRU locates the maximum power operatmg pomt of the solar array ThiS mode was mvoked when electncal load demand at the SPRU output termmals exceeds the maximum\npower aVaIlable from the solar array The electncal loads consist of three twenty-two cell 20 Ampere-hour\nmckel-cadmlUm battenes and spacecraft loads The output voltage of the SPRU and battenes were mamtamed\nat the same level SPRU current was lImited by the mstantaneous power from the array In the peak power\ntrackmg mode (PPT), the SPRU regulates the current from the array to wlthm \xc2\xb15 % of the aVaIlable max-\n\nImum When one battery reaches the selected voltage/temperature value, the SPRU changes Into a voltage limit\nmode whereby the battenes contmue to charge, but only at a taper current Solar array current drawn\ndecreases, thereby reducmg mput spacecraft power TYPically the PPT operatIOn lasts approximately 5 mmutes\nafter dawn Dunng that mterval, the temperature of the solar array should be m the vlclmty of 250 K Thus\nfor companson of observed telemetry and predicted power levels, a temperature correctIOn factor was\nemployed ThiS factor depended upon temperature and radiatIOn fluence level\nThe SMM telemetry was corrected for temperature, Illummatlon, and radiation effects Maximum power\nvoltage may be obtamed by the followmg relatIOnship

degradatIOn rate of the Teflon\xc2\xae adhesive It was\nnoted that after two months of exposure the loss factor had leveled off to 0 98 of the ongInal power level\nFurther exposure to the ultraVIOlet

exposure When companng the predicted power levels, the only difference between them was the\nspace environment fluence levels SInce the Jet PropulSion Laboratory tables were tnple Interpolated a

Abstract\nThe 5-year In-orbit power degradation of the silicon solar array aboard\nthe Solar Maximum Satellite was evaluated. This was the first spacecraft to use Teflon R FEP as a coverglass adhesive, thus avoldlng the\nnecessity of an ultraviolet filter.\nThe peak power tracking mode of the power regulator unit was employed to\nensure consistent maximum power comparisons. Telemetry was normalized to\naccount for the effects of illumination intenslty, charged particle\nirradlation dosage, and solar array temperature. Reference conditions of\n1.0 solar constant at air mass zero (AMO) and 301 K (28\xc2\xb0C) were used as\na basis for normalization. Beginnlng-of-life array power was 2230 watts.\nCurrently, the array output is 1830 watts. This corresponds to a 16\npercent loss in array performance over 5 years. Comparison of Solar\nMaximum Telemetry and predicted power levels indicate that array output\nis 2 percent less than predictions based on an annual 1.0 MeV equivalent\nelection fluence of 2.34 x 1013/ cm2 space environment.\n17 Key Words (Selected by Author(s))\nSolar Maximum Satellite\nsilicon solar cells\nTeflon R FEP\ncharged particle irradiation dosage\n19 Security Classlf (of thiS report)\nUnclassified\n\n18 Distribution Statement\nUnclassified - Unlimited\n\n20 Secunty Classlf (of thiS page)\n\nSubject Category 20\n21 No of Pages 22 Price\n\nUnclasslfied\n\nFor sale by the NatIonal TechnIcal I nformatlon SerVIce, Spnngfleld, VIrginIa\n\n18\n22161\n\nA02\nGSFC 25\xc2\xb744 (10/77)\n\nNASA-Langley, 1985\n\nEnd of Document\n\n'
