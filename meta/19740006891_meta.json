Remote sensing by the ERTS-1 satellite was compared with selected water quality parameters including pH, salinity, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, water depth, water temperature, turbidity, plankton concentration, current variables, chlorophylla, total carotenoids, and species diversity of the benthic community. Strong correlation between turbidity and MSS-sensed radiance was recorded and less strong correlations between the two plankton pigments and radiance. Turbidity and benthic species diversity were highly correlated furnishing an inferential tie between an easily sensed water quality variable and a sensitive indicator of average water quality conditions.", "title": "Water quality parameters of harbors of Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas, Virgin Islands:  Acquisition of in situ water data, intercorrelation of selected water parameters, and initial correlation of these in situ biological, chemical and physical data with ERTS-1 bulk CCT MSS band 5 data", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-07T19:32:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19740006891, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Coulbourn, W.
