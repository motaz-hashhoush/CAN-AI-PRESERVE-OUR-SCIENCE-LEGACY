The results of chemical analyses of lunar samples are discussed, and their implications regarding chemical reactions beginning with carbonaceous dust are considered. Amino acids isolated from lunar samples taken from different sites show a high degree of similarity, in agreement with the hypothesis that carbon compounds, including amino acid precursors, were implanted on the lunar surface by components of the solar wind. The amino acid precursors are most likely a cyanide compound. Overlapping amino acid/carbon ratios from lunar samples and samples of meteorites suggest a common cosmochemical state of carbon in the solar system.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"volume": "6", "submissionId": 19760047268, "id": "6a0013187c9d404fa8aec9ce0735bc89", "publicationName": "BioSystems", "publicationDate": "1975-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
