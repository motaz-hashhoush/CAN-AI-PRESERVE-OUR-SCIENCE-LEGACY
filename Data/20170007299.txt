ARM will demonstrate high power Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP), on\nthe order of 40 kW to the Electric Propulsion (EP) system, currently being developed for future\nrobotic and human missions to Mars and beyond.

The ARRM spacecraft in this study was assumed to carry a maximum of 5.3 mt of total Xenon propellant for the mission (5 mt usable + 6%\nmargin). This reference mission currently assumed a launch in December 2021 on either a Delta\nIV Heavy or a Falcon Heavy to a trajectory targeting a series of Lunar Gravity Assist (LGA) maneuvers to reach Earth escape. The reference trajectory is optimized to provide 215 days for operations at the target asteroid, 2008 EV5, and to support a crewed rendezvous mission in 2026. The\nresults of these analyses, as well as the ground rules and assumptions of the current ARRM reference trajectory, are documented in this paper.\nTHE CURRENT ARRM REFERENCE TRAJECTORY\nThe current ARRM reference trajectory assumes that the Asteroid Redirect Vehicle (ARV)\nwould launch at the end of the calendar year 2021 on either a Delta IV Heavy or Falcon Heavy\nlaunch vehicle to a trajectory targeting an LGA. In order to provide a > 20-day launch period, the\nARV would launch into a set of elliptical phasing orbits to target an LGA in Feb. 2022. This first\nlunar flyby, LGA1, sends the ARV onto a large elliptical Earth orbit where Solar perturbations\nincrease the ARV energy before a second lunar flyby, LGA2, in June 2022 that would send the\nARV onto an Earth escape trajectory. During this 6-month Earth departure process, the ARV will\nconduct non-critical deployments and checkouts where the SEP system will be calibrated and\nprepared for interplanetary thrust. The outbound cruise then takes the ARV to the asteroid.\nThere are currently 215 days allocated for asteroid operations in the reference trajectory. In\norder to allow for time to make up for missed thrust on the outbound leg of the trajectory, 30 days\nof coast is inserted into the trajectory as additional stay time at the asteroid. When this resulting\n215-day asteroid operations time is added to the 30 day forced coast for missed thrust in the outbound cruise, this leads to a 245-day stay time for trajectory modeling. Additionally, 15 days is\nreserved on the asteroid approach for observation while not under SEP thrust and is allocated as\npart of the interplanetary trajectory on the leg to the asteroid for the purposes of trajectory modeling.\nThe inbound cruise phase of the trajectory maneuvers the combined ARV and boulder back\ntowards Earth. There is an Earth Gravity Assist (EGA) to provide additional plane change to the\ninterplanetary trajectory a year before an LGA that captures the ARV-boulder combination into\nthe Earth-Moon system. After capture, Solar and Lunar perturbations are used to transfer the entire stack to a crew-accessible orbit. In this example trajectory, the ARV would target a crewaccessible, Lunar Near-Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO) for the Asteroid Redirect Crew Mission\n(ARCM). During ARCM, astronauts are sent in an Orion spacecraft to rendezvous and dock with\nthe ARV. After ARCM, the ARV will transfer to a Lunar DRO with an orbit lifetime in excess of\n100 years for storage of the returned boulder.\nSpacecraft Technology Assumptions\nThe ARV is designed to be a technology demonstration mission of a 40 kW class Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) spacecraft.\nThe nominal thruster configuration of the ARV for the reference trajectory assumed three active and 1 spare PPU/thruster string (3+1). A duty cycle of 90% is assumed on the trajectory\nmodeling to allow for missed thrust and other non-thrusting operations. The duty cycle is reduced to 70% on the last 15 days prior to asteroid arrival to allow for observation and characterization of the asteroid on approach. A Xe margin of 6% of the useable Xe is carried as an addi-\n\n2\n\ntional inert mass in the trajectory modeling to account for mission Delta-V (\xe2\x88\x86V) margin and\ntrapped residuals.\nA total End of Life (EOL) power to the Power Processing Units (PPUs) of 42 kW is required\nto power 3+1 configuration of 13.95 kW thruster strings.\nReference Trajectory\nIn the current reference trajectory modeling, the dry mass of the ARV is adjusted in order to\nreturn approximately 20 t of asteroid mass from the reference target asteroid, 2008 EV5, given the\nassumptions documented in the previous sections. Reduction in that dry mass of the ARV would\nresult in an increase of returned asteroid mass for the same set of assumptions.\nThe heliocentric trajectory starts at Earth departure, after the approximately 6 month LGA has\nboosted the outgoing velocity to a C3 of 2 km2/s2. Table 1 below captures the dates of the heliocentric trajectory of the ARRM. In the reference trajectory, Earth departure starts on June 11,\n2022. After completing a thrust-coast-thrust-coast-thrust structured outbound cruise, the ARV\narrives at the asteroid on August 6, 2023. After spending 245 days at the asteroid (30 days of\nmissed thrust coasting, 215 days of operations), the ARV departs for Earth on April 7, 2024. In\norder to change the heliocentric inclination of the incoming trajectory to match that of Earth, an\nEGA is targeted on June 24, 2025. The heliocentric trajectory ends upon Earth arrival on July 28,\n2026. After several months of EP thrusting in cislunar space, the ARV arrives in its final NRHO\norbit for the human operations.\nTable 1.

In order to make observations from Earth of the asteroid operations possible, the current proposed ARRM reference mission is targeting operations\nat the asteroid during this closest approach to Earth. The current proposed reference mission arrives at the asteroid in August of 2023, ahead of the closest approach of December 20 of that year\n(highlighted in blue in Table 2), so that operations at the asteroid will be taking place around this\ntime.\n\n4\n\nTable 2. 2008 EV5 Close Approach Data.\nDate\n\nMinimum Distance\n(AU)\n\nV-relative\n(km/s)\n\n2010-Apr-18\n\n0.2397\n\n9.460\n\n2022-Dec-27\n\n0.4236\n\n16.055\n\n2023-Dec-20\n\n0.0422\n\n5.345\n\n2024-Jul-20\n\n0.1410\n\n4.9456\n\n2025-Apr-27\n\n0.1746\n\n7.4511\n\n2038-Dec-23\n\n0.3198\n\n12.922\n\nFigure 2 displays the distance between the Earth and 2008 EV5 during the 20-year span from\n2020 to 2040. As can be seen from the data, the synodic period of the Earth and 2008 EV5 is approximately 15.7 years. The closest approach being considered for the current ARRM reference\ntrajectory will not repeat again until 2040.\n\nFigure 2. Earth - 2008 EV5 Range from 2020 \xe2\x80\x93 2040\n\nREFERENCE TRAJECTORY LAUNCH DATE SENSITIVITY\nThe first time-dependent analysis examined the effect of change in launch date on the reference trajectory. Any change in launch date will impact either the allowable spacecraft dry mass or\nthe returned boulder mass capability or both. Additionally, since this launch is targeting a series\nof lunar flybys to provide a gravity assist on the outgoing trajectory leg, launch date slips will\nrequire coordination with the availability of the Moon. To assess the launch date slips, intervals\nof 28 days were examined in order to line up with the period of the moon\xe2\x80\x99s orbit. This corre-\n\n5\n\nsponded to Earth arrival date slips of 28 days accordingly with Earth departure dates adjusted to\nalign the outgoing velocity vector with the Moon\xe2\x80\x99s velocity direction. Launch slips throughout\nthe reference launch year 2021/2022 and into the following year 2022/2023 were examined.\nBased on fact that the synodic period between Earth and 2008 EV5 is 15.7 years and the closest\napproach between the Earth and 2008 EV5 occurs in December 2023, as ARRM slips launch\ndates (and subsequently Earth departure dates) further out from the current reference date, the\norbital alignment between Earth and 2008 EV5 becomes less optimal, driving the trajectory DeltaV (\xe2\x88\x86V) requirements and decreasing the asteroidal boulder mass return capability.\nAnalysis Assumptions\nThe analysis for this trade study was performed in MALTO (The Mission Analysis LowThrust Optimization)4, a medium fidelity tool ideally suited for running trade studies about the\nreference trajectory. The spacecraft is assumed to have the same fixed dry mass of 5014 kg as the\nreference case and the returnable asteroid boulder mass is maximized for each launch date. For\neach launch date slip, the Earth return date is allowed to slip accordingly such that the total mission duration is kept the same or less than that of the reference trajectory. Asteroid stay time is\nassumed to be 245 days. Earth departure is assumed to have an escape characteristic energy (C3)\nof 1.75 km2/s2 and declination of up to 60 degrees relative to the Ecliptic plane, achievable via a\npair of LGAs. The higher declination is beneficial for certain launch dates due to the relatively\nhigh inclination of 2008 EV5\xe2\x80\x99s orbit. The Earth return C3 is assumed to be 2 km2/s2 and declination up to 30 degrees.\nFamilies of Trajectories\nDuring the trade runs in which the launch date is changed in 28-day intervals, the solution of\nthe previous trajectory is used as initial guess for the next case. The initial guesses may work for\na few data points but typically require fresh restarts afterwards due to the drastic change to the\norbit phasing between Earth and the asteroid. To overcome this, four families of trajectories are\ncreated independently in launch years between 2021 and 2024. Figure 3 shows the maximal boulder mass and corresponding launch dates for each of the four families. To bring back over 20 tons\nof asteroid boulder mass, seven monthly launch opportunities exist after the reference launch date\nof December 2021. Three additional launch opportunities exist in late 2022 but none after that\nsince the asteroid is slowing moving away from Earth and the next close approach of the asteroid\nonly arises in 2038.\n\n6\n\nFigure 3. ARRM Returned Boulder Mass vs Launch Date.\n\nREFERENCE TRAJECTORY STAY TIME SENSITIVITY\nIn addition to the impact of launch date, increasing the stay time at the asteroid will also impact either the allowable spacecraft dry mass or the returned boulder mass capability or both. The\nreference trajectory is built around a 245 total stay time at the asteroid (215 days of operation and\n30 days of margin) to allow for asteroid observation, boulder identification, boulder capture, and\na planetary defense demonstration. As analysis is ongoing into the time required for each of these\noperations, investigation into the impact of extending the stay at the asteroid has been performed.\nUnlike the launch date slips, the analysis of the impact of asteroid stay time to the reference trajectory assumed a return to Earth of the same date as the reference trajectory. This means there\nwas no one-to-one return date slip for asteroid stay extension examined. Because the reference\ntrajectory was optimized to return 20t of asteroid mass with the assumption that the stay time was\n245 days, increasing the stay time above 245 days further constrains the problem and results in\ndecreased returned asteroid mass for a fixed ARV dry mass, or reduced ARV dry mass for fixed\nasteroid returned mass.\nStay Time Analysis Assumptions\nThe reference trajectory baseline used for this trade study was modeled in the trajectory tool,\nCopernicus5. Copernicus development started at the University of Texas at Austin and currently\ncontinues at Johnson Space Center (JSC).6 Copernicus is a generalized spacecraft trajectory design and optimization tool, capable of designing low thrust and impulsive trajectory problems.\nCopernicus is currently the baselined tool for performing all higher fidelity ARRM trajectory\nanalysis. The ARRM spacecraft in this study was assumed to carry a maximum of 5.3 t of total\nXe for the mission (5t usable + 6% margin) with an additional 360 kg of hydrazine carried for use\nat the asteroid. The launch mass was constrained to not exceed the Delta IV-H performance to the\nC3 required for the LGA (-1.5 km2/s2), minus a launch adapter mass of 900 kg.\n\n7\n\nThe results presented were generated by first by fixing the spacecraft dry mass and maximizing returned boulder mass, and then by fixing the returned boulder mass and maximizing the\nspacecraft dry mass, all while varying the asteroid stay time. In order to return the 20t boulder\nmass in the reference trajectory, the maximum possible ARV dry mass for a 245-day stay time\nwas 5014 kg. To assess the sensitivity of the reference trajectory, stay time, boulder mass and\nspacecraft dry mass were varied near these reference values.\nStay Time Analysis Results\nInitial analysis of the sensitivity of asteroid stay time varied the stay durations from 10 weeks\nshorter to 35 weeks longer than the reference of 245 days in 1-week steps. ARV dry mass was\nheld constant at 4800, 5000 and 5200 kg with maximum returned asteroid mass as the objective\nfunction. Next, returned boulder mass was held constant at 19t and 20t with maximum ARV dry\nmass as the objective function. The arrival and departure dates were optimized in this scenario in\norder to represent a mission that has a planned stay time of the specified duration rather than a\nmission that required a modified stay time after asteroid arrival.\nFigure 4 shows the results of maximizing returned asteroid mass for a range of ARV dry\nmasses and stay times. Each ARV dry mass curve demonstrates similar characteristics for the returned asteroid mass sensitivity. From -10 weeks to +15 weeks relative to the reference stay time,\nthe slope is nearly linear at approximately -0.06 tons/week. That is, an additional week of stay\ntime in this region reduces the maximum return mass by 0.06t (60 kg). From +15 weeks to +25\nweeks, a flat region exists where the returned asteroid mass is nearly constant. As the stay time\nincreases beyond +25 weeks, an exponential decline in maximum returned mass is observed, with\na peak slope of approximately -0.9 tons/week.\nDecreased Stay Time\nIncreases Asteroid Mass\n\nIncreased Stay Time\nDecreases Asteroid Mass\n\n23.0\n\n22.0\n\nMaximum Returned Asteroid Mass (mt)\n\n4800 kg Dry\n\n+1 mt Asteroid Mass \xe2\x89\x88\n-200 kg Dry Mass\n\n5000 kg Dry\n5200 kg Dry\n\n21.0\n\n20.0\n\n19.0\n\n18.0\n\n-100 kg Dry Mass \xe2\x89\x88\n+10 Weeks Stay Time\n\n17.0\n\nReference\nMission Stay\nTime (245 days)\n\n16.0\n\n15.0\n- 10\n\n- 5\n\n+ 0\n\n-200 kg Dry Mass \xe2\x89\x88\n+25 Weeks Stay Time\n+ 5\n+ 10\n+ 15\n+ 20\nReference Relative Stay Time (Weeks)\n\n+ 25\n\n+ 30\n\nFigure 4. Maximum Returned Asteroid Mass vs. Asteroid Stay Time\n\n8\n\n+ 35\n\nFigure 5 shows the results of maximizing ARV dry mass for a range of returned boulder\nmasses and stay times. Each returned asteroid mass curve demonstrates similar characteristics for\nthe ARV dry mass sensitivity. From -10 weeks to +15 weeks relative to the reference stay time,\nthe slope is nearly linear at approximately -10 kg/week. That is, an additional week of stay time\nin this region reduces the maximum ARV dry mass by 10 kg. From +15 weeks to +25 weeks, a\nflat region exists where the ARV dry mass is nearly constant. As the stay time increases beyond\n+25 weeks, an exponential decline in maximum ARV dry mass is observed, with a peak slope of\napproximately -300 kg/week.\nFurthermore, before the region of exponential decline in both ARV dry mass and returned asteroid mass, 1t of asteroid mass is equivalent to approximately 200 kg of ARV dry mass. For example, at the reference stay time, to increase the ARV dry mass from 5000 kg to 5200 kg, returned asteroid mass would have to decrease by approximately 1t. In addition, to add 10 weeks to\nthe stay time and retain a 20t returned asteroid mass, the ARV dry mass must not exceed ~4900\nkg. Similarly, if it is desired to stay an additional 25 weeks at the asteroid, but still return a 20t\nboulder, the ARV dry mass must not exceed ~4800 kg.\n\n5,400\n20t Boulder\n5,300\n\n19t Boulder\n\nMaximum Dry Mass (kg)\n\n5,200\n5,100\n5,000\n4,900\n4,800\n4,700\n\nReference\nMission Stay\nTime (245 days)\n\n4,600\n4,500\n- 10\n\n-5\n\n+0\n\n+5\n\n+ 10\n\n+ 15\n\n+ 20\n\n+ 25\n\n+ 30\n\n+ 35\n\nReference Relative Stay Time (Weeks)\n\nFigure 5. Maximum Spacecraft Dry Mass vs. Asteroid Stay Time.\n\n2008 EV5 Contour plot of Asteroid Mass and ARV dry mass for asteroid stay times\nAdditional analysis was completed on the reference trajectory to examine the sensitivity of the\nround trip trajectory to stay time at the asteroid. Setting the spacecraft mass constant across the\nanalyses, the trajectory optimization maximized the return mass from the asteroid. Figure 6 shows\na close up view of the variation of boulder mass with asteroid stay time. The reference trajectory\nis indicated as \xe2\x80\x9c0\xe2\x80\x9d days on the x-axis. Stay times of less than the current reference stay at the as-\n\n9\n\nteroid are to the left, represented by negative stay times, and stay times of more than the reference\ntrajectory assumed stay time are to the right as positive or longer stay times. For the range of \xc2\xb1 17\nweeks (~120 days) the asteroid return mass varied from 20.1t to 20.85t. Less stay time returns\nmore asteroid mass and more stay time returns less asteroid mass than the reference trajectory for\nthe same Earth departure and Earth return conditions. The 120-day range from the current reference was intended to capture the change to boulder mass due to a potential earlier departure date\nif the boulder was successfully captured early in the operations phase.\nFor all of these trajectories, the arrival at the asteroid date was the same, but the departure date\nvaried. All of these cases returned to the same Cartesian state at the start of the Earth-gravity assist preceding the endgame capture phase for a 2026 ARCM.\n\nFigure 6. Maximum Asteroid Boulder Returned Mass vs. Asteroid Stay Time.\n\nA contour plot of asteroid boulder returned mass for asteroid arrival and departure date combinations is shown in Figure 7 below. For all of these day combinations, the Earth departure and\nEarth arrival times remain in 2022 and 2026 respectively and the optimal spacecraft dry mass is\nassumed to be the reference trajectory derived mass of 5014 kg. The days along the x-axis are\nexpressed in days from the current reference arrival date, with positive days indicating an arrival\nlater than the current reference and negative days indicating an arrival earlier than the current reference. Similarly, the days along the y-axis are expressed in days from the current reference departure date with positive days indicating a departure later than the current reference, negative\ndays indicating a departure earlier than the current reference. The (0,0) point represents the current reference assumption of arrival and departure dates. The different between the two is the 245\ndays modeled in the trajectory as days at the asteroid. The diagonal line represents combinations\nof arrival and departure dates of the trajectory that are also 245 days apart indicating a constant\n245-day stay time line for 2008 EV5. Date combinations above the 245-day constant stay time\n\n10\n\nline represent stay times > 245 days and date combinations below the 245-day constant stay time\nrepresent stay times < 245 days.\nContours of asteroid returned mass were determined for each of these combinations of asteroid\narrival and departure dates. As can be seen, the contour of 20t returned mass is possible for arrival departure dates that result in stay times less than or equal to 245 days. If after additional analysis, the reference trajectory requires more than 245 days stay time for operations at the asteroid,\nthe returned asteroid boulder mass will be reduced for the current Earth departure and Earth arrival dates. Contours in red are around 20t, and contour line colors change to orange, yellow, etc.\nrepresent lines of less than 20t returned asteroid mass.\n\nFigure 7. Maximum Asteroid boulder returned Mass vs. Asteroid Stay Time.\n\nAnother contour plot of maximum spacecraft dry mass for asteroid arrival and departure date\ncombinations is shown in Figure 8 below. For all of these day combinations, the Earth departure\nand Earth arrival times remain in 2020 and 2026 respectively and the asteroid returned mass was\nassumed to be the reference trajectory returned mass assumption of 20t. As with the contours\nabove, the diagonal line represents combinations of arrival and departure dates of the trajectory\nthat are also 245 days apart indicating a constant 245-day stay time line for 2008 EV5. Date combinations above the 245-day constant stay time line represent stay times > 245 days and date\ncombinations below the 245-day constant stay time represent stay times < 245 days.\n\n11\n\nFigure 8. Maximum Asteroid boulder returned Mass vs. Asteroid Stay Time.\nCONCLUSION\nBecause of the alignment of 2008 EV5 and Earth within their orbits with respect to one another, the current timeline for the proposed Asteroid Redirect Robotic Mission (ARRM) is the optimal time to bring back as much asteroid mass as possible from 2008 EV5 given the assumed high\npower SEP in space propulsion system. The synodic period of 2008 EV5 and the Earth is 15.7\nyears and the closest approach of December 20, 2023 falls within the currently proposed timeline.\nDelays in the launch and Earth return dates will result in a capability for less asteroid mass returned. Nevertheless, launch date delays of several years as under study in this analysis, resulting\nin a one for one Earth return delay are still feasible missions. Additionally, the asteroid stay time\ncan be increased from the current reference trajectory assumptions by either reducing the amount\nof asteroid mass returned, the dry mass of the spacecraft or both.\nSince it is more difficult to reduce mass of the spacecraft as the design commences, a reduction in the returned mass from the asteroid seems to be the more likely trade for asteroid stay\ntime. All of these trades in dates (launch and asteroid arrival/departure) are directly impact the\nability of the optimized trajectory to return mass from the asteroid. Any delays in the launch or\narrival dates, at Earth and/or the asteroid, from the current proposed reference trajectory presented in this paper will result in a decrease of asteroid returned mass.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors wish to express their gratitude to the management of the ARRM project as well as\ntheir own management at NASA GRC, JPL, NASA LaRC and NASA GSFC.
