b'Introduction\nIn the history of humankind, every space adventure, great or small, has begun on\nthe ground. While this seems to be stating the obvious, mission and flight\nhardware designers who have overlooked this fact have paid a high price, either\nin loss or damage to the hardware pre-launch, or in mission failure or reduction.\nDesigners may risk not only their flight hardware, but they may also risk their\nlives, their co-workers lives and even the general public by not heeding safety on\nthe ground. Their eyes may be on the stars but their feet are on the ground!\nThis discussion applies to all forms of flight hardware from the largest rockets to\nthe smallest spare parts.\nTypical Ground Safety Issues\nA very common issue that the Ground Safety Community encounters is lack of\nrecognition of the need for ground safety documentation and reviews. This is\nmost often expressed as \'What do you mean I have to get ground safety\napproval?" Many designers feel that if the hardware is safe to fly, it should also\nbe safe on the ground, or that the safety processes used during development\nand manufacturing are sufficient for use at the launch and landing sites. Of\ncourse this is not true. At most of the world\'s launch sites, processes exist to\nassure that the hardware, it\'s Ground Support Equipment and operations are in\ncompliance with requirements applicable to that site, It is not that the sites do not\ntrust the hardware; it is more the case that, up until the delivery, the hardware\nhas the privilege to be a stand-a-lone process. Upon arrival, the hardware enters\ninto an integrated environment often consisting of the general public, other flight\nhardware, and facilities. The safety approval processes are structured to provide\nassurances to all interested parties that the risk is acceptable or has been\ncontrolled.\nThere is also a tendency for hardware owners to pay less attention to the ground\nsupport equipment than to flight hardware. This is understandable as the flight\nhardware is what the mission is all about. However, this can lead to situations\nwhere the ground support equipment is not adequate for the job or, at best, has\nbeen inadequately analyzed for the role it is to perform. The misuse of\ncommercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment is also a major concern. This occurs\nwhen a program purchases COTS and then modifies it to meet their needs. Of\ncourse, this then shifts the equipment out of the category of COTS and into a\nself-built category of equipment requiring a full analysis. When such cases are\ndiscovered, there is a mad scramble to get the equipment reviewed and\napproved. This has the potential to delay processing and a possible impact to\nlaunch.\nAn important requirement many projects tend to overlook is the use of written\nprocedures. Written procedures are critical in assuring that operations are run in\n\nthe manner that the test team has intended. The lack of adequate procedures or,\nworse yet, the failure to use written procedures has been listed as the cause of\nnumerous accidents. The timing of the production of procedures is also\nimportant. A procedure that is hurried through development and review and is\nissued just prior to the operation can be just as risky as no procedure at all. An\nexample of this is the Apollo I fire, when the procedure for the "plugs out" test\nhad hundreds of changes made to it and was issued the night before. This\nessentially meant the test team was seeing the procedure for the first time during\nthe test. The use and control of written procedures can not be over-emphasized.\nHardware providers must make special considerations while their hardware is in\nthe ground environment. These considerations cover such areas as:\nContingency Planning - Unexpected events, whether external to the\nhardware, such as heavy weather, or internal, such as a propellant leak,\nmust be planned for so when they occur prompt corrective action is taken.\nTools - the proper design and use of tools is important to complete prelaunch processing. The accounting for hand tools is critical so they do not\nbecome part of the flight hardware.\nChemicals and Biologics - It is commonly accepted that these\ncommodities when contained in experiments present hazards to the flight\ncrews; however, their handling on the ground present different problems\nwhich are often overlooked by developers. This generally applies to\nsample preparation or return. Because during these times, the\ncommodities are outside their containment. These same issues also\napply to the return of trash.\nMechanical Systems (Pressure/Ordnance/Deployable) - All of these\nsystems contain stored energy which must be released in a controlled\nmanner at the proper time. This is often accomplished through the use of\ninhibits. The status of inhibits on the ground must be carefully tracked in\norder to not inadvertently activate the system.\nIn summary, when ground processing flight hardware, the same level of vigilance\nis necessary as is applied to flight operations.\nThe Commonality or Uncommonality of Ground Standards\nDepending on the location of the ground processing, a hardware provider faces a\nmyriad of processes from none to complex. This is a reflection of the fact that\nprocessing sites are owned and operated by nation states, who expect their laws\nwill apply. In spite of the fact that the processing of flight hardware and its\nground support equipment has developed in a somewhat standard process, the\nrequirements among the various sites have continued to be independently\ndeveloped and applied.\n\nOne exception to this is the human-rated International Space Station Program.\nThree of the processing sites, Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in the USA, the\nGuiana Space Center (CSG) in Kourou, French Guiana, and Tanegashima\nSpace Center (TNSC) in Japan, use the same document as the basis of their\nrequirements with each site adding their own local requirements. This document\nwas originally written for the US Space Shuttle and was based on U.S. Air Force\nRange requirements. So there exists now a string of related requirements which\ncan serve as precedence.\nFor the expendable launch vehicles, the applicable requirements remain site\nspecific. The cause of this is related to the large amount energy in these\nvehicles and the potential for harm to the general public. It is this public safety\nfacet that makes the processing sites reluctant to adopt outside standards. As a\nreminder for those programs that operate on both human-rated and non-humanrated vehicles, when on the ground, neither the flight hardware nor the ground\nsupport equipment cares what it is flying on; meaning that the requirements for\nground processing safety are generally the same regardless of vehicle.\nAcross the various processing sites, there is a fair amount of commonality in the\ndesign requirements however; the rules governing operations across the sites\ntend to be unique, reflecting their national character. This makes the issuance of\na common standard difficult. Adding to this difficulty is the reluctance of\nprocessing sites to accept hardware without completion of their review process.\nOne area that may serve as a seed for commonality is the use of COTS. These\nitems are used around the world in non-space applications without further review.\nAn agreement by the launch sites to determine a list of acceptable\ntesting/approval agencies for COTS and then accept them for use without further\nreview would be helpful.\nThis brings us to the topic of an ISO Standard. There currently exists a three\npart ISO Standard for space systems (ISO 14620 - Space systems -- Safety\n\'requirements -- Part 1: System safety; Part 2: Launch site operations; and Part 3:\nFlight safety systems). To my limited knowledge the issue with these standards\nis that their development does not appear to include the very programs that\nwould make use of them. I believe this is based in part to the strong aspect of\nnational ownership of the sites as previously discussed. The ISO Standards,\nalong with the discussion of COTS above, could serve as a basis for a common\nstandard both internationally and intranationally.\n\nThe Cost of Lack of Commonality\nThe cost of this lack of a common ground safety standard is primarily borne by\nthe payload and cargo community. The launch vehicle community tends to be\nfixed based and is not easily moved from site to site. The costs incurred in\ncomplying with individual sites safety requirements can be minimized by ensuring\n\nthe site is included early in the mission process. However, designing payloads\nand cargos to support individual sites can prevent the development of common\nspacecraft buses and associated ground safety equipment that are universally\nacceptable. It is this hindrance of cost savings through commonality that is the\ntrue cost.\nConclusion\nIn order to increase the efficiency of ground processing and thereby drive down\ncosts, a universal standard covering ground safety requirements and processes\nis required. There are processes at work now such as the ISO Standard and the\nInternational Space station processes that can serve as the basis for such a\ncommon standard, If we can develop a standard for ground safety, can one for\nflight be far behind?\n\nU)\na)\nU)\nCl)\n>\n\n(I)\n-o\n\n0\n(9\n\noa)\n--o\n\xe2\x80\x94Co\nCo\n\n-o\na)\n\n(I)\nz\n\nCl)\na)\nCl)\nCl)\n>1\n\nCo\n\n\'Pt\t\n\n0\n\na-\n\nC/)\nO)\t\n\n0\t\nrn co -\t\na)\n\noo\t\n\nLLW(/)I\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n-\t\n\n)\nQCI)\n\n0\nO)\n\n-\n\nQ\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\x94Ct5\n\nIII\n\ng\xe2\x80\xa2E o2o\n\nL..\t\nCO0OL1C)\n-\t\nIC\t\n- a_ a) . -\t\n0\n\na)\t\n\n-\n\n2\t\n(9\t\n\n> a0\n(I)\na- -o\n>p,*\n\n0\n\n-o\n\n(I)\n\nV) -o\t\nCo\n\no\n(Ui\n\n(9\n\n>1 0\n\no\nI\xe2\x80\x94\nz\n.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nCo\t\n-o\t\n\nCo\t\n\xe2\x80\x94\t\n,/Ipt\t\n\n\'4/I\t\n\no\t\nL.\t\n\nci)\nU)\t\nU)\t\n\nci)\nC.)\t\n0\nCl)\t\n\n-o\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\n-o\nI\n\nCO\n\nCO\n\nE\nI\nI\n\n0\n\n>\n-D\n\nCl)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nU)\t\n-o\nCO\t\n\n-o\t\n-\t\nC\')\n\na)\nE\n0\naw\na)\n\nC/)\n\ndc\n\nCN\n\nCo\n\no\n\n0E\nE.E\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n0)\n\nCo\nO\n\nL0\n\noIl\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nCl)\n0\n- Co\n.-\t\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n>\n0\n\n0\n\n>\n\n-o\nU)\n\nc-o\nCo\nO\t\n\nE\n\n\'I-\t\n\'4-,\t\n\no\n\nCo\n\nI\n\n09.-\n\nI\t\n\n.!:J\xe2\x80\xa25\nE :\n\n0\n\nI\n\n>\n(0\n\nE\nE\n\n'
