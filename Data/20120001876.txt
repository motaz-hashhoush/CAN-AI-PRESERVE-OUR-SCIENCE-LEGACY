b'High-Temperature Coatings Offer Energy Savings\nNASA Technology\n\nT\n\nhe U.S. X-Plane Program included the first-ofits-kind research in aerodynamics and astronautics\nwith experimental vehicles, including the first aircraft to break the sound barrier; the first aircraft to fly in\nexcess of 100,000, then 200,000, and then 300,000 feet;\nand the first aircraft to fly at three, four, five, and then six\ntimes the speed of sound.\nDuring the 1990s, NASA started developing a new\nthermal protection material to test on the X-33 and X-34\nsupersonic aircraft. The X-33 was intended to demonstrate the technologies needed for a new reusable launch\nvehicle and was projected to reach an altitude of approximately 50 miles and speeds of more than Mach 11.\nThe X-34, a small, reusable technology demonstrator\nfor a launch vehicle, was intended to reach an altitude\nof 250,000 feet and fly at speeds of Mach 8.\nAs a result of its research and development\nefforts, NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Ames Research Center\ninvented the Protective Ceramic\nCoating Material (PCCM). Applied to a\nsurface, the thin, lightweight coating\ncould protect the material underneath from\nextreme temperatures.\nThe capability of the\ntechnology came\nfrom its emissivity,\n\nIn developing new materials to\ntest on the X-33 reusable launch vehicle\n(artist\xe2\x80\x99s concept shown here), Ames Research\nCenter invented a thin material capable of withstanding high\ntemperatures. It also exhibited good thermal shock, vibration,\nand acoustic performance.\n\n160\t Industrial Productivity\t\n\nwhich radiated heat away from the surface it covered,\nthereby decreasing the amount of heat transferred to\nthe underlying material. PCCM not only increased the\ncapability of materials to withstand higher temperatures,\nit also exhibited impressive thermal shock, vibration,\nand acoustic performance. In addition, it proved to be\nresistant to abrasion and mechanical damage and was\nalso environmentally safe, due to it being water-based\nand containing no solvents. Even though funding for the\nX-33 and X-34 ended in 2001, PCCM continued on a\npath of innovation.\n\nPartnership\nShortly after Ames made PCCM available for licensing, Emisshield Inc. (then Wessex Incorporated) in\nBlacksburg, Virginia, stumbled upon the technology, and according to John Olver, president and\nCEO of Emisshield, \xe2\x80\x9cAfter we looked it over,\nanalyzed it, read about it, and checked on some\nof the references, we called Ames and said we\xe2\x80\x99d\nlike to license it. We wanted to know how they\ndid that.\xe2\x80\x9d\nOlver and other representatives from\nEmisshield talked to the NASA inventors\nto learn more about PCCM, and in\n1996, obtained a license for the\ntechnology. With assistance\nfrom the Center for\nAdhesion and Sealant\n\nSciences at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State\nUniversity (Virginia Tech), Emisshield performed\nextensive testing, research, and development of the\ncoating. By 2001, the company had expanded its license\nagreement to include all applications except space and\nspace vehicle applications.\nDuring the first few years, Emisshield made several\nchanges to make PCCM more practical to use. One of\nthe properties Emisshield adjusted was the shelf life of the\nmaterial. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you mixed it up, it set like concrete in\nabout an hour. You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t use it after that,\xe2\x80\x9d Olver says.\nEmisshield also modified PCCM so it would adhere to\nmetal and was easy to apply with a spray gun.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs we progressed, we took the base license and\nadvanced it into two new patents,\xe2\x80\x9d says Olver. \xe2\x80\x9cNASA\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s what we intended for you to do, to license it,\nmake it better, and commercialize it.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBenefits\nPreviously featured in Spinoff 2001 and Spinoff 2004,\nEmisshield provides its NASA-derived technology, also\ncalled Emisshield, in more than 20 different products.\nEach formulation is different based on the material it is\nbeing applied to as well as the temperature and conditions\nof the environment. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are changing the surface properties of existing materials\xe2\x80\x94metals, ceramics\xe2\x80\x94to improve\ntheir performance,\xe2\x80\x9d says Olver. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will work just about\nanywhere there is heat\xe2\x80\x94from electricity to manufacturing glass and plastic bottles.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAvailable for use on new or existing substrates in any\ncombustion process including metals, refractory (heat\nresistant material), ceramics, and high technology fabrics,\nEmisshield can provide significant savings for most energy\nconsuming, producing, or related heat systems. According\nto its customers, Emisshield has permitted heat-driven\nindustrial applications to experience up to a 15-percent\nenergy savings, a 15-percent increase in production, more\nuniform heating, prolonged substrate life, and reduced\ndowntime for maintenance. In fact, the company finds\nSpinoff 2011\n\nthe harder a process is pushed, the greater the fuel savings\nand the faster the payback for using Emisshield.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother thing that happens is that by improving\ncombustion of gasses and fuels, products are made with\nless energy, and that reduces air emissions,\xe2\x80\x9d says Olver.\nAll of this is done with a coating that is about as thin as a\nkitchen garbage bag. The coating can be applied to items\nat an Emisshield facility, or onsite at a customer\xe2\x80\x99s facility.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s unique because it is so easy to install, even in the\nfield and for applications that have extreme requirements.\nWe can go out, clean the surface, and then apply the\ncoating.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn hydrocarbon and chemical processing, Emisshield\ncan be used to coat the combustion chamber and process\ntubes of high temperature cracking units, as well as lower\ntemperature process heaters. Emisshield is applied to the\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe started the root system with NASA,\nthen the trunk, and now we\xe2\x80\x99re growing the\nbranches. We wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be here if it weren\xe2\x80\x99t for\ntechnology transfer from NASA.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x94John Olver, Emisshield Inc.\nprocess tubes and refractory walls, a combination that\ngenerates an increase in energy savings and production.\nLike applications in the hydrocarbon and chemical\nprocessing industry, power generation can also see similar\nbenefits while promoting better air emissions. Such\napplications include biomass boilers, waste incinerators,\nnatural gas boilers, heat recovery steam generators, and\nburners.\nFor metal production, applications include reheat\nfurnaces, bell annealing furnaces, walking beam fur-\n\nnaces, electric arc furnaces, and others. The increase in\ncombustion allows for a quicker heat up and cool down\nin an intermittent furnace, which saves manufacturers\ntime and money. Emisshield is also used in a variety of\nmultipurpose kilns including intermittent kilns and continuous kilns.\nOne of Emisshield\xe2\x80\x99s most popular applications is in\nfurnaces for making glass\xe2\x80\x94everything from wine bottles\nto windshields. So far, the coating has been applied to\n30 furnaces worldwide. \xe2\x80\x9cOn these big glass furnaces, they\nare saving about 10 percent of their energy,\xe2\x80\x9d says Olver.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe payback for our clients making glass is always under\na year.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAs the company moves forward, it strives to penetrate\nnew market areas. Recently, the company started focusing on introducing Emisshield in the food processing\nindustry. The company is working to apply the coating\non the walls of ovens, baking pans, and burners for commercial bread baking. \xe2\x80\x9cWe see lots of opportunities in\nthis market, and are hoping to push into it in the next\nfew years,\xe2\x80\x9d says Olver. \xe2\x80\x9cEmisshield could even be applied\nto the grills that people use at home. There are a lot of\npotential applications.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe newest application, however, is for high solar\nabsorptive materials for concentrated solar power generation stations. The company is currently working with an\nIsraeli-U.S. company in this area.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe started the root system with NASA, then the\ntrunk, and now we\xe2\x80\x99re growing our branches,\xe2\x80\x9d says Olver.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be here if it weren\xe2\x80\x99t for technology transfer\nfrom NASA.\xe2\x80\x9d v\n\nIndustrial\nProductivity\n\nEmisshield\xc2\xae is registered by Emisshield Inc.\n\nEmisshield Inc. licensed technology from NASA to incorporate into various formulations of coatings for high-temperature applications.\nThe images above show the walls of a boiler before (left) and after (right) the NASA-derived coating was applied.\n\nSpinoff 2011\t\n\nIndustrial Productivity\t 161\n\n'
