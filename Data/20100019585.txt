b'this specific appointment information\nentered in the application to generate\nreports and to keep track of active NASA\nastronauts\xe2\x80\x99 whereabouts at all times.\nAOSS can send or retrieve astronauts\xe2\x80\x99\nschedule information via their individual\nOutlook calendars with a two-part\nprocess called PUSH and PULL. This\nprocess, along with weekly operational\nprocedures agreed to by the users and\ncurrent astronaut corps staff, delivers optimal scheduling processing performance. AOSS also provides the ability to\ncreate reports, statistics, and situation information for many NASA offices. Displays of the software are designed to be\nfunctional and familiar by using the same\nformat design to ensure ease of use.\nThe software is composed of three\nmain components \xe2\x80\x94 AOSS Application,\nAOSS Web, and AOSS Database. In the\napplication, this is the main data entry\npoint where most of the AOSS-typical\ntransactions occur. AOSS users and the\nAOSS application perform data manipulation, reporting, and changes here. The\napplication is the main lifeline between\nthe user and the database. The AOSS\nWeb function allows users to use a Web\nbrowser environment to view information, print results, and transact with the\nresults of data entered in the AOSS database. This component contains a mixture\nof html and asp pages.\nThe main operation of the database\nis to hold data entered through the application component and to provide\nsecure access to this information by\nqualified AOSS users, customers, and\nmanagement. The database was developed in SQL and is held within an SQL\nserver database environment. Using\nthis system eliminates the need to prepare paper schedules and the time it\ntakes to distribute them to the astronauts as well as ensuring a faster delivery of updates and schedule changes.\nThis work was done by Estevancio Brown\nof United Space Alliance for Johnson Space\nCenter.

MSC-24384-1\n\n\xc2\xa9 ISS Solar Array Management\n\nThe International Space Station (ISS)\nSolar Array Management (SAM) software\ntoolset provides the capabilities necessary\nto operate a spacecraft with complex\nsolar array constraints. It monitors spacecraft telemetry and provides interpretations of solar array constraint data in an\nintuitive manner. The toolset provides extensive situational awareness to ensure\nmission success by analyzing power gen-\n\n20\t\n\neration needs, array motion constraints,\nand structural loading situations.\nThe software suite consists of several\ncomponents including samCS (constraint set selector), samShadyTimers\n(array shadowing timers), samWin (visualization GUI), samLock (array motion\nconstraint computation), and samJet\n(attitude control system configuration\nselector). It provides high availability\nand uptime for extended and continuous mission support. It is able to support two-degrees-of-freedom (DOF)\narray positioning and supports up to ten\nsimultaneous constraints with intuitive\n1D and 2D decision support visualizations of constraint data. Display synchronization is enabled across a networked control center and multiple\nmethods for constraint data interpolation are supported. Use of this software\ntoolset increases flight safety, reduces\nmission support effort, optimizes solar\narray operation for achieving mission\ngoals, and has run for weeks at a time\nwithout issues.\nThe SAM toolset is currently used in\nISS real-time mission operations.\nThis work was done by James P. Williams,\nKeith D. Martin, Justin R. Thomas, and\nSamuel Caro of United Space Alliance for\nJohnson Space Center. Further information is\ncontained in a TSP (see page 1). MSC24425-1\n\n7\n\nProbabilistic Structural\nAnalysis Program\n\nNASA/ NESSUS 6.2c is a general-purpose, probabilistic analysis program that\ncomputes probability of failure and\nprobabilistic sensitivity measures of engineered systems. Because NASA/ NESSUS uses highly computationally efficient and accurate analysis techniques,\nprobabilistic solutions can be obtained\neven for extremely large and complex\nmodels. Once the probabilistic response\nis quantified, the results can be used to\nsupport risk-informed decisions regarding reliability for safety-critical and oneof-a-kind systems, as well as for maintaining a level of quality while reducing\nmanufacturing costs for larger-quantity\nproducts. NASA/ NESSUS has been successfully applied to a diverse range of\nproblems in aerospace, gas turbine engines, biomechanics, pipelines, defense,\nweaponry, and infrastructure.\nThis program combines state-of-theart probabilistic algorithms with general-purpose structural analysis and lifting methods to compute the\nprobabilistic response and reliability of\n\nengineered structures. Uncertainties in\nload, material properties, geometry,\nboundary conditions, and initial conditions can be simulated. The structural\nanalysis methods include non-linear finite-element methods, heat -transfer\nanalysis, polymer/ ceramic matrix composite analysis, monolithic (conventional metallic) materials life-prediction\nmethodologies, boundary element\nmethods, and user-written subroutines.\nSeveral probabilistic algorithms are\navailable such as the advanced mean\nvalue method and the adaptive importance sampling method. NASA/NESSUS 6.2c is structured in a modular format with 15 elements.\nThis work was done by Shantaram S. Pai,\nChristos C. Chamis, Pappu L. N. Murthy, and\nGeorge L. Stefko of Glenn Research Center;\nDavid S. Riha and Ben H. Thacker of Southwest Research Institute; Vinod K. Nagpal of\nN& R Engineering and Subodh K. Mital of the\nUniversity of Toledo.

This program uses the\nGPS onboard receiver measurements to\nsequentially calculate the vehicle state\nvectors and provide this information to\nground flight controllers. It is the first\nreal-time ground-based shuttle navigation application using onboard sensors.\nThe program is compact, portable, selfcontained, and can run on a variety of\nUNIX or Linux computers.\nThe program has a modular objectoriented design that supports application-specific plugins such as data corruption remediation pre-processing and\nremote graphics display. The Kalman filter is extensible to additional sensor\ntypes or force models. The Kalman filter\ndesign is also strong against data\ndropouts because it uses physical models\nfrom state and covariance propagation\nin the absence of data.\nThe design of this program separates\nthe functionalities of SPOT into six dif-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, May 2010\n\n'
