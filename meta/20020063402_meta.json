The Dual CCD developed for SeaSpec is used in our FieldSpecO Dual UV/VNIR/CCD. This product is very popular for coastal research. It allows for a small suitcase sized spectrometer to be placed in a boat and the attached fiber optic cable can be lowered 30 feet below the surface allowing researchers to perform the same studies as SeaSpec just not at the deep-water depths. Most of the people who inquire about SeaSpec end up purchasing a FieldSpec Dual CCD.SeaSpec was designed to withstand harsh marine environments and depths up to 200 m. While it meets these requirements it is the only instrument of its kind and we consider it a prototype. The first version was released in April 1997. It was tested, we made modification and returned the product in March 1998.", "title": "Ocean View", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T12:47:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020063402, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020063402, "isbn": "0-16-050159-8", "id": "e45d35efb8a24998ac77f0cf49f43e60", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1999", "publicationDate": "1999-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020063402.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020063402/downloads/20020063402.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020063402/downloads/20020063402.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020063402/downloads/20020063402.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
