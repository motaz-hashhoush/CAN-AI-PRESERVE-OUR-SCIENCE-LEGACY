While about 10 percent of the delays were weather-related, over 65 percent were caused by payload/launch vehicle problems. The planned processing time was exceeded by more than two weeks in most cases. Nearly 30 percent of the payloads required some storage time.", "title": "Payload processing study for ELV launches", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-15T15:25:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19920055635, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Terhune, Creighton A."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA John F.
