The synthetic aperture radar images show unusual kilometer-sized features on the ocean surface which are related to clouds. The ocean near shore was cloud-free and had no radar features, while from 30 to 330 km offshore there were clouds and prominent kilometer-sized features in the SAR image. These radar features are most prominent when the radar was looking upwind, are less prominent when the radar was looking downwind, and disappear entirely when the radar was looking crosswind. Since ocean radar echo strengths are believed to be controlled primarily by ocean waves satisfying the Bragg relation, these radar features most likely resulted from local enhancements of short gravity waves with 17- to 34-cm wavelengths, which in turn are surface expressions of roll convections in a kilometer-thick unstable marine boundary layer.", "title": "Synthetic aperture radar observation of ocean roughness from rolls in an unstable marine boundary layer", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T01:26:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19840034426, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Thompson, T.
