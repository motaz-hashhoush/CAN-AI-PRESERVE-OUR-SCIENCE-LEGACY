b'Feature Detection Systems Enhance Satellite Imagery\nOriginating Technology/NASA Contribution\n\nI\n\nn 1963, during the ninth orbit of the Faith 7 capsule,\nastronaut Gordon Cooper skipped his nap and took\nsome photos of the Earth below using a Hasselblad\ncamera. The sole flier on the Mercury-Atlas 9 mission,\nCooper took 24 photos\xe2\x80\x94never-before-seen images\nincluding the Tibetan plateau, the crinkled heights of\nthe Himalayas, and the jagged coast of Burma. From his\nlofty perch over 100 miles above the Earth, Cooper noted\nvillages, roads, rivers, and even, on occasion, individual\nhouses.\nIn 1965, encouraged by the effectiveness of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s\norbital photography experiments during the Mercury and\nsubsequent Gemini manned space flight missions, U.S.\nGeological Survey (USGS) director William Pecora put\nforward a plan for a remote sensing satellite program that\nwould collect information about the planet never before\nattainable. By 1972, NASA had built and launched\nLandsat 1, the first in a series of Landsat sensors that have\ncombined to provide the longest continuous collection of\nspace-based Earth imagery. The archived Landsat data\xe2\x80\x94\n37 years worth and counting\xe2\x80\x94has provided a vast library\nof information allowing not only the extensive mapping\nof Earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface but also the study of its environmental\nchanges, from receding glaciers and tropical deforestation to urban growth and crop harvests. Developed and\nlaunched by NASA with data collection operated at\nvarious times by the Agency, the National Oceanic and\nAtmospheric Administration (NOAA), Earth Observation\nSatellite Company (EOSAT, a private sector partnership\nthat became Space Imaging Corporation in 1996), and\nUSGS, Landsat sensors have recorded flooding from\nHurricane Katrina, the building boom in Dubai, and the\nextinction of the Aral Sea, offering scientists invaluable\ninsights into the natural and manmade changes that shape\nthe world.\nOf the seven Landsat sensors launched since 1972,\nLandsat 5 and Landsat 7 are still operational. Though\n108\t Environmental and Agricultural Resources \t\n\nboth are in use well beyond their intended lifespans,\nthe mid-resolution satellites, which provide the benefit\nof images detailed enough to reveal large features like\nhighways while still broad enough for global coverage,\ncontinue to scan the entirety of the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface. In\n2012, NASA plans to launch the Landsat Data Continuity\nMission (LDCM), or Landsat 8, to extend the Landsat\nprogram\xe2\x80\x99s contributions to cartography, water management, natural disaster relief planning, and more.\n\nPartnership\nIn 2002, Geospatial Data Analysis Corporation\n(GDA), of State College, Pennsylvania, received a Phase I\nSmall Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract\nwith Stennis Space Center. (The company also engaged\nin a follow-on Phase II SBIR with Stennis.) The NASA\ncenter was seeking a new method for detecting clouds\nfor future use with Landsat 8. Cloud contamination is\na common problem with satellite imagery. For previous\nLandsat missions, NASA has used its Automated Cloud\nCover Assessment (ACCA) algorithm to estimate cloud\ncontamination in Landsat images. ACCA heavily relies on\nthermal data from the Landsat satellites\xe2\x80\x94thermal signals\nbeing the easiest method for cloud detection. Thermal\nsensors, however, are expensive additions to satellites, and\nLandsat 8 will not feature any in its array. GDA took on\nthe challenge of developing a new system that could accurately detect clouds without the benefit of thermal data.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe proposed that, in order to identify clouds automatically and without thermal data, you have to move\nbeyond the spectral signal in the imagery and into spatial\nfeature and pattern recognition,\xe2\x80\x9d says Dr. Stephanie\nHulina, GDA president and senior scientist. GDA\nemployed its SBIR funding to arrive at the embodiment of\nthis approach: the Cloud and Cloud Shadow Assessment\n(CASA) software.\nCASA is a highly automated feature detection/extraction system. The system contains global libraries of\nexpected spatial, visual, and near-infrared spectral and\n\nLaunched in 1999, Landsat 7 continues to provide stunning,\ndetailed images of Earth, like this shot of South Florida.\nImages like these provide unparalleled views of the impact of\nnatural and manmade factors on the health of the planet.\n\ncontextual signatures for the feature of interest (in this\ncase clouds and cloud shadows). For example, depending on the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s angle and viewpoint of the sensor, all of\nthe clouds in any particular image should have shadows\nin similar locations. CASA uses information like this to\nconfirm or reject elements in a given image as clouds. The\nsystem goes through an iterative, hierarchical self-learning\nprocess, identifying clouds based on a comparison to the\ncharacteristics in its global library. Definitive clouds are\nlogged in a local library for additional comparison, helping CASA learn with increasing accuracy how to identify\nclouds and cloud shadows. The system produces a raster\nSpinoff 2009\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo have the\nresearch and\ndevelopment\nfunding and\nthe backing\nof NASA to go\nout into the\ncommercial\nmarket has\nbeen key\nfor us.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nmask, showing per pixel cloud\nand cloud shadow contamination\nof the image. Clouds of different\ntypes can be assigned different\ncolor shades.\nWhen tested on Landsat 5 and\n7 images, CASA comes within 10\npercent of the visual cloud estimate for 94 percent of the images\ntested\xe2\x80\x94comparable to and often\nexceeding ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s capabilities.\n\xe2\x80\x9cCASA would be the perfect\ntechnology for the next-generation\nLandsat sensor,\xe2\x80\x9d says Hulina.\n\nDepartment of Agriculture (USDA) and the National\nGeospatial Intelligence Agency.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe NASA SBIR contracts allowed us to get our\nstart and develop our intellectual property using sound\nscience,\xe2\x80\x9d says Hulina. \xe2\x80\x9cTo have the research and development funding and the backing of NASA to go out into\nthe commercial market has been key for us.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHulina also notes that GDA has since branched\nout into other categories of feature detection. Using\nthe same technology it applied for CASA, GDA can\nprovide detection services for virtually any predefined\nclass of features. The company has entered into Phase\nIII SBIRs with the USGS and USDA Forest Service for\n\nthe development of feature detection systems for stream\nnetworks, riparian buffers (vegetated areas along streams\nor rivers), and certain land covers. The company also has\ncontracts from the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service\nfor detecting crop fields around the globe. GDA provides\nthese clients with outputs like crop acreage maps or flood\nmaps derived from the satellite imagery, allowing them\nto accurately evaluate key information about everything\nfrom agricultural production to the impact of pollution.\nAs concerns about the effects of climate change and\npopulation growth lead to a greater need for the valuable\ndata acquired through remote sensing, GDA\xe2\x80\x99s NASA\nSBIR-developed feature detection capabilities will likely\nbe in high demand. v\n\nProduct Outcome\nSince establishing CASA\xe2\x80\x99s effectiveness with Landsat\nimagery, GDA has taken advantage of the system\xe2\x80\x99s\nversatility and high level of automation to provide cloud\ndetection services for a host of space-based sensors.\nGDA has proven the CASA software effective for\ncloud and cloud shadow detection in high-resolution\nimagery from commercial satellites such as QuickBird\n(owned and operated by DigitalGlobe), SPOT (Spot\nImage), IKONOS, and OrbView (both GeoEye). The\ncompany also completed a NASA Dual-Use Technology\nDevelopment contract with Stennis to adapt the CASA\nalgorithms to the Indian Remote Sensing-P6 Advanced\nWide Field Sensor, or AWiFS, data. CASA\xe2\x80\x99s automation\nenables it to process large data sets in short periods\nof time, allowing GDA to guarantee return of cloud\nmasks within minutes of receiving the raw data on its\nservers. Using the CASA output, GDA can also remove\nidentified clouds and cloud shadows on a per pixel basis,\nbackfill them, and radiometrically normalize the changes\nfrom one image to another\xe2\x80\x94all without the lengthy\nand expensive process of removing them by hand. The\ncompany counts a number of private remote sensing\nimagery firms among its CASA clients, as well as the U.S.\nSpinoff 2009\t\n\nFrom a satellite image of a South American river valley (left), GDA\xe2\x80\x99s feature detection system produced a detailed map of\nsoybean crop fields (right), revealed in yellow.
