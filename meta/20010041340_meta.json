In addition, we model the important, unobserved EUV emission both from the hot gas responsible for the SXRB and from a possible evaporative boundary between the LIC and the hot gas. We show that these ionization sources can provide the necessary ionization and heating of the cloud to match observations. Including the radiation from the conductive boundary, while not required, does improve the agreement with observations of the temperature of the LIC. The ionization predicted in our models shows good agreement with pickup ion results, interstellar absorption line data towards epsilon CMa, and EUV opacity measurements of nearby white dwarf stars. The areas of disagreement point to a possible underabundance (relative to solar abundance) of neon in the LIC. The presence of dust in the cloud, or at least depleted abundances, is necessary to maintain the heating/cooling balance and reach the observed temperature.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20010041340, "id": "faa7b92c502d4339bdbd97ecc57662c3", "publicationDate": "2001-04-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20010041340.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20010041340/downloads/20010041340.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20010041340/downloads/20010041340.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20010041340/downloads/20010041340.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
