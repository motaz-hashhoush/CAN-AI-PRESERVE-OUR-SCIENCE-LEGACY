The mission design underpinning this program is a critical aspect inthe integration of the multiple vehicles, processes, and capabilities to execute the most demanding human spaceflightmissions to date. Frequently mission design is characterized solely by its trajectory and the associated delta-velocityto achieve the end-to-end mission on a single day of flight. However, in practical terms for spaceflight missions,actual performance must characterize the translation delta-velocity demand, integrated power and thermal, crew dayoperations, commodities limitations, launch vehicle opportunities, and numerous additional factors across numerouslaunch day dependent variables. These factors together provide a unified set of mission design constraints that mustall be met in order to execute a fully integrated mission. The frequency of achieving all of the mission designconstraints is thus characterized as mission availability. The mission availability reflects the number of opportunitiesin any given period (month, year, etc.) for which an end-to-end mission could be launched. Ensuring adequatemission availability for the Artemis Program is necessary to support long term viability and sustainability of humanlunar exploration. This paper will characterize the driving factors in the Artemis mission availability includingvehicle specific effects from the Space Launch System (SLS), Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle, Gateway, HumanLanding System (HLS) and other contributing projects. This analysis will also summarize the relevant factors thatfuture vehicles and projects should consider for  the integration and expansion of exploration capabilities with theArtemis Program.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "cui": {"isCui": false}, "meetings": [{"country": "FR", "submissionId": 20220012445, "endDate": "2022-09-22T05:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": " International Astronautical Federation"}}, "meetingId": "373da2cb95c24b97950368449b317a3d", "id": "bca6a4de7e71480ba4635ebe99a7c901"}], "name": "73rd International Astronautical Congress (IAC)", "location": "Paris", "id": "373da2cb95c24b97950368449b317a3d", "url": "https://www.iafastro.org/events/iac/iac-2022/", "startDate": "2022-09-18T05:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "name": "IAC2022_LunarMissionAvailability_Paper.docx", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20220012445/downloads/IAC2022_LunarMissionAvailability_Paper.docx", "pdf": "/api/citations/20220012445/downloads/IAC2022_LunarMissionAvailability_Paper.docx.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20220012445/downloads/IAC2022_LunarMissionAvailability_Paper.docx.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
