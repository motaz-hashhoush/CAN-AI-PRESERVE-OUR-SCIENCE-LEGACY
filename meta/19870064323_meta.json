A complete set of energy equations developed by Brennan and Vincent (1980) was partitioned into zonal and eddy components; the eddy forms of energy were derived from a grid point's departure from the zonal average over a 5-deg latitude belt. The results of the analysis indicate that the eddy kinetic energy content (KE) is greater than the eddy available potential energy content (AE) throughout the period. Both AE and KE show large losses beginning when the SPCZ enters a decaying state: AE shows a gradual but slow decrease until after January 22, when it decreases rapidly; KE oscillates, reaching a maximum on January 22 before a rapid decrease.", "title": "Comparison between the South Pacific Convergence Zone and South Atlantic Convergence Zone in January 1979", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-13T05:44:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19870064323, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Vincent, Dayton G."}, "organization": {"name": "Purdue Univ.", "location": "West Lafayette, IN, United States"}}, "id": "c687831cf85043faa7b202872b5dae1f"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19870064323, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Hurrell, James W."}, "organization": {"name": "Purdue University", "location": "West Lafayette, IN, United States"}}, "id": "b0b5035010724790acb4813756e2843e"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19870064323, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Huang, Huo-Jin"}, "organization": {"name": "North Carolina, University", "location": "Asheville, United States"}}, "id": "50ccb2e0688c4127a9928d49b502c7be"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19870064323, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19870064323, "id": "3c4ad2db314d4648a82abf4dc52985f5", "publicationDate": "1986-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
