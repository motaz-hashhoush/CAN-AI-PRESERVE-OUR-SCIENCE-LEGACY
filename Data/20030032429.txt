These are expensive to maintain and\noperate and cover only limited geographical areas. Future spaceports will require new technologies to\nprovide greater launch and landing opportunities, support simultaneous missions, and offer enhanced\ndecision support models and simulation capabilities. These ranges must also have lower costs and\nreduced complexity while continuing to provide unsurpassed safety to the public, flight crew, personnel,\nvehicles and facilities. Commercial and government space-based assets for tracking and communications\noffer many attractive possibilities to help achieve these goals. Figure 1 demonstrates the primary existing\nEastern and Western Range instrumentation sites and a possible future space-based configuration.\n\nSpace-Based Range and Range Safety Today & Future\n\n-L+8.5 MN .........................\n\n........... ................ ..............\n................\n\nI\n\n................\n\n..... ...............\n\n.............................\n\nEWRS 0\n\nFigure 1. The existing range Eastern and Western Range assets are shown in red. A possible\nspace-based configuration is shown in blue. Note that some launch head ground-based assets\nwill still be needed for visibility and rapid response times shortly after liftoff.\nThis paper describes two NASA proof-of-concept projects that seek-toexploit the advantages of a\nspace-based range: Iridium Flight Modem and Space-Based Telemetry and Range Safety (STARS).\nIridium Flight Modem uses the commercial satellite system Iridium for extremely low cost, low rate twoway communications and has been successfully tested on four aircraft flights. A sister project at Goddard\nSpace Flight Center\xe2\x80\x99s (GSFC) Wallops Flight Facility (WFF) using the Globalstar system has been tested\non one rocket. The basic Iridium Flight Modem system consists of a L1 carrier Coarse/Acquisition\n(C/A)-Code Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, an on-board computer, and a standard commercial\n\n1\n\nsatellite modem and antennas. STARS uses the much higher data rate NASA owned Tracking and Data\nRelay Satellite System (TDRSS), a C/A-Code GPS receiver, an experimental low-power transceiver,\ncustom built command and data handler processor, and digitized flight termination system (FTS)\ncommands. STARS is scheduled to fly on an F-15 at Dryden Flight Research Center in the spring of\n2003, with follow-on tests over the next several years.\n\nIridium Flight Modem\nBackground\nIridium Flight Modem is a joint project at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) and Wallops Flight Facility\n(WFF) to investigate the feasibility of using the Iridium satellite system for low-rate full duplex two-way\ncommunications (GPS tracking data and commands). Flight Modem uses COTS communications\nequipment (Motorola 9500 series modems), a high dynamics Ashtech G-12 C/A-Code GPS receiver and a\nPC-104 computer. The target applications for this project are tracking and telemetry for weather balloons\n(tracking weather balloons is the most frequently used application for the Ranges\xe2\x80\x99 radars), manned and\nunmanned aircraft tracking and commanding, and possibly two-way backup communications system for\nrockets. KSC has tested Iridium Flight Modem during four aircraft flights by sending GPS data to ground\nmodems via Iridium Flight Modems, recording and comparing this data with other tracking data, and\nmaking a first attempt at measuring the total data latency. These tests are described in more detail in the\nfollowing sections.\n\nFigure 2. A typical snapshot of the GPS satellites (yellow)\nand Iridium satellites (red) in view during the first flight test.\nIridium is a commercial, global cell phone system with worldwide coverage provided by 66 Low\nEarth Orbit (LEO) satellites equally spaced in 6 orbital planes at an altitude of 780 km. There are 48 spot\nbeams per satellite, each with a diameter of about 48 km (30 miles) on the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface. (Note: the\ndecreasing spot size with altitude decreases high altitude coverage). L-band frequencies are used for the\nuplinWdownlink segments and the signaling is frequency division multiple accesdtime division multiple\naccess (FDMmDMA). The guaranteed data rate is 2400 bps with a 12 dB link margin, although this\n\n2\n\ncan be increased to 3800 bps with a larger link margin. The primary gateway is in Tempe, AZ and there is\na DOD gateway in Hawaii. The main satellite ground control station is in Leesburg, VA; a backup\nfacility is being added in Chandler, AZ. The current cost of modems is -$1,200. The price is estimated\nto drop to $200. Airtime is currently -$0.80 per minute and may also decrease in the future.\nVarious types of connections are available: mobile to Public Switched Telephone Network\n(PSTN), PSTN to mobile, mobile-to-mobile, and direct Internet where Iridium is the internet service\nprovider. Short burst messaging capability is in beta testing and mobile-to-direct Internet I is planned\nP\nfor the future.\n\nFlight Test 1\nOn 22 March 2002, a prototype Iridium Flight Modem using a DOS-based operating system was\ntested on a privately owned Piper Cherokee flying in and around KSC airspace. This was a flight of\nopportunity that was also testing a COTS 900 MHz wireless spread-spectrum frequency-hopping line-ofsight system for certification of the Microwave Scanning Beam Landing System (MSBLS) and Tactical\nAir Navigation System (TACAN) installations at the Shuttle landing sites.\nIridium Flight Modem sent GPS position data at 1800 bps via the Iridium satellite and ground\nnetwork (Figure 2 ) to a modem in the KSC industrial area where it was displayed in real-time and\nrecorded for post-flight analysis. The 900 MHz wireless system sent data to a ground station at the south\nend of the Shuttle Landing Facility (SLF) where it was recorded and used as truth for the post-flight\nanalysis. A data flow diagram for the Flight Modem system is shown in Figure 3.\n\n4&\nGPS Satellite\n\n+\nIridiumSatellite\n\nIridium Satellite\n\nIridium & GPS\n\nFG104 Linw\n\nAshtech G12 GFS\n\nIridium Ground\nStation\nReroutes the call\n\nIridium Ground\n\nIridium Network\n\nUDP Data\nto outside\nNetwork\n\n+\n\nFigure 3. The configuration of Iridium Flight Modem during the first two test flights.\n\n3\n\nThe 2.4-hour flight from Merritt Island Airport (MIA) followed a path typical of the flight\ninspection routes flown by the Shuttle landing aids certifications program for MSBLS and TACAN.\nBecause this was a shakedown flight, the flight maneuvers were very benign with speeds around 100\nknots, altitudes below 9000 ft, and slow turns. The Iridium Flight Modem did not maintain a continuous\ncommunications link throughout the flight due to hardware and software problems, recording only 20\nminutes of data. The hardware problems were straightforward and easily fixed: a loose radio frequency\ncable and an intermittent power switch. The software problems were more involved. The most\nsignificant problem was re-establishing a link due to the set-up of the AT Command set. There were also\nproblems with the buffering, resulting in much of the data being retransmitted. Nevertheless, both the\nIridium Flight Modem and the 900 MHz wireless system worked under benign flight conditions and the\ntest was deemed a success. The results were reported in document KSC-YA-5896. The problems were\naddressed and another flight test performed.\n\nFlight Test 2\nOn 31 May 2002, after changing to a Linux operating system and correcting the\nretransmission problem, a second flight test of the Iridium Flight Modem was flown on the same private\nplane out of MIA. The flight lasted about 45 minutes and flew a series of banked turns and spirals over\nthe Atlantic Ocean off the coast of KSC. Only one dropout was recorded when the plane was making a\n60\xe2\x80\x9d banked turn. There were no problems re-establishing the link, although it did take about 30 seconds.\nThe buffering problem did not reoccur. The 1800 bps position data was again displayed real-time at KSC\nand recorded for post-flight analysis. Data from an onboard GPS system was recorded and used for postflight analysis. This was a very successful test and demonstrated Mobile-to-Mobile Iridium throughput at\n1800 bps for GPS data.\n\nFlight Tests 3 and 4\nFlight Tests 3 and 4 were flights of opportunity on a P-3 Orion flying out of WFF. Another\nmessage containing velocity information was added and the transmission rate was increased to 2 Hz for\nboth the position and velocity messages (about 3400 bps total). Plans were made to measure the data\nlatency using one of the atomic clocks at KSC and the time in the GPS data messages. As before, the\nFlight Modem data was sent to KSC via the Iridium satellite and ground network, displayed real-time and\nrecorded for post-flight analysis. The data was also sent to WFF using Universal Datagram Protocol\n(UDP) via a PSTN landline. GPS, velocity and attitude data from the on-board P3 navigation systems\nwere made available for post-flight analysis.\nFlight Test 3 was a 3-hour round-trip flight from WFF to Greensboro, NC on 19 June 2002.\nThere was one long dropout in the beginning for about 30 minutes. Once the link was reestablished the\ndata was more reliable, with other dropouts lasting from 30-120 s. Flight Test 4 was a 3 1/2 hour flight\nfrom WFF to Iowa on 24 June 2002 for a geophysical mapping operation. There were fewer data\ndropouts than on any of the other tests, none longer than 120 s.\nThe data latency averaged 0.72 s from \xe2\x80\x9cdata sent\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cdata received\xe2\x80\x9d. Comparisons between the\nP3 navigation data and the Iridium Flight Modem data indicated that the largest position differences were\nabout 0.0025\xe2\x80\x99 latitude and about 0.003\xe2\x80\x9d longitude, with the averages about a factor of three smaller,\ncorresponding to typical horizontal differences of about 150 m. Unfortunately, it was not possible to\ncompare altitude differences because the aircraft was using a radar altimeter and the GPS receiver in the\nIridium Flight Modem measured height above the reference ellipsoid. Differences in ground track and\nground speed were less than about 3\xe2\x80\x9d and 1 m/s, respectively.\n\nOngoing Research\nSince these tests, the modems have been upgraded to Motorola 9505 modems with better\nshielding and an extended AT command set; the system redial time is down to 10 s; and the operating\nsystem has been upgraded to VxWorks.\n\n4\n\nResearch is underway to increase the data rate and reliability by using two modems\nsimultaneously. One idea is to have two modems multiplexed together, so that if one fails, the other\nmodem will continue sending data at half the data rate when both are functioning. Another possibility is\nto have one of the modems acting as a hot standby so that one modem is always sending data. If the first\nshould fail, the second modem will start sending data immediately, resulting (theoretically) in no delay.\nA third idea is to have one modem always sending data down while the second receives commands from\nthe ground. If the first fails, the second modem sends the data down to the ground as the primary\ninformation.\nThe latency issue is being evaluated with the goal of reducing it to 0.1 s. KSC is investigating the\nlimits of the applicability (e.g. maximum altitude and speed) of the Iridium Flight Modem for various\naerospace vehicles using simulations (in particular Satellite Tool Kit). Work is also underway on\ncompressing the data to increase the effective data rate by transmitting the data in binary format and\nmaximizing the use of all bits in the data string; by transmitting differential values to effectively shorten\nthe number of bytes required; by transmitting only essential fields in the GPS messages; and by lowering\nthe ratio of absolute to incremental fields.\n\nFuture Flight Tests\nAdditional aircraft and balloon tests will be done as opportunities become available. A sounding\nrocket test combining both Iridium and Globalstar Flight Modem at either WFF or White Sands is\nplanned within the next year.\n\nSTARS\nBackground\nSTARS is a multifaceted and multi-center NASA project to determine the feasibility of using\nTDRSS and GPS to provide reliable communication, telemetry and tracking for a variety of launch\nvehicles. STARS is based on two proposals submitted by Dryden Flight Research Center (DFRC) and\nKSCIGoddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) to the Second Generation Reusable Launch Vehicle Project to\nreduce launch costs and increase capability. These two proposals were combined into a single study\nproposal that was accepted and funded in January 2001. STARS has recently been funded for\ncontinuation under the new Next Generation Launch Technology (NGLT) Program.\nSTARS is comprised of the Range Safety and Range User systems. The hardware in the Range\nSafety system includes an Ashtech 2-12 L1,L2 C/A-Code GPS receiver for metric tracking, a new\nversatile low-power multi-channel transceiver (LPT) by lTT and a state-of-the-art custom built flight\nprocessor (Command & Data Handler - C&DH). The Range Safety system also includes digitized FTS\ncommands, a custom 10 kbps telemetry format, and digitized 400 bps FTS forward link. The Range User\nside uses broad bandwidth communications (-400 kbps) for voice, video and vehicle/payload data.\nFigure 4 shows the basic system for the first flight demonstration described in\' more detail below.\n\n5\n\nFigure 4. The basic system for STARS Flight Demonstration 1\nscheduled to begin March 2003 at Dryden Flight Research Center.\n\nFlight Demonstration #1\nThe first set of test flights are scheduled for March-April, 2003 on an F-15B at Dryden Flight\nResearch Center. Eight flights are planned to test the system during a variety of maneuvers and speeds at\naltitudes up to 40k feet. These include straight and level flight, 45" climb/70" descent, rolls at rates up to\n2OO0/s, turns at up to 4 g\' s, cloverleafs, pushover/pull-ups, long distance over-the-horizon (from the\n"launch head") and supersonic flight. A simplified data flow diagram is shown in Figure 5. The 10 kbps\nRange Safety data will be sent in near real-time to KSC and GSFC. KSC will be able to visualize the\ntracking using three-dimensional graphics and display many other parameters.\nThe primary goals of the first demonstration include verification of the ability to acquire the\nsatellites and tests of the LFT and C&DH under flight conditions. Of particular interest are the\nperformance of the digitized FTS commands, the telemetry processing and the coverage of the antennas.\nAs Figure 4 shows, there will be antennas on the top and bottom of the aircraft for the GPS, Range Safety\nand Range User TDRS links. AI1 data sent from and received on the ground will be recorded for postflight analysis. Acquisition, reacquisition and signal lock will be correlated with attitude rates recorded\nby the onboard aircraft instrumentation system. The link margins will be characterized and the 10 kbps\nreturn link Range Safety telemetry data (GPS data, LPT and FTS status) verified. The Range User side\nwill test only the return link using COTS hardware providing approximately 400 kbps data rate (voice,\nvideo, data). The recorded 400 bps FTS commands will be used to characterize the forward bit error rate.\nThe vehicle will be tracked by ground-based radar and this data will be also be available for post-flight\nanalysis and comparison.\n\n6\n\nSTARS Configuration\nFliaht Demonstration 1\n\n\\\n\nDFRC ATF\n\nFigure 5. A simplified data flow diagram for STARS.\n\nFlight Demonstration #2\nThe second set of test flights is currently scheduled to begin in September 2004 on the NASA\nF-15B at DFRC. The basic goals are to meet the Range Safety requirements and increase the data rate on\nthe Range User side. Specifically, the goals include: meet and verify the command and data latency,\nachieve and verify 95% spherical antenna coverage, implement Enhanced Flight Termination System\n(EFTS) forward link data protocol, provide encryption on the forward FTS commands, achieve 5-7 Mbps\nRange User return link data rates using an enhanced Range User transceiver and Ku-band phased array\nantenna, measure the carrier-to-noise ratio, handoff between 2 TDRS satellites in flight, and verify the\nvehicle\xe2\x80\x99s attitude with an onboard inertial measurement unit.\n\nFlight Demonstration #3\nThe schedule is for a hypersonic flight in January 2006. SR-71, X-33, X-34, and X-43 were\npotential vehicles at the time the proposal was written, but the SR-71, X-33, and X-34 are no longer\navailable, and the X-43 is too small to fly the STARS hardware. STARS is looking for flight\nopportunities on other recoverable vehicles, or maybe an expendable launch vehicle if the equipment can\nbe recovered. The X-37, X-43C and Kissler K-1 are possible options.\n\n7\n\nInteragency and Intercenter Cooperation\nFlight Modem and STARS are excellent examples of collaboration and partnerships between\nmany of the NASA centers, their support contractors and the United States Air Force.\nNine NASA facilities as well as the Eastern and Western Ranges are involved in STARS. These\ncontributions include:\nMarshall Space Flight Center: Funding via Next Generation Launch Technology Program\nKennedy Space Center: Program management, flight processor, post-flight analysis\ne\nGoddard Space Flight Center: Flight hardware, TDRSS and communications support\nWallops Flight Facility: Engineering support, environmental testing\nDryden Flight Research Center: Flight hardware, flight test vehicle and range support\nGlenn Research Center: Preliminary research and analysis\nWhite Sands Complex: TDRSS and communications support\nJohnson Space Center: Micro-processor development\nJet Propulsion Laboratory: FTS printed circuit board design\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\ne\n\nAir Force 45th and 30th Space Wing Range Safety: Loaner equipment for the RU system for\nDemo 1, design-review support representing the Range Safety requirements and interest\n\nFlight Modem is a smaller project than STARS, involving mainly KSC and WFF, but the\ncooperation has been just as superb as with STARS. A number of the participants are active in both of\nthese, and other Advanced Range Technologies projects.\nThe Air Force Range Safety community has been very responsive and helpful, always willing to\nanswer questions and attend reviews and demonstrations.\n\nCost Benefits\nThe driving factors for STARS and Flight Modem are increased capabilities at reduced costs.\nAccording to the Report of the Defense Science Board Task Force on Air Force Space Launch Facilities,\nJune 2000, the estimated cost of operating both the Eastern and Western Ranges was $573M in FYOO.\nThe estimated savings of using a predominately space-based range instead of the existing predominately\nground-based range - after development of the telemetry system and elimination of unnecessary range\nsupport equipment - is approximately $30M to $40M per year. Using GPS for metric tracking would\neliminate the need for a number of the radars, saving an estimated $20M to $30M per year. After initial\ndevelopment and installation, there could be an additional savings over the years from what would be\nrequired to continue to upgrade and operate the radar infrastructure. The space relay of GPS data, vehicle\ntelemetry and FTS commands could save an additional $1 1M per year.\n\nConclusion\nSpace-based communications projects like Flight Modem and STARS should help lead to a\nspace-based range and its many advantages, namely the increased capability for more launches from more\nlocations, decreased turnaround times and reduced ground-based infrastructure. This should be\naccomplished while paying only for the services needed from satellite providers, instead of ultimately\npaying the direct costs to support an entire range that is often idle.\nHowever, while a space-based range has many advantages, it is important to keep in mind that\nspace-based assets cannot replace all ground-based systems. The requirements for quick response times\nshortly after liftoff, external visualization of the vehicle for troubleshooting and debris tracking, among\nothers, will continue to demand some ground-based assets. The key to successful future spaceports will\nbe to use all available assets, ground and space-based, as intelligently as possible.\n\n8\n\n'
