b'The Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM)\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is developing a robotic mission to visit a\nlarge near-Earth asteroid (NEA), collect a multi-ton boulder from its surface, and redirect it into a stable\norbit around the Moon. Once returned to cislunar space in the mid-2020s, astronauts will explore the\nboulder and return to Earth with samples. This Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM) is part of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s plan to\nadvance the technologies, capabilities, and spaceflight experience needed for a human mission to the\nMartian system in the 2030s. Subsequent human and robotic missions to the asteroidal material would\nalso be facilitated by its return to cislunar space. Although ARM is primarily a capability demonstration\nmission (i.e., technologies and associated operations), there exist significant opportunities to advance\nour knowledge of small bodies in the synergistic areas of science, planetary defense, asteroidal\nresources and in-situ resource utilization (ISRU), and capability and technology demonstrations. In order\nto maximize the knowledge return from the mission, NASA is organizing an ARM Investigation Team,\nwhich is being preceded by the Formulation Assessment and Support Team. These teams will be\ncomprised of scientists, technologists, and other qualified and interested individuals to help plan the\nimplementation and execution of ARM. An overview of robotic and crewed segments of ARM, including\nthe mission requirements, NEA targets, and mission operations, will be provided along with a discussion\nof the potential opportunities associated with the mission.\n\n'
