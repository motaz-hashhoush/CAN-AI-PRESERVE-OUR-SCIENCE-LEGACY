b'slotted configuration of the waveguide/antenna structure makes the device scalable to larger areas and higher\npowers. All that is needed for scaling up\nis the attachment of additional matched\nradiating slots along the length of the discharge chamber. If it is desired to make\nthe power per slot remain constant in\nscaling up, then the input microwave\npower must be increased accordingly.\nUnlike in prior ECR microwave\nplasma-generating devices, there is no\nneed for an insulating window on the\n\nantenna. Such windows are sources of\ncontamination and gradually become ineffective as they become coated with erosion products over time. These characteristics relegate prior ECR microwave\nplasma-generating devices to non-ion\nbeam, non-deposition plasma applications. In contrast, the lack of need for an\ninsulating window in the present device\nmakes it possible to use the device in\nboth ion-beam (including deposition)\nand electron-beam applications. The device is designed so that ECR takes place\n\nabove each slot and the gradient of the\nmagnetic field at each slot is enough to\nprevent backflow of plasma.\nThis work was done by John E.

(To\nsome extent, the resolution of the strain\ngauge can be tailored and may be extensible to 0.01 microstrain.) The total cost\nof the hardware components of this\nstrain gauge is less than $100 at 2006\nprices. In comparison with prior strain\ngauges capable of measurement of such\nlow strains, this strain gauge is more accurate, more economical, and more robust, and it operates at a higher update\nrate. Strain gauges like this one are useful mainly for measuring small strains\n(including those associated with vibrations) in such structures as rocket test\nstands, buildings, oilrigs, bridges, and\ndams. The technology was inspired by\nthe need to measure very small strains\non structures supporting liquid oxygen\ntanks, as a way to measure accurately\nmass of liquid oxygen during rocket engine testing.\nThis improved fiber-optic strain gauge\nwas developed to overcome some of the\n\ndeficiencies of both traditional foil\nstrain gauges and prior fiber-optic strain\ngauges. Traditional foil strain gages do\nnot have adequate signal-to-noise ratios\nat such small strains. Fiber-optic strain\ngauges have been shown to be potentially useful for measuring such small\nstrains, but heretofore, the use of fiberoptic strain gauges has been inhibited,\nvariously, by complexity, cost, or low update rate.\nThe improved fiber-optic strain\ngauge is partially composed of a multimode fiber optic which is wound in an\nelliptical pattern and bonded to the\nstructure of interest. A laser is fixed\nwithin an adjustable cylindrical steel enclosure and aimed at one end of the optical fiber. The laser light emerging\nfrom the other end of the fiber forms a\nspeckle pattern that changes as strain is\napplied to the structure. The speckle\npattern is intercepted by an array of\nphotocells, so that any change in the\nspeckle pattern manifests itself in\nchanges in the intensities of light measured by the individual photocells. The\n\noutputs of the photocells are collected\nby a customized data-acquisition system\nthat includes a signal-conditioning subsystem. The photocell outputs are then\nfed to a neural network that recognizes\nthe correlation between changes in the\noutputs and changes in strain.\nInasmuch as the changes in the intensities of light incident on the photocells\nare repeatable for a given amount of\nchange in strain, the neural network can\nbe quickly trained by use of speckle patterns associated with known levels of\nstrain. For measurement of temporally\nvarying strain (for example, when vibrations are present), the update rate and,\nhence, the dynamic analysis rate depends on the data-acquisition rate.\nThis work was done by Fernando Figueroa\nof Stennis Space Center and Ajay Mahajan,\nMohammad Sayeh, and Bradley Regez of\nSouthern Illinois University, Carbondale.\nInquiries concerning rights for the commercial use of this invention should be addressed\nto Intellectual Property Manager, NASA Stennis Space Center; (228) 688-1929.

With appropriate modifications, the lens design\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, July 2007\n\nform can be tailored to cover the range of\nresponse of the focal-plane array, from Si\n(400\xe2\x80\x931,000 nm) to InGaAs (400\xe2\x80\x931,700 or\n2,100 nm) or InSb/HgCdTe reaching to\n2,500 nm. For reference, lenses typically\n\nare achromatized over the visible wavelength range of 480\xe2\x80\x93650 nm.\nIn remote sensing applications, there is\na need for broadband achromatic telescopes, normally satisfied with mirror-\n\n23\n\nbased systems. However, mirror systems\nare not always feasible due to size or geometry restrictions. They also require expensive aspheric surfaces. Non-obscured mirror systems can be difficult to align and\nhave a limited (essentially one-dimensional) field of view. Centrally obscured\ntypes have a two-dimensional but very limited field in addition to the obscuration.\nTelecentricity is a highly desirable property for matching typical spectrometer\ntypes, as well as for reducing the variation\nof the angle of incidence and cross-talk on\nthe detector for simple camera types.\nThis rotationally symmetric telescope\nwith no obscuration and using spherical surfaces and selected glass types fills\na need in the range of short focal\nlengths. It can be used as a compact\nfront unit for a matched spectrometer,\nas an ultra-broadband camera objective\nlens, or as the optics of an integrated\ncamera/spectrometer in which the\nwavelength information is obtained by\nthe use of strip or linear variable filters\non the focal plane array. This kind of\ncamera and spectrometer system can\nfind applications in remote sensing, as\nwell as in-situ applications for geologi-\n\n24\n\ncal mapping and characterization of\nminerals, ecological studies, and target\ndetection and identification through\nspectral signatures. Commercially, the\nlens can be used in quality-control applications via spectral analysis.\nThe lens design is based on the rear\nlandscape lens with the aperture stop in\nfront of all elements. This allows sufficient room for telecentricity in addition\nto making the stop easily accessible. The\ncrucial design features are the use of a\ndoublet with an ultra-low dispersion glass\n(fluorite or S-FPL53), and the use of a\nstrong negative element, which enables\nflat field and telecentricity in conjunction\nwith the last (field lens) element. The\nfield lens also can be designed to be in\ncontact with the array, a feature that is desirable in some applications.\nThe lens has a 20\xc2\xb0 field of view, for a\n50-mm focal length, and is corrected\nover the range of wavelengths of\n450\xe2\x80\x932,300 nm. Transverse color, which\nis the most pernicious aberration for\nspectroscopic work, is controlled at the\nlevel of 1 \xce\xbcm or below at 0.7 \xce\xbcm field\nand 5 \xce\xbcm at full field. The maximum\nchief ray angle is less than 1.7\xc2\xb0, provid-\n\ning good telecentricity. An additional\nfeature of this lens is that it is made exclusively with glasses that provide good\ntransmission up to 2,300 nm and even\nsome transmission to 2,500 nm; thus,\nthe lens can be used in applications\nthat cover the entire solar-reflected\nspectrum. Alternative realizations are\npossible that provide enhanced resolution and even less transverse color over\na narrower wavelength range.\nThis work was done by Pantazis Mouroulis\nof Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
