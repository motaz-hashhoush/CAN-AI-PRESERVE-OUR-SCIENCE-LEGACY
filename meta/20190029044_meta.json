Combining creative orbital mechanics, robotic mining and process automation techniques, humanity can use lunar resources to generate the necessary propellant to support the transportation of cargo and humans between multiple points in the cis-lunar space. Robotic systems could collect water by either directly collecting the water entrained in the lunar regolith or by processing minerals found in the lunar regolith. These robotic systems could then electrolyze the water to generate high quality hydrogen and oxygen propellant and capitalize on the very low temperatures (< 15 Kelvin) in permanently shadowed regions (PSR) to maintain these propellants in a cryogenic state. Uncrewed service vehicles could distribute this lunar-generated resource throughout the cis-lunar space to intermediary waystations, like the Gateway. These platforms enable larger payloads into Low Earth Orbit (LEO) by providing the propellant necessary to travel through the cis-lunar space without requiring launch mass to lift the propellant and supporting tankage into LEO from the Earth's surface. Delivering 1 kg to LEO from the lunar surface reduces the propellant mass of the launch vehicle from Earth by 7 kg to 11.3 kg, depending on the final destination. By leveraging resources among multiple nations and corporations, this exploration infrastructure potentially can be both fiscally self-supporting and enable more organizations to sustain a human presence on the moon.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "Spain", "submissionId": 20190029044, "endDate": "2019-06-30T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Department of Energy (DOE)", "location": "Washington, DC, United States"}}, "meetingId": "30366067904b425b9d0f23c53640fc2c", "id": "f55395f2a3e14942842c3fb19eb39a5a"}], "name": "Hydrogen-Metal Systems Gordon Research Conference (GRC)", "location": "Castelldefels", "id": "30366067904b425b9d0f23c53640fc2c", "startDate": "2019-06-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20190029044, "id": "515d4006258a4903aa3b974be48f1cf0", "publicationDate": "2019-06-30T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20190029044.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20190029044/downloads/20190029044.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20190029044/downloads/20190029044.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20190029044/downloads/20190029044.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
