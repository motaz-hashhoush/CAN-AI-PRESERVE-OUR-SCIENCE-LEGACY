b"May 1964\n\n\t\n\nBrief 63-10424\n\nNASA TECH BRIEF\nThis NASA Tech Brief is issued by the Technology Utilization Division to acquaint industry\nwith the technical content of an innovation derived from the NASA space program.\n\nVariable Light Source With a Million-To-One Intensity Ratio\n\nCam(\n\nLight Output\n\nN\n\n.\n\nThe problem: Development of a wide-range\nvariable-intensity light source of constant color\ncharacteristics, that can be used for the testing and\ncalibration of photo-multiplier tubes.\n\nThe solution: A light attenuator having a 1,000,000\nto 1 intensity ratio that first diffuses light from a\nconstant source, and then permits variable attenuation\nthrough a series of chambers and adjustable apertures.\nHow it's done: A lightproof box is divided into\nseveral chambers, each containing one or more electric\nlamps. The device actually used consisted of three\nchambers, but a greater range can be obtained with\nthe use of more chambers. Each of these chambers\nis painted white, and the rear and middle chambers\nhave exit apertures leading to the chamber ahead.\nThe output aperture is located in the forward chamber on the wall , opposite the middle-chamber exit\nanerture. Each aperture is fitted with an iris which\n\ncan be varied to control the output from its respective\nchamber. Apertures are not aligned. In order to provide the necessary diffusion, a ground glass is placed\nbetween each light source and its respective exit\naperture.\nEach chamber is inherently a high initial-loss device.\nLight intensity variation is achieved by manipulation\nof irises to admit light in measured amounts from one\nchamber to the next. Since the source lamps operate\non constant voltage and current, color temperature\noutput remains unchanged throughout the wide intensity range.\nOperation of the light attenuator, as in the testing\nof photo-multiplier tubes, requires only the lighting\nof the required lamps and setting the openings of the\napertures. In a typical application, the output of this\ndevice would go into the input of a phototube\namplifier circuit, either directly, or first interrupted by\na chopper.\n/\t\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National \t\nAeronautics and S p ace Administration.
