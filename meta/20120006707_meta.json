Aerodynamic performance and motor electrical performance are heavily influenced by rotational speed. The fan used in this work is at a practical limit for rotational speed due to motor performance characteristics, and there is no more space available in the packaging for a larger fan. The pressure rise requirements keep growing. The way to ordinarily accommodate a higher DP is to spin faster or grow the fan rotor diameter. The invention is to put two radially oriented stages on a single disk. Flow enters the first stage from the center; energy is imparted to the flow in the first stage blades, the flow is redirected some amount opposite to the direction of rotation in the fixed stators, and more energy is imparted to the flow in the second- stage blades. Without increasing either rotational speed or disk diameter, it is believed that as much as 50 percent more DP can be achieved with this design than with an ordinary, single-stage centrifugal design. This invention is useful primarily for fans having relatively low flow rates with relatively high pressure rise requirements.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20120006707, "id": "76c9b472fce946c9a8da5a89f41bf541", "publicationName": "NASA Tech Briefs, November 2011", "publicationDate": "2011-11-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20120006690, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "NASA Tech Briefs, November 2011", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20120006707.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20120006707/downloads/20120006707.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20120006707/downloads/20120006707.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20120006707/downloads/20120006707.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
