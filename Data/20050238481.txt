Incorporation of the NASA soil moisture\nproducts in the Dust Regional Atmospheric Model is possible through use of the satellite observations of\nsoil moisture to set initial conditions for the dust simulations. An additional comparison of satellite soil\nmoisture observations with mesoscale atmospheric dynamics modeling is recommended. Such a\ncomparison would validate the use of NASA soil moisture data in applications and support acceptance of\nsatellite soil moisture data assimilation in weather and climate modeling.\n\niv\n\nBlonski, Holland, and Henderson\n\n1.0 Introduction\nAlthough soil moisture can be defined as the water content in the upper several meters of ground\navailable for vegetation growth, soil moisture has other far-reaching effects on atmospheric dynamics,\nland surface hydrology, and civil engineering. Soil moisture is especially important in the atmospheric\nand hydrologic models used to predict weather and climate. Despite the many applications of soil\nmoisture data, observations of soil moisture are often sparse. In situ field measurements provide data only\nin a local area. Airborne measurements conducted during suborbital campaigns provide broader coverage,\nbut those data are available for only limited time periods. Recurrent, global measurements of soil\nmoisture are made solely by satellite remote sensing, but even those measurements are difficult to make.\nGlobal measurements also have many limitations, the main being that the satellite retrievals represent\nonly a shallow, near-surface layer of soil and do not provide critical information about soil moisture in\ndeeper zones. However, interest is increasing in assimilation of satellite measurements into land surface\nmodels to better predict vertical profiles as well as spatial and temporal patterns of soil moisture (Reichle\net al., 2004).\nSurface wetness has been identified as one of the 24 key physical measurements carried out by the Earth\nObserving System (EOS) program (King, 1999). NASA data products that provide observations and\npredictions of soil moisture are described in the following sections. Recommendations on incorporation\nof NASA soil moisture data in the Dust Regional Atmospheric Model (DREAM) are discussed in the last\nsection of this document.\n\n2.0 Observations\n2.1 Satellite Measurements\nThe Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - EOS (AMSR-E) is a multi-frequency, dual\npolarization, conically scanning, passive microwave radiometer onboard NASA\xe2\x80\x99s EOS Aqua satellite.\nFrom Aqua\xe2\x80\x99s sun-synchronous, 705-km orbit, AMSR-E scans across a 1450-km swath and provides soil\nmoisture measurements with near-global coverage in two days or less (Njoku et al., 2003). In doing so,\nAMSR-E continues the heritage of several sensors:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nScanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR), which operated on the Nimbus-7\nsatellite from 1978 until 1987,\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSpecial Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) series of instruments, which have been deployed on\nthe Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) spacecraft since 1987 (currently F13, F14,\nF15, and F16), and\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI) onboard the TRMM\nsatellite, which was launched in 1997.\n\nAMSR-E also improves upon the past microwave radiometers; it doubles spatial resolution of SMMR and\nSSM/I and combines into one sensor all the spectral channels that SMMR and SSM/I individually\npossessed. Table 1 lists the spectral and spatial characteristics of the AMSR-E instrument. Noteworthy are\ndifferences in shape and size between instantaneous fields of view for various spectral bands.\n\n1\n\nNASA Soil Moisture Data Products and Their Incorporation in DREAM\n\nTable 1. AMSR-E instrument characteristics.\nBand center frequency\n[GHz]\n6.925\n10.65\n18.7\n23.8\n36.5\n89.0\n89.0\n\nInstantaneous Field of View (IFOV)\n[km]\n75 \xc3\x97 43\n51 \xc3\x97 29\n27 \xc3\x97 16\n32 \xc3\x97 18\n14.4 \xc3\x97 8.2\n6.5 \xc3\x97 3.7\n5.9 \xc3\x97 3.5\n\nMicrowave observations are sensitive to soil moisture through the effects of water content on the\ndielectric constant and hence the emissivity of the soil. Vegetation and surface roughness reduce this\nsensitivity, and vegetation and roughness effects become more pronounced as the microwave frequency\nincreases. Furthermore, at lower frequencies, microwave emission originates from deeper soil layers.\nWith the lowest frequency of 6.9 GHz, soil moisture measurements by the AMSR-E instrument are\nlimited to a very shallow surface layer and areas with predominantly bare soil. Still, it is an improvement\nover the instruments currently deployed on operational weather satellites: SSM/I bands have the lowest\nfrequency of 19.35 GHz. However, there is a concern that measurements at 6.9 GHz are seriously affected\nby Radio-Frequency Interference (RFI) in many areas of the globe (Li et al., 2004). Future missions, such\nas the Hydrosphere State Mission (Hydros) (http://hydros.gsfc.nasa.gov/), will use a 1.4-GHz band that is\nless susceptible to effects of vegetation and RFI.\nThe AMSR-E Level 1A data are generated in Japan at the Earth Observation Center of the National Space\nDevelopment Agency of Japan, currently the Earth Observation Research and Application Center of the\nJapan Aerospace Exploration Agency. The Level 1A data contain sensor counts and coefficients needed\nto compute antenna temperatures and, subsequently, surface brightness temperatures at Level 1B. The\nLevel 1A data are sent to the Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center (PO.DAAC)\nlocated at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. From there the data are transmitted to the\nU.S. AMSR-E Science Information Processing System (SIPS). The SIPS has two components, one\nlocated at the Remote Sensing Systems (RSS) facility in Santa Rosa, California, and the other at the\nGlobal Hydrology and Climate Center (GHCC) in Huntsville, Alabama. At the RSS SIPS, Level 2A\nbrightness temperatures are generated by reconstructing the AMSR-E antenna gain patterns at each\nchannel to five footprints, corresponding to the footprint sizes of the 6.9, 10.7, 18.7, 36.5, and 89 GHz\nobservations. The sampling intervals are approximately 10 km for the four low resolutions and 5 km for\nthe highest resolutions. The Level 2A data contain as a subset the Level 1B data. The Level 2A data are\nsent to the GHCC SIPS for higher-level processing.\nThe AMSR-E data products are provided by SIPS in both a pixel-by-pixel, orbital swath projection and in\na global space and time averaged (e.g., daily, weekly, or monthly composite) Earth-oriented coordinate\ngrid. The AMSR-E soil moisture data products, AE_Land (Level 2B) and AE_Land3 (Level 3), are\nresampled to a global cylindrical Equal-Area Scalable Earth Grid (EASE-Grid) with 25-km spacing,\nalthough spatial resolution of the products is approximately 60 km. Level 2B datasets are separated into\nsubsets acquired during ascending (daytime \xe2\x80\x93 Figure 1) and descending (nighttime \xe2\x80\x93 Figure 2) half-orbits,\nwhile the Level 3 datasets include daily global coverage (Figure 3). The data products are subsequently\ntransferred to the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) DAAC in Boulder, Colorado, for\narchiving and distribution (http://nsidc.org/data/amsre/).\n\n2\n\nBlonski, Holland, and Henderson\n\nFigure 1. Daily mosaic of AMSR-E soil moisture measurements during satellite ascending passes.\n\nFigure 2. Daily mosaic of AMSR-E soil moisture measurements during satellite descending passes.\n\n3\n\nNASA Soil Moisture Data Products and Their Incorporation in DREAM\n\nFigure 3. Level 3 dataset of AMSR-E soil moisture measurements.\nIn addition to distributing standard data products, NSIDC hosts a 7-day, rolling archive of preliminary\nAMSR-E data for those who need data that is closer to near-real-time (NRT) than the final, standard\nAMSR-E datasets can produce. The NRT archive is updated up to several times per day and usually\nprovides access to datasets acquired on the previous (or even the same) day. Figure 4 shows an example\nof a soil moisture map created with Level 2B data points retrieved from the NRT archive. Since a single\nswath of the AMSR-E instrument does not cover the entire area, measurements from multiple passes of\nthe Aqua satellite were combined to create this map on May 3, 2005. The map includes measurements\nacquired mainly on May 1 and 2, but a small number of the data points originated as early as April 25.\nThe figure illustrates not only the advantages of satellite soil moisture measurements but also the\nlimitations of retrievals in areas that are mountainous, densely vegetated, near coasts, or covered with\nsnow.\nThe EOS Aqua spacecraft has a direct broadcast X-band downlink that allows AMSR-E data to be\nreceived in real time by ground stations having the proper reception hardware and being located in a\ndirect line of sight of the satellite. Since April 2005, the International MODIS/AIRS Processing Package\n(IMAPP) software has been capable of processing the AMSR-E direct broadcast data to produce\ncalibrated and geolocated AMSR-E Level 1B / Level 2A products. While the AMSR-E processing\nsoftware was developed by the RSS, it is distributed as part of IMAPP by the University of Wisconsin \xe2\x80\x93\nMadison (http://cimss.ssec.wisc.edu/~gumley/IMAPP/IMAPP.html). Software for further processing of\nAMSR-E data into Level 2 rain products is available as well. NASA requires developers of algorithms for\ngeneration of science products to provide their software code to a DAAC. Such code is subsequently\narchived and available upon special request from the DAAC (such as the NSIDC). Therefore, generation\nof AMSR-E soil moisture products from direct broadcast data seems feasible, but it also appears to be less\npractical and more expensive than downloading the NRT products.\n\n4\n\nBlonski, Holland, and Henderson\n\nFigure 4. Mosaic of NRT AMSR-E soil moisture data for the western United States on May 3, 2005.\n\n2.2 Ground Measurements\nSoil Moisture Experiments in 2002 (SMEX02), 2003 (SMEX03), and 2004 (SMEX04) were campaigns\nof airborne and field measurements. Soil moisture data were collected both remotely and in situ at the\nfollowing locations:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSMEX02: Iowa; June 24 - July 15, 2002\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSMEX03: Oklahoma, Georgia, Alabama; June 23 - July 18, 2003\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSMEX03: Brazil; September 1-10, 2003\n\n5\n\nNASA Soil Moisture Data Products and Their Incorporation in DREAM\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nNAME-SMEX04: (North American Monsoon Experiment) Mexico and Arizona; July 15 August 15, 2004\n\nThe SMEX02-SMEX04 datasets have been instrumental in the validation of AMSR-E measurements, but\nunrestricted access is currently granted only to the SMEX02 datasets:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSMEX02 Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN) Station 2031, Ames, Iowa\nThis dataset provides data from various sensors on SCAN station number 2031, located near\nAmes, Iowa. The data include hourly and daily recordings of precipitation, air temperature, solar\nradiation, wind speed, relative humidity, soil moisture, and soil temperature. The station houses\nnumerous sensors that automatically record data. Sensors include global precipitation sensor,\nthermistor, thin film capacitance-type sensor, anemometer, pyranometer, pressure sensor, and a\nfrequency-shift dielectric measuring device. Units of measurement vary, depending on the type of\nsensor. Data are uploaded by meteor burst telemetry to the Natural Resources Conservation\nService (NRCS) Data Processing Center in Portland, Oregon. The NRCS has been operating this\nSCAN station since September 23, 2001, but this dataset covers only the time period of interest to\nthe SMEX02 campaign, June 1 to August 31, 2002. Data are available in two text files: hourly\ndata and daily data.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSMEX02 Iowa Regional Ground Soil Moisture Data\nThe parameters for this dataset include gravimetric and volumetric soil moisture, bulk density,\nand soil temperature. This study was conducted during June and July 2002 in the area around\nAmes, Iowa. Data were collected in crop fields using a variety of methods and sensors: manual\nsoil samples for gravimetric and bulk density data, infrared pyrometers for soil moisture, and\nhydra probes for soil moisture and temperature. Data are provided in ASCII text files.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSMEX02 Soil Moisture and Temperature Profiles, Walnut Creek, Iowa\nThis dataset contains measurements of soil moisture, soil temperature, and rainfall. Soil moisture\nand temperature were measured at various depths: 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 cm. Data were\ncollected in four fields, each containing two measurement sites called \xe2\x80\x9cpit A\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpit B.\xe2\x80\x9d The\nstudy was conducted in the Walnut Creek watershed in south-central Iowa during June and July\n2002. Water content reflectometers measured soil moisture. Soil temperature probes and\naveraging thermocouple probes measured soil temperature. A tipping bucket rain gauge measured\nrainfall. Data are provided in ASCII text files and a Microsoft Excel\xc2\xae file.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSMEX02 Sliced Core Soil Moisture Data, Walnut Creek Watershed, Iowa\nThis dataset includes sliced soil core moisture data collected during June and July 2002 in the\nWalnut Creek watershed in south-central Iowa. The study parameters include gravimetric soil\nmoisture and bulk soil density. Data were collected manually at two corn and two soybean sites.\nData are provided as ASCII text files and Microsoft Excel files.\n\n6\n\nBlonski, Holland, and Henderson\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSMEX02 Watershed Soil Moisture Data, Walnut Creek, Iowa\nThe parameters in this dataset include gravimetric and volumetric soil moisture, bulk density, soil\ntemperature, soil conductivity, and soil salinity. This study was conducted during June and July\n2002 in the area of the Walnut Creek watershed in south-central Iowa. Data was collected in crop\nfields, using a variety of methods and sensors: manual soil samples for gravimetric and bulk\ndensity data, infrared pyrometers for soil moisture, and hydra probes for soil moisture,\ntemperature, and salinity. Data are provided in ASCII text files.\n\nThe NSIDC DAAC (http://nsidc.org/data/amsr_validation/soil_moisture/) distributes the SMEX02\ndatasets.\n\n3.0 Predictions\nThe Land Information System (LIS) is a high-performance land surface modeling and data assimilation\nsystem, based on Land Data Assimilation Systems developed at Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC)\n(Peters-Lidard et al., 2004). LIS calculations include one of three different land surface models:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCLM, the Community Land Model of National Center for Atmospheric Research,\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nNOAH, the community NOAH * land surface model, and\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nVIC, the Variable Infiltration Capacity model.\n\nPredictions of soil moisture for various soil layers are generated as output of any of these models. The\nmodeling can be done at different spatial resolutions, down to 1 km, although requirements for\ncomputational resources increase significantly at high resolutions. A key extension to the LIS\ninfrastructure is the capability to perform data assimilations, which are techniques to merge observed data\nfields with model predictions to improve the subsequent predictions. However, soil moisture assimilation\ncapabilities are not yet implemented in the available LIS software.\nResearch on assimilation of global satellite observations and soil moisture measurements is also\nconducted at the GSFC\xe2\x80\x99s Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO). In contrast to the\nmesoscale LIS modeling, the GMAO calculations are performed on a global scale at much lower spatial\nresolution \xe2\x80\x93 on the order of 100 km (1 degree latitude/longitude). These calculations are based on two\nland surface models of the NASA Seasonal-to-Interannual Prediction Project: Catchment and Mosaic.\nValidation against ground-based measurements from the Global Soil Moisture Data Bank in Eurasia and\nNorth America demonstrated that soil moisture fields derived from data assimilation are superior to either\nsatellite data or model data alone (Reichle and Koster, 2005).\nIn the GMAO\xe2\x80\x99s operational Data Assimilation System GEOS-4, top soil layer wetness and root zone soil\nwetness are produced eight times per day (every three hours) as time-averaged fields on the global grid\nwith cells 1.25 degree longitude by 1 degree latitude each. GEOS-4 assimilates observations from a\ndiverse, heterogeneous observing system of land surface, ocean surface, and atmosphere that includes\n\n*\n\nNOAH is an acronym created from the names of the following institutions: National Centers for Environmental\nPrediction, Oregon State University, Air Force, and Hydrologic Research Laboratory of the National Weather\nService.\n7\n\nNASA Soil Moisture Data Products and Their Incorporation in DREAM\n\nseveral satellite instruments but that does not include remote sensing measurements of soil moisture (i.e.,\nAMSR-E) (Bloom et al., 2005).\n\n4.0 DREAM Recommendations\nIn Dust Regional Atmospheric Model (DREAM), soil moisture is one of the factors controlling\nproduction of dust. Soil moisture data used in the dust calculations are generated internally by a coupled\natmosphere/land-surface model incorporated in the DREAM modeling system (Nickovic et al., 2001).\nThe calculations are initialized with atmospheric conditions generated by an external, numerical weather\nforecasting system based on assimilation of meteorological observations. Subsequently, further numerical\nforecasts from that external system are used to create periodically (e.g., at 6-hour intervals of the\nsimulated time) lateral boundary conditions imposed on the DREAM simulations. These initial and\nboundary conditions include atmospheric temperature, humidity, and wind velocity.\nUse of the AMSR-E satellite measurements of surface soil moisture as initial conditions for the dust\nsimulations provides the best opportunity for application of NASA soil moisture data in DREAM. Field\nmeasurements of soil moisture conducted during the SMEX campaigns are not as useful because they\nwere collected at only a few locations and during a limited time span. NASA Earth science models, such\nas LIS and GEOS, may provide improved soil moisture data in the future, but their functionality for\nassimilation of ASMR-E and similar observations must first become operational. Otherwise, direct use of\nAMSR-E soil moisture products is a better choice. Although without assimilation into land surface\nmodels AMSR-E provides only measurements of moisture content in a thin surface layer of soil, this may\nactually be the layer that is essential for production of dust. Moreover, an initial state of the soil moisture\nfield was shown to have an important effect on outcome of the numerical weather forecasting (Chen et al.,\n2004).\nNevertheless, characteristics and limitations of the current NASA soil moisture observations and\npredictions need to be better understood. Today\xe2\x80\x99s remote sensing of soil moisture delivers\ngroundbreaking Earth observations on a global scale, but its applicability to mesoscale atmospheric\nmodeling, such as in the DREAM simulations, still needs to be verified and validated. Some comparisons\nof AMSR-E soil moisture observations with field measurements and land surface model predictions have\neven indicated disagreements (Sahoo, 2004). Therefore, further validation is needed of NASA soil\nmoisture observations for their application in mesoscale modeling. Currently, the atmospheric modeling\nin DREAM is based on the North American Mesoscale \xe2\x80\x93 Eta model developed and used for operational\nforecasts by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In the near future, this model will be\nreplaced by the Nonhydrostatic Mesoscale Model of the Weather Research and Forecasting modeling\nsystem (COMET, 2005). Comparisons of AMSR-E soil moisture measurements with results of the\noperational models should help build confidence in the satellite data and promote its use in applications of\nnational priority.\n\n8\n\nBlonski, Holland, and Henderson\n\n5.0 References\nBloom, S., A. da Silva, and D.

ABSTRACT\n\nNASA provides soil moisture data products that include observations from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer on the\nEarth Observing System Aqua satellite, field measurements from the Soil Moisture Experiment campaigns, and model predictions\nfrom the Land Information System and the Goddard Earth Observing System Data Assimilation System. Incorporation of the NASA\nsoil moisture products in the Dust Regional Atmospheric Model is possible through use of the satellite observations of soil moisture\nto set initial conditions for the dust simulations. An additional comparison of satellite soil moisture observations with mesoscale\natmospheric dynamics modeling is recommended. Such a comparison would validate the use of NASA soil moisture data in\napplications and support acceptance of satellite soil moisture data assimilation in weather and climate modeling.\n\n15.
