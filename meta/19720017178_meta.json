The LF467 is an advanced turbotip lift fan intended for application with the YJ97-GE-100 turbojet gas generator on a V/STOL transport research aircraft. The program objective was to define a fan that develops a reasonably high (1.30) fan pressure ratio consistent with propulsion requirements of a V/STOL research transport aircraft and that exhibits the ability to achieve a 100 PNdE overall noise objective through the use of modest additional installation treatment. The aerodynamic and mechanical designs of this system and the resulting configuration, weight, and noise predictions are presented.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19720017178, "id": "55862088f285440d80b58aafb922582b", "publicationDate": "1972-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19720017178.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19720017178/downloads/19720017178.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19720017178/downloads/19720017178.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19720017178/downloads/19720017178.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
