b'Advancing Human Spaceflight\nThe vision of commercial human spaceflight to low-Earth orbit is a robust, vibrant\nenterprise with many providers and a wide range of private and public users.\nA successful human space transportation system will strengthen the International\nSpace Station Program, allow NASA to focus on deep-space exploration, potentially\nreduce the cost of human access to space and significantly contribute to the national\neconomy. NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Commercial Crew Program serves two purposes:\nPublic Purpose\nSupport the development of\nnon-NASA markets for commercial\nhuman transportation services to\nand from low-Earth orbit.\n\nNASA Purpose\nSafe transport of NASA and\nNASA-sponsored astronauts to\nand from the station.\n\nInvest in System, Subsystem and\nIntegrated Capabilities:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nOverall spacecraft and launch vehicle\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nLaunch abort systems\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nEnvironmental control and life support\ndevelopment\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nLaunch vehicle emergency detection systems\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThermal protection systems\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nRocket motor development and testing\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nParachute testing\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPressure vessel testing\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nIntegrated system development\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nGround, orbital and recovery operations\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSignificant development milestones\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nBegan the partnership with the FAA\n\nBlue Origin (CCDev2):\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPusher Escape In-Flight Escape Demonstration\nData Review\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFlight Demonstration of BE-3 Engine\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFlight Demo of Subscale Propellant Tank Assembly\n\nBoeing (CCiCap):\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAll milestones complete\n\nSierra Nevada Corporation (CCiCap):\n\xe2\x80\xa2 ETA Flight Testing #2\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Design Analysis Cycle-6 Closeout Review\nSpaceX (CCiCap):\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Pad Abort Test\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Dragon Primary Structure Qualification \xe2\x80\x93\nHatch Open Test\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Delta Crew Vehicle Critical Design Review\n\xe2\x80\xa2 In-Flight Abort Test\n\nCertification Products Contracts (CPC):\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nEnabled NASA and industry to have a dialogue on\nwhat would be required for certification\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPromoted the delivery, technical interchange and\nNASA disposition of early lifecycle certification\nproducts with Boeing, Sierra Nevada Corporation\nand SpaceX\n\nCommercial Crew Transportation\nCapability (CCtCap):\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nBuilt with industry to advance American human\nspaceflight and support both the public and\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s needs\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nLays the foundation for NASA to acquire\ncommercially provided crew transportation\nservices to and from the International Space Station\nfrom Boeing and SpaceX\n\nCCtCap contracts were awarded to Boeing and SpaceX\nfor the final development and certification of integrated\ncrew transportation systems.
