Background to the establishment of the AWS program is given as well as program objectives. In order to understand the fundamental flow mechanisms that caused the undesirable motions for a pre-production version of the F/A-18E, steady and unsteady flow field details were gathered from dedicated transonic wind-tunnel testing and computational studies. The AWS program has also adapted a free-to-roll (FTR) wind-tunnel testing technique traditionally used for low-speed studies of lateral dynamic stability to the transonic flow regime. This FTR capability was demonstrated first in a proof-of -concept study and then applied to an assessment of four different aircraft configurations. Figures of merit for static testing and for FTR testing have been evaluated for two configurations that demonstrated wing drop susceptibility during full-scale flight conditions (the pre-production F/A-18E and the AV-8B at the extremes of its flight envelope) and two configurations that do not exhibit wing drop (the F/A-18C and the F-16C). Design insights have been obtained from aerodynamic computational studies of the four aircraft configurations and from computations quantifying the impact of the various geometric wing differences between the F/A-18C and the F/A-18E wings. Finally, the AWS program provides guidance for assessing, in the simulator, the impact of experimentally determined lateral activity on flight characteristics before going to flight.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20030012600, "endDate": "2003-01-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "41st Aerospace Sciences Meeting and Exhibit", "location": "Reno, NV", "id": "c5528b953e5a4ba385c93bd12faf1280", "startDate": "2003-01-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20030012600, "id": "95e663002fef4355bb98884e4524b4a5", "publicationDate": "2003-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20030012600.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20030012600/downloads/20030012600.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20030012600/downloads/20030012600.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20030012600/downloads/20030012600.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
