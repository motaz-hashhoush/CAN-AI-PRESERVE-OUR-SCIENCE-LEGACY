b'ALL CHAIN IDRAN-C TIME SYNCHRONIZATION\nLCDR H. T. Sherman\nU. S. Coast Guard\n\nABSTRACT\nA program i s in progress to implement coordinated universal time (UTC) synchronization on all Loran-C transmissions. The present cap3bility i s limited\nto five b r a n - C chains in which the tolerance is twenty-five microseconds\nwith respect to UTC. Upon completion of the program, the transmissions of\nall Inran-C chains will be maintained within five microseconds of UTC.\n\nThe improvement plan consists of equipping selected b r a n 4 transmitting\nstations for greater precision of frequency standard adjustment and improved\nmonitoring capability. External time monitor stations will utilize television\ntime transfer techniques with nearby SATCOM terminals where practicable,\nthus providing the requisite traceability to the Naval Observatory,\nDue to funding limitations, the program i s being implemented in phased.\nThe first phase comprises upgrading the East C ~ a s t ,Central Facific and\nMediterranean Loran-C chains and outfitting the training facility. Subsequent\nphase(s) will upgrade the Northwest Pacific, North Atlantic and Norwegian\nSea chains and implement synchronization in the North Pacific and Southeast\nAsia chains.\nEquipment groups a r c being assembled and tested at the Coast Guard\'s Washington Radio Station Laboratory. Field installation i s scheduled to commence\nearly in 1974.\nThe paper discusses the time monitor equipment groups and the interrelationships with the ground station equipment. After a brief word on control\ndoctrine, the remainder of the paper addresses forth-coming improvements\nto transmitting stations and how the time monitor and navigation equipmcnts\nwill complement each other resulting i n improved service to all usc-rs of\nthe Loran-C system.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nA discussion of the Loran-C system a s a means for the dissemination of precise\ntime and time interval (PTTI) is contained in the proceedings*, a s is Loran-C\n\ntime and frequency adjustment**\n\n.\n\nThis paper diecusses existing Loran-C ground station equipment and the new\ntime-monitor eqdpment groups being assembled and tested a t the Coast Guarclie\nWashington Radio Station. Current and future improvements in the navigation\nsystem will enhance the uee of Loran-C for dissemination of PTTI.\nLet us first take a look a t a typical transmitting station a s shown in form of a\nblock diagram in Figure 1. The baeic element of the system is the Loran-C\ntimer set. Two timers a r e installed a t each station, The timer performs the\nfollowfng functions,\nGenerates bran repetition rate from frequency standard input.\na Generates transmitter triggers and phase coding.\na Monitors b r a n time difference between master-secondary pairs.\na Corrects the transmitted signal for propagation changes a t the trans-\n\nmitting site.\n0\n\nProvides alarms in event of system malfunctions o r navigational tolerance errors.\n\na Provides a means of making phase adjustments to the transmitted signal\n\nto correct the navigation grid a s directed by the control station.\n\nThe Control Indicator Group (CIG) provides operate/standby mode selection\nand signal routing. The Transmitter Control Group (TCG) generates low level\nInran-C pulses from the triggers generated by the operate timer and provides\noperate/standby transmitter mode selection.\nThe transmitter then shapes and amplifies the b r a n - C pulee to the rated power\noutput. Peak output power is in the range of 160 to 3000 kw depending upon the\nequipment type and transmitting tower at theparticular station. All transmitters\n\nSC. E.

A solid state high power transmitter is being developed under contract and, if successful, should be a substantial improvement in system reliability. The transmitter has traditionally\nbeen the weak link in the system.\nUntil recent years, the master-secondary time difference was controlled by\nelectro-mechanical servo systems in the timers, The servo in the secondarystation timer actively tracked the master signal to maintain the prescribed\ntime difference. This mode of operation, called "synchronized operationff, resulted in the servo noise being transmitted on the secondary signal.\nWith the advent of atomic frequtncy standards,\' it was found that the timer\nservos could be turned off with a substantial improvement in stability of the\ntime difference. This mode is called "free-running operation" and is now employed in all Loran-C chains. All transmitting stations a r e presently equipped\nwith cesium beam frequency standards.\nIn the late 1960fs, the stability and wide coverage of the Loran-C system were\nrecognized a s excellent qualifications for broad-scale dissemination of PTTI.\nThrough cooperation of the U, S. Naval Observatory and the Coast Guard,\nseveral Loran-C chain tran~missions\nhave been synchronized to UTC (USNO).\nIn order to initially implement the program, additional equipment was developed\nand installed at the master stations for the East Coast, Norwegian Sea, Central\nPacific and Northwest Pacific Loran-C Chains.\nThe equipment added was a unit called a UT Synchronizer which interfaces\nwith the station equipment and provides a local time reference, The U T\nSynchronizer utilizes the station frequency standard and performs the following\nfunctions.\nGenerates and displays time of day.\nGenerates and displays time of coincidence of UTC with the first master\nradiated pulse.\nProvides alarms in event of timing error.\nProvides b r a n - C timer reset capability.\nGenerates a 1-PPS transmitter trigger (Discontinued in 1972).\nFigure 2 is a block diagram of the UT Synchronizer. The frequency standard\ninput to each timer i s independenlly controllable by a phase 8hifter to permit\naccurately positioning the transmitter trigger. This enables a fine adjustment\n\n\'I -\n\nFREQ STD lNPUT\n\nL\n\n-\n\nPHASE\nSHIFTER\n\nLORAN3\nTIMER\n\nr\n\nTIHER\nlNTERFACE\n\n-\n\nV\nf l ( 1-PPS)\n\n5\n\n2\n\n>\n\nL\n\n-\n\nPHASE\nSH I FTER\n\nLORAN RATE\n?\n\nLORAN-C\nT 1 HER\n\nd\n\nWONITOR\ni\n\nr\n\nLORAN\nRATE\nGENERATORS\n( 2 )\n\nTOC (LOCUT)\nDISPLAY 5 SET\n\n1\n\nI\n\nA\n\'\n\n>\n\nL\n\n1\n\nPHASE\nSHI FTER\n\nU T C\nMONITOR\n\n-\n\nU T C\nGATE\n\nL\nL\n\n-\n\nU T\nCLOCKS\n\nJ\n\n4\n\n( 3 1\ni\n\nt\n\nTot (LOCUT)\n\n6ENERATORS\n\nFigure 2.

A third phase shifter controls the phase of\nthe frequency standard input b two b r a n rate generators. These i n d ~ n d e n t\nrate generators are then compared to each other aad the timers by the b r a n\nRate Generator Monitor. This unit also provides the capability of instantaneously\nresettingthe timer t the UT Synchronizer. The remainder of the circuitry still\no\nin use comprises TOD clocks and the generation and monitoring of TOC. The\nt T C Gate was used t initiate a single pulse transmission each second. The 1o\nPPS transmission war, discontinued in 1972, after the conversion of time scale\nto improved UTC.\nThe first UT Synchronizer was developed a t the Coast Guard Electronics Engineering Center under project W-340 and was installed a t Carolina Beach, the\nEast Coast master station. This unit was subsequently installed a t the master\nstation in the Central Pacific chain after three improved models were constructed under project W-425. The major disadvantages of these U1 Synchronizer\nequipments are.\nCost\nSpecial operator training required\nComplex circuitry with no ability for "hands on" technician training.\nRequires timermdifications, therefore results in non-standard ground\nstation equipment.\nTimer interface unit would require further modification for compatibility with future b r a n - C timers.\nNo time reference external to station.\nCurrent developments a r e directed toward replacement of the aging timer equipm e n t ~ . A new generation timer has been developed for use a t either Loran-C o r\nb r a n - A atations, and is commonly called "COLAC" for Combined &oranA and\nC. The b r a n - C version, the AN/FPN-54 p r f o r m s all of the basic functions\nof the older equipments with one exception. The design is based on the freerunning mode of operation, hence it does not have a time difference monitoring\ncaplbility. A computer controlled monitor/control receiver is being developed\nunder contract, and should be avilable in approximately three years.\nFigcrc :\nshows the basic block diagram of the COLAC timer set.

Provisions have been made for remotely controlling many of the\nfu~ctions communications link. This will eventually lead to reduced manning\nvia\nlevels at the stations.\nThe initial COLAC installation at Estartit, Spain, has been in operation for over\nthree years and has a remarkable record of only two failures, both in the power\naupply, during that period. The new-generation timers have been installed for\nsome time at Bo and Jan Mayen in the Norwegian Sea chain, and recently a t\nCarolina Beach, Nantucket, Jupiter and Dana of the East Coast chain. For an\n\naggregate of over seven equipment-years of operation, there has been a total\nof about thirty minutes bad signal time directly attributable to COLAC. Most\nremaining stations will be COLAC-equipped within the next two years.\nOf particular interest t all u s e r s of b r a n - C is the development of a new transo\nmitter corrtrol unit. This equipment permits individual control of each halfcycle of the transmitter drive signal by literally "building" the bran pulse.\nThus we will have pulse shape control to a precision heretofore unattainable.\nTbese new units have just been installed at Dana, Nantucket and Carolina Beach\nwith future installations planned where pulse shape adjustment is particularly\ndifficult due to transmitter type.\n\nThe improved stability and reliability of the navigation system suggests a potential for upgradingthe PTTI capability as well. DOD has provided the first\nof two increments of funding to implement improved PTTI on all b r a n - C chains.\nUnder the improvement program, all master stations will be equipped for\ngreater precision of adjustment of frequency and a self-monitoring capability.\nWhere required, an additional time monitor will be established at a b r a n - C\ntransmitting site to provide the requisite traceability to UTC (USNO).\nThe following stations are in the program.\nPhase I\nCarolina Beach\n\nSS7 Master\n\nSimeri Crichi, Italy\n\nSLl Master\n\nTargabarun, Turkey\n\nSLl Time Monitor\n\nJohnston Island\n\nS1 Master\n\nUpolo Point, Hawaii\n\n51 Time Monitor\n\nGesashi, Okinawa\n\nSS3 Time Monitor\n\nTraining Center, New York\n\nCape Race, Newfoundland\n\nSS7/SL7 Cross chain monitor\n\nAngissoq, Greenland\n\nSL7 Master\n\na Ejde, Faeroe Isles\nSt. Paul, Pribilof 13.\n\nSL3 Master & SL3/SL7 monitor\nSH7 Master\n\na Attu, Aleutian I.\ns\n\nSH7 Time monitor\n\na Iwo Jima\n\nSS3 Master\n\na Sattahip, Thailaad\n\nSH3 Master & Time monitor\n\nFigure 4 depicts the scheme that will be employed in most chains to monitor the\ntiming of the chain. Satellite time transfer will establish the relationship between the SATCOM-terminal clock and UTC (USNO). The secondary transmitting statioc (Time monitor station) is then updated using passive television\ntime transfer with the SATCOM terminal. The time monitor receives and compares the master transmitted signal to its updated clock.\nThe master station will also be equipped with timing receivers. One receiver\nwill track the time monitor signal, while the other will track the master\'s own\nradiated pulse. Thus, should the master station have a failure of both timers,\no r some other such catastrophic failure, i t w i l l have the capability of reestablishing the relationship to UTC without external assistance.\nThe block diagram for the time monitor station is shown in Figure 5, and comprises the following major elements.\nh a l signal switched attenuator/blanker.

Provides an output coincident with a specific\nTV synchronization pulse for passive TV time transfer with SATCOM\nterminal.\nExperience has shown that the fine frequency control (C-field adjust) of the\ncesium beam frequency standard is rather coarse when attempting to maintain\ntight control of the frequency offset of b r a n with respect to UTC (USNO). To\nobtain an improved means of adjusting frequency offset, each master station will\nbe furnished with two phase micmsteppers*. These units enable adjusting the\nfrequency offset in increments of one part in 10\n\n".\n\nThe high resolution available with tbe phase microstepper has given rise to a\ntechnique which will be evaluated in the near future. The COLAC timer contains circuitry which monitors cross-timer agreement and alarms if the difference between timers exceeds twenty nanoseconds. The scheme which will be\nstudied i s shown in Figure 6, and may be the configuration in the future. The\nprimary-frequency-standard/phase-n~icrostepper combination is used a s the input to the "operate" TD-989/FPN-54.\nThe standby timer, however, uses the\nbackup frequency standard-microstepper. This configuration would provide\ncontinual comparison of the two frequency sources within the twenty nanosecond\nwindow. Should the on-line equipment fail, the station would simply change\ntimers (a single pushbutton operation) and resume transmitting without loss of\ntime.\nLet us now take a look a t the control problem.

UTC (USNO) update by portable clock. Monitor data also provided\nto USNO by SATCOM terminal at Futenma, Guam.\n\nBased upon the data from these various reports, the Observatory computes the\ndaily phase values, which a r e then published in Time Service Announcements.\nAdjustments of operate frequency standards at master stations a r e directed by\nCoast Guard Headquarters with the concurrence of the Observatory.\nWith the availability of UTC (USNO) a t the SATCOM terminal, hence a t the time\nmonitor, this rather lengthy process could be reduced to a local control function.\nIn fact, local control would be required to implement the mini-step adjustment\nmethod which has been suggested*. Although requiring some conventional operating technique of the navigation system, the following is considered to be a\npracticable control doctrine. This could be implemented with minimal additional\nequipment, namely, phase microsteppers at the time monitor with additional\n1-PPS dividers.\nTime monitor uses "new" 1-PPS source for time transfer from SATCOM\nterminal.\nT h e moriitor adjusts own microstepper for zero offset.\nMaster adjusts microstepper for zero offset with respect to time monitor as directed by the monitor.\nRemainder of secondary stations maintain relationship to master by\nlocal phase adjustments.\nThe time monitor station would then report the change in frequency offset. An\nalternate, and perhaps more palatable, method would be for the time monitor to\nrecommend the intended change, but not enter it in the system until concurrence\nwas received from higher command.\n\nThe All Chain PTTI Improvement Program depends to a large degree upon the\ntraceability of the time monitor s a t i o n to UTC (USNO). If satellite time is not\navailable at the SATCOM terminal, o r cannot be transferred with an acceptable\naccuracy, then we will have to continue with the burden of the portable clock.\nIn either event, I am sure that we can meet the goal of maintaining all Loran-C\nchains within 2.5 microseconds of UTC.\n\nQUESTION AND ANSWER PERIOD\n\nLCDR. SHERMAN:\nAre there any questions ?\nQUESTION:\nYour slide on the monitor system didn\'t show anything for the Alaska chain. I\nwas just wonhering, how do you currently monitor the SH-7 ?\nLCDR, SHERMAN:\n\n-\n\nThe Alaskan Chain is not presently timed. I believe that there a r e some I\nknow that there a r e several users. The Observatory has been working on the\nproblem. However, the chain itself i s not equipped with a UT synchronizer.\nDR. REDER:\nYes, Mr. Lavanceau.\n\nMR. LAVANCEAU:\nIn regard to the Alaskan Loran-C chain, we believe that in about two weeks from\nnow we may be able to put that chain on time. In other words, asking the Coast\nGuard to make the time adjustment to the chain which would result in a step of\nabout 15 mi~\',seconds. The monitoring will be done by three different organizations, six stations, located all over Alaska.\nIn regard to monitoring some of the chains a s f a r a s the Medjterranean Loran-C\nchain, your slide shows that the monitoring was done by the Paris Observatory,\n(BIH) through the H. P. Lab in Geneva. In addition, we use monitor data\nand\nfrom the USMO in order to detect the timing variations of the North Atlantic\nchaiu, Also for the Northwest Pacific we use about 6 o r 7 different monitoring\nsites in addition to the Fuchu site.\nDR. REDER:\nAny more questions?\nMr. Smith.\n\nMR. SMITH:\nThank you, Mr. Chairman.\nI do not wish to ask a question, but if I may for a moment speak a s the Chairman of the Directing Board of the BIH, may I say how dependent we a r e upon\nthe Loran-C system in order to form the international scale of atomic time.\nWe do very much greatly appreciate the cooperation of the U. S. Coast Guard\norganization in trying to meet these very specialized needs of p r e c i ~ e\ntiming in\norder that the independent atomic time scales may each contribute towards the\ninternational scale.\n\nSince Admiral Pearson was present a t one of the CCDS meetings, there has\nindeed been a full understanding by the Coast Guard of this additional responsibility, and I would like to place on record our appreciation of all that has been\ndone.\nThank you.\nDR. WINKLER:\nDr. Smith\'s comments pmmpt me to add some comments to the discussion\nwhich we had yesterday and also to tNs paper here.\nSome users have experienced tmubles in picking up time absolutely with sufficient accuracy, and I refer back to Dr. Smith\'s comments yesterday.\nNow, one of the problems in many such cases is that the geodetic position i s\nnot known accurately enough. If you do not know your geodetic position, o r if\nthere is a question about on which datum that position is, ycil cannot expect, of\ncourse, to get absolute time to within one microsecond.\nThere is one good way to circumvent that. If you have capable operators in the\nstation, what you do is you determine your Loran Hyperbolic po~itionwith the\nsame timing equipment which you use to pick up time. You make difference\nmeasurements of time of arrivals from every station of the chain that you can\nget, and you compute (these programs a r e available) your Loran position.\nIf you use, then, that position to compute your absolute time delay, you will find\na significantly greater agreement with portable clock calibrations than otherwise.\n\nThank you.\n\nCMDR. SHERMAN:\nJust to add a little bit to Dr. Winklerts comment there. We have a t headquarters\nseveral programs which will give us the all seawater transmission time, o r\npropagation time from the transmitting station to the monitoring point.\n\n-\n\nIf you know your geographic position, I would volunteer my services let ue\nknow where you are, and what station you want to receive, we will not only give\nyou the baseline distance in microseconds, but we will also give you a computer\nprintout which will tell 3mu how to correct for the terrain between you and the\ntranumitting station.\nThis additional factor i s very important. It i s called Additional Secondary\nPhase Correction, and a s a matter of fact we have some little slide rules,\nwhich, if you don\'t want the whole big computer printout, we can send you.\nDR. REDER:\nAny more questions?\nMay I ask one myself?\nYou mentioned that reliability of the transmitter towers i s occasionally some\nproblem how serious i s that?\n\n-\n\nCMDR. SHERMAN:\nWell, a s with any high powered transmitting equipment, you have equipments\nthat you a r e really pushing to their extreme.\nWe frequently have t r o ~ b l e t Cape Race because of lightening. Now, there i s\na\nnot a thing we can do about that. We have been fighting it for years, static\ndrain resistors, other types of suppressors.\nDR. REDER:\nHow important i s this? Does it appear weekly, daily, monthly?\nCMDR. SHERMAN:\nAgain, it depends upon the conditions, the age of the equipment, the local\nconditions, the technicians that w e have a t the etation.\n\nNormally, our signal avaiiability time i~ better than 99 percent of the time.\nDR. REDER:\n\nAnother question or comment ?\n(No response, )\n\n'
