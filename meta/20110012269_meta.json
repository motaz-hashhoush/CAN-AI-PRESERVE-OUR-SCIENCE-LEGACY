The software attempts to satisfy as many observation requests as possible considering each against spacecraft operation constraints such as data volume, thermal, pointing maneuvers, and others. More complex constraints such as temperature are approximated to enable efficient reasoning while keeping the spacecraft within safe limits. Other constraints are checked using an external software library. For example, an attitude control library is used to determine the feasibility of maneuvering between pairs of observations. This innovation can deal with a wide range of spacecraft constraints and solve large scale scheduling problems like hundreds of observations and thousands of combinations of observation sequences.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20110012269, "id": "fb47a75d0dce4189957021a964c222b7", "publicationName": "NASA Tech Briefs, March 2011", "publicationDate": "2011-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20110012230, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "NASA Tech Briefs, March 2011", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20110012269.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20110012269/downloads/20110012269.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20110012269/downloads/20110012269.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20110012269/downloads/20110012269.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
