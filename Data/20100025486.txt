b"Investing American Recovery and Reinvestment Act Funds\nto Advance Capability, Reliability, and Performance in\nNASA Wind Tunnels\nGeorge H. Sydnor1\nNASA Aeronautics Test Program, Langley Research Center, Hampton, Virginia, 23681\n\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration\xe2\x80\x99s (NASA) Aeronautics Test\nProgram (ATP) is implementing five significant ground-based test facility projects across the\nnation with funding provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).\nThe projects were selected as the best candidates within the constraints of the ARRA and the\nstrategic plan of ATP. They are a combination of much-needed large scale maintenance,\nreliability, and system upgrades plus creating new test beds for upcoming research\nprograms. The projects are: 1.) Re-activation of a large compressor to provide a second\nsource for compressed air and vacuum to the Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel at the Ames\nResearch Center (ARC) 2.) Addition of high-altitude ice crystal generation at the Glenn\nResearch Center Propulsion Systems Laboratory Test Cell 3, 3.) New refrigeration system\nand tunnel heat exchanger for the Icing Research Tunnel at the Glenn Research Center, 4.)\nTechnical viability improvements for the National Transonic Facility at the Langley\nResearch Center, and 5.) Modifications to conduct Environmentally Responsible Aviation\nand Rotorcraft research at the 14x22 Subsonic Tunnel at Langley Research Center. The\nselection rationale, problem statement, and technical solution summary for each project is\ngiven here. The benefits and challenges of the ARRA funded projects are discussed.\nIndirectly, this opportunity provides the advantages of developing experience in NASA\xe2\x80\x99s\nworkforce in large projects and maintaining corporate knowledge in that very unique\ncapability. It is envisioned that improved facilities will attract a larger user base and\ncapabilities that are needed for current and future research efforts will offer revenue growth\nand future operations stability. Several of the chosen projects will maximize wind tunnel\nreliability and maintainability by using newer, proven technologies in place of older and\nobsolete equipment and processes. The projects will meet NASA\xe2\x80\x99s goal of integrating more\nefficient, environmentally safer, and less energy consuming hardware and processes into\nexisting tunnel systems. These include Environmental Protection Agency-approved\nrefrigerants, energy efficient motors, and faster, flexible tunnel data systems.\n\nNomenclature\ng/m3\nhp\nkcmil\npsia\npsig\nrpm\nscfm\nATP\nDCS\nDRS\nDDS\nEPA\n1\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\ngrams per cubic meter\nhorsepower\nthousand circular mils\npounds per square inch, absolute\npounds per square inch, gauge\nrevolutions per minute\nstandard cubic feet per minute\nAeronautics Test Program\ndistributed control system\nData Reduction Software\nDynamic Data System\nEnvironmental Protection Agency\n\nCapital Investment Projects Manager, Aeronautics Test Program, MS188C, NASA Langley Research Center,\nHampton, VA.\n1\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nNASA\nNTF\n\n= National Aeronautics and Space Administration\n= National Transonic Facility\n\nI. Introduction\nNASA's Aeronautics Test Program (ATP) was created to preserve and promote flight and ground testing\ncapabilities of a select set of research facilities in the United States. Four NASA centers - Ames Research Center in\nMountain View, CA; Dryden Flight Research Center in Edwards, CA; Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, OH;\nand Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA - operate these facilities providing an extensive array of services in\ntheir respective areas of expertise. Responsible for asset management of these facilities within the Aeronautics\nResearch Mission Directorate (ARMD), ATP directs investments in facilities and capabilities that grow and sustain\nthe needed tools for the aeronautics research and testing community. As with most large, complex assets, these are\nconstantly in need of major and minor repairs, technology advancements, and modifications to support the current\nand upcoming needs of various NASA programs, DOD, and industry customers. Strategic selection of investment\nprojects with a constrained budget usually means that only the highest priority requirements are met. However,\nbecause of the ARRA initiative, ATP has the singular opportunity to vertically advance the overall health of its\nportfolio and provide urgently needed test capabilities. Using these funds, ATP is investing in five significant\nprojects across NASA\xe2\x80\x99s ground-based test facilities.\nIn February 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act was signed into law. Paramount to success in\nexecuting this law are preserving and creating jobs, spurring technological advances in science and health, and\npromoting economic recovery. NASA supports and achieves these national goals through the funding selections\nmade in its program and infrastructure. From the ARRA, NASA received a total of $1B of funds spread across its\nfour Mission Directorates. The ARMD received $150M, of which ATP was allocated $46.6M for facility and\ncapability upgrades.\nATP chose projects that ranked highest when matrixed between the ARRA funding requirements and the ATP\nstrategic plan for capability advancement and maintenance recapitalization. Each of these ground-based facilities is\nin high demand and need significant investments. These projects represent a good balance of maintenance, upgrades,\nand new ground-test capabilities that would be impossible to achieve simultaneously without significant funding as\nprovided by the ARRA. By proposing the projects described below for execution ATP successfully demonstrated\ndirect project correlation to the ARRA funding criteria, thereby securing over 38% of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s total ARRA\ninfrastructure investment dollars. The rationale, in part, was based on workforce demographics required to execute\nthese projects. Contracted firms are a balance of large and small businesses, including both blue and white-collar\nworkers. Skill sets required are varied \xe2\x80\x93 construction workers, engineers, designers, manufacturers, and fabricators\nacross the nation are employed. The project activities stimulate economic growth through directly contracted labor\npools and through goods and services provided across the country for supplies that are both non-specialized and\naerospace related. The accomplishment of these projects will enable continued and expanded wind tunnel test\ncapabilities providing national economic benefits by enabling new research jobs, sustaining existing workforce, and\nincreasing tunnel availability by minimized downtime.\n\nII. Compressor Reactivation at the Ames Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel\nThe Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel (UPWT) located at the Ames Research Center (ARC) has been instrumental in\nthe development of virtually every domestically produced commercial transport and military fixed-wing airframe\nsince the 1960s. The wind tunnel complex consists of two operating variable Mach number, variable Reynolds\nnumber wind tunnels, and their associated auxiliary subsystems. The two tunnels have complimentary Mach\nenvelopes covering the transonic range (0.25-1.45) in the 11-Foot and supersonic range (1. 5 to 2.50) in the 9x7. In\nboth closed-loop tunnels, circuit pressure is varied to achieve Reynolds numbers conducive to scaling for test section\nand model sizes. The circuit pressure is adjusted with a high capacity Make Up Air (MUA) compressor system and a\nnetwork of piping, valves, and storage spheres to deliver or remove the air from the tunnels. The singular MUA\ncompressor was put into service in 1956. It consists of a dual-stage, Clark Brothers centrifugal compressor rated at\n50,000 scfm driven by a General Electric 15,000 Hp induction motor through a Farrel Brothers speed-increasing\ngearbox (318/4200 rpm). This MUA compressor system is well beyond its design life and represents a critical single\npoint failure for UPWT operation. The MUA system, over 55 years old, remains largely as it was originally built in\n1954. The used drive motor, on the other hand, was scavenged from the early ARC 16-Foot Subsonic Wind Tunnel\nwhen it was converted in 1953 to the 14-Foot Transonic Tunnel. The motor originally went into service in December\n1941, and at 69 years old, the motor has been well maintained, but never rewound.\n2\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nAlready at an austere age, this equipment continues to run every day, and component failures cause unplanned\ndowntimes at an ever-increasing rate. The probability of unscheduled downtime and catastrophic failure due to\nproblems with 50-70 year old machinery is high. Due to the single-point failure risk the MUA system represents, a\nsignificant amount of effort and money is dedicated to keeping this vital equipment operational. As one might\nexpect, spare parts for this equipment long ago\nbecame unavailable and must now be individually\nmanufactured. Lead times of 6 to12 months and costs\nupwards of $1 million for major components can be\nexpected in the event of a failure. An unplanned\nshutdown with that much test program schedule\nimpact would be devastating to a customer.\nThe Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) MUA\ncompressor system at Building N206 was installed as\npart of the 12-Foot Pressure Wind Tunnel Restoration\nProject in 1994. It was provided to pressurize the\nclosed circuit tunnel. The MUA consists of a 12,000\nHp, 1200 rpm, synchronous motor driving a fourstage, integral gear, centrifugal compressor delivering\n50,000 scfm. Since its initial activation, the MHI\ncompressor has less than 2000 hours of operation and\nremains in excellent overall condition.\nA process air tie line was originally installed at\nARC in the 1970s and was replaced for the most part\nin the 1990s. The tie line was intended to allow\nsharing of air services and mitigate single point\nFigure 1. MHI Make up air compressor, out of service.\nfailures at several facilities, including the 12-Foot\nPressure Tunnel and the UPWT. In 2006, an electrical failure damaged the feeder cables for the 12-Foot Tunnel\nComplex switchgear, forcing a deactivation of the entire facility, including the MHI compressor and subsystems. It\nhas sat idle and unpreserved since that time. Because the other facilities were no longer operating at ARC, the tie\nline was isolated and unmaintained.\nThe Compressor Reactivation Project will provide the UPWT with higher reliability and more efficient\noperations. Primarily, the MHI compressor, via the tie line, will become the primary air supplier for the UPWT,\nincreasing the facility\xe2\x80\x99s reliability, reducing unplanned facility downtime, and reducing the risk of a major facility\noutage. Second, when practical, operating the MHI and Clark MUA systems together improve facility productivity\nby reducing pressurization or evacuation times. Thirdly, the addition of new piping and valves to the 11-Foot tunnel\ncircuit provides capabilities and operating flexibility that will allow additional productivity gains. Finally, there are\nsignificant safety advantages of reactivating the MHI compressor, particularly for the 9x7 tunnel where shock wave\nenergy across the model during an unstart can be reduced. The reactivation project consists of the following major\nwork packages.\nA. Compressor Refurbishment\nBecause the MHI compressor, shown in Fig. 1, has not run nor been maintained for almost five years, several\nareas of work are underway to bring the machine to operational condition. During the process, any damage found is\nbeing repaired. The reactivation approach includes general refurbishment activities with large mechanical rework\nbeing deferred until it has been determined that the work is actually required or not. All work is being executed at\nthe compressor site.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Clean and inspect the unit on site to determine current condition\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Open; inspect/repair heat exchanger tubes in the intercoolers and aftercooler, reassemble, and hydro test\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Integral gearbox pinion and bull gear cleaning and inspection\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Lubrication system overhaul, flush and refill\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Replace miscellaneous parts such as gaskets and seals\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Visually inspect piping compressor connections for defects\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Visually inspect the foundation for cracks\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Refurbish the Air Inlet House, adding safe access, rainproof roof, condensation heaters, and install new filters\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Perform motor maintenance, re-energize motor space heaters\n3\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nB. Air Dryer Upgrades\nThe existing downstream air dryer for the MHI compressor is known to have operating deficiencies support of\nthe UPWT, including poor duty cycle and inadequate drying capability. During the original start-up and\ncommissioning of the dryer, the regeneration blower fan blades came loose due to incorrect mechanical integration\nand damaged the system. The air dryer was reconfigured and additional devices were added to improve system\noperation and safety. However, the performance necessary to support the UPWT independently was never achieved.\nIn order to improve the efficiency of the activated alumina adsorbent material, higher tower pressure is required. The\nexisting backpressure butterfly control valve uses a hydraulic actuator that is unable to hold higher pressure with the\nexisting controller configuration. This deficiency is being corrected by adding fine and coarse valves and integrated\ncontrols to improve the efficiency.\nThe dryer is also being upgraded with high-performance adsorber bed material, a larger capacity electric\nregeneration heater, and fan capacity to meet the duty cycle requirements. Because of its obsolete and marginal\ncontrols, the dryer is being outfitted with a completely new control system that matches the UPWT distributed\ncontrol system platform. The new hardware and software will assure proper control and interlocking of the dryer\nvalving for safety concerns associated with a dual bed regenerative dryer system. The air dryer is now sized to dry\n50,000 scfm of 155 psia saturated air at 95\xc2\xb0F to outlet moisture content of less than 0.4 grains of H2O per pound of\ndry air.\nC. Tie Line Inspection and Repair\nThe predominantly thirty four inch, 1500\xe2\x80\x99 tie line is underground from the 12 Foot Tunnel for 1200\xe2\x80\x99 and then\nrises above ground for the remainder of the run. The pressure drop and evacuation times of the tie line between the\nMHI compressor inlet and the isolation valve at UPWT has been checked by calculation to verify the value of both\npressurization and evacuation modes of the remotely located compressor. The underground section of pipe has been\npartially inspected and subsequently analyzed as part of the project. Robotic visual inspection was performed on the\nfirst 550\xe2\x80\x99 of the pipe interior starting from the UPWT entry point to provide data for condition assessment. The\npipeline\xe2\x80\x99s external coating has been spot-checked by the impressed direct current method. The conductivity of the\npiping relative to the soil was also tested.\nThe pipe is in generally good condition. The internal video inspection showed corrosion associated with the pipe\njoint welding at several locations. Significant corrosion was also noted inside the steel pipe surface near the\ndrainpipe connections because of standing condensation collection. No significant external corrosion or pipeline\ncoating damage was indicated from the impressed current testing. The soil resistivity survey indicated that the soil\nalong the pipeline is moderately corrosive, and would contribute to pipe deterioration. A cathodic protection system\nhas been recommended to minimize external corrosion from soil-pipeline interaction, and will be added to the\nfacility maintenance list. Repairs to the five low point drains and affected pipes will be accomplished and then a full\nup pressure test performed prior to putting the tie line back in service.\nD. Anti-Surge Compressor Control System\nThe existing anti-surge control system for the MHI compressor is integrated into the obsolete control platform\noriginally provided with the compressor. A separate, dedicated anti-surge controller will be installed to perform\nhigh-speed opening of the compressor\xe2\x80\x99s surge relief valve. The anti-surge control system hardware includes a set of\nmain and back-up controllers, a redundant control selector, and power supply components. Not only does this\nsolution provide redundant safety systems it assures complete independence between the compressor controls and\nthe anti-surge control.\nE. Feeder Cables\nThe existing medium voltage conductors supplying power to the compressor are beyond their recommended life\nand four of the nine of the conductors have failed. This leaves five out of nine existing conductors operable, an\ninsufficient quantity to power the MHI MUA compressor. It was considered, but not recommended, to replace just\nthe failed cables, but because of the intertwined installation and damaged cable supports, it was decided to replace\nall cables so that the compressor feeder has consistent electrical characteristics. The existing 2000\xe2\x80\x99 long conductors\nare being replaced with 1250 kcmil ethylene propylene rubber insulated conductors rated for 105\xc2\xb0C continuous full\nload capacity. The new conductors will follow the same route as the existing conductors. Prior to installation work,\nall existing and other abandoned cables will be removed to ease the installation of the new cable runs. As the new\nconductors are pulled in, deteriorated conductor supports will be replaced.\n\n4\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nBecause the cable replacement effort will leave one building (Building N237) without power while the\nreplacement of the conductors is being performed, a temporary feeder and portable generator has to be installed for\nthe duration of the cable replacement work package execution.\nF. Controls and Instrumentation\nThe existing control of the MHI compressor is integrated into the mothballed 12 Foot Pressure Tunnel control\nsystem. To remotely operate the compressor from the UPWT, which has a different control platform, a new controls\nintegration scheme is required. The reactivation controls work consists of a new fiber optic link between the two\nfacilities and controls upgrade to the Emerson Ovation\xe2\x84\xa2 DCS.\nThe current Bently-Nevada\xe2\x84\xa2 3300 health monitoring system for the MHI compressor is a multi-instrument\nsystem that monitors the temperature of drive motor windings, lubrication oil, cooling water, and air as well as\nvibration of the compressor and motor shafts. The newer 3500 series system has current support and more features,\nand consequently is replacing the existing system. The upgraded health monitoring will be interfaced directly to the\nUPWT DCS allowing direct collection of data. In order to maintain integration of the temperature signals with the\nfacility data system, the new 3300series system is configured to also transmit temperature data via the data network.\nThis provides UPWT a fully integrated health monitoring system; recording data continuously for predictive\nmaintenance decisions. This integration method of sensor/control and subsystem/data recording allows UPWT to\nuse equipment condition assessments to determine the most effective time to schedule and perform maintenance.\n\nIII. Ice Crystal Capability at the Glenn Propulsion Systems Laboratory\nThe Propulsion Systems Laboratory (PSL) is one of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s premier direct connect altitude simulation\nfacilities for full-scale gas turbine engine and propulsion system research. It is NASA's only ground-based test\nfacility that can provide true flight simulation for experimental research on air-breathing propulsion. The laboratory\ncan simulate altitudes to 90,000 feet and speeds up to Mach 6. The PSL is equipped to conduct full-scale component\ntesting for basic research, advanced aircraft, space transportation, general-aviation and hypersonic propulsion.\nSince 1988, the Engine Harmonization Working Group (EHWG) has documented over 140 engine power-loss\nevents (surge, stall, rollback, or flameout) attributed to mixed phase (water and ice) and ice crystal atmospheric\nenvironments. Ice accumulation on engine components can result in blockage to airflow, thereby starving the engine\ncombustor leading to engine loss of power. In addition, ice buildup can shed and cause engine stalling or result in\nphysical damage to engine components. Aircraft engines must be certified to operate in icing conditions without\nserious loss of power, loss of thrust, or damage to the engine hardware because of ice shedding. Demonstrating\ncompliance with this requirement is usually carried out in ground test facilities without altitude simulation\ncapability. The fundamental physics of ice buildup and shedding is poorly understood, and research at altitude\nconditions is required to validate information derived from ground testing.\nTo this point, NASA has worked with industry and other government agencies to develop and define the needed\nfacility requirements for reproducing engine icing conditions in flight. Implementation of this new capability will\nprovide engine manufacturers a test bed for understanding and mitigation of engine ice accretion. Armed with this\nknowledge, safer engines can be designed and manufactured, eventually passing the Federal Aviation\nAdministration\xe2\x80\x99s proposed FAR 33 Appendix D engine icing certification tests.\nThe modifications at PSL\xe2\x80\x99s Test Cell 3 will mass producing ice crystals in a controlled environment and direct\nthem into an operating engine. The ice generation system consists of unique crystal-producing spray bars, support\nsystems hardware, and fluid processes. A tunnel transition section will be fabricated and installed to guide the ice\ncrystals into an operating engine. Table 1 lists the requirements for conducting icing research at the PSL Test Cell 3.\nThe PSL icing method will produce small ice particles using water with air-assisted atomization techniques.\nIn this process, atomized water droplets are cooled to insure that all ice particles produced have fully frozen prior to\napproaching the inlet of the engine being tested. This icing system will be capable of producing glaciated icing\nclouds with a density up to 9.0 g/m3. The process uses chilled water and air as cold as 35\xc2\xb0F at the atomizing nozzles.\nColder temperatures are not necessary or recommended in order to avoid possible freezing within the supply lines.\nAs small water particles are produced, their temperature drops almost immediately to 32\xc2\xb0F, the freezing temperature\nof water. The particles stay at that temperature until all latent heat of fusion has been removed, at which point it\nbecomes 100% frozen. Any additional cooling reduces the ice particle temperature closer to its surrounding air.\n\n5\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nTable 1.

Each spray\nbar also has electrical heaters to maintain temperature within the bar as well as insulation to protect it from the\nplenum flow conditions. At the inboard end of each spray bar, the water inlet turns 180\xc2\xb0 and exits the plenum,\nreturning to the closed loop icing water system. Figure 2 shows an exploded cut-away view of the spraybar.\nC. Test Cell 3 Transition Section\nA removable, epoxy-fiber composite transition section has been designed and will be fabricated and installed to\nprovide a smooth transition from the larger Test Cell 3 plenum diameter to the smaller engine inlet diameter\n(approximately 18\xe2\x80\x99 to 7.5\xe2\x80\x99). The transition section outer mold line affects how the ice crystal distribution (quantity\nand size) profile appears to the engine inlet. For ease of fabrication and installation, this transition section consists of\nmultiple epoxy fiber panels that interlock to provide a contiguous transition section. It is envisioned that custom\nfitting of the section will be necessary to accommodate the existing features of the plenum wall, such as the crane\nrail. Figure 3 is the output of a CFD simulation showing Mach number distribution with the curvilinear transition\nsection modeled between the test cell plenum and the engine inlet.\n\nFigure 3. Simulated Mach number distribution using a curvilinear transition section.\n\nIV. New Refrigeration System and Tunnel Heat Exchanger for the Glenn Icing Research Tunnel\nAs the nation\xe2\x80\x99s largest refrigerated wind tunnel, the Icing Research Tunnel (IRT) simulates and tests the effects\nof in-flight icing on various aircraft components and scale models. Built at the end of World War II, the IRT was\ninstrumental in developing and testing ice-protection systems for early piston- and propeller-driven aircraft. The IRT\ncontinues to be very instrumental in the on-going development and certification of ice protection systems and in\nunderstanding icing phenomena.\nThe IRT is in high demand by NASA, DoD, and industry; running test programs 150-200 days per year. The\nnew refrigeration system will replace the original refrigeration system installed in 1943. Through repairs and\nmodifications, the existing system has lost low-temperature cooling capability over time. A planar-style tunnel heat\nexchanger (HEX) replaced the vintage W-style HEX in 1999. This modification was coupled with substantial tunnel\ncircuit modifications that improved the flow quality problems associated with the air passage through the original\nHEX. Once the tunnel was placed back in service, it was discovered that ice formation and shedding on the exit edge\nof the planar HEX was causing ice erosion on subject models, reducing test quality. This project will provide a\ncompletely new and modern refrigeration system and a new state of the art heat exchanger mounted in the tunnel.\nThe new Integrated Refrigeration System coupled with the new cascade heat exchanger will provide several\nimportant customer benefits. For testing capability, the new equipment will greatly reduce the current ice erosion\nregion during high speed, low temperature test conditions by reducing air velocity through the new HEX. The\n7\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nsystem will also restore the tunnel\xe2\x80\x99s capability to operate to the original minimum capability of -40\xe2\x81\xb0C by using a\ndual fluid system. Temperature control\nis enhanced by using a secondary fluid\nbypass loop to increase the response\ntime to temperature variations. The\npublic continues to benefit from the\nIRT through its contribution to the\ndevelopment of aircraft that can safely\nfly through hazardous weather\nconditions.\nA. Integrated Refrigeration System\nThe original IRT refrigeration system\nused fourteen 1500Hp centrifugal\ncompressors, and was designed to\nservice the IRT and the Altitude Wind\nTunnel (Ref. Fig. 4). The refrigerant\nwas originally R12, but later changed\nto R134a after the Montreal Protocol\nwas adopted by the United States in\n1987. Since its initial installation, the\nFigure 4. Original IRT Refrigeration System, circa 1951.\nsystem\nhas\nundergone\nmany\nprocess/equipment changes, all seeming to slowly nibble away at the integrated performance of the refrigeration\nsystem coupled to the IRT HEX. Currently leaks in the system are requiring about 10,000 lbs. of refrigerant\nreplacement every two years. The system also suffers from many of the same age-related reliability issues discussed\nfor the UPWT Clark compressor.\nThe design of a completely new Integrated Refrigeration System consisting of two main segments is underway:\nA Primary Refrigeration System and a Secondary Coolant System. By integrating the two fluid loops, the primary\nloop refrigerant compressor stability requirement and setpoint control is greatly relaxed. Additionally, the use of\nrefrigerant as the HEX heat transfer fluid can lead to uncontrolled phase change, thereby disrupting uniform heat\ntransfer across the HEX and resulting in much higher system inefficiency. A pre-engineered metal building is\nprovided to house the equipment and controls. The 70\xe2\x80\x99 x 120\xe2\x80\x99 building allows for weather protection with minimal\nenviromental conditioning.\nThe Primary Refrigeration System will use multiple screw compressors, evaporators, and condensers to provide\nabout 1500 tons of cooling. The primary refrigerant fluid will be R-507. At the -65\xc2\xb0F evaporator temperature, this\nrefrigerant operates at a higher pressure than R-134a, and allows more efficient compressor operation. For other\nfactors, such as flammability, toxicity, Global Warming Potential, and Ozone Depletion Potential the two\nrefrigerants exhibit similar characeristics. With the new refrigeration system, the amount of refrigerant is reduced\nfrom approximately 24,000 lbs to less than 7,000 lbs and the yearly leakage rate is nearly eliminated.\nThe Secondary Cooling Loop consists of a piping pass through the Primary Refrigeration System evaporator, a\npump skid, reservoir, controls, and distribution piping/valves to the tunnel and the HEX itself. By using a secondary\ntransfer fluid, the control of exit air temperature and temperature uniformity are greatly improved. The secondary\nloop fluid, Dynalene\xe2\x84\xa2 HC-50, was chosen based on thermal capacity, flammability, toxicity, and other variables.\nAlso, because of its high density and heat transfer coefficient at the desired temperature range, the volumentric flow\nrate is lower than other candidates. Two 250 Hp supply pumps will deliver a flow rate of over 7000 gpm to the\ntunnel HEX.\nNew, modern control of the Integrated Refrigeration System will be implemented to improve operational\nefficiency and achieve near autonomous operation. This reduces the manpower required to operate the IRT and\nresults in an improved efficiency that will benefit the test customers with more testing hours per test program.\nModern leak detection and and life safety systems will be provided for the building. Operation of each gable end\nroll-up door, and the building ventilation systems are interlocked with the refrigerant leak detectors for safety.\nB. Heat Exchanger Fluid Temperature Control Loop\nTo very accurately control air temperature exiting the tunnel HEX, additional steps beyond typical variable\ncompressor loading and hot-gas bypass injection methods must implemented. The Integrated Refrigeration System\xe2\x80\x99s\nSecondary Cooling Loop includes a set of opposing flow controls that regulate HEX inlet temperature while\n8\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nmaintainin constant flow rate of the s\nng\nw\nsecondary cool\nlant fluid.

Data System Improvements\nRecent studies at NTF have shown that the facility measurement accuracies and repeatability do a marginal job\nof meeting current commercial high Reynolds number testing demands. Primary contributors limiting performance\nare balance measurements and calculation issues, model angularity measurements and tunnel conditions that are\nboth measured and calculated. A major common element to these contributors is the existing data acquisition\nhardware and architecture. The following actions are underway to correct these issues. Note that with each data\nsystem computer and software replacement, the existing front-end hardware, wiring, and instrumentation is not\naffected by this upgrade.\nReplacement of the Process Computer System - The Process Computing System (PCS) that performs as the plant\nstate monitor and logging historian, will be upgraded to a current technology based platform capable of continuous\nrecording. The new hardware and software integrates with the other facility data systems such that common\ncomponents may be shared and configured in a consistent manner between each system. The new system is\nexpandable up to 1028 analog and 64 digital channels and will have the ability to collect and store data at the\nmaximum scan rate for up to 12 hours. Historical data analysis and archiving capability is also included.\n\nTable 2. Comparison of existing and new PCS data throughput and scan rates.\n\nReplacement of the Research Computer System - The Research Computer System (RCS) that performs the data\nacquisition and calculations for tunnel parameters, test article measurements and various research specific\nmeasurements is also being upgraded to a current technology based platform. The RCS will communicate with the\ntunnel control system through the upgrades described below to gather tunnel control parameters and measurements.\nRCS captured data shall have the capability to be time aligned such that differing measurement lag times at various\ntunnel conditions can be correlated. The new RCS is also expandable up to 1028 analog and 64 digital channels and\n\nTable 3. Comparison of existing and new RCS data throughput and scan rates.\n\nwill have the ability to collect and store data at the maximum scan rate for up to 12 hours.\nReplacement of the Dynamic Data System - The dynamic data acquisition system (DDS) is being upgraded as an\nintegral part of the RCS architecture. Data may be collected simultaneously with RCS at rates allowing frequency\nspectral analysis concurrent with relatively static data from RCS. It can operate independently or in concert with\nRCS.\nReplacement of the Model Prep Area Data System - Upgrade the Model Prep Area (MPA) data acquisition\nsystem which performs measurement and calculation of signals generated in the Model Prep Bays to a current\ntechnology based platform. The MPA will duplicate all functions and calculations as RCS so that in the event of a\nfailure, components of MPA may stand in for RCS thereby reducing the downtime impact to productivity.\n10\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nOn-line Data Reduction Software - The Data Reduction Software (DRS) will reside on the RCS and perform all\nthe current data reduction routines. It will be implemented utilizing commercially available analysis and\ncomputational software system (e.g. MATLAB\xc2\xae), allowing for rapid development and integration of new methods\nand options. The DRS will provide real time display capability for all measurements and calculations. All\ncalculations will occur such that each measurement step is concurrent with its calculated values. The DRS will have\nseveral advanced balance configuration possibilities, including selectable options to allow balance interaction\ncalculations using either the Langley standard 6 X 27 matrix or the AIAA 6 X 96 matrix. In addition, the balance\ninteractions may be applied after conversion to force or before. The DRS will allow the balance to be connected as a\nmoment device with appropriate interactions applied and resulting forces calculated or as a force balance with\nappropriate interactions applied. Balance tare routines will be developed to provide tares with upright/inverted\nmeasurements that resolve to near zero. The DRS options modifications will also allow balance temperature\ncompensation using non- linear curve fits for up to 9 points on the balance. The curve fit components as well as X,\nY, Z location on the balance with respect to moment center will be components of the calculation. The balance\ninteraction calculations shall be modified to compensate for up to nine temperature different measurement locations.\nThe RCS running the data reduction software shall \xe2\x80\x98reduce\xe2\x80\x99 a 40,000-point series of test data including file input and\noutput functions within 10 minutes. (The current system requires over five hours performing this task.) The\noperation of the data reduction software shall not affect the performance of RCS while capturing data.\nOther Improvements - The scope of additional improvements is large. Features such as a new Automatic Test\nSequencer, data storage on a redundant array of independent disks with tape back-up, video system storage,\nsynchronized time stamping, real time display screens, and more make this effort truly innovative in the\nadvancements in ease of testing and data access/management.\nB. Control System Upgrades\nUpgrades to the facility controls at NTF target several weak areas of tunnel infrastructure and instrumentation.\nTo assure performance validation of the new components and site implementation, tunnel testing is included both\nbefore and after the upgrades. The tasks are broken down into the following work packages.\nTunnel Control Microprocessors - Three rack-mounted microprocessors function as tunnel pressure controller,\ntunnel temperature controller, Mach number controller, and model position controller. The microprocessors also\ninclude analog safety interlocks, and supervisory functions associated with controlling the tunnel operations. These\nwill be replaced with a single computer for control algorithms and calculations. A programmable logic controller\n(PLC) will be added to handle the inputs and outputs associated with the interlocks and sequencing previously\nimbedded in the control microprocessors. Software for the new platforms is currently being written.\nPLC Platform Upgrade \xe2\x80\x93 Four existing PLCs will be upgraded to a newer, higher speed platform. This includes\nadvanced processors with high speed communication interconnection, new input/output modules and backplanes.\nNovel manufacturer designs allow plug and play replacement of the hardware, even thought the form factor is\ncompletely different. The existing logic is being ported to the compatible application software for the new PLCs. In\naddition, the fan drive motor health monitoring system and data interfaces will be replaced with new components.\nFlow Reference System Study \xe2\x80\x93 The existing Mach number measurement system contains equipment and\nsensors that are no longer manufactured. In order to develop a replacement, highly accurate sensors with wide\ndynamic ranges are needed. To accurately determine the facility need and the subsequent device specifications, a\ntunnel uncertainty model has been developed. Using this model in a Monte Carlo simulation with existing test data\nwill provide the information necessary to design a replacement system.\nTunnel Simulation Model \xe2\x80\x93 A complete tunnel simulation is being developed using MATLAB\xc2\xae and Simulink\xc2\xae.\nThe NTF has complex control systems with strong interactions and dependencies. For example, Mach number\ncontrol is effected by tunnel pressure, temperature, fan pressure ratio, and whether the tunnel is operating with air or\nnitrogen as the test gas. The complexity and wide range of facility operational conditions has limited the\noptimization of the various control systems due to the high tunnel operational expenses, risks, and extensive\ncommitments of tunnel test time. As a result, minimal tunnel optimization or advanced algorithm development has\ntaken place. Also, the original tunnel control laws were not well documented. The new tunnel model is being rapidly\ndeveloped with the sophisticated tools currently available and has good correlation with existing tunnel performance\ndata. The goal will be to enable the tunnel operations team, and customers, to simulate various scenarios of tunnel\nchanges and demonstrate performance results without involving the physical hardware.\nValidation Tests \xe2\x80\x93 A check standard test, T208, was completed in March 2010 using the standard Pathfinder\nmodel in both air and cryogenic modes. A follow-up test, T209, is planned next year to compare performance with\nthe new control upgrades, and hopefully the newly installed data system upgrades, although that addition is not a\n11\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\ncriteria for the follow-up test. Comparison of the test data will be a quality assurance and requirements acceptance\nactivity for the contracted elements of the work package.\nC. Reliability Assessment and Improvements\nTo improve the operational reliability, three subtasks with in this work packages are being executed to identify\ndowntime sources and how to best approach reduction of the resulting lost time.\nReview/Analysis of Lost Time - A detailed review and analysis of operational lost time history at the NTF is\nbeing conducted. The purpose is to identify the operational lost time and the associated cost impact per lost time per\nsystem over the last four fiscal years (2006, 2007, 2008, & 2009). Included in the analysis is data from all related\nMishap Investigations.\nA \xe2\x80\x98Lost Time Analysis Report\xe2\x80\x99 that details the ranking (from greatest to least) of the operational lost time per\nsystem and associated cost influence per system will be prepared from the analysis. This report will contain a brief\ndescription of the lost time event and clearly identify repeat events or safety related events. Any reliability issues\nthat are considered safety critical will be prioritized.\nOn-Site Condition Assessment - An on-site system condition assessment is also being conducted to evaluate the\ncurrent condition of major facility systems and subsystems. The assessment will address the physical condition of\neach major system and associated subsystems; evaluate the effectiveness of the current maintenance program, spare\nparts inventory and systems operations. Facility systems will be compared to \xe2\x80\x98industry standards\xe2\x80\x99 of maintenance\nand reliability of similar equipment. The condition assessment will be summarized in a report, including an\nevaluation of the systems with regard to safety of equipment, safety of workforce, system reliability, an estimation\nof remaining useful life and likelihood and cost of a system or component failure.\nRecommendations and Review - The results of the Review and Analysis of Lost Time and the On-Site Condition\nAssessment will be compiled in a Final Recommendations Report. The information provided will be used to\nimprove the NTF\xe2\x80\x99s reliability through reduced operational downtime. The Final Recommendations Report will\ninclude findings and detailed recommendations that are necessary to improve the NTF\xe2\x80\x99s reliability in priority order\nnecessary to improve reliability and reduce lost time and costs. Implementation of the items will begin after the\nreport has been accepted, and will continue as schedule and funding is available.\n\nVI. Modifications at the Langley 14x22 Low Speed Wind Tunnel\nIn the past, this facility has been used to assess conventional performance for low-speed tests of powered and\nunpowered models of various fixed- and rotary-wing civil and military aircraft over a wide range of takeoff, landing,\ncruise, and high angle-of-attack conditions. Nevertheless, the tunnel can be reconfigured for acoustic, tethered freeflight and forced-oscillation testing. The project focuses on infrastructure modifications that will provide the facility\ncapability to accomplish a groundbreaking test program and establish a benchmarking standard with leading edge\ntechnology for acoustic measurements.\nThe 14x22 modifications will support the Environmentally Responsible Aviation (ERA) Project under ARMD\xe2\x80\x99s\nnewly formed Integrated Systems Research Program (ISRP). Through the partnership with ISRP using ARRA\nfunding, ATP is providing two significant efforts. First, a traverse mechanism design to hold a specialized\nmicrophone phased array and second, fuel storage and delivery equipment for a novel Compact Jet Engine Simulator\n(CJES). Developing technologies that will enable dramatic reductions in aircraft noise is a critical element of\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s ERA program. The future role for the 14x22 as a premier acoustic research facility starts with the Hybrid\nWing Body (HWB) Acoustic Test Program.\nA. Fuel and Purge Systems Infrastructure\nTesting the proposed phenomena in a wind tunnel requires the use of engines scaled to the size of the model. The\nCJES developed for acoustic and propulsion integration studies in the 14x22 are hot dual stream subsonic engines at\na 5.8% scale of a 75,000 pound thrust engine. The CJES\nwill generate scaled thrust and combustion products\nappropriate to the proposed engines and mimic aero\nacoustic noise generated by aircraft engines. In order to\naccomplish this, propane and air are supplied to the CJES\nwhere they are mixed and burned. Various discrete engine\nlocations coupled with a movable model sting allow for\ncharacterizing total acoustic interactions with the model.\n12\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nIn order to support a typical test day (6 hours of testing) of continuous operation with the scale model CJESs, a\npropane storage and delivery system is being designed and built to bring the fuel to an interface point on the CJES\nmodel fuel pallet. The fuel system is designed to provide 0.3 pounds-mass per second to the CJES from a 250 gallon\nrun tank. The run tank can be filled and emptied via a connection to a 2500 gallon liquid propane storage tank.\nA parallel nitrogen pressurization and purge system is\nFigure 6. Conceptual CJES, mounted on HWB model.\nalso being provided to safely remove air initially from the\nfuel lines and to inert the lines after a test run. The\nnitrogen will also be used to pressurize the fuel run tank\nduring operations. The systems are designed to interface with the CJES control pallet as the tunnel model support\ncart is moved in and out of the test section.\nB. Microphone Traverse Mechanism Design\nWhile the high-bypass ratio simulator engines\nare running, it is envisioned that acoustic noise\npatterns can be mapped with a movable multimicrophone recording system. To accurately\ndevelop acoustic maps of engine noise, sensitive\nmicrophone arrays must be positioned out-of-flow\non a stable mechanism that provides accurate twodimensional positioning.\nThe biggest challenge to gathering high\nfidelity acoustic measurements at the 14x22 is\novercoming the flow induced vibrations of the\ntunnel structure into a traverse framework holding\nthe microphone array. Additionally, there is a\nsmall envelope of space overhead between the\nneeded ceiling acoustic insulation and the lower\nboundary of the \xe2\x80\x98out-of-flow\xe2\x80\x99 region where the\narray panel can be positioned. Preliminary tunnel\nFigure 7. Model of traverse concept in the 14x22 test section.\nmeasurements and existing acoustic mapping\ntechniques have established the required\npositioning accuracies and vibration limits. A rigorous, high performance trade study is being conducted, including\nthree-dimensional modeling of proposed frames and attachment methods. These techniques check for physical\ninterferences throughout the range of traverse motion and simulate the structural dynamic performance. A downselect process will provide the best solution overall and define the constraints for the final design work.\nIn order to provide the necessary access envelope at the flow inlet end of the test section, a portion of the\nexisting control room and a helicopter blade protective blast wall have to be removed. A control room modification\nis required to reduce the footprint while maintaining the existing controls equipment.\nC. Rotorcraft Test Cell Upgrades\nThe 14x22 also has a long history of performing rotorcraft research, and over the years has developed an\ninfrastructure base that supports this research. The Rotor Test Cell, an area of the facility dedicated to rotor\nperformance investigations is in need of significant improvements. These improvements, while not costly, bring\nexpanded control room areas and better equipment and instrumentation to support upcoming tests. ATP is providing\nthe project execution of these additional 14x22 modifications to advance NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Subsonic Rotary Wing research.\nExpansion of Rotor Test Cell Control Room - Rotorcraft research in the Rotor Test Cell now routinely involves\nmultiple test objectives and thus more researchers, especially those with specialized test techniques and\ninstrumentation. To effectively and efficiently conduct research in the Rotor Test Cell, when the test involves\nmultiple objectives, the entire test team needs to be located in the same control room. A new two-story control room\nis being constructed to house all the rotor operational staff and additional researchers using specialized instruments.\nModel Interface Racks (MIF) Environmental Cabinets - The MIF racks provide the instrumentation interface\nbetween research models and the 14x22 tunnel data system. The current MIF racks are over 25 years old and contain\nworn components that create data measurement quality and reliability problems. Four environmentally-controlled\nequipment racks will replace the existing units.\nHigh Speed Cameras - The quality of the measurement of pressure sensitive paint (PSP) is directly related to the\namount of light used to illuminate the paint and the sensitivity of the cameras used to record the PSP images. Two\n13\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nCMOS cameras with 1280x1024-pixel resolution and image capture rate up to 520 frames per second are being\ninstalled to improve the quality of the PSP rotor data.\nModel Instrumentation and Patch Panel/Cabling \xe2\x80\x93 Connections and cabling of instrumentation that measures\nrotor system parameters is critical to both the operation of the rotor system and the quality of the data produced\nduring a test program. A reliable, new patch panel and signal cabling maintains measured data quality and reduces\nthe time required to connect instrumentation. The next scheduled test in the rotor test cell will be a rotor\ndownwash/outwash investigation. High accuracy dynamic pressure transducers will be provided to make\nmeasurements as needed on the fuselage and ground plane to characterize the flow of the rotor downwash and its\neffect on ground-plane objects.\n\nVII. Additional Benefits and Challenges of the Recovery Act Projects\nWhile the primary technical gain for NASA from the implementation of these major projects is given above in\nthe descriptions, there are additional intangible benefits and some difficult challenges. The overall use of wind\ntunnels for research testing has declined over the past years and along with that, the ability to attract, retain, and\ndevelop wind tunnel application engineering. A major challenge of executing these projects is to bring them on line\nsuccessfully in concert with ongoing facility operations.\nA. Additional Benefits\nNASA and its Contractor workforce will gain from these large, fast track projects through the experience and\nmaturity of the people involved. NASA is losing the corporate wind tunnel operations knowledge base through\nattrition. In addition, NASA has not attracted new talent because of increasingly attractive competition of hightechnology jobs. Through these projects, both labor segments are gaining hands-on involvement, building the much\nneeded resource competency and re-establishing a mature work force that can execute difficult wind tunnel projects\nwith the critical knowledge skills that only come from actual involvement in such efforts. Subsequent to the\ncompletion of the projects, additional research jobs, and employment opportunities will exist utilizing these\nadvancements.\nB. Challenges\nThe facilities to be upgraded are all heavily utilized and represent unique test capabilities. The challenge of\nintegrating installation and checkout of new systems or modifications with customer test schedules usually results in\ncompromise and delays. Managing customer milestone deliveries and smoothly executing the transition from\noperation to construction represent additional workloads on the facility managers and staff. The impacts to the\nprojects can be nontrivial as well. Costs resulting from extended schedules or Government imposed workarounds\ncan require significant contingencies. However, because of the strict and accelerated spending requirements of the\nARRA, holding contingencies well into project maturity is not allowed. The Center-located ATP project managers,\nalong with the affected facility managers, have to develop strategies unique to each individual tunnel and testing\nschedule to meet these conflicting requirements successfully. In any case, ATP must be prepared to cover\ncontingency shortfalls in the next fiscal year, which will certainly affect the facility budgets.\n\nVIII. Conclusion\nThe new capabilities of icing research and acoustic noise mapping will be instrumental in future aircraft safety\ndevelopments and environmentally responsible aircraft designs. The benefit to NASA, its customers, and ultimately\nthe public is possible because of the major funds provided by the ARRA.\nIn order to continue providing new capabilities that research entities are envisioning and maintain safe and\nreliable facilities that can be made available when needed, projects like the ARRA ones are much needed. The\nprojected out-year budgets for ATP to manage and maintain this core set of facility capabilities are flat, at best.\nSpecialized funding sources are rare and unpredictable, and by necessity, ATP and Centers must always be prepared\nto take advantage of opportunities like the ARRA and immediately start major improvements.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe author would like to thank each of the project teams across the three NASA Centers for the outstanding\nwork in executing these projects.
