Published work is examined to show that the bit assignment rule is useful for transforms of full pictures, but subjective bit assignments for transform picture coding using small block sizes are significantly different from the theoretical bit assignment rule. An intuitive explanation is based on subjective design experience, and a subjectively obtained bit assignment rule is given.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19770013347, "id": "f42d7df622b64daab5601ffc8a3e6129", "publicationDate": "1977-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19770013347.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19770013347/downloads/19770013347.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19770013347/downloads/19770013347.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19770013347/downloads/19770013347.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
