The projects were selected as the best candidates within the constraints of the ARRA and the strategic plan of ATP. They are a combination of much-needed large scale maintenance, reliability, and system upgrades plus creating new test beds for upcoming research programs. The projects are: 1.) Re-activation of a large compressor to provide a second source for compressed air and vacuum to the Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel at the Ames Research Center (ARC) 2.) Addition of high-altitude ice crystal generation at the Glenn Research Center Propulsion Systems Laboratory Test Cell 3, 3.) New refrigeration system and tunnel heat exchanger for the Icing Research Tunnel at the Glenn Research Center, 4.) Technical viability improvements for the National Transonic Facility at the Langley Research Center, and 5.) Modifications to conduct Environmentally Responsible Aviation and Rotorcraft research at the 14 x 22 Subsonic Tunnel at Langley Research Center. The selection rationale, problem statement, and technical solution summary for each project is given here. The benefits and challenges of the ARRA funded projects are discussed. Indirectly, this opportunity provides the advantages of developing experience in NASA's workforce in large projects and maintaining corporate knowledge in that very unique capability. It is envisioned that improved facilities will attract a larger user base and capabilities that are needed for current and future research efforts will offer revenue growth and future operations stability. Several of the chosen projects will maximize wind tunnel reliability and maintainability by using newer, proven technologies in place of older and obsolete equipment and processes. The projects will meet NASA's goal of integrating more efficient, environmentally safer, and less energy consuming hardware and processes into existing tunnel systems. These include Environmental Protection Agency-approved refrigerants, energy efficient motors, and faster, flexible tunnel data systems.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20100025486, "endDate": "2010-07-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "Reston, VA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "2463604c1a27410498b652de348595fb", "id": "998a75327828409db8debee953c78489"}], "name": "27th AIAA Aerodynamic Measurement and Ground Testing Conference", "location": "Chicago, IL", "id": "2463604c1a27410498b652de348595fb", "startDate": "2010-06-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20100025486, "id": "a3f93f4020524102a74898215c93af0e", "publicationDate": "2010-06-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20100025486.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20100025486/downloads/20100025486.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20100025486/downloads/20100025486.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20100025486/downloads/20100025486.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
