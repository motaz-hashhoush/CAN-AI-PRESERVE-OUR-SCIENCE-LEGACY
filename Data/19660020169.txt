Such measurements were used t o\nf i n d t h e t r u e t a i l o r e d conditions f o r C02 + Ar and C02 + A r + H mixtures,\ne\nCalculated conditions i n excellent agreement\nand f o r N2 driven by He.\nwith t h e s e resulted when t h e r e a l performance of t h e tube, instead of t h e\ni d e a l performance, was employed i n t h e usual t a i l o r i n g formula. This suggss%s a rapid systematic way t o prochze the t a i l o r e d s t a t e , and shows that\nit w i l l not be the same i n a l l tubes. However, a small pressure excursion\ndue t o contact-surface i n t e r a c t i o n s t i l l remains even when perfect t a i l o r ing i s achieved.\nINTRODUCTION\n\nI n recent years considerable use has been made of t h e r e f l e c t e d shock\nwave i n studying high temperature gas dynamic phenomena. Because it provides s t a t i o n a r y t e s t gas, increased t e s t i n g t i m e , higher gas enthalpy.and\ndensity, and lends i t s e l f t o chemical sampling, t h e reflected-shock \xe2\x80\x98technique has found wide usage i n chemical shock tubes and shock tunnels.\nHowever, both applications require a d e t a i l e d understanding and close cont r o l of t h e state of t h e gas behind the r e f l e c t e d shock wave. Because\ni n t e r a c t i o n between t h e r e f l e c t e d shock wave and t h e contact surface causes\na pressure and temperature distrubance t o be r e f l e c t e d back i n t o t h e t e s t\nzone, it i s desirable t o eliminate t h i s interaction. This i s usually accomplished by using t h e t a i l o r e d - i n t e r f a c e mode of operation.\nI n t h e t a i l o r e d - i n t e r f a c e mode, i n i t i a l conditions i n t h e d r i v e r\n(diaphragm pressure r a t i o , gas composition, and i n some tubes, temperat u r e ) a r e adjusted s o t h a t t h e r e f l e c t e d shock wave, on encountering t h e\ncontact surface, produces the same pressure and the same p a r t i c l e v e l o c i t y\non b o t h s i d e s of it. These requirements, when expressed i n terms of t h e\nusual r e l a t i o n s among shock strength and gas properties, lead t o t h e t a i l o r ing formula\n\n.. :..\nr\n.\n\n.\n\nBrabbs and Belles\n\nHowever, when t h i s equation i s used the calculations a r e usually made by\nassuming t h e shock tube behaves ideally; t h a t i s , t h e Mach number i s r e lated t o t h e i n i t i a l pressure r a t i o Pgl by t h e i d e a l shock tube performance equations. Because most shock tubes do not behave ideally, t h e\ni n i t i a l t e s t conditions calculated from equation (1) a r e only approximate,\nand achievement of t a i l o r i n g can be established only by observing t h e experimental pressure record. The experimental procedure usually employed\ni s t o c a l c u l a t e t h e i n i t i a l t a i l o r i n g conditions and t o use these t e s t\nconditions t o obtain an experimental pressure record. If t a i l o r i n g has\nnot been achieved, which i s t h e usual case, t h e i n i t i a l pressure r a t i o\n(P41) i s adjusted somewhat and another pressure record i s obtained. Because it i s d i f f i c u l t t o judge how much t h e pressure r a t i o must be changed\nby looking a t t h e pressure record, the procedure usually requires several\nt e s t runs. This procedure can be very t i m e consuming and a simpler and\nmore d i r e c t method f o r t a i l o r i n g i s desirable.\nI d e a l l y t h e t a i l o r e d oscillogram i s expected t o show t h e r e f l e c t e d shock pressure as a flat-topped plateau, and i n p r i n c i p l e t h e r e should be\nonly one incident-shock Mach number that would y i e l d such a record f o r a\ngiven driver-driven gas combination. I n practice, however, records having\nt h e q u a l i t a t i v e appearance described a r e obtained over a small range of\nincident Mach numbers close t o t h e t a i l o r i n g conditions.\nThis i s because\nt h e i n t e r a c t i o n i s weak and has l i t t l e e f f e c t on t h e pressure history.\nIf,\nhowever, t h e shock tube i s operated outside t h i s range, t h e r e f l e c t e d shock\nwave w i l l experience multiple r e f l e c t i o n s between t h e contact surface int e r f a c e and t h e end of the tube. The r e s u l t of these multiple shock r e f l e c t i o n s i s t h e formation of a quasi-uniform region known a s t h e "equilibrium" s t a t e ( r e f . 1). This equilibrium s t a t e l i k e t h e t a i l o r e d s t a t e i s\ncharacterized by a flat-topped pressure h i s t o r y as shown i n figure 1\n.\nFigure 1 shows a t y p i c a l nontailored pressure-time history. The arr i v a l of t h e r e f l e c t e d disturbance from t h e contact surface can be seen by\nt h e abrupt change i n t h e pressure. The f l a t region a f t e r t h e i n t e r a c t i o n\ni s t h e equilibrium s t a t e . Thus a flat-topped pressure record i s not always\ns u f f i c i e n t proof that t a i l o r i n g has been achieved. Experimental r e s u l t s\nt o be presented l a t e r show t h a t confusion can e x i s t between these two states\nand t h a t a b e t t e r c r i t e r i o n f o r t a i l o r i n g i s required.\nA t Mach numbers greater than the t a i l o r e d one, t h e equilibrium pressure\n(p,) i s g r e a t e r than t h e r e f l e c t e d shock pressure ( p5).

It w s made up of\nsections of 6.35-centimeter inside-diameter s t a i n l e s s - s t e e l tubing; t h e\ndriven section was 3.2 meters long and t h e d r i v e r 1.88 meters. The dump\ntank volume w a s &bout 5600 l i t e r s . The b a s i c instrumentation consisted\nof t h r e e miniature p i e z o e l e c t r i c pressure transducers located 11.4, 29.2,\nand 47 centimeters from t h e end of the shock tube. These operated t h e\ns t a r t - s t o p c i r c u i t s of two microsecond time-interval meters s o t h a t t h e\nv e l o c i t y could be measured over two i n t e r v a l s f o r each run. A f o u r t h\npickup located 11.4 centimeters from the end of t h e tube was a c a l i b r a t e d\nSLM ( K i s t l e r I n s t . Corp., type 601) pressure transducer. I t s output, recorded on an oscilloscope, gave the pressure-time h i s t o r y i n t h e reaction\nzone behind t h e r e f l e c t e d shock wave. The r e f l e c t i n g surface of t h e\nshock tube could be moved t o within 0.63 centimeter of t h e SIN pressure\ntransducer by i n s e r t i n g close f i t t i n g plugs i n t o t h e tube.\n\nI n order t o eliminate contamination of t h e helium d r i v e r gas by\nr e s i d u a l a i r , t h e d r i v e r section w a s evacuated t o 1 t o r r or l e s s and then\npurged w i t h helium before f i l l i n g .\nThe t e s t section was always evacuated t o about 4~10\'~ o r r and flushed\nt\nwith t e s t gas before f i l l i n g . "his section was i s o l a t e d from t h e pump by\na cold t r a p cooled i n l i q u i d nitrogen and had a leak r a t e of 1 t o 2 ~ 1 0 \' ~\nt o r r per minute.\nThe driven gases were nitrogen and various mixtures of argon, helium,\nand carbon dioxide. The mixtures were prepared by t h e method of partial\npressures. The procedure w a s described i n a previous paper ( r e f . 3).\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nI n each experiment t h e following data were obtained: i n i t i a l tempera t u r e and pressures of d r i v e r and driven gas, incident shock v e l o c i t i e s\n(over two i n t e r v a l s ) , and an oscilloscope record containing t h e pressuretime history. The shock v e l o c i t i e s over t h e two i n t e r v a l s were generally\nfound t o be t h e same within t h e resolution of the measurement; therefore,\na t t e n u a t i o n was neglected. The pressure transducer was dynamically C a l i brated by p l o t t i n g t h e measured p5 against t h e calculated p5.

This was due mainly t o three things;\n4\n\n.\n\nBrabbs and Belles\n\n(1)Acceleration response of t h e transducer\n( 2 ) Excessive ringing of t h e transducer due t o t h e mounting\n(3) Effect exerted on t h e pressure record by t h e i n t e r a c t i o n of t h e\nr e f l e c t e d shock wave and the boundary l a y e r\n\nThis i n a b i l i t y t o determine t h e i n i t i a l r e f l e c t e d shock pressure with\nany c e r t a i n t y lead us t o question whether t h e flat-topped equilibrium state\nw a s not being confused with t h e t a i l o r e d s t a t e . I n order t o i l l u s t r a t e t h e\nproblem as it might a r i s e from t h e t h i r d cause j u s t l i s t e d , two r e f l e c t e d pressure records were obtained i n nitrogen a t t h e same incident Mach number.\nNitrogen w a s selected as t h e t e s t gas because it i s subject t o strong b i f u r cation of t h e r e f l e c t e d shock near the w a l l , as described by Mark ( r e f . 4).\nCenter ( r e f . 5) showed t h a t the bifurcation becomes more pronounced as t h e\nshock recedes from t h e end wall. Thus, a pressure record obtained close t o\nthe end wall may c l e a r l y resolve p while one obtained f a r t h e r away w i l l\nhave p5 obscured by t h e e f f e c t s o? shock bifurcation.\n\n,\n\nThe r e s u l t s of these tests are shown i n f i g u r e 3. I n f i g u r e 3(a), obt a i n e d a t 0.63 centimeter from the end w a l l , the a r r i v a l of a strong d i s turbance from t h e contact surface a t about 500 microseconds shows c l e a r l y\nt h a t t a i l o r i n g did not occur. But i n t h e record of figure 3(b), which was\nobtained a t 11.4 centimeters from the end w a l l , t h e i n t e r a c t i o n blends with\nt h e disturbance i n t h e boundary layer t h a t r e s u l t s from t h e more pronounced\nbifurcation. The record thus indicates a smoothly rounded pressure f r o n t\nfollowed by a plateau.\nIf the shock b i f u r c a t i o n w e r e assumed t o b e responsible f o r a l l t h e\n\ncurvature i n a t r a c e such as f i g u r e 3(b), then it would be q u i t e possible\nt o conclude t h a t t h e f l a t portion signals t h e achievement of t a i l o r i n g .\nI n making t h i s mistake, e r r o r s i n pressure and temperature would a r i s e\namounting, i n t h i s p a r t i c u l a r case, t o about 40 percent i n t h e pressure\n8\'\nand 10 K i n t h e temperature. This i s much t o o large an e r r o r f o r most\nexperiments.\nThus, t h i s experiment has shownthat a g r e a t e r degree of\'confidence\ncan be achieved i n t a i l o r i n g by locating and mounting t h e pressure transducer so that t h e r e f l e c t e d shock pressure (p5) can be measured and compared with theory. If t h i s i s impossible, then the equilibrium pressure\nshould be measured and compared with t h e calculated p5 since a t t h e\nt a i l o r e d conditions these two should be equal.\nTailoring\nThe f i r s t experiments were conducted with 7 percent C02 + 9 3 percent\nA r driven by helium.

Measured a r r i v a l times (time from passage of t h e r e f l e c t e d shock\nwave t o a r r i v a l of t h e r e f l e c t e d disturbance from t h e contact surface)\ni n t h e Mach number range of 3.1 t o 4.4 showed good agreement with those\nc a l c u l a t e d by Mire&\' analysis of the t e s t i n g time between t h e shock wave\nand the contact surface.\n\nREFERENCES\n(1)Hertzberg, A. j Smith, W.
