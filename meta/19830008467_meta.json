Theoretical and experimental investigations of various methods of converting the energy of nuclear fission fragments to laser power are summarized. The development of direct nuclear pumped lasers was achieved. The basic processes involved in the production of a plasma by nuclear radiation were studied. Significant progress was accomplished in this area and a large amount of basic data on plasma formation and atomic and molecular processes leading to population inversions is available.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19830008467, "id": "fe5c55ca058f4dcf9a79897332272965", "publicationDate": "1983-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19830008467.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19830008467/downloads/19830008467.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19830008467/downloads/19830008467.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19830008467/downloads/19830008467.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
