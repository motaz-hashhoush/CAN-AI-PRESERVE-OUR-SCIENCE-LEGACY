The cone cooperates within a slotted collar end which has a number of tangs on a cylindrical body. The fastener is set by inserting it through aligned holes in the workpieces to be joined. Turning the pin in one direction draws the cone into the collar, deforming the tangs radially outward to mate with tapered back-tapered hold in the workpiece, thus fastening the two pieces together. Reversing the direction of the pin withdraws the cone from the collar, and allows the tangs to resume their contracted configuration without withdrawing the fastener from the insertion hole. The fastener is capable of joining materials together from only one side with substantial strength in tension and shear over many resue attachment cycles, with no special operations on the main assembly parts other than the tapering of the back end of the insertion hole.", "title": "Reusable captive blind fastener", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-04T15:01:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19820018797, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Peterson, S.
