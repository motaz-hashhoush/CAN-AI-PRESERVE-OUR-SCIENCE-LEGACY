Johnston, Terry L. St.\nClair, Robert M. Baucom, and\nJohn R. Gleason , Langley\nResearch Center\nPolyimides are attractive to the aerospace\nindustry because of their toughness, thermal\nand thermooxidative stability, solvent resistance, and excellent mechanical and electrical properties over a wide temperature range.\nProcessing of these materials has been difficult, however, due to limited melt flow during\nthe application of heat and pressure. In the\nLangley process, semi-crystalline polyimide\npowders are blended with polyamic acid solutions to form slurries, which are used to prepare prepregs for production of structurally\nsound , void-free laminates. This technique\nyields composite materials with matrices of\ntough, thermoplastic aromatic polyimides exhibiting excellent melt flow during processing.\nFor More Information Circle No. 692.\nMetal Etching Composition\n(US Patent No. 5,034,093)\nInventors: Joseph E.

Lee, Christopher H.\nSchilling , and Taylor G. Wang ,\nJet Propulsion Laboratory\nMicroshells with an outside diameter well\nbelow one millimeter are formed by heating a\nmaterial to molten temperature in the presence of a soluble gas. The resulting solution\nis atomized to form many separate droplets\nthat are cooled during free-fall. Cooling from\nthe outside traps the dissolved gas and forces\nit to form gas bubbles at the droplets\' centers.\nReheating and then cooling them in an environment with a lower pressure than the gas\nbubbles causes them to expand and form\nthin-walled shells. The shells can be made of\na wide variety of materials, including refractory metals and alloys, for such applications\nas filler in reinforced beams.\nFor More Information Circle No. 695.\nIgnitability Test Method and Apparatus\n(US Patent No. 5,052,817)\nInventors: Laurence J. Bement, James W.\nBailey, and Morry L. Sch immel,\nLangley Research Center\nIgnition of propellant materials used in rocket\nmotors, munitions, or even automobile air\nbags starts with an initiator that is fired electrically or mechanically. A simple apparatus\nprovides quantitative measurements of the\nefficiency of all types of initiators. The material\nis ignited within a cavity and pressure traces\nare recorded by an oscillograph and analyzed. The method can determine the initiator\'s\noutput delay, function time, and ability to ignite\ntypical propellants.\nFor More Information Circle No. 696.\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 1992\n\nGOUL[)\nOur nelV recorder\ncOlDes with everything\nbut complications.\nSitting down with our new WindoGraf\xc2\xae recorder is\nlike sitting down with a trusted friend.

Four years ago, we at\nAssociated Business Publications, publishers of NASA Tech Briefs, initiated\nthis contest so that our elected representatives would know that there is a\nlarge segment of the public that is very\nmuch aware of the benefits all of us\ndown here enjoy because of the work of\nNASA and the aerospace industry.\nNASA Tech Briefs readers, now\nnumbering more than 200,000, know\nthat the Space Agency and its contractors produce a broad array of important inventions and innovations that improve daily life and impact the national\neconomy, so this column isn\'t intended\nto preach to you , the choir, but to ask\nyou once again to help us reiterate to\nour elected representatives that space\nexploration is both worthwhile in and of\nitself and beneficial right here, right\nnow, with far-reaching spinoff applications. Many NASA Tech Briefs readers\nknow that a study by Midwest Research\nInstitute found that for every dollar invested in the space program , nine dollars have rebounded to the American\neconomy. But our representatives still\nseem unaware that this kind of return\non an investment is unique in govern-\n\nI\n\nment and rare in the private sector.\nThis year, 14 other organizations\nhave joined us as cosponsors of the\ncontest, including the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics,\nAnalog, Isaac Asimov\'s Science Fiction Magazine, the Challenger Center, Final Frontier, High Frontier, the\nNational Space Society, Omni, Spacecause, Space Pac, Space Station News,\nthe US Space and Rocket Center, the\nUS Space Foundation, and the Young\nAstronauts Society.

During successive years, the\nshuttle fleet and its crews will continue\nto build onto Freedom until rotating\ncrews can live and work on the station\npermanently by the turn of the century.\nOnce permanent occupancy of the\nstation has been achieved, America\nand its three international partnersCanada, the European Space Agency,\nand Japan-will enter an unprecedented era of human exploration and\nthe utilization of space for the benefit\nof humanity.\n\nI\n\nfor long-duration studies of human\nphysiology and well-being in space,\nresearch that is necessary before the\nnation can prudently embark on longrange human exploration goals. Freedom will serve as a laboratory for learning how to use the microgravity environment of space, enabling the study of\nnew materials, new medicines, and new\ntechnologies. As an engineering test\nbed on the high frontier, Freedom will\nput humans on the scene to learn by\ndoing, helping to answer the many\nquestions and problems which , taken\ntogether, comprise the continuing\nchallenge of space flight.\n"We have elected to treat space\nstation Freedom as the first step in the\nMission from Planet Earth," stated the\nReport of the Advisory Committee on\nthe Future of the US Space Program,\n"even though it has other valid uses,\nsuch as hands-on extended duration\nmicrogravity research." Not only will\nresearch aboard Freedom prepare us\nfor long-term space travel, the report\nsaid, but this endeavor also could be\nresponsible for "unlocking new developments in such fields as electronics\nand biosciences. The space station is\ndeemed essential as a life sciences\nlaboratory, for there is simply no Earthbound substitute."\n\nAn Investment In America\n\nFreedom\'s microgravity environment\nwill provide a unique laboratory for\ncell research that could result in\nimproved disease-fighting drugs.\n\nNASA\'s space station is, as President George Bush said, a "critical next\nstep in all our space endeavors." Skimming along 250 miles above the cloud\ntops of Earth, Freedom will serve as the\ncrucial next link in the chain of knowledge necessary to further human exploration of the solar system.\nFreedom will serve as the focal point\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 1992\n\nSpace exploration is an affordable\ninvestment in our nation\'s future. NASA\nis 1% of the federal budget, an important 1% because it represents an investment for tomorrow, and space station Freedom is a vital component of a\nbalanced space program. Among the\npayoffs for this 1% investment are:\nNational Vitality. Space exploration\nfosters American values of pushing\nnew boundaries and undertaking\nnew challenges. Space exploration\nrepresents America\'s commitment\nto leadership and a national spirit of\nexcellence.\nAmerican Competitiveness. NASA\nprograms are an important part of\n\nthis nation\'s investment in aerospace, one of our most important\nindustries and one of the few industries that enjoys a favorable and\nrising balance of trade .\nHigh Technology. Freedom is a visible demonstration of America\'s technological prowess-a promotion for\nUS products and services.\nKnowledge. America\'s space program\ncontributes to the nation\'s storehouse of knowledge-knowledge\nthat is helping to reshape our world,\ncontributing to our understanding of\nour place in the universe and improving our quality of life.\nInternational Cooperation. Programs\nlike space station Freedom nurture\ninternational cooperation and serve\nas models for the way things can\nwork on Earth.\nEduca~ion.\n\nSpace exploration can\nstimulate young people\'s interest in\nmathematics and science. America\nwill need a technically competent\nwork force to compete in the global\neconomy of the future.\n\nQuality of Life. Space research results\nin products that contribute to the\nquality of life on Earth-communications satellites, weather satellites,\nand medical devices, to name a few.\nEmployment. The space station Freedom program will directly and indirectly employ about 70,000 people,\ntapping the professional services of\nmore than 2000 businesses in 40\nstates. These jobs will contribute\nnew ideas, new knowledge, and new\nproducts to our economy.\nFreedom is the linchpin of our\nnation\'s future in space. It will shape\nwhat America does in space and how it\nwill be done. Freedom, with a permanent window on the universe, will ensure that America\'s future in space will\nbe even brighter than its past.\nGreat nations dare to explore. It\'s\ntime for America to take its place on the\nfinal frontier. 0\n15\n\nNew Product Ideas\nNew Product Ideas are just\na few of the many innovations\ndescribed in this issue of\nNASA Tech Briefs and having\npromising commercial applications.

Although the original version\nof this antenna is intended for use aboard\na spacecraft, terrestrial versions could be\ndesigned to be mounted on the ground or\non the surfaces of such structures as ships,\nland vehicles, and buildings. Because the\nmajor part of a microstrip reflectarray antenna would be flat, its mass and the cost\nof its fabrication are likely to be less than\nthose of a paraboloidal reflector that has\nan aperture of equal size, and it could be\nmounted more easily, with less supporting\nstructure.\nAs the name suggests, a reflectarray\nantenna includes a reflecting array of small\nantennas or antenna elements fed through\nspace by another small, low-gain antenna. Each antenna element in the array is\nconnected to a short transmission line terminated in a short or open circuit to make\nthe element reflect the feed radiation out\ninto space. The length of each transmission line is chosen to impart the desired\nphase to the radiation field of its antenna.\nelement so that this field adds coherently\nwith the fields of selected other elements\nto yield a beam with high gain in the d6<\nsired direction and with the desired angular\nwidth. If the element, such as the microstrip patch, can have different polarizations\nwith good isolations, phases of elements\ncould be chosen at will to yield two or more\nbeams in different directions. This reflectarry concept works well only when the num-\n\nber of elements is large (about 65,800\nwould be required in the original spacecraft application) to avoid large backscattered fields.\nThe figure shows a simplified version\nof the proposed microstrip reflectarray. A\nslab of dielectric material with a thickness\n=s; 0.02 wavelength would be coated on\nthe side facing away from the feed antenna with a thin layer of metal that would\nserve as a ground plane. A similar coat of\nmetal on the side faCing the feed antenna\nwould be etched in a pattern that would\nleave many identically sized and shaped\nmicrostrip patches. An open- or short-circuited microstrip transmission line of the\nrequired length would extend from each\npatch. Because the required change in\nphase would not exceed 360 0 for any element, none of the microstrip-patch transmission lines would have to be longer than\nhalf a wavelength. Consequently, the insertion losses associated with these transmission lines should be minimal, and the efficiency of the microstrip reflectarray should\napproach that of a paraboloidal reflector\n(55 to 75 percent).\nA microstrip reflectarray antenna could\nbe aimed at angles as large as 60\xc2\xb0 from\nthe broadside direction; in contrast, a paraboloidal antenna cannot aim more than\na few beamwidths off the broadside direction . Phase shifters could be placed in the\nelement phase-shift transmission lines to\nsteer the beams electronically. One major disadvantage would be that a microstrip\nreflectarray antenna would provide the de-\n\nsired beam pattern over only a small frequency range (a maximum of 3 percent).\nOne relatively inexpensive way to overcome this disadvantage is to construct the\nreflectarray in multiple layers, so that operation could be optimized at multiple\nfrequencies.\nThis \'NOrk was done by John Huang of\nCaltech for NASA\'s Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory. For further information, Circle 25 on the TSP Request card.\nNPO-18460\nCircular\nMicrostrip\nPatch\n\nMicrostrip\nTransmission\n\nLine\n\nThe Mlcrostrip Reflectarray Antenna could\nbe made to radiate several beams in different directions by appropriate choice of\nthe lengths of the microstrip transmission\nlines. In a practical antenna, the number\nof microstrip patches would be much\ngreater than shown here. Although the patches shown here are round, they could be\nsquare or otherwise shaped to meet the\ndeSign requirements.\n\n~J Simple Superconducting "Permanent" Electromagnet\nThe design would exploit maximally the anisotropy of a high-temperature-superconducting material.\nNASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nA proposed short tube made of a hightemperature-superconducting material like\nYBa2Cu 30 7 would act as a strong electromagnet. It would be a "permanent"\nmagnet in the sense that once the magnetizing electric current was induced, it\nwould continue to flow as long as the mag20\n\nnetic field remained below a critical value\nand the temperature of the cylinder was\nmaintained sufficiently below the superconducting-transition temperature (about\n70 K for YBa 2Cu 30 7).\nSome previous efforts to develop magnets that incorporate superconductors\n\nhave involved the use of high-temperaturesuperconductor wires. At present, bulk\nspecimens of these materials have superconducting properties superior to those of\nwi re specimens.

(After fabrication , the Nb and Au\nlayers serve as electrical contacts to the\nYBa 2Cu 30 7_ c5 superconductive base\nelectrode.)\nAu is deposited, then in some cases\nis patterned by ion milling to remove all\nof it except on the aligned edges of the\nYBa2Cu30 7_c5 and A1 20 3. The portion that\nremains on the edge of the YBa2Cup7_c5\nwill become the normally conducting\nlink. Finally a layer of Nb (or optionally\nYBa 2Cu 30 7_ c5) is deposited to serve as\nthe superconducting counterelectrode.\nThis electrode is reactive-ion-etched or\nion-milled into the required narrow strip\ncrossing the edge of the YBa 2Cu 30 7_ c5\nbase electrode.\nOne of the advantages of the edge-de-\n\nfined geometry is that the thickness of the\nAu film, which determines the length of the\nnormally conducting link, is readily made\nless than 1,000 A. The significance of this\nlength is that it is approximately the normal-conductor coherence length for gold\nat an operating temperature of 4.2 K, and\nthe link must be shorter than a few times\nthis length to operate in the desi red manner. If edge-<:Jefined geometry were not\nused, other fabrication techniques that are\nmuch more demanding would have to be\nused. Another advantage of the edge-defined geometry in general is that it simplifies the fabrication of a link of very small\ncross-sectional area.\nYet another advantage of this particular\nedge-<:Jefined geometry is a consequence\n\nof the fact that the YBa2Cup7_c5 is most\neasily deposited with the high-current-<:Jensity, long-coherence-Iength a-b crystalline\nplanes parallel to the substrate surface.\nThe edge geometry allows current to flow\nonly in these planes and takes advantage\nof the longer coherence length at the\ncritical YB~Cu307 _ c5/Au interface. As a\nresult, the sensitivity of the device to damage on the edge of the YBa2Cu307_c5 is\nreduced.\nThis oork was done by Brian D. Hunt\nand Marc C.

Calculations and experiments with prototypes have verified the\nbasic design concept, according to which\na thick metal plate is perforated with a\nregular hexagonal or other suitable pattern\nof holes and the holes are filled with a\ndielectric material. The arrangement and\nsizes of holes, the distances between\nthem, and the material and dimensions of\nthe dielectric plugs are chosen to satisfy\ndesign requirements, especially with regard to transmittance, reflectance, dissipation, and diffraction as functions of frequency, direction of incidence, and polarization.\nThe figure shows one of four prototypes\ndesigned to meet the following requirements, among others:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Insertion loss < 0.04 dB (nearly total\ntransmission) at frequencies from 7,145\nto 7,190 MHz and 8,400 to 8,450 MHz\n(the two passbands) at an angle of incidence of 30\xc2\xb0 , and in both polarizations\n(perpendicular and parallel to the plane\nincidence);\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Insertion loss > 45 dB (nearly total reflection) at frequencies from 2,090 to 2,320\nMHz (the stop band); and\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Ability to maintain these electrical characteristics while passing 100 kW of continuous-wave power in either or both of\nthe two passbands or reflecting 100 kW\nof continuous-wave power in the stop\nband.\nPerforated-metal dichroic plates have\nbeen in use for several years, but the holes\nin the plates have been left unfilled. The\nconcept of filling the holes with dielectric\nmaterial (in this case, polytetrafluoroethylene) was introduced because it was not\npossible to design an unfilled-hole plate\nto satisfy the specific requirements mentioned above: a plate with unfilled holes\n26\n\nwould give rise to undesi red diffractiongrating lobes in the 8,400-to-8,450-MHz\npassband at an angle of incidence of 30\xc2\xb0.\nThe theory shows that when dielectric\nplugs are used, holes can be made smaller\nand closer together; this, in turn, reduces\nthe grating lobes that arise at 30\xc2\xb0 and\nother angles of incidence.\nAntenna-pattern tests of the prototype\ndichroic plates did not reveal any unusual\n\nbehavior such as might be caused by unexpected surface waves or unexpected diffraction-grating lobes. The results of the\nexperiments generally confirmed the theoretical predictions.\nThis oork was done by Tom Y. Otoshi\nand Robert C. Clauss of Caltech for\nNASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

A laser of this type\nincludes a pseudomorphic In0.2GaO.8 As/\nGaAs/ Al xGa 1_ xAs graded-index-of-refraction, separate-confinement-heterostructure\nsingle quantum well (GRINSCH SOW) with\nan overlaid ridge waveguide. These lasers\nare suitable for pumping Er 3 +\'doped optical-fiber amplifiers; e.g., in optical-fiber communication systems and optical phasedarray ranging ("optical radar" ) systems.\nThe wavelength of 980 nm is chosen as\nthe one that yields the most efficient pumping because there is no absorption in ex\xc2\xb7\ncited states at this wavelength.\nThe laser structure (see Figure 1) is\ngrown by molecular-beam epitaxy. The required combination of the thickness of the\nquantum well and the concentration of\nInAs in the well is determined from calculations in which strain and quantum size effects were taken into account. The singlequantum-well active layer is 60 A thick\nand is sandwiched between two GaAs\nlayers 50 A thick. These layers are sandwiched between two graded-index-of-refraction layers of Al xGa 1 _ xAs 1,700 A\nthick, in which x varies with depth from\n0.05 to 0.5. All of the foregoing layers are\nsandvviched between two 1.0-pm-thick cladding layers of AI o.5G305As, one p-doped ,\nthe other n-doped.\nAccurate control of the wavelength of\nthe emitted light is essential to match the\nwavelength of maximum pumping efficiency of an Er 3 +-doped optical-fiber amplifier.\nThe use of the ridge waveguides facilitates\nthis match in that the fabrication of these\nwaveguides does not involve postgrowth\nhigh-temperature processing, which could\nalter the wavelength of the emission; they\nare formed along the [011] direction by wet\nchemical etching. In the prototype lasers,\nthe ridge waveguides are 6 Ilm wide. The\nheight of these ridge waveguides, 0.9Ilm ,\nis chosen to produce a lateral step of\n1 X10- 3 in the effective index of refraction to ensure lasing in the fundamental\nmode for high coupling into a single-mode\noptical fiber.\nA layer of Si0 2 half a wavelength thick\nserves as an anti reflection coat on the\nfront facet of each laser, while multiple\nlayers of SiO alternating with Si0 2 serve\nas a highly reflective coat on the rear facet.\nThe distance between the front and rear\nfacets is 600 Ilm . The maximum output\n(beyond which failure occurs) through the\nfront facet is about 220 mW. The maximum\nelectrical-to-optical power-conversion ef\xc2\xb7\nficiency is about 37 percent at an output\npower of about 140 mW.

The dc power supply for the\nconverter under test and the emissionspectrum-analyzing equipment were located outside the shielded chamber.\nWith respect to the desirability of minimizing electromagnetic interference with\nother eqUipment, the 33-kHz sine-wave\nunit was found to be the better of the two\nconverters. Its radiated broadband emissions were within the limits specified for\nthe particular spacecraft application, although its radiated narrow-band emissions\nwere 3 dB too high at 6.6 MHz and 5 dB\ntoo high at 8 MHz. Its electric- and magnetic-field emissions at 33 kHz were also\nabove specified levels but could likely be\nreduced by use of shields made of highly\nmagnetically permeable metal ("mu metal").\nThe conducted emissions from both units\nincluded components at the fundamental\nswitching frequencies and harmonics.\nElectrostatic shielding was installed on the\nprimary windings of the main transformer\nof the 33-kHz sinusoidal unit to reduce\ncapacitive coupling between the primary\nand secondary winding; this reduced noise\ncurrents by as much as 38 dB in some\ncases.\nThe report concludes with several recommendations to reduce the emissions\nfrom the 33-kHz sinusoidal converter.

This\nstudy focuses on the effect of funneling\nupon the total charge collected by a lowimpedance (ideally, a voltage source) external circuit; this total charge is the current\nintegrated over the time necessary to recover from the ion hit. As used here, "funneling" denotes a phenomenon caused by\ninteractions among the evolving distributions of electrons, holes, and electrostatic\npotentials during the recovery-and-chargecollection time; funneling is the enhancement, by the voltage drop across the substrate, of the flow of minority carriers (in\nthis case, electrons) from the substrate into\nthe depletion region.\nThe report presents a detailed qualitative description of the collapse of the depletion region and the subsequent recovery.\nThe collapse involves the rearrangement\nof charge carriers within what was initial1~1 the boundary of the depletion region.\nBecause the electric field is much stronger\nin the depletion region than it is anywhere\nelse in the device, the collapse can be\nassumed to occur instantaneously upon\nformation of the ion track, for purposes of\nthe analysiS.\nTo simplify the analysis further, it is assumed (1) that densities of injected charge\nare large enough that the density of electrons nearly equals the density of holes\nin the substrate and (2) that the ratio between the diffusion constants for electrons\nand holes equals the ratio between the\nmobilities of electrons and holes. These\nassumptions are applied to the basic equations for the drift and diffusion components\nof the electron and ion currents, leading\nto the following equation for the total collected charge, Q r:\n.\nQr\n(1+J1.r/J1.p)Qo+2 Qdiff\nwhere Qo is the charge initially liberated\nin the depletion region, Qdiff is charge collected by diffusion, J1.n is the electron mobility, and J1.p is the ion mobility.\nThe report goes on to discuss the estimation of the diffusion current, which involves the solution of a boundary-value\nproblem to estimate the gradient of the\nelectron density.

Previously,\n190 \xc2\xb0F (88 0c) was thought to be the threshold temperature for thermal runaway.\nIn one of the tests, a fully charged battery was heated to an initial temperature\nof 108 OF (42\xc2\xb0C), then placed in a vacuum\nand discharged at a constant of 84 amperes. During the discharge, its temperature rose to 239 OF (115\xc2\xb0C). The discharge\nwas stopped after 19.2 minutes, when the\nremaining energy stored in the battery was\nless than 1 ampere\xc2\xb7hour.

It presents a theoretical\nstudy of the statistical and spectral characteristics of this noise and describes an experimental study of the dependence of this\nnoise upon the applied magnetic field, the\nthickness of the magnetic layer, and the\n\n32\n\nroughness of the surface of this layer.\nDirect-current modulation noise is the\nfluctuating signal superimposed on the\nnominal zero output of a recording/playback head traveling along a recording\ntrack on a disk after the disk has been first\nmagnetized with a de field along the track,\nthen remagnetized with a field of the oppoSite polarity. In this study, dc modulation noise is attributed to the nucleation\nof isolated regions of reversal of magnetization in the recording medium and to the\ngrowth and coalescence of those regions\nwith increasing reverse applied magnetic\nfield. The boundaries of these regions,\ncalled "pseudotransitions," are sources of\n\nSee us at the AFCEA Show - Washington, DC 6/23-6/25 Booth #1275\nFor More Information Circle No. 500\n\ndiverging magnetization and of fringing\nmagnetic fields, which are sensed by the\nrecording/playback head.\nAccording to this physical model, relatively little reversal of magnetization occurs\nand, therefore, little noise is generated\nwhen the peak reverse magnetic field is\nsignificantly less than the coercivity of the\nmedium. As the peak reverse magnetic\nfield is increased, more noise appears because the medium becomes more strongly marked with pseudotransitions induced\nby partial reversal. As the peak reverse\nmagnetic field continues to increase, this\nnoise diminishes as the magnetization becomes more nearly completely reversed\nand spatially uniform.\nFor the theoretical study, the distribution of the pseudotransitions in time and\nspace is represented as a statistical eventarrival process governed by the Wei bull\ndistribution, which can be regarded \'as a\ngeneralization of the Poisson distribution.\nThe Weibull distribution is used to compute the autocorrelation function of the dc\nmodulation noise and the power spectral\ndensity of this noise as a function of the\nfrequency, the length of the gap in the recording/playback head, the speed of the\nhead along the track, the expectation value\nof the magnitude of magnetization, and a\nL.mentzian-pulse-duration parameter.\nExperiments were performed on aluminum disks plated with cobalt-alloy magnetic\nrecording layers of various thicknesses\nfrom 25 to 60 nm. Initial saturation-level\nsignals were written, then erased, then\noverwritten with reverse signals, and the\ncycle repeated, increasing the reverse signals in steps until saturation was reached.\nAfter these measurements were taken,\nbulk magnetic properties of the disks were\nmeasured, and the roughnesses of their\nsurfaces were measured with a surface\nprofilometer.\nThe playback signals were processed\nthrough a spectrum analyzer and processed further in a computer. Electronic\nnoise was digitally subtracted from these\nsignals; then the theoretical power spectral density was fitted to the measured spectrum by an iterative technique. When the\nfits were completed, the theoretical model\nof dc modulation noise was found to agree\nwith the experimental data with correlations greater than 0.99.The trends observed\nin the experimental data indicate that the\ninhomogeneities in the magnetic recording\nmedia, and not the roughnesses of their\nsurfaces, are the dominant sources of noise.\nThis wrk was done by Romney R.

The associated circuitry included discrete metal oxide/semiconductor field-effect transistors\n(MOSFET\'s). Module 2 also contained\neight 1- by l-mm detector elements, two\nof which were active. The circuitry associated with the active elements included\nintegrated MOSFET\'s. The arrays in both\nmodules operated in an integration-andreset/multiplexing scheme.\nThe modules were tested in a low-background-radiation environment in a cryogenic chamber, in which they were cooled by\nliquid helium to 4.2 K and lower temperatures. Infrared radiation from a black body\nat various temperatures up to 80 K was\npassed to the detectors through a stack\nof filters, the output spectrum of which was\ncentered at 106 JAITl, with 1.25 JAITl full width\nat half maximum. The responsMties, noises,\nand other parameters of the detectors and\nthe readout and multiplexing circuits were\nmeasured.\nAt a temperature of 4.2 K and a detector bias of - 264 mV, the average responsivity was about 300 A/w. At 4.2 K and a\ndetector bias of 350 mV, the optimum system readout noise was 6,100 electrons per\nsample, and the noise-equivalent power\nwas 10 - 16 W/-JHz.. The tests revealed\nseveral deficiencies that must be overcome to make future designs successful.\nThe most notable deficiencies are significant variations (about 25 percent) among\nthe responsivities of detector elements, and\nlow breakdown voltages (about \xc2\xb1 300 mV).\nThe report draws several conclusions\nthat can be summarized as follows:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The Ge:Ga arrays are not yet perfected\nsufficiently to enable the accumulation of\nreliable data on performance, though the\npreliminary data are encouraging.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The nonuniformity of responsMty is a serious disadvantage that is magnified by the\nsmallness of the breakdown voltage and\ncould impose severe limitations even with\ndetectors at peak performance.

The term " modulation loss" is somewhat misleading in that it does not mean\na loss in the usual sense: it denotes the\nfraction of the total transmitted power\nallocated to (or, if you prefer, "lost to") a\ndesignated channel (see figure). The\nmethod was developed to compute the\nmodulation losses in a spacecraft/groundstation system but presumably could be\nmodified for application to any similar terrestrial or aerospace system that involves\none-way and/or two-way transmission , including retransmission.\nIn general, the means and variances of\nthe modulation losses can be computed\nfrom (1) the nominal values and tolerances\nof design parameters (specifically, modulation indices and modulation losses derived\n\n./\nGround\nor Other\nCommanding\nStation\n\nfrom them) and (2) the probability-density\nfunctions for these parameters. Heretofore,\nthis has entailed the use of a " brute-force"\nmethod in which modulation losses are\ncomputed for all possible combinations of\nthe modulation indices. For example, the\ncomputation of the tolerances on the downlink-telemetry modulation loss in the case\nof simultaneous telemetry, command, and\nrange operations requires 128 different\ncombinations of modulation indices.\nThe improved computational method is\nbased on uplink and downlink signals that\nconform to a standard promulgated by the\nConsultative Committee for Space Data\nSystems. According to this standard, the\nuplink carrier signal is phase-modulated by\na square-wave or sinusoidal uplink ranging\nsignal and by a sinusoidal telecommand\nsubcarrier that is, in turn, modulated by a\nnon-return-to-zero rectangular wave. The\ndownlink carrier is phase-modulated by a\ndownlink ranging signal; by a square-wave\nor sinewave telemetry subcarrier that is, in\nturn, modulated by a non-return-to-zero\n\nTotal\nUplink\nPower\n(PT1l\n\nUplink Telecommand Power (PCDl\nUplink Ranging Power (PR1l\n\nJ\n\nDownlink Telemetry Power (PTLMl\n\n./\n\nDownlink Ranging Power (PR2l\nDownlink Residual Carrier Power (PC2l\n\nUplink Telecommand Modulation Loss = PCD/Pn\nUplink Ranging Modulation Loss = PR1/Pr1\nUplink Carrier Modulation Loss = PC1/Pn\n\n~\n\n1\n\nUplink Residual Carrier Power (PC1)\n\n"\'"\n\n\'"\n\nrectangular wave; and by uplink noise that\nfeeds through the ranging transponder filter.\nThe specific algebraic forms of these\nSignals are used to derive expressions for\nthe maximum and minimum values of the\nuplink telecommand, the downlink telemetry, and the uplink and downlink carrier\nand ranging modulation losses. In the uplink\ncase, these are functions of the modulation indices. In the downlink case, these are\n. functions of the modulation indices and\nuplink noise. These functions, along with\nthe appropriate probability-<:Jensity functions, are incorporated into algorithms that\ncompute the means and variances of the\nuplink and downlink modulation losses.\nThese algorithms complete the computations about three times as fast as do the\nalgorithms of the "brute-force" method.\nThis work was done by Tien M.

A conventional multiplying-type\nphase detector puts out ripple at twice the\ncarrier frequency, and the ripple energy is\nconcentrated in the low harmonics. To\nfilter this output adequately, it is necessary\nto use a low-pass filter, which limits the\nbandwidth.\nIn the improved PL L, the phase detector\nis replaced by a state estimator, implemented by a ramplsample-and-hold circuit.\n(see figure) The circuit operates as follows:\nSuppose that a reset pulse has just set the\nramp generator to zero. The circuit remains static until a signal comes from the\nvm to start the ramp generator. A short\ntime later, a pulse comes from the incoming-signal line. This triggers a monostable\nmultivibrator, which produces a short pulse\nthat tells the sample-and-hold circuit to\nhold. The voltage that appears at the output of the sample-and-hold circuit is thus a\nmeasure of the difference in time between\nthe veo and incoming signals. The trailing\nedge of the output of the monostable\nmultivibrator triggers a second monostable multivibrator, arranged to reset the\nramp generator. The second monostable\nmultivibrator serves to delay the reset until\nthe sample-and-hold circuit has acquired a\nnew sample. The sequence then repeats.\n\nVOUage.ControUed\n\n\'.......1"" ~\nOe""".. \'),.\nOscll\'\'\'\'\'\'\n~\n\nS\'ona\'\n\nV\n\nLoop FIlter\n\nCOHYENTlONAl Pll\nFromVCO\n\nSIgnal F rom veo\n\nIRamp-Stanlng Signal) , - - _ - - - - ,\n\nOutput of\nSam~.nd\xc2\xad\n\nHold CuCUit\n\nReset Pulse\nSample Pulse\n\nIncoming Signal\n\nIneo""~\n\nSignal\n\nDETAIL OF AAMPfSAMPl E- AND - HOlD CIRCUIT AND ITS TIMING DIAGRAM\n\nrome\n\nThe Ramp/Sample-an d-Hold Circu it driven by the VCO and incoming signals performs the\nfunction of a phase detector, and needs little , if any, loop filtering .\n\nBecause the ramp/sample-and-hold circuit is inside the PLL, the difference in time\nbetween the incoming and vm signals is a\nmeasure of the difference in phase. Thus,\nthe ramp/sample-and-hold circuit acts as a\nphase detector. The requirements for filtering the output of this circuit are much less\nsevere than in the conventional multiplying-type phase detector because there is\nlittle ripple energy and it is concentrated\nmostly in the high harmonics.\nAs an FM demodulator, the improved\nPLL provides low-noise output with good\nfrequency response. Another application is\nas a tachometer. In the usual tachometer\nsystem, noise is present in the output. Filtering this noise - for example, to reduce\nchatter in a speed-control circuit - causes\na lag in the response. The improved PLL\nreduces this noise to zero at a steady\n\nspeed; therefore, no filtering is required .\nThis INOrk was done by Harold Kkkham\nand Shannon P Jackson of Caltech for\nNASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

A highly digital front end can\noffer many well known advantages relative\nto analog implementations, including\nsmaller size, better reliability, greater accuracy and lower cost. With regard to accuracy, both delay instability and absolute\ndelay errors due to the front end can be\nreduced to a small fraction of a nanosecond, without continuous calibration . Comparable performance is very difficult to\nachieve with analog designs. The adopted\ndesign generates baseband samples in\nquadrature with an exactness in quadrature separation that surpasses that of analog implementations.\nIn its simplest form, the design approach presented here requires only two\nmajor steps to bring a Signal from RF to\na filtered and sampled form at baseband:\n36\n\ncommensurate sampling at RF and a sum.\nIn commensurate sampling, the sample\nrate is chosen so that the aliasing action\nof the sampling operation itself down converts the signal from RF to baseband.\nThus, one operation carries out both sampling and down conversion. In contrast,\nanalog implementations are considerably\nmore complex and unstable, requiring\nsteps that mix the signal with a local oscillator (LO) signal , filter to remove the sum\nnote, and then sample.\nIn the adopted form of commensurate\nsampling, which will be referred to as "halfsubharmonic" sampling, the sample rate\nis set equal to 4 f/(2n + 1), where n is a nonnegative integer and f is the frequency\ncomponent to be down converted to zero\nfrequency. The advantage of "half-subharmonic" sampling is that a single sampler at RF, driven by one "sample-clock"\nsignal, directly produces both quadrature\ncomponents at baseband with exact quad-\n\nrature separation. More specifically stated,\nthe sampling process directly produces interleaved "cosine" (C) and " sine" (S)\nsamples at baseband in the sequence C,\nS,\nS, -C, o C, s, -C, -S The indicated sign\nreversals on alternate C samples (and S\nsamples) are easily removed by subsequent integrated-circuit (IC) logic.\nA top-level functional block diagram of\nthe simplest adopted design is shown in\nthe figure for the L1 and L2 components\nof the GPS signal. The output of the antenna is amplified, passed through a broadband RF filter, and then power divided into L1 and L2 branches. On the L1 and L2\nbranches, thEl filters are given center frequencies of fu and fL2\' as indicated, and\nbandwidths no greater than 450 Mhz and\n490 Mhz, respectively. (Since the overall\nnoise bandwidths for the two branches are\nset by these filters, their bandwidths should\nbe consistent in a Nyquist sense with the\nsubsequent RF sample rates.)\nNASA Tech Briefs.

Figure 1 presents for. L1\nand L2 the relationship of offset carrier frequency to the offset P-code rate defined\nby f\'\n10.23 MHz - ~f, where ~f is a\nsmaIT offset to be introduced by the frequency subsystem. (A prime on a variable\nwill denote an offset relative to nominaL)\nWhen the RF sample rate is 417 times the\noffset carrier frequency for L1 and 4/5 for\nL2, each RF sample rate becomes an advantageous integer multiple of the offset\nP-code rate, namely, 88f\'p for L1 and 96f\' p\nfor L2. Note that both of these integer\nmultipliers are multiples of four - a fact\nthat is critical to the following scheme.\nAfter sampling , the output of each\nsampler is demultiplexed into C and S\nstreams and a sign correction applied to\nalternate samples. At this point, the sample rate for each quadrature component\nis 44f\'p for L1 and 48f\' for L2 (about 450\nMsamplesls and 491 Msamples/s, respectively, depending on the value of ~f) . By\ndesign, these two rates are about the\nsame magnitude and are relatively large\ninteger multiples of 2f To reach the output rate of 2f\'p (about ~0.46 MHz) for both\nL1 and L2, a digital filter can be applied\nto each stream, with a rate-reduction fac-\n\n=\n\n9.\n\ntor of 22 for L1 and 24 for L2. In the\nsimplest implementation, the digital filter\nbecomes a sum-and-dump operation , with\na sum length of 22 points for L1 and 24\nfor L2. A slight improvement (about 20 percent) in delay precision can be obtained,\nat the cost of greater complexity, if the\ndigital filter is given an approximately rectangular bandshape and a single-sided\nbandwidth of about 10 MHz.\nThis design simplifies the receiver in\nthree ways. First, for each branch , a single\nsampling operation replaces several analog components that would have been\nseparately requ ired for down converting\neach quadrature component. Second, the\nfrequency subsystem is very simple. Each\nof the two RF sample rates can be generated as a simple integer multiple of the\noutput of a single reference synthesizer\nthat produces the frequency, 2f\'p. Offsetting the rate of this synthesizer from 20.46\nMHz automatically provides an advantageous offset in both the final baseband\noutput rate and the baseband carrier rate\n(for both L1 and L2). Third, digital-filter design is greatly simplified inasmuch as the\nrate-reduction factor to be introduced by\nthe digital filter can be set equal to an exact integer for both L1 and L2 (Le., 22 and\n24, respectively).\nAs suggested above, the RF sample\nrate is not made exactly commensurate\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 1992\n\nwith the nominal carrier frequency, but\nwith a frequency that is slightly offset from\nthe carrier frequency (e.g. by 10 to 300 kHz\nat RF). The offset is made large enough\nto place the observed carrier frequency\nat baseband at a positive value for all expected Doppler shifts. This same offset\nalso shifts the final baseband rate away\nfrom 20.46 MHz, thereby insuring its effective incommensurability with P-chip rate\nof 10.23 MHz. Avoidance of zero baseband\ncarrier frequencies is advisable if the downconversion sinusoid in the baseband proc-\n\nessor is quantized to only a few levels (e.g.\nthree levels) or if the option of nonquadrature baseband operation is a design\ngoal. Effective incommensurability with the\nP-chip rate is advisable in high-accuracy\ndelay measurements if the effects of\ndiscrete sampling are to be minimized\n(particularly when the Doppler rate is zero).\nThis work was done by J. Brooks\nThomas of Caltech for NASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

Recapitulating from that\narticle, each level of the hierarchy can be\ndescribed as performing a different kind\nof control computation that corresponds to\na different kind of mental process analogous to the mental processes of a person\nengaging in a grasping task. The lowest\nlevel would interact directly with sensors\nand actuators, the middle level (the rule\nlevel that is the focus of attention in this\narticle) would command responses to patterns that it would recognize in feedback\nsignals, and the highest level would be\ndedicated to planning and the recognition\nof sequences of patterns. In ascending the\nhierarchy, one would encounter increasingly symbolic types of logic.\nThe hierarchical architecture (see Figure 1) requires several additions to the\nstandard architectures of previous planner\nand actuator controllers. First, one has to\ngenerate the set of conditions that constitute the qualitative component of the\nspecification of the evolution of a task.\n\nFigure 1. The Rule\nLevel of the Hierarchi ca l Control Architecture would be\nimplemented in two\nBoolean neural networks that would operate and be updated\nin alternation. A prototype Boolean network has been built.\n\nAnalog\n\nSet Points\n\nr---------\n\n:\n\n~--~--~\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\nI\n\nRule Level\nof Hierarchy\n\nFigure 2. The Prototype Boolean Neural Network is a very-large-scale integrated circuit. It\nincludes a 4-by-8-node AND plane, an 8-by-8node OR plane, and an 8-node control column\nbetween those two planes. The circuit chip\nmeasures 7.9 by 9.2 mm and is mounted in a\n64-pin package.\n\n40\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 1992\n\nSecond, one has to store a set of alternate trajectories. Within the rule level of\nthe hierarchy, range selectors would transform the analog outputs of the sensors into\nBoolean variables (logic-level signals). Two\nBoolean neural networks would process\nthe Boolean variables according to memorized " if ... then" rules supplied by the\nplanner (which would reside in the highest\nlevel of the hierarchy). This concept relies\non two basic assumptions: that a small set\nof actuator trajectories can cover most\ngrasping tasks and that the evolution of\na grasping task can be represented by logical conditions.\nThe Boolean networks would be operated in altemation under control of an adap\'\ntation-and-rule controller, which would also\nsupervise the loading of a new plan and\nits rules. While one Boolean network was\noperating, the other one would be receiving the updated plan . Once updating was\ncompleted, the newly updated network\nwould be switched into operation and the\nother switched out of operation to be up\'\ndated in turn. In this way, updating could\nproceed without interfering with the correct processing of feedback signals.\nThe prototype Boolean neural network\n(see Figure 2) is an adaptive, self-organizing logic network in that it takes an active part in reconfiguring its own logic\ngates. In so doing , it strives to optimize its\nconfiguration andlor performance with respect to such criteria as minimality and\nconsistency of the rule base. During processing , the network acts as a programmable logic array. During adaptation, as\nnew rules are added, the network automatically reconfigures itself into a logic circuit that seeks to maintain a minimum and\nconsistent rule base.\nThere is no explicit programming of the\nnetwork, and the internal configuration of\nthe network is not unique but , rather, depends on the initial state and on the history\nof the previous adaptations.

The\nadaptation may involve addition or deletion of nodes or compaction of subnetworks. A central controller is used for coor-\n\ndination, but the adaptive process itself is\ncompletely distributed in the network, and\nmodifications to the network are performed\nwith considerable concurrency.\n\nThis work was done by Paolo Fiorini and\nJeffrey Chang of Caltech for NASA\'s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

To effect changes in timing signals, it was necessary to rewire the logic\ncircuit - a time-consuming and difficult\ntask. With a microcontroller, one can\nchange timing signals via software, without changes in wiring. Because the software-based approach is more flexible, timing signals can be changed more easily\nand quickly.\nNASA Tech Briefs. June 1992\n\nThe microcontrollers are commercial\nAm29CPL154 field-programmable controllers (FPC\'s). They are incorporated in a\ngeneral-purpose FPC circuit board, which\nis the basis for the system (see Figure 1).\nEach microcontroller simultaneously puts\nout a bit pattern and executes an instruction from a set of instructions. Some of the\npossible instructions are waiting, branching, looping, and subroutine calls and returns. After a routine is written for each\nof the basic operations required by the\ndetector, the operations can be executed\nthe correct number of times and in the correct order to read data out of the detector.\nEach microcontroller can drive up to 16\n\nGeneral -Purpose\nFPC Circuit Board\n\n-.\n-\n\nSources of\nFixed Bias\nVoltage\n\n~\n\nAnalog Clock\xc2\xb7\nDriver Module\n(32 Channels)\n\n+\n\nCharge-Coupled-Device\nArray Detector\n\nFigure 1.

First, a source file is written in\na high-level programming language with\nthe help of a word-processor program. The\nsource file is then processed via the as\xc2\xb7\nsembler software into a Joint Electron Device Engineering Council (JEDEC) fuse\nmap. The fuse map is processed via the\nsimulation software to determine whether\nthe program runs properly before burning\nthe program into the microcontroller. If\nnecessary, the source file is modified, then\nprocessed through to simulation as before.\nOnce the results of the simulation are\nsatisfactory, the microcontroller can be\nprogrammed.\nThe fuse map provides all of the necessary information for a device programmer\nto burn the desired program into a microcontroller. Each microcontroller thus programmed is installed in the general-purpose FPC board.\nPrototype general-purpose FPC boards\nare being used to operate detectors of\n2,048 x 2,048 picture elements.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nAn electronic system collects, manipulates, and displays in real time the results\nof the manipulation of multiple streams of\ndata that have been transmitted from remote scientific instrumentation. The system includes an interface circuit, a Macintosh Ilx computer, and special software for\ncontrol of the collection, display, and\nstorage of the data. The system was designed for use in the reception and realtime preliminary inspection of multiple\nstreams of data from the Microgravity Vestibular Investigations experiment aboard\nthe Space lab. Much of the special software should be useful in other applications\nin which Macintosh computers are to be\nused in the real-time display and recording\nof data.\nThe streams of data from the various\ninstruments are multiplexed along with\nclock signals for transmission, then demultiplexed after reception. The input data-andclock signal for the present system is the\noutput of the demultiplexer. This is a nonstandard signal characterized by differential \xc2\xb11.5-V levels, synchronous non-returnto-zero data and clock components, serial\ntransmission with the most-significant bit\ntransmitted first, and a rate of 25.6 kBd.\nThe data are transmitted in major and\nminor frames at a rate of 1 major frame\n42\n\nTo Disk Siorage\nDisplay\n\n+12V\nDala and Clock\nSlgnalOul\n\n22K\n\nFigure 1. The Interface Circuit shifts the\ndata-and-clocksignal\nfrom the differential\nlogic levels of the\nmultiplexer to the\nsingle-ended logic\nlevels ofthe computer.\nIn addition, it amplifies the signal to provide adequate margin\nfor stability and unambiguous detection\nof logic states.\n\n1.SK\n-12 V\n\nper second, each major frame containing\n16 minor frames. Each minor frame begins\nwith a 24-bit synchronization pattern and\ncontains 100 words (200 bytes) of data.\nThere are no start, stop, or parity bits.\nTypically, data are collected continuously during as much as 2 hours at a time.\nBecause there are no "clear-to-send" or\n"data-terminal-ready" signals and no\nstatus bits, and because it is not possible\nto retransmit data when bit losses are detected, it is critical to maintain synchronization during those hours. All manipulations\nof the data, including reversal of bits and\nbytes, stripping of data for display, plotting\n\non display, scrolling, and writing to disk,\nmust give the "data-receiving" interrupt\nthe highest priority and be fast enough for\nall manipulations to occur while maintaining real-time scrolling.\nThe data-and-clock signal is fed through\nthe interface circuit into one of the serial\nports (port A) of the Macintosh IIx computer (see Figure 1). The interface circuit\nis needed to accommodate the singleended-logic-level design of the computer\nto the differential-logic-level design of the\ndemultiplexer. Several modifications of the\nMacintosh serial-driver software and of\nsoftware packages that interact with the\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 1992\n\nserial driver were made to accommodate\nthe nonstandard data-and-clock format.\nThe skeleton of the custom-designed\nserial-interrupt driver consists of a circular\nbuffer with an in-pointer for data coming\nfrom port A and an out-pointer for data\nblocks being written to disk. As data are\nreceived, an inline bit/byte reversal is performed via a lookup table. The data are\nwritten to disk in blocks, each of which\nconsists of 1 major frame (3,200 bytes).\nError-detecting and -correcting features include a synchronization check at the start\nof every minor frame and a reset routine\nfor use in the event that synchronization\nis lost. The reset routine loses only 2 minor\nframes (125 ms or 400 bytes of data).\nThe application software, written in\nForth, operates with the top priority being\nto receive the data and write them to disk.\nDuring inactive states, the current display\n(stripchart or alphanumeric) is updated. A\npulldown menu at the top of the screen\nprovides options of stopping or starting the\ncollection of data, activating the alphanumeric display, and quitting the application\nprogram.

This filter is part of an optoelectronic\napparatus that indicates the degree of correlation between (1) an input image of a\ngiven object and (2) any of a number of\ntraining images of the same object at various positions and orientations that may\ndiffer from those represented in the input\nimage. An apparatus of this type might be\nused, for example, in a tracking system to\nrecognize a moving vehicle or other substantially rigid object from any direction.\nThe synthetic discriminant function (SDF)\ncontains the training-image information. If\nan updateable spatial light modulator were\nable to encode arbitrary complex values,\nthen the design of the SDF could be calculated analytically. The binary modulation\ncharacteristics of current spatial light modulators require the design of a different\nfilter function called a " filter SDF" (fSDF)\nthat can be implemented optically and that\ncan yield the desired result of equal correlation peaks for each of the training images. The problem for this design is that\nit cannot be solved analytically.\nThe solution involves choosing the SDF\nto be a linear combination of the training\nimages. The modulation function of the spatiallight modulator is incorporated into the\nequations for the correlation response to\neach training image. The resulting set of\nNASA Tech Briefs. June 1992\n\nnonlinear equations is solved iteratively by\na modified Newton-Raphson procedure to\nobtain the coefficients of the linear combination, which coefficients are then used\nto construct the SDF.\nIn the experiments, the iterative construction of the filter was performed directly on\nan optical correlator under automatic control by a digital computer. The optical correlator (see figure) included two 128 X128pixel magnetO<Jptical spatial light modulators\n(MOSLM\'s): one at the input plane and one\nat the filter plane. Binary phase-only operation was obtained by placing an analyzer\n(not shown in the figure) downstream of\nthe filter MOSLM. polarized perpendicular\nto the polarization defined by another polarizer (also not shown) associated with the\nInput Magneto\xc2\xb7Optical\nSpatial Light Modulator\n\nFilter Magneto\xc2\xb7Optical\nSpatial Light Modulator\n\n- - - - -\n\ninput MOSLM.

Each specimen is tested under computer control to obtain better resolution of data and more data points\nin less time. The measurements are performed in a sequence in which the computer determines whether the measurements at each step satisfy prescribed\ncriteria before proceeding to the next step.\nThe time required by the automated apparatus to complete a high-temperature\ntest of a representative specimen is 3 V2\ndays, compared with 11 days for a similar\ntest on a prior semiautomated apparatus.\nEach specimen is mounted on an\nalumina fixture with chisel-point contacts\nin a Van der Pauw (four-probe) configuration . To obtain a complete set of data that\ncharacterize the electrical resistivities of\nthe specimen, it is necessary to take electrical-resistance measurements in eight\nelectrical orientations. Another four electrical-resistance-measuring orientations\nare required for the Hall-resistance measurements. At each of these four Hall-resistance-measuring electrical orientations,\ntwo resistance measurements are performed, one at each of two opposite orientations of an applied magnetic field (see\nFigure 1).\nThe computer both acquires the data\nand controls the apparatus. Control is exerted via three feedback loops: one for\ntemperature, one for the magnetic field,\nand one for electrical-potential data (see\nFigure 2). The temperature is set by voltage commands sent from the computer\nvia an IEEE-488 data bus to the dc power\nsupply of a furnace that heats the specimen to the desired temperature. The computer monitors the temperature of the\nspecimen by polling a digital voltmeter that\nreads the output of a thermocouple. After\n12 consecutive temperature readings are\nfound to be equal, the temperature is considered to be stabilized, and the measurements are begun.\nThe switching of voltages, currents, and\nmeasurements thereof for the sequence\nof 12 electrical orientations and 2 magnetic-field orientations is accomplished via\na transistor/transistor-logic sequence\npanel, which sets relays. The steps of the\nsequence are controlled by the computer,\nusing the modem lines from an RS232-C\ninterface. The magnetic field is applied and\nregulated automatically via a field-control\npanel that includes mercury contactors\nand a motor-driven potentiometer linked to\nan external resistance-programmed dc\n46\n\nSP<CY\\\\9\n\n~~\' ~\n@~~\' ~\n\n~e.\n\nRESISTIVITY MEASUREMENTS\n\nI\n\nHALL MEASUREMENTS (ONE WITH MAGNETIC FIELD INTO PAGE.\nONE WITH MAGNETIC FIELD OUT OF PAGE FOR EACH CASE SHOWN)\nNotes:\n1.

The 4.5-kW output of this\nsupply produces a stable field of 1 T in a\n12-in. (30.5-cm) electromagnet. Magnetic\nfeedback to the computer is provided by\nan IEEE-488 gaussmeter.\nResistivity measurements are taken first\nbecause consistent resistivity readings indicate a likelihood of success with the\nmore lengthy Hall measurements. For\neach of the eight resistance measurements, the computer polls a nanovoltmeter\nfor stable readings of electrical potential\nand the digital voltmeter for applied current and voltage. The four resistivities are\nthen evaluated by use of an equation applicable to the Van der Pauw configuration .\nThe Hall constant is determined from\nstable readings of magnetic field, current,\nand change in electrical potential between\n\napplications of forward and reverse magnetic fields. For each orientation of the\nmagnetic field, the change in potential is\nfound by subtracting the mean value of\npotential with the field off from the mean\nstable potential with the field on.\nRaw and calculated data are printed out\nwhile the test is in progress. Upon completion of testing at a specified temperature, data on resistivities, Hall parameters, and the temperature are recorded on\nmagnetic tape. The files can then be read,\nscaled, and plotted by a graphics program.\nThis \'NOrk was done by James B. Parker\nand Leslie D. Zoltan of Caltech for NASA\'s\nJet Propulsion Laboratory.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nAn automatic-Ievel-controllautomaticgain-control (ALe/AGC) system for a\ncharge-coupled-device (CCO) color television camera (see figure) prevents overloading in bright scenes. The system implements an improved technique for\nmeasuring the brightness of the scene\nfrom the red, green , and blue output signals of the camera and processes these\nsignals into adjustments of the gains of the\nvideo amplifiers and into control signals\nfor a motor that varies the opening of the\niris on the camera lens. The advantages\nof this system over prior systems are that\nit is faster, does not distort the video brightness signals, and is built with smaller\ncomponents.\nIn this system, the output voltages of\nthe camera are measured during each\ntelevision-field period, and the video gains\nare adjusted accordingly only during the\nvertical blanking interval. Thus, the gains\nof the amplifiers are corrected quickly\n(every 1/60 second), but not during an image scan. The AGe voltage is monitored\nby a second stage, and when it wanders\n\noutside a range defined by two preset reference limits that represent underexposure\nor overexposure, respectively, the opening\nof the iris is incremented or decremented\nappropriately. This correction is slower\nthan the AGe adjustment is but provides\na very wide dynamic range for allowable\nbrightness of the scene.\nVideo information is clamped in the red,\ngreen , and blue channels to establish a\ndc reference for the video black level and\nto compensate for variations in the dark\ncurrent of the CCO imager. The dc-restored\nwaveforms are mixed nonadditively, and\nthe signal of highest amplitude is compared to a predetermined reference. The\noutput of the comparator is then peak- or\narea-detected, depending upon the mode\nselected by remote or manual command.\nThe area-detector/peak-detector circuit,\nwhich is part of the control loop, puts out\nan AGe voltage that keeps a commanded fraction of the picture raster at a predetermined signal level.\nThe control loop includes two integrators: one provides area detection; the other\n\nintegrates the area error. The area-detection integrator is reset just prior to the beginning of each field , during the vertical\nblanking interval. The intermediate output\nof this circuit is a voltage proportional to\nthe total area of the parts of the image in\nwhich the brightness Signal is above the\nreference level. The intermediate output\nof this circuit is offset so that if the area\nin which the signal is above the threshold\nlevel equals a selected fraction (1 percent\nor 5 percent) of the total area of the image, the final output of this circuit is zero.\nThe output of the area detector is sampled\nduring vertical blanking at the end of each\nfield and fed to the area-error integrator,\nthe final output of which is used as the\nAGe voltage. Because the AGe voltage\ncan change only during vertical blanking,\ntime constants much smaller than those\nused in prior systems (and, consequently,\nsmaller capacitors) can be used without\ncausing distortion of the video signal. A\ndiode clamp limits the output of the area\ndetector, providing similar response times\nfor both bright and dim signals.\n\n\'----------------------------------,I\nAGC\nOutput\n\nI\n:\n\nBuffer I\n\nAmplifier\n\n.>--,......_ _ _.....

These commands are multiplexed with manual and remote commands to provide opening and closing\nlogic signals to the stepping-motor-driving\ncircuit.\nPeak detection is achieved by triggering a monostable multivibrator (not shown\n\nin the figure) in the area detector from the\ntrailing edge of output of the comparator\nthat immediately precedes the area detector. This stretches the pulse response to\nan effective area greater than that set by\nthe equilibrium condition of the area detector.

Such judgments are based primarilyon intuition and general flying experience because pilots rarely experience\naborted takeoffs. Standard takeoffs on adequately long runways generally present no\nproblem. Visual perception of motion combined with cues from cockpit instrumentation that indicate airspeed and "engine\nhealth" help a pilot relate sensed acceleration to the remaining takeoff distance. "Go/\nno-go" decisions become more critical as\nthe airplane nears takeoff speed. The pilot\nmust continually decide if there is enough\nrunway distance ahead to (1) safely complete the takeoff (with one engine failed)\nor (2) stop the airplane before it runs off\nthe end of the pavement.\nThe purpose of the Airplane-RunwayPerformance Monitoring System (ARPMS)\nis to increase safety during takeoffs and\nlandings by providing pilots with symbolic\n"head-up" and "head-down" information\npertinent to their decisions to continue or\nabort takeoffs or landings. When a takeoff\nis aborted or a landing is approached,\nARPMS provides graphic information concerning where the airplane could be\nbrought to a stop. With the ARPMS, the\npilot could monitor the ground speed and\npredicted stopping point while looking at\nthe actual runway ahead. When fully developed, the combined head-down/headup cockpit display system would be driven\nby a common algorithm.\nIn essence, the ARPMS is an extension\nof the Take-Off Performance Monitoring System (TOPMS), providing some additional\ninformation. The "failed-engine" flags have\nbeen replaced in both the head-up and\nhead-down displays by variable-length linear bars that indicate the magnitude of the\nengine-pressure ratio (for each engine).\nWhen an EPR value becomes unacceptable, the associated EPR bar shrinks in\nlength, turns red, and triggers an "abort-advisory" flag that resembles a STOP sign\n(see figure). Significant deviation (greater\nthan 5 percent) from nominal along-track\nacceleration is indicated by the white arrow that extends from the end of the runway graphic back toward the EPR bars.\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 1992\n\nAlso, if no engine failure had occurred, but\nthe acceleration-error arrow had extended back beyond the "acceptable limit"\ntick-mark between the EPR bars, the abortadvisory flag would similarly have been\ntriggered - this time indicating that unacceptable acceleration (e.g., greater than 15\npercent deviation from nominal) was being\nachieved.\nThe logic and calculations that drive\nboth displays are generally similar to those\nof the TOPMS. Also, like the TOPMS, the\nARPMS displays revert to a very simplified\nform when a takeoff abort or landing is\ninitiated. The primary advantage of the\nARPMS head-up display is that it provides\nthe pilot with insight into takeoff or braking performance without requiring the pilot\nto glance back inside the cockpit. It also\nallows the pilot to keep the runway in view\nwhile monitoring airspeed and verifying\ncertain anomalies reported by the copilot.\nIn the initial development of the ARPMS\ndisplays, the TOPMS displays and logic\nwere modified to their present form following a real-time simulator evaluation by experienced NASA, FAA, Air FQrce, and commercial-airline pilots. These displays are\nconsidered to have high potential for incorporation into the cockpit environment\nfor the entire aerospace community.\nThis work was done by David B.\n\nWith the ARPMS Head-Up Display In the Pilot\'s Window, the pilot does not have to\nglance back into the cockpit for pertinent information during critical procedures.\n\nMiddleton and lee H.

Older tachometers based on electromagnetic, optical , and magnetic-force sensing principles are\nnot well suited to such measurements where temperatures vary over wide ranges because they tend to be\nsensitive to distances between sensors and shafts, and\nthese distances change with thermal expans ion and\ncontraction . The proposed tachometer would be relatively insensitive to the distance between the sensor and\nthe shaft.\nLight from a laser diode would be split into two fiberoptic paths and sent to the shaft through a dual fiberoptic sensor (see figure) . Light emerg ing from one fiber\nwould illuminate the notched area of the shaft and would\nbe reflected back along that fiber to a photodiode. Light\nemerging from the other fiber would illum inate the adjacent , un notched area of the shaft and be similarly reflected back along this fiber to a second photodiode.\nBecause the sensing ends of both fibers would lie at\nvery nearly the same distance from the shaft, regardless\nof vibrations or thermal expansion or contraction , the\namount of laser light reflected back to both photodiodes\nwould vary by about the same proportion . Therefore , the\nratio between the outputs of the photodiodes should be\nnearly independent of the distance between the sensor\nand the shaft. The fluctuations in th is ratio would indicate\nthe passage of the notches and , therefore , could be used\nto determine the speed of rotation .\nThis work was done by James A.

The MSAT-X network would\ninclude mobile stations (e.g., aboard trucks)\nand base (e.g ., dispatching) stations com\xc2\xb7\nmunicating by microwave radio relay via\na geostationary satellite. It would provide\nthree main types of service: mobile telephone (voice only), mobile dispatch (voice\nand digital data), and digital data (packet\nmessages). Aspects of the MSAT-X network have been described in previous ar\xc2\xb7\nticles in NASA Tech Briefs.\nThe report summarizes the findings of\nthe research conducted in the MSAT-X proj\xc2\xb7\nect in recent years. The findings serve as\nbackground for the discussion of tentative\nspecifications for the design of the network, which would implement a demand\xc2\xb7\nassigned/frequency\xc2\xb7division multiple\xc2\xb7access (DA/FDMA) scheme.\nThe technical details are presented in\n10 sections, beginning with a brief history\nand overview of the MSAT-X concept in sec\xc2\xb7\ntion I. Section II describes the basic elements of the MSAT-X network other than the\nsatellite - namely, the base stations, mobile stations, and network-management center. Section II also describes the topology\nof the interconnections among the ele\xc2\xb7\nments of the network, including both the\nphysical aspects (principally, frequency\nchannels) and logical aspects (represen\xc2\xb7\ntation of permissible interconnections via\na matrix).\nSection III discusses the basic closed\xc2\xb7\nend and open\xc2\xb7end modes of interconnec\xc2\xb7\ntion. Closed\xc2\xb7end connections would be\nused mostly for the transmission of short\ndigital messages between mobile stations\nor between mobile and base stations.\nOpen\xc2\xb7end connections would be used for\nvocal communications and the transfer\nof long files of digital data.\nSection IV describes those aspects of\nthe structure of the network that pertain\nto the demand-assigned multiple\xc2\xb7access\n(DAMA) scheme. The scheme is imple\xc2\xb7\nmented by the Integrated Adaptive Mobile\nAccess Protocol (I-AMAP) algorithm, which\npartitions the channels dynamically in such\na way as to optimize between the com\xc2\xb7\npeting goals of maximizing the number of\nsubscribers who have simultaneous acNASA Tech Briefs, June 1992\n\ncess while minimizing delays in the com\xc2\xb7\npletion of services.\nSection V discusses the channel\xc2\xb7access\nprotocol (CAP), which governs the sending\nof requests for, and the waiting for acknowl\xc2\xb7\nedgements of, connections. Two alternative\nCAP algorithms are considered: Modified\nSlotted ALOHA and the free\xc2\xb7access tree\nalgorithm, both of which implement ran\xc2\xb7\ndom\xc2\xb7access schemes and have been dis\xc2\xb7\ncussed previously in NASA Tech Briefs.\nSection VI describes the connection protocol, which includes procedures that resemble the corresponding procedures used\nin telephone systems to initiate and termi\xc2\xb7\nnate connections. Section VII describes\n\ntechniques used to suppress errors in the\nMSAT-X network. These include error-de\xc2\xb7\ntecting and error-correcting codes and selective retransmission of message packets\nthat contain errors. Section VIII discusses\nthe structures of message packets.

Despite its extraterrestrial focus, the report may also be useful to scientists, engineers, and hobbyists\nwho are interested in terrestrial electronic\ncommunications because it includes an\nintroductory tutorial chapter on fiber-opticcommunication technology and a short\nchapter on current efforts to improve this\ntechnology.\nThe question of feasibility is approached\nfrom the perspective of the effects of the\nlunar environment - most notably, the\nadverse effects of extreme temperatures\non the surface (-175 to +135 0c) and\nionizing radiation. The easiest way to protect against both seems to be to bury fiberoptic cables 10 to 15 cm below the surface - a task that should be relatively\neasy, given the looseness of the surface\nlayer of lunar soil and the availability of terrestrial cable-burying equipment. The terminal and repeater electronics could also\nbe buried and heat-sunk to the lunar mass.\nThe report compares fiber-optic and\nmicrowave technologies, concluding that\nfiber optics offer advantages of less consumption of power, less weight, less bulk,\nand lower cost. It will probably be necessary to redesign the buffer and jacket materials of fiber-optic cables to optimize\nstrength, weight, and volume; to withstand\nthe surface radiation and thermal conditions and/or the rigors of handling during\nburial; and to protect the optical fibers\nagainst the darkening that is caused by\nthe radiation . It may also be necessary to\ndesign the associated electronic equipment to prevent damage from the discharges of the static electricity that tends\nto build up in a near-vacuum environment\n52\n\nlike that of the Moon. Overall, the report\nconcludes, none of the unique lunar environmental effects seems to pose insurmountable problems of design, manufacture, or installation; present commercial\nfiber-optic technology appears to be\nusable on the Moon with fairly minor\nmodifications.\nThis oork was done by George FLutes\nof Galtech for NASA\'s Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory.

The system\ncould be designed to utilize either concept\nvia either of two basic approaches: random access, in which each subscriber is\nallowed to transmit without making requests to a network control center; and\ndemand-assigned access, in which each\nsubscriber must make a connection request to the network control center, which\nthen grants access.\nThe principal means of comparison in\nthis study are the performances of the\nsystem under each channelization concept and access approach, as modeled\nmathematically, with some simplifying assumptions, for various conditions of voice\ntraffic, message traffic, noise, available\npower, and available bandwidth. Considerable attention is focused on accounting for\nthe level of voice activity in planning to use\nthe gaps between spoken words to transmit other signals (e.g., message packets).\nIn the case of demand-assigned access\nusing either code division or frequency division, numerical results indicate that the\ntraditional rule of thumb, in which the raw\nnumber of channels is divided by the\nvoice-activity factor to obtain the effective\nnumber of channels, is valid only asymptotically as the aggregated traffic approaches infinity. In the case of random access,\nthe numerical results show that code division is not particularly attractive for a firstgeneration mobile/satellite system that has\nlimited bandwidth, but could offer a viable\nalternative for such future systems as the\n\nExperiments in Calibration\nof Synthetic-Aperture Radar\n\nA report describes an international collaboration on a series of experiments in\nthe calibration of synthetic-aperture radar\n(SAR) systems. These systems were the\nNASA/JPL DC-8 P/LlC-Band polarimetric\nSAR, the Dutch X-Band Side-Looking Airborne Radar (SLAR), and the Canadian\nLlC/X-Band SAR. The experiments were\nconducted in August 1989 at Oberpfaffenhofen in Germany, Flevoland in the Netherlands, and Thetford in the United Kingdom.\nThe three test sites include various flat,\nagricultural, and forested areas. Several\ndifferent kinds of calibration equi pment\nwere deployed on the ground at the test\nsites, including trihedral and dihedral corner reflectors and polarimetric active radar\ncalibrators. The purposes of the series of\nexperiments were (1) to address the problems associated with calibration of data\nwithin areas of scientific interest, (2) to\ncross-calibrate between sets of imagingradar data obtained by different systems,\n(3) to test various designs of ground calibration equipment, and (4) to find candidate\nsites for the calibration of future satelliteborne SAR systems.\nThe report describes the major features\nof topography, natural vegetation, and agriculture along with the experimental procedures and equipment used at the three\nsites. It shows preliminary results of the experiments at the Oberpfaffenhofen site and\ndraws some conclusions concerning measurements needed to complete the calibration of the NASA DC-8 C-Band SAR and\nconcerning sources of error in the preliminary measurements.\nThis work was done by Anthony\nFreeman of Caltech for NASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

These equations express the relationships among the characteristics of the\noutput, the pumping rate above the thresh\xc2\xb7\nold pumping rate, and the rate of repetition of the Q switch. The equations are particularly useful for analyzing the performances of diode-pumped solid-state lasers,\nthe lasing thresholds of which are easily\nmeasured and readily related to the characteristics of the pump beams.\nHeretofore, the accurate prediction of\nthe performance and characteristics of a\nQ-switched laser has requi red the solution\nof the laser-rate equations, which are two\ncoupled differential equations that express\nthe relationship between the populationinversion density in the gain medium and\nthe photon density in the laser cavity. The\nequations must be solved by numerical integration , and the accuracy of the solution depends on the choice of the initial\nphoton and population-inversion densities.\nFurthermore, the solution is often given in\nterms of the population-inversion densities,\nwhich do not provide ready means for\ncomparing the predictions of the theory\nwith the results of experiments.\nThe approximate analytic equations are\nobtained by solving the rate equations under the following simplifying assumptions:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The Q-switched laser operates in the unsaturated-gain regime.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The Q.switched laser operates in the\nTEMoo electromagnetic mode.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The profile of the TEM mode, the laSing\nwavelength, and the coupling characteristics of the pump beam do not change\nas the pump power is increased.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The emission of a pulse of light coincides\nwith the opening of the Q switch, and the\nswitch is fast, as explained more fully\nbelow.\nThe derivation of the equations begins\nwith the calculation of the popUlation-inversion density attained during the low-Q\ninterval.

Then assuming that the switching time\nis so short that there is no appreciable\nchange in the population-inversion density in the gain medium during the transition from the low-Q (energy-storage) state\nto the high-Q (pulse-buildup) state, one can\ntreat the behavior in the latter state by\nseparate equations.

These equations and algorithms are based partly on the known scattering characteristics of artificial targets in\nthe scene and partly on the assumption\nthat all other targets scatter reciprocally;\nno other assumptions about the statistics\nof background scatter are required. In contrast, some prior equations and algorithms\nwere based on the assumption of azimuthal symmetry of the statistics of background scatter.\nThe equations are derived from a mathematical model in which seven parameters are used to specify completely the\namplitude and phase calibrations for\ntransmission and reception in horizontal\nand vertical polarizations, including the\ncross-polarization terms.

The\nmodel is applicable to both ring and\nstanding-wave lasers.\nUnlike liquid dyes, such tunable solidstate laser materials as Ti:sapphire and\nalexandrite are birefringent. It is frequently troublesome to design laser-resonator\ncavities that contain electro-optical Q\nswitches, birefringent gain media, and\nbirefringent filters. A proper design must\ntreat the polarization eigenstate of an entire resonator as a function of wavelength .\nThe polarization eigenvector at the output\ncoupler describes the polarization characteristics of the laser output, while the\neigenvalue defines the strength of the\ngiven polarization eigenmode. If the eigenvalue is greater than a threshold , the system lases in\' that mode. The mathematical\nmodel addresses these considerations.\nThe model is implemented by a computer program written in Turbo Pascal for\n\nMS DOS with EGA. The program includes\nsoftware modules for a variety of optical\nelements including Pockels cell, laser rod,\nquarter- and half-wave plates, Faraday rotator, and polarizers. In addition, it includes\na flexible module for the birefringent-filter\nassembly. As currently written, most of the\nmodules enable the investigation of the effects of roll misalignments. The birefringent-filter module enables the investigation of the effects of plate-thickness errors\nand of plate-te-plate alignment errors in tilt\nand rotation .\nEach module builds a complete wavelength<lependent polarization matrix (Jones\nmatrix). This matrix is a product of matrices\nthat describe surface losses, rotation matrices that transform the cavity coordinate\nsystem to the internal coordinate system\nand back again, a bulk gain or loss matrix,\nand a phase-retardation matrix. At each\nwavelength, the product of all polarization\nmatrices is evaluated to determine the\neigenvalue and eigenvector. From these,\nthe magnitude of the maximum eigenvalue\n\nEigenvalue and Polarization Spectra were comp uted for t he low-Q reso nator cavity\nof a standing-wave laser, usi ng two different sequences of birefringent filter plates.\nThe spectral resolut ion of these plots is 0.05 nm.

The information about the\npolarization state is transformed into values\nthat describe the axes of the polarization\nellipse with respect to the axes of the cavity and the eccentricity of the polarization\nellipse.\nTo provide an example of the utility of\nthe model, the program was used to\nanalyze a standing-wave laser resonator\ncomposed of an output coupler, an alexand rite rod, a five-quartz-plate bireiringent\nfilter, and a Pockels-cell Q switch. A laboratory laser in this configuration demonstrated incomplete hold-off during tests. The\ntop part of the figure shows the spectrum,\ncomputed by the model, of the magnitude\nof the eigenvalue at the output coupler\nwith the cavity in the low-Q condition. This\nspectrum confirms a near-threshold condition during holdoff. The model predicts\nfurther that simple reversal of the order of\nthe quartz plates solves the holdoff problem, as shown in the computed spectrum\nin the bottom part of the figure. Laboratory\ntests with the order of the plates reversed\nconfirm the prediction of the model.\nThis work was done by Bryan Monosmith\nof Goddard Space Flight Center.

In the original intended application, such cameras would be\nused as remote imagers to be carried\naboard small exploratory spacecraft. On\nEarth, cameras of this type might be useful\nas portable imagers that may be subject\nto rough or unpredictable handling, or as\ninstrumentation cameras to be mounted\non severely vibrating or accelerating vehicles, platforms, and the like.\nThe optics of a typical camera of this\ntype would consist of four coaxial focusing mirrors in a Cassegrain configuration\n(see figure). Any or all of the mirrors could\nbe conics or aspherics. The all-reflective\noptics would be achromatic, and the imaging system overall would pass light in\na wide spectrum from extreme ultraviolet\nto far infrared.\nTwo of the four mirror surfaces would\nbe machined (e.g ., by diamond turning) into\neach of two round cylindrical blocks of\nmetal (which could be beryllium for light\nweight). The entrance aperture would consist of a series of axial holes spaced evenly\naround an annulus in one of the blocks.\n\nThe remaining material in this annulus\nwould serve as a rigid support for the two\nmirror surfaces in that block.\nThe material remaining after the machining of each block would include rugged\nintegral baffles to prevent unfocused light\nfrom reaching the focal plane directly from\nthe scene. A charge-coupled-device video\ncamera, film camera, or array of photodetectors would be placed at the focal plane.\nThe folded optics of the Cassegrain configuration could be designed, if desired, to\nhave an effective focal length several times\nthe axial distance from the input end of the\ncamera to the focal plane. Computer simu-\n\nlations with representative designs show\nthat a camera of this type could give diffraction-limited performance over a substantial (several degrees) field of view.\nThis INOrk was done by Aden B.

Because the optics\nwould be reflective\n(as distinguished\nfrom refractive), they\nwould also be achromatic.

Arrays of devices\nof this type could be incorporated into integrated-circuit infrared imaging devices.\nA typical device of this type (see figure)\nwould have some of the features of both\na back-te-back heterojunction internal-phetoemission (HIP) detector and a FabryPerot interferometer. The example uses an\nAlGaAs/lnGaAs/GaAs heterostructure with\nn+ doping of the InGaAs layers; however,\nother heterostructure materials (e.g., AIAs/\nGaAs/AIGaAs, Si/GeSi/Si, ecl.) and/or p+\ndoping may be appropriate. Photons of energy greater than the height of the n+InGaAs/GaAs heterojunction barrier would\nbe absorbed, causing internal photoemission of electrons (holes) over the barrier.\nIn a device of typical dimensions and composition, only a few percent of the photons\nof the desired wavelength would be absorbed in one pass. To effect multiple passes and thereby increase the number of\n56\n\nTh is Lo ng-Wave length-Infra red detector would offer\nhigher efficiency by\nvirtue of multiple\npasses of the radiation through the active volume .\nSeml\xc2\xb7lnsulating\nGaAs Substrate\n\nInfrared\nRadiation\n\nPART OF IMAGING ARRAY OF DETECTORS\n\nn + InGaAs\n\nGaAs\n\nn GaAs\n\nAlGa As\n\nGaAs\nn+ InGaAs\n\nAIGaAs\n\nSemi\xc2\xb7\ninsulating\nGaAs\n\nActive\nHeteroJunctlon\n\nHalf Wavelength, Taking\n\nAccount of Index of Refraction - - - . .\nIncoming Photon\nExcites Electron\n\nDepth Into Material\n\nELECTRON\xc2\xb7ENERGY DIAGRAM OF ONE DETECTOR\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 1992\n\nphotons absorbed, and thus the quantum\nefficiency and output current, the device\nwould incorporate front and rear plasma\nreflecting n+ (or p+) layers spaced for\nresonance like the reflecting surfaces of\na Fabry-Perot interferometer.\nThe reflections would occur in the heavily doped n+ (or p+) InGaAs layers of sufficient thickness (-1 /lm) at wavelengths\ngreater than that of the plasma resonance\nof these layers. The plasma-resonance\nwavelength is inversely proportional to the\nsquare root of the charge-carrier density;\nfor example, at a representative density of\n2 X10 19 cm - 3, the plasma-resonance\nwavelength would be about 6 /lm .\nThe device shown in the figure would\nprovide photovoltaic output from the two\nn+ InGaAs/GaAs heterojunction barriers,\nwhich would be connected in parallel so\nthat the combined internal photoemission\ncurrent would be collected in the common\nn - -GaAs layer in the middle. Two outer\nAIGaAs layers would confine the n+InGaAs layers and increase the quantum\nefficiency somewhat by reflecting photoelectrons back inside toward the active\n\nbarriers. However, the infrared radiation\nwould be absorbed and reflected mostly\nfrom regions near the internal interfaces\nbetween the n+-lnGaAs and GaAs layers,\nand this effect would cause the photoelectrons to be produced closer to the active\nbarriers, thereby substantially increasing\nthe quantum efficiency.\nIn fabricating an imaging array of such\ndevices, common metal contacts would\nbe depoSited directly over the exposed\nn+ layers on the slopes of the grooves\nthat would surround each device. Quantum tunneling through narrow Schottky\nbarriers would effect good electrical contact between the metal and the n+ InGaAs layers. On the other hand, a wide\nSchottky barrier that would form between\nthe n - GaAs layer and the metal would\neffectively block conduction, preventing\nthe metal from electrically shorting out the\ndevices.\nThis oork was done tJy Joseph Maserjian\n\nof Caltech for NASA\'s Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory.

These matrices have been used\nalong with the complex-amplitude S (scattering) matrices to derive the basic equations for several prior methods of calibration of SAR systems.\nHeretofore, calibration equations and\nalgorithms have been derived under the\nassumption that the ratio between the\npowers transmitted in horizontal (H) and\nvertical M polarization and the ratio between the gains of the receiver(s) in the\nH and V channels both remain constant.\nIn practice, gains are switched to higher\nvalues in the reception of cross-polarization returns to keep signals within optimum\nranges of analog-to-digital converters. In\nthe new method, one assumes not only\nthat the gains can be switched but also\nthat the overall complex (amplitude and\nphase) gain can be different in each of the\nchannels HH, HV, VH , and VV (see figure).\n\nThe Overall Gain in Each Combination of\nTransmitting and Receiving Channels is\nassumed to be different, as it can be in\npractice, even when only one transmitter\nand one receiver are used.

This parameter can be\nused to transform the measurements made\nby the system into a format compatible\n\nwith the simple 2 x 2 model, so that the\ndata thus preprocessed can then be processed by the applicable one of the several\nprior methods based on the simple model.\nIgnoring second-order crosstalk terms,\n/\' is insensitive to rotations of PARC\'s about\nthe line of sight of the radar system. Other\nquantities measured by use of PARC\'s are\nsensitive to such rotations, and the method\nprescribes a calibration procedure that\nminimizes the effect of small deviations of\nthe orientations of PARC\'s from the desired\norientations. If the orientation of a PARC\n\nwith respect to the local reference frame\ndetermined by the surface of the Earth is\nknown, then one of the parameters computed in the calibration procedure should\ngive the orientation of the H, V radar coordinate system with respect to the H, V coordinate system of the Earth.\nThis oork was done I:1j Anthony Freeman\nof Caltech for NASA\'s Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory.

The analysis employed uses the\nbackward-propagated local-oscillator\n(BPLO) approach, in which the local oscillator beam is imagined as being projected\nthrough the receiver optics to the target\nplane, where it is coherently convolved\nwith the transmitter beam.\nThe far-field irradiance distribution of the\nBPLO beam used in the analysis is computed via the diffraction integral, assuming a Gaussian transverse distribution of\nBPLD irradiance truncated by the transmiV\nreceive pupil. The corresponding far-field\ndistribution for the transmitted beam is determined in a similar manner, except that\nthe transverse distribution of irradiance at\nthe pupil is either of two basic types, depending on whether the transverse reflectance prOfile of the transmitter output optic\nis considered to be Gaussian (soft-edged)\nor planar (hard-edged). In the Gaussian\ncase, the transverse distribution of irradiance across the transceiver pupil is a compound Gaussian due to the convolution of\nthe resultant Gaussian internal laser mode\n\nwith the Gaussian reflectance output optics. In the hard-edged case, the transverse distribution of irradiance across the\npupil is approximated as a uniformly illuminated annulus.\nThese two cases have been selected\nfor comparison because of their practical\nimportance. In previous studies, the Gaussian profiled optiCS have been found to improve the far-field qualities of laser beams.\nOn the other hand, hard-edged couplers\ncan be fabricated from more-damage-resistant (i.e., metallic) materials, a critical\nfeature in high-energy laser systems. In\nparticular, the intercomparison shows that\nfor multi-joule-output pulsed CO2 lasers,\nthe Gaussian profiled optics offers relatively little improvement over the hard-edged\noption, while the greater hardiness and\nsuperior energy-extraction capability of the\nlatter may constitute a strong argument in\nfavor of its application.\nThis work was done by David M.

Satellites in certain orbits around the earth ,\nespecially the geosynchronous and the\npolar regions, are frequently immersed in\nan energetic plasma environment leading\nto electrostatic charging of dielectric exterior surfaces and resultant electrostatic\ndischarges.\nThe static-discharge problem can be\nparticularly acute in thermal-control paints,\nwhich are electrically insulating and which\ncannot be made electrically conductive\nwithout ruin ing the thermal-control properties. When a surface covered by such a\npaint is exposed to a flux of charged particles, the charges lodge on the surface\nand do not leak to the grounded conductive surface below the paint.

The band is connected to the\nconductive substrate at several points. The\nband causes discharges to occur at lower\npotentials and to be less energetic.

The role of SURF in the software\ncycle of CFD graphics is to enable the interactive input of grid and solution files\nfrom the PLOT3D/AMES program; to use\nthose files in the interactive creation of\nwire-frame, shaded, and function-mapped\nimages of parts to view; and then to put\nout ARCGraph standard files that can be\nanimated by use of GAS (COSMIC Program ARC-12379).\nThe CFD cycle begins with the execution of such " flow solver" programs as\nINS3D (COSMIC Program ARC-11794).\nThese programs solve the higher-order\nequations that govern flight characteristics, according to the test-geometry specifications (e.g., forward-swept-wing model\nwith surrounding airspace), and simulation\nconditions (e.g., angle of attack, mach number, Reynolds number) supplied by the user\nas inputs. The numerical solution data thus\ngenerated are collected and converted to\nimages of flows, distributions of pressure,\nshock waves, and particle traces by use\nof the PLOT3D/AMES (ARC-12777 through\nARC-12789) graphics-software package.\nSURF includes a mouse-driven menu\ninterface that enables the user to create\na model that consists of a mixture of different types of parts (including Gouraud\nand smoothly shaded function-mapped\nparts) that can be interactively viewed, deleted, or sent to ARCGraph files. The color and the specular highlights of a Gouraudshaded part can be adjusted interactively. Shaded parts are created on the basis\nof the sources of light, point of view, and\nambient light level specified by the user.\nThe spectrum of colors of function-mapped\nparts can be adjusted interactively.

In this\ndevice, the hydrostatic bearing ring is\nclamped in a radially flexing support by\nside plates that are clamped against its\nradial surfaces by spring-loaded bolts. The\nplates provide friction force against radial\nmotions of the shaft. The bolts can be adjusted to vary and balance the pressures\non the plates and, thereby, the amount of\nfrictional damping. The axial pressure drop\nin the bearing fluid provides additional\nclamping pressure. In operation, as the\ndynamic load on the shaft changes, the\nexternal friction device flexes; the resulting\nrelative motion between the bearing and\nthe side plates generates stabilizing forces.\n\nAn external friction device damps the\nvibrations of a shaft and of a hydrostatic\nring bearing in which it turns. The device\nis needed because such bearings have\nlittle inherent damping, yet a high degree\nof stabilization is needed for the stable\noperation of such a shaft-and-bearing combination at supercritical speed.\nOne prior technique to increase damping in the fluid film of a hydrostatic bearing involves roughening the facing surfaces of the bearing. However, the fluid film\nprovides adequate bearing support only at\nspeeds above a certain minimum value.\nDuring low-speed " rub starts" and "rundowns," these rough surfaces can be degraded by wear.\n\nThis work was done by Paul S.\nBuckmann of GenCorp for Marshall\nSpace Flight Center.

The dolly could be removed\nfrom the towbar quickly at the point of use.\nThe dolly would include an aluminum\nframe with light-duty wheels (see figure).\nA clamp pin and an anti rotation bar on the\naxle shaft of the dolly would fit the rear\nclamp on the towbar, which is used during normal towing to connect to the vehicle to be towed.

The current method of transportation requires a forklift and Hon truck to\nmove the 1,700-lb (770-kg) towbar. A total\nof about 8 worker-hours are required for\na truckdriver, forklift operator, and Space\nShuttle tow-vehicle driver. With the dolly,\nonly the tow-vehicle driver would be needed.

The mechanism is permanently attached via this flange to the first object.\nThe other end of the tube or pin is inserted\nin a mating hole in the second object. A\nplunger is free to move axially inside the\ntube or pin and is biased by a spring toward a position in which it forces a set of\nballs to protrude slightly from the side of\nthe tube or pin.

For each\nvibrational mode, the damping in the entire link is found by integrating the local damping over the whole link.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 1992\n\nments by selection of the fiber and matrix\nmaterials, the I,{llume fractions of these materials, and the thicknesses, angles, and\nstacking sequence of the plies.\nIn the integrated theory, the damping in\na composite link is computed by synthesis\nfrom the damping properties of each material component. First, a simplified theory\nof micromechanics is used to calculate\nthe hysteretic on-axis damping. Then the\ndamping capacities of on-axis plies subjected to off-axis loading (or, equivalently, offaxis plies subjected to on-axis loading) are\ncalculated. Next, the local damping capacity throughout the entire thickness of the\nlaminate is formulated.\nThe local damping provides rough estimates of the damping in the entire link. However, a typical practical link would exhibit\nmore complicated and coupled deformations, and its damping capacity would be\nthe integrated contribution of local damping over the whole volume at a particular\ndeformation shape. Inasmuch as the elastodynamic response of any structure is a linear\ncombination of individual vibrational modes,\nstructural damping associated with each\nmode would provide a useful measure of\nthe overall damping capacity of the link. Accordingly, the global damping capacity of\nthe link structure for a particular mode\nshape, called the " structural modal damping," is computed for that shape by integrating the damping over the whole link\nvia a finite-triangular-plate-element discretization (see figure). This approach enables\nthe selective minimization of vibrations in\nspecific modes, with ply angles and volumes of fibers tailored to obtain optimal\ncombinations of damping stiffness.\nThe method was tested by simulating the\ndynamic responses of links of various designs via a finite-element analysis, using the\nsame triangular-plate elements as those\nused to compute the structural modal damping. These simulations illustrate the effects of\nply angles, multiple angle-ply sublaminates,\nand fiber-I,{llume fractions on the optimal\ndesigns. These case studies led to the following conclusions:\n1. The resultant optimal laminate configurations and composite material systems significantly improved the damping of bending modes by factors of 5 with respect to\na reference unidirectional-fiber design,\nwhile the undamped dynamic amplitudes\nwere degraded by factors of only 1.5.\nThere were wide margins for compromises among damping, static stiffness,\nand dynamic stiffness without changing\nthe shapes and, consequently, the masses\nof the links.\n2. Ply angles were the most critical deSign\nparameters.\n3. Laminates with single or multiple angleply sublaminates yielded optimal designs\nof comparable performance.\n4.

In addition, the system allows for small angular and lateral misalignments. Applications for thi s system might\ninclude such connections as those between modular electronic units, coupled\nvehicles, and hydraulic systems.\nThe system (see figure) includes a passive member mounted on one of the units\nto be mated and an active member\nmounted on the other unit. The active and\npassive members include shell-type connector-mounting subassemblies held by\nbushings that accommodate both small\nangular misalignments (rotations about the\nbushing axes) and small translational misalignments (translations along the bushing\naxes). In mating, the two bushing axes are\nnominally perpendicular to each other and\nto the stroke axis.\nThe connector-mounting subassembly\nin the active member includes an inner\nhousing that is spring-loaded into nominal\nangular alignment. The activation cusp\n(the_shell of the active connector) and a\nconnector mount slide relative to each\nother along the stroke axis on linear bearings in the inner housing. These sliding\nmotions are coupled by a pai r of dual\nrack-and-pinion mechanisms such that\nwhen the activation cusp slides a given\ndistance in one direction, the connector\nmount slides twice that distance in the\nopposite direction.\nIn mating, the passive connector-mounting subassembly is pushed into the activation cusp until the lower edge of its connector shell makes contact with a shelflike\nedge inside the activation cusp. Thereafter,\nfurther pushing (downward in the figure)\ncauses the activation cusp to move downward and, via the rack-and-pinion coupling, causes the active connector mount\nto move upward at twice the speed of the\ndownward push . Thus, the connector in\nthe passive member (shown in dotted\nlines) is pushed upward to mate with the\nconnector (hidden in the figure) in the\npassive member, the speed of relative\nmotion between the two connectors along\n\nFor More Information Circle No. 544\n\n72\n\nNASA Tech Briefs.

Such a member\nacts like an ordinary structural member in\nthat it carries structural loads in the usual\nway, but in addition, it can be used to\nmeasure loads and to apply forces to\ncounteract undesi red vibrations. The use\nof active members in conjunction with\nelectronic control systems to suppress\nvibrations in large, flexible structures is a\nsubject of continuing research.\nIn vi bration testing of a structure, one\nseeks to identify its vibrational modes and\nthe parameters (frequencies, phases,\ndamping ratios, relative amplitudes at\nvarious positions) of those modes. If the\nstructure is sufficiently small, it can usually\nbe tested in a laboratory by use of external actuators. However, if the structure is\ntoo large to be tested in a laboratory, if tne\nvibrational modes that one seeks to suppress are not known accurately or change\nduring use or operation of the structure,\nif external actuators distort the vibrational\n\nmodes excessively, or if external actuators\ncannot be used for any other reason, then\nthe active members may be the best or\nonly actuators available.\nThe experiments were conducted on a\nsix-bay vertical truss structure about 6 ft\n(1 .8 m) tall cantilevered at its lower end\nfrom a heavy block. Weights were attached\nto the structure near the middle and at the\nupper end. \'!Wo longitudinal members and\none diagonal member near the lower end\nwere piezoelectric active members. The\ntruss was instrumented with accelerometers for measurement of the shapes of\nthe vibrational modes. In addition, load-cell\nand displacement measurements were\nmade at the active members. Sinusoidal\nvibrations were excited at various frequencies, and accelerational responses measured in the steady state to obtain data that\nwere then used to compute vibrationalresponse spectra. Several experiments\nwere conducted. In the first experiment,\nthe excitations were applied by an external electromecilanical shaker. In the following experiments, the excitations were\napplied via one active member at a time.\nA curve-fitting computer program was\nused to extract the frequencies, damping\nparameters, and shapes of the vibrational\nmodes from the vibrational-response spectra. A total of 10 global modes and 3 local\nmodes were obtained. The results indicate\nthat the accuracies of modal parameters\nobtained from active-member-excitation\ntests equal or exceed those obtained from\nexternal-excitation tests.\nThis work was done by Jay Chung Chen\nand James L.

Turbulent\nboundary-layer flows of this type occur\naround blades in turbomachinery, airfoils\ndownstream of propellers or canards, and\nother objects of importance in engineering. This study was motivated in large part\nby the fact that, generally, the most critical\nstage for the development of a boundary\nlayer occurs when it is exposed to a decelerating external free-stream flow and a\ncorresponding adverse pressure gradient.\n\nWhen the free-stream turbulence is small,\nan adverse pressure gradient can weaken\nthe boundary layer (as indicated by an\nincrease in the shape factor, H), leading\neventually to separation of the flow and\na corresponding loss of pressure if the\nflow is internal, or a loss of lift and increase\nin drag if the flow is external.\nIn the experiments, a flat plate on which\nboundary layers were to be formed was\nplaced in a wind tunnel. Rods were placed\nupstream of the plate to generate freestream turbulence in the wind-tunnel flow.\nTo obtain zero and various small adverse\ngradients of static pressure, the angle of\nincidence of the plate was set at angles\nof 0\xc2\xb0, 2.6\xc2\xb0, and 5.2\xc2\xb0. Static-pressure taps\nwere equally spaced along the centerline\nof the plate. Velocities near the surface of\nthe plate at various positions along lines\nperpendicular to the surface were measured by total-pressure probes. The velocity and the intensity of turbulence of the\nfree stream were measured with hot-wire\nanemometers.\nTraditionally, adverse pressure gradients\nhave been considered to weaken boundary layers and eventually lead to separations of flow. This traditional view is\ncorrect for boundary layers with low freestream turbulence. However, the results of\nthe experiments in this study show that in\na turbulent boundary layer under stronger\nexternal free-stream turbulence, improved\nmixing and more effective transmission\nof momentum from the free stream to the\nboundary layer occur when a mild adverse\ngradient of pressure exists, relative to the\nzero-pressure-gradient case with the same\nvalues of the total intensity and integral\nlength scale of the turbulence in the free\nstream. The shape factor of the boundary\nlayer was found to remain constant, within the limits of the uncertainty of the data,\nwith increasing Reynolds number based\non the momentum thickness of the boundary layer.\nTwo fluid mechanisms were concluded\nto be responsible for the improved mixing\nand corresponding stronger boundary\nlayers with lower shape factors.\n1. A reduction of the ratio (Ax/o) of the\nintegral scale (Ax) of free-stream turbulence to the thickness (o) of the boundary\nlayer generally occurs in the presence of\nan adverse gradient of pressure. This reduction in Ax/o is due primarily to the\nnatural increase in 0 that occurs as an\nadverse gradient of pressure increases\nfrom zero.\n2. Vortex stretching of the turbulent eddies\nin the free stream occurs in the presence\nof an adverse gradient of pressure, resulting in a higher vorticity and a corresponding augmentation of mixing.\nBoth of these mechanisms act to improve\nthe transmission of momentum from the free\nstream to the boundary layer.\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 1992\n\nThis work was done by J.

The approach taken\nin this study is based partly on the fracturemechanics concept that the higher the\nproof load a bolt survives, the smaller is\nthe largest flaw in the bolt and, therefore,\nthe longer will be its demonstrated cyclic\nfatigue life after the proof test. More specifically, the fatigue life of interest is that of a\nbolt that contains a flaw of such a size that\nthe bolt just barely survives the proof test.\nIn the experimental part of the study,\nbolts of various sizes were notched by\nelectrical-discharge machining and fatigueprecracked at the notches to obtain flaws\nof known size. The precracked bolts were\nsubjected to tensile proof tests by stretching them to various large fractions of their\ntested ultimate tensile strengths. The results of these tensile tests were analyzed\nto determine critical flaw sizes at proof test\nloads. The bolts that survived the proof\ntests were subjected to tensile cyclic fatigue tests until they failed.\nThe numerical results of these tests\nwere analyzed in terms of a hypothesized\nequation that expresses various power-law\nproportionalities describing the fatigue life\nof a proof-tested bolt, the size of the bolt,\nthe mean stress and the range of alternating stresses in the cyclic fatigue test,\nthe proof stress, and the ultimate tensile\nstrength of the bolt material. This equation was obtained by applying the multipleregression method to the fatigue lives\ncomputed by the NASA/FLAGRO computer program while varying one parameter at a time.\nThe conclusions drawn in the study are\nsummarized as follows:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Bolts can be qualified by proof testing at\n0.75 x [(average ultimate tensile strength\nminus one standard deviation) determined\nin prior tests].\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The hypothesized equation appears to be\nNASA Tech Briefs June 1992\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nvalid according to the limited test data\navailable thus far.\nGiven the same test conditions, stronger\nbolts have longer demonstrated fatigue\nlives.\nOf all of the parameters of the tests, the\nproof load affects the fatigue life most\nstrongly. Bolts tested at greater loads\nhave longer demonstrated fatigue lives.\nThe range of altemating stress in a fatigue\ntest strongly affects the fatigue life, while\nthe mean stress has a minor effect.\nGiven the same test conditions and loads\nscaled according to cross-sectional areas,\nlarger bolts have shorter fatigue lives.\nVariations in fatigue lives of bolts made\nfrom the same heat of steel are small,\n\nbut variations among bolts made from different heats are large.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The assumption that the ratio between\nthe proof load and the plastic-collapse\nload is constant, which assumption is invoked in interpreting the results of tests\nto determine critical flaw sizes, appears\nto be reasonable.\nThis work was done by Cheng H.

The gripper is\na prototype subsystem of a robotic cell that\nis intended to handle geranium cuttings in\na commercial greenhouse. The basic concept and design of the gripper could be\nmodified for handling other objects (e.g.,\nrods or nuts), including sorting the objects\naccording to size. The concept is also applicable to real-time measurement of the\nsize of an expanding or contracting part\ngripped by a constant force and to measurement of the size of a compliant part as\na function of the applied gripping force.\nThe gripper is mounted on an industrial\nrobot. The robot poSitions the gripper at\na fixed distance above the cutting to be\nprocessed. A vision system locates the\ncutting in the x-y plane lying on a conveyor\nbelt (see figure). The robot uses fiber-optic\nsensors in the fingertips of the gripper to\nlocate the cutting along the z axis. The\ngripper grasps the cutting under closedloop digital servo force control. The size\n(that is, the diameter of the stem) of the\ncutting is determined from the finger-position feedback, while the cutting is being\ngrasped under force control. The robot\ntransports the cutting to a scale for weighing, then to a trimming station, and finally\nto a potting station. In this manner, the cuttings are sorted according to weight,\nlength, and diameter.\nThe control subsystem includes a 32-bit\nminicomputer that processes the vision information and collects stem-grading data.\nThe minicomputer communicates with the\nrobot controller and the gripper-node control. The gripper-node control communicates with the scale. The robot controller\ncommunicates with the gripper-node controller via discrete input/output triggering\nof each of the gripper functions.\nThe gripper subsystem includes a PC\nAT-compatible industrial computer, a gripper mechanism actuated by two dc servomotors and with an integral load cell ,\ndiscrete input/output components, and two\nfiber-optic analog-output distance sensors.\nThe computer includes a discrete input/\noutput-circuit card, an eight-channel analog-to-digital converter circuit (A/D) card,\n76\n\nRobot Arm\n\nThe Robotic Gripper prepares to\ngrasp by closing part\nway in a positioncontrol mode, then\nclosing the rest of\nthe way in a forcecontrol mode once it\nsenses initial force\nof contact with the\nobject. Fiber-optic\nsensors in the fingertips help the robot\nand gripperto locate\nand identify the object.\n\nGripper\n\nz\n\n}-.\n\na motor-control circuit card with A/D components, two serial ports, and a 286 processor with coprocessor.\nA geranium cutting comprises a main\nstem and several petioles (tiny stems with\nleaves). The individual outputs from the\nfiber-optic sensors can be processed into\nan indication of whether a stem or a petiole is coming into view as the gripper encounters the cutting. Consequently, the\ngripper can be commanded to grasp a\nstem but not a petiole. The axial centerline of a stem can also be recognized from\nthe outputs of the fiber-optic sensors.\nUpon the recognition of a centerline, the\ngripper Signals the robot, and the robot\ncommands the gripper to close.\nThe motor-control circuit card supplies\nthe command signals to the amplifier that\ndrives the gripper motors. This card can\nbe operated as a position control with\ndigital position feedback or as a force control with analog force feedback from the\nload cell mounted in the gripper. A microprocessor is located on the motor-control\ncard. Buffered command programs are\ndownloaded from the computer to this\ncard for independent execution by the card.\nPrior to a controlled-force closure, the\n\n-\n\nMotion\n\nof Fingers\n\nmotor-control card controls the gripper in\nposition-servo mode until a specified force\nthreshold is sensed, indicating contact\nwith the cutting. Thereafter, the positionservo loop is opened, and the command\nSignal to the amplifier is calculated as the\ndifference between the force setpoint and\nthe force feedback from the load cell. This\ndifference is multiplied by a programmable\ngain value, then pulse-width-modulated\nwith programmable duty cycle of typically 20 percent. This technique provides integral stability to the force-control loop.\nThis force-control loop is bidirectional in\nthe sense that if the cutting expands between the fingertips, the ~;.,gers are made\nto separate, and if the cutting contracts,\nthe fingers are made to approach each\nother.\nThis work was done by James L.\nMontgomery of Martin Marietta Corp. for\nMarshall Space Flight Center.

This segmented ion-thrustor design\napproach enables the immediate development of 100-kW-ciass argon-ion engines for\noperation at a specific impulse of 100,000\nm/s. Several such segmented ion engines\nwould be used on a cargo vehicle to travel\nbetween the Earth and Mars.\nA combination of six 30-cm-diameter\nion chambers operating as a single engine\ncan convert over 100 kW of electrical input power to thrust at an efficiency of\ngreater than 70 percent using ion-thrustor\ncomponents that exist today. Each of the\nsix ion chambers would process one-sixth\nof the total input power and produce onesixth of the total 1.42 N thrust. The combined six-chamber engine would operate\nfrom a single power-processor unit, which\nprovides the currents and voltages required by the ion engine.\nThe segmented ion-thrustor design may,\nin some sense, be considered as the third\nstep in ion-engine evolution to higher power\nlevels. The lowest-power ion sources are\nmade with accelerator systems that consist of a single aperture. Space-charge effects limit the total current that can be extracted from this Single aperture for a given\napplied voltage; typical power levels are\ntens of watts. The second generation of\nion sources make use of multiple-aperture\naccelerator systems. The ion current per\naperture is still limited by space-charge effects, but multiple apertures are used to\nincrease the total ion current Significantly. For multiple-aperture grid systems, the\ntotal current is limited by the achievable\nspan-to-gap ratio (defined as the ratio between the ion-chamber diameter and the\ngrid-to-grid separation) and by the maximum electric field that can be sustained\nbetween the grids.\nThe third step makes use of a multiplegrid-sets power engine. Span-to-gap and\nelectric-field considerations still limit the\nion current per grid set, but multiple-grid\nsets are used to increase the total ion-beam\ncurrent significantly. This engine configuration is somewhat analogous to a multicylin77\n\nder automobile engine. An a~emate analogy\nis that of segmented mirrors used in the\ndevelopment of large optical telescopes.\nBenefits of the segmented ion-thrustor\ndesign approach include reduction in the\nrequired accelerator system span-to-gap\nratio for large-area engines, reduction in\nthe required hollow-cathode emission current, mitigation of the plasma-uniformity\nproblem associated with the development\nof large-area ion engines, increased tolerance to accelerator system faults, and reduction in the vacuum-system pumping\nspeed required for engine development\ntesting.\nThis work was done by John R.

The instability and internalfriction problems arise together because\na typical rotor is built of several parts that\nare shrink- and/or press-fit together; these\nparts can slide upon each other when the\nrotor operates at a speed and/or load great\nenough to excite bending-mode vibrations.\nThe theoretical part of this study involved the development of nonlinear\nmathematical models of internal friction in\nthree types of joints commonly found in\nmodern high-speed turbomachineryaxial splines, Curvic\xe2\x84\xa2 splines, and interference fits between smooth cylindrical\nsurfaces. The effects of speed, stiffnesses\nof bearings and jOints, external damping,\ntorque, and coefficient of friction in the joint\nwere evaluated. It was shown that a rotor\nthat turns at a speed above a critical speed\nfor bending exhibits unstable subsynchronous (at a frequency less than that of rotation) vibrations at the first natural bendingmode vibrational frequency of the rotor.\nThe experimental part of the study included (1) traction tests to determine the\ncoefficients of friction of various rotor\nalloys at various temperatures, with and\nwithout lubrication, and with various surface finishes; (2) bending-mode-vibration\ntests of shafts equipped with axial-spline,\nCurvicTM..spline, and interference-fit joints;\nand (3) rotordynamic tests of shafts with\naxial-spline and interference-fit joints. Under conditions similar to those in the turbopumps in the main engine of the Space\nShuttle, the coefficients of friction were approximately 0.2 in the presence of lubrication and 0.8 in the absence of lubrication.\nThe damping measured in the vibration\ntests increased with vibration amplitude\nin a manner that was not representative\nof either a linear-damper or a coulombfriction mathematical model.\nRotordynamic tests of an axial-spline\njoint under 5,000 Ib-in. (565 N-m) of static\ntorque revealed an extremely severe instability when the rotor was operated\nabove its first bending-mode natural frequency. The presence of this instability\nwas predicted by nonlinear rotordynamic\ntransient analysis, using one of the nonlinear mathematical models of internal friction mentioned above. The corresponding\nrotordynamic test of a shaft with an interference-fit jOint revealed subsynchronous vibrations at the first natural frequency.

Kennedy Space Center, Florida\nThe combination of a template and a routing tool are used\nto make precise, light cuts of ceramic tiles to final dimensions.\nSpecifically, the template guides the router along precisely\ndefined planes so that it accurately and uniformly shaves\nchamfers on the edges of the tiles.\nThe template consists of a plate, which contains the guide\ngroove, on a pair of irregularly shaped legs.

The routing tool,\nwhich includes an air-powered rotating bit, is inserted in the\ngroove and moved along the edge of the tile .

The\nseparation of the two representations\nwould also allow the sensing and motioncontrolling systems to operate asynchronously; this would facilitate the integration\nof new map and sensor data, as they become available, into the planning of motions.\nThe motioni>lanning representation INOUId\nbe a symbolic representation of the spatially continuous environment of the robot. It\n\n~\n\nwould consist of a set of abstractions (e.g.,\nslopes, roughnesses, locations and heights\nof obstacles, presence or absence of vegetation) that would be relevant to planning\nand controlling motions and that would be\nextracted from the map and sensor data\nreferred to the square map grid(s) of the\nterrain in the vicinity of the robot.\nThe data to be abstracted into the motion-planning representation would be\ntaken from those squares of the terrain grid\nthat lie within a "terrain port" - a round,\nrectangular, or otherwise-shaped area\ncentered on the grid square that represents the current location of the robot. The\nabstractions would consist of quantitative\nand qualitative spatial features called\n"primitive" and "composite" features.\nPrimitive spatial features (e.g., slopes or\nroughnesses) would be computed from\nthe terrain data by use of filtering functions\nand would be bound to the terrain port.\nComposite spatial features would be constructed from primitive spatial features\n\nand/or from other less-abstract composite\nspatial features and would not be bound\nto the terrain port. One example of a composite feature might be the best direction\nin which to escape in case of an emergency.\nFigure 2 illustrates in more detail how\nterrain-height data might be abstracted.\nFirst, these data could be sampled from\nthe grid cells along ribbons of terrain that\nare oriented in various directions and that\npass through the center of the terrain port.\nThe data on height vs. position along each\nribbon could then be processed in several\ndifferent ways: the standard deviation of\nheight could be computed to determine\nroughness, major changes in height could\nbe taken as indications of obstacles, and\na gradual change in height could indicate\nthat the robot is located on a hillside.\nThis vvork was done by Marc G.

The original intended application\nis the automatic identification of various\nminerals and rocks in a scene via recogni\xc2\xb7\ntion of spectral reflectance patterns in the\nscene as it is portrayed in 300 spectral\nbands between wavelengths of 0.5 and\n2.5 Itm. The underlying concept is clearly\napplicable, in general, to pattern\xc2\xb7classifi\xc2\xb7\ncation problems in which there is a need\nto reduce the amount of computation necessary to classify, identify, or match pat\xc2\xb7\nterns to the desired degree of resolution.\nThe spectral intensities in N spectral\nbands in a picture element or region of an\nimage are regarded as input vectors. The\nclassical method of matching such N-dimensional input data with a set of M\nknown patterns is by taking the inner product of each input vector with each of M\nnormalized vectors in memory that represent the known patterns. The highest inner product indicates the best match. An\nalgorithm that implements this method\nis called a "matched filter." Because a\nmatched filter serves, in effect, to test all\nknown possibilities, it entails a large amount\nof computation.\nThe purpose of the hierarchical pattern\nclassifier is to reduce the number of comparisons between input and memory vectors without reducing the detail of the final\nclassification . This is done by dividing the\nclassification process into a coarse-to-fine\nhierarchy (see Figure 1) that, in its simplest\nform, comprises a first "grouping" step\nand a second detailed classification step.\nIn preparation for the grouping step, the\nmemory vectors are collected into P\ngroups, within each of which the memory\nvectors are closer to each other than to\nmemory vectors in other groups. One\nmemory vector is chosen to represent\neach group (this vector could be, for example, an average of the vectors in the\ngroup).\nThen in the first step of the classification process, an input vector is compared\nwith each of the P representative vectors,\nand a base match is found. In the second\nstep, the input vector is compared with all\nof the memory vectors in the group represented by the best match. Because no\nattempt is made to match the input vector with the memory vectors in the other\ngroups, the amount of computation in the\nsecond step is considerably less than that\nof a classical matched filter.\nThe amount of computation can be reduced further by combining the initial\n84\n\nN-Dimensional\nril l \'-\'.IL._--- - --- Vector Space\nRepresentative\n\' - - - -----Vectors\n\nt+-----\n\nP Groups\n\nM Memory\nL.----Vectors\n\nFigure 1.

A Three-Layer Neural Network reduces the amount of computation further\nby reducing the number of vector dimensions in processing.\n\ngrouping with a reduction in the dimensionality of the vectors. The problem lies\nin determining which are the best dimensions to retain to ensure reliable classification . This problem is solved by implemen\xc2\xb7\nting the grouping step of the classification\nprocedure as a fully connected feedforward neural network of three layers (see\nFigure 2) (Note that this network is not integrated into the final hierarchical pattern\nclassifier but is used as an analytic tool\nto design the hierarchy). The number of\nnodes in the input layer equals the number\nof dimensions of an input vector. The middle (hidden) layer has fewer nodes. The\nnumber of nodes in the output layer equals\nthe number of memory vectors or output\nclasses, into one of which the input vector is to be classified. Each node in the\ninput and hidden layers is connected to\neach node in the hidden and output layers,\nrespectively, with a given connection weight.\n(The various connection weights typically\ndiffer from each other.)\nThe processing of an input vector involves setting a Signal at each hidden and\noutput node equal to the weighted sum of\nsignals from the input and hidden nodes,\nrespectively. At each hidden and output\n\nnode, a sigmoid function of the weighted\nsum is computed to drive the signal toward 0 or 1. When the neural network is\ndesigned and trained properly, the signal\nat the output node of the appropriate class\nis 1, while at the output nodes of the other\nclasses it is O.\nThe connection weights are set by a\ntraining procedure. A set of known vectors\nthat span the expected test space is put\nin, and connection weights are altered until\nthe output signals representative of the appropriate classes are obtained. During this\ntraining procedure, the nodes of the hidden layer often come to act as feature detectors in that they select, from the Ndimensional inputs, such fewer-<limensional features as maximums, minimums, and\nratios between values, which are important in distinguishing the desired classes.\nThese features may then be used as inputs to a reduced-<limensionality classifier.\nThis work was done by Gigi L Yates and\nSusan J.

June 1992\n\nUsing Derivatives of Higher Order in Sensitivity Analysis\nPrevious sensitivity analysis is extended to derivatives higher than first by a recursive method.\nLangley Research Center, Hampton, Virginia\nIn design of engineering systems, there\noften arise such "what if" questions as\n"What will be the change of the payload\nof an aircraft if the aspect ratio of its wing\nis increased or decreased by 10 percent?"\nAnswers to such questions are common\xc2\xb7\nIy sought by incrementing the pertinent\nvariable and reevaluating the major in\xc2\xb7\nvolved analyses. These analyses are con\xc2\xb7\ntributed by engineering disciplines that are\nusually coupled, as are the aerodynamics,\nstructures, and performance, in the con\xc2\xb7\ntext of the above question.\nThe "what if" questions can be answered\nexactly, without using the "increment-andreevaluate" approach and without finite differencing of the system analysis, by use\nof sensitivity analysis to calculate the first\nderivatives of the behaviors of coupled\nsystems with respect to design variables.\nQuite obviously, if the problem is strongly\nnonlinear, the efficiency of this methcx:lology\ncan be improved by making derivatives of\nsecond and possibly higher order available\nto search algorithms.\nA new method extends the algorithm of\na previous method to include the derivatives of the second and higher orders,\nagain, without finite differencing of the\nsystem analysis. The extension is effected\nby recursive application of the same implicit function theorem that underlies the\nprevious method. In the calculation of a\nmixed derivative of the N-th order with respect to a particular variable, the recursivity requires derivatives of the orders\nN -1 and lower with respect to the same\nvariable as prerequisites. On the other\nhand, because of the recursivity, the equations share the same matrix, so that one\nmust factor the matrix only once and can\nthereafter reuse the factored matrix when\nthe equations are solved one after another.\nEach solution, then, requires only a back\nsubstitution, a task ideally suited to the\nmodern vector and parallel-processor\ncomputers. The recursivity also becomes\nan advantage if there is only one variable\nwith respect to which the derivatives are\nto be taken . It occurs in searching design\nspace along a line defined by a search\ndirection, an operation that is a part of\nmany optimization algorithms. Accurate\nextrapolation based on derivatives of higher order may reduce the need for costly\nrepetitions of the system analysis in such\nan operation by widening the limits of\nmovement.\nThis capability to quantify the effects of\nproposed changes in engineering designs\ncan provide the basis for a mathematical\nmodel of design. It is useful in design calNASA Tech Briefs, June 1992\n\nculations for almost any system, including\nstructures, machines, and distribution networks.

I-AMAP is based\non the concept of frequency-division/derna.nd-assigned multiple access (FD/DAMA)\nin which, as its name suggests, the partition of the available spectrum is adapted\n\nto subscribers\' demands for service. IAMAP accommodates two types of service: closed-end, in which data are transmitted as " packet" messages of finite\nduration; and open-end, in which a channel between two subscribers is maintained\nuntil relinquished by the subscribers, as\nin a conventional telephone connection .\nIn the proposed first-generation MSATX system, 7 MHz of uplink spectrum and\n\n7 MHz of downlink spectrum are assumed.\nThe uplink band is at 1.65 GHz, and the\ndownlink is at 1.55 GHz. The system would\ninclude one or two geosynchronous relay\nsatellites, each with antennas aimed to\nprovide four partially overlapping beams\nthat cover the continental United States.\nBecause the two outermost beams would\nnot overlap, they could use the same frequencies. By use of a combination of steerable medium-gain antennas and different\npolarizations, ground stations could discriminate between the two satellites, thereby doubling the use of the same frequencies. Each beam would contain 465 uplink\nand 465 downlink channels, each channel 5 kHz wide. The theoretical maximum\nspectral efficiency of the proposed system\nwould be 1.28 bps/Hz in the one-satellite\ncase or 2.56 ~Hz in the two-satellite casr\nIn I-AMAp, each subscriber would issue\na request for open- or closed-end service\nto the network-management center. Requests for service would be processed, and\ncompeting requests would be resolved according to a channel-access protocol,\nwhich would be a random-access scheme\ncalled " modified Slotted ALOHA" or a freeaccess tree algorithm that was described\nin "Connection Protocol for MobilEl\'Satellite\nCommunications" (NPO-17735), NASA\nTech Briefs Vol. 14, No. 6 (June 1990), page\n91 .

It helps you\n\nby robots-some mathema ticians were\n\nun d e r-\n\nexplore and de-\n\nskeptical of something that might re-\n\ns tan d .\n\nvelop concepts,\n\nplace them. So when m y firm offered\n\nP e 0 pie\n\nby handling the\n\nan in-house training seminar on Mathe-\n\nrespond to a\n\ntedious details.\n\nmatica, I decided to see what all the talk\n\nIn that way,\nthan abstract equations, hand-\n\nyou\'re free to\n\nwaving, or scribbling on a\n\nwas about.\n\nconcentrate on\n\nblackboard. With Mathematica \'s\ngraphical capability, especially\nanimation, I can make a dynamic\n\nIntersection of fields of\nsweep of two sensors in\nthe shuttle payload bay.\n\npresentation that gives a concrete idea\nof what I\'m talking about.\n\nMathematica is available for: MS-DOS,\n\nThen there\'s the symbolic power.\n\nMicrosoft Windows, Macintosh , CONVEX,\n\nThat class was fun.

I solved it on my own\n\nIBM RISC System/6000 , MIPS, NeXT,\n\nMathematica syntax. I wanted to do ani-\n\nand then let Mathematica solve it.
