The three-dimensional arrangement of\nthe first alloy composition is infused with at least a second\nalloy composition, where the second alloy composition\ncomprises a shape memory alloy. The three-dimensional\narrangement is consolidated into a fully dense solid structure, and the original shape of the second alloy composition\nis set for reversible transformation. Strain is applied to the\nfully dense solid structure, which is treated with heat so that\nthe shape memory alloy composition becomes memory\nactivated to recover the original shape. An interwoven\ncomposite of the first alloy composition and the memoryactivated second alloy composition is thereby formed in the\nmultiple alloy composite structure.\n13 Claims, 8 Drawing Sheets\n\n300\n\n302\n\nCreate partlally enclosed box with\nsolid walls and internal open yell\nmetallic cellular structure\n\n304\n\nInfuse metallic cellular structure\nwith powder of at least one shape\nmemory alloy\n\n305\n\nSeal composite structure with a\ncover plate and consolidate to full\ndensity\n\n303\n\nAllow cooling of consolidated\ncomposite structure\n\n310 ---\n\n312 \xe2\x80\x94\n\nMechanically cold work\nconsolidated composite structure\n\nSubject consolidated composite\nstructure to shape recovery heat\ntreatment\n\nU.S. Patent\n\nSep.19,2017\n\nSheet 1 of 8\n\nUS 9,764,386 B2\n\nAUSTENITE\n\nHEATING\nw\nQ\nw\nw\n\nI\n\nCOOLING\nLOADING\n\nDEFORMED MARTENSITE\n\nTWINNED MARTENSITE\n\nLOAD\n\nFIG. 1\n\nU.S. Patent\n\nSep.19,2017\n\nUS 9,764,386 B2\n\nSheet 2 of 8\n\n200\nr\nJ\n\nELECTRON BEAM\nCOLUMN\nFILAMENT -\n\nASTIGMATISM LEN\nFOCUS\n\nDEFLECTION LENS\nHEART SHIELD-----\n\nVACUUM\nCHAMBER\nELECTRON BEAM\n\nPOWDER\nHOPPER\n\nRAKE-`\n\nPOWDER\nHOPPER\n\nr.1\n\nBUILD TANK\n\nPOWDER\nSTART PLATE\n\nBUILD PLA\'\n\nFIG. 2\n\nU.S. Patent\n\nSep. 19,2017\n\nSheet 3 of 8\n\nUS 9,764,386 B2\n\n300\n\n1\n\n302\n\nCreate partially enclosed box with\nsolid walls and internal open cell\nmetallic cellular structure\n\n3041 Infuse metallic cellular structure\nwith powder of at least one shape\nmemory alloy\n\n1\n\n306\n\nSeal composite structure with a\ncover plate and consolidate to full\ndensity\n\n308-1Allow cooling of consolidated\ncomposite structure\n\n1OR11\n\n312\n\nMechanically cold work\nconsolidated composite structure\n\nSubject consolidated composite\nstructure to shape recovery heat\ntreatment\n\nFIG. 3\n\n0\n\nPERIODIC\n\nal\nk\n\n00\n4-o\nO\n\nCD\nCD\n\nsr\n\nItIMPI11\n\nU.S. Patent\n\nSheet 6 of 8\n\nSep. 19,2017\n\nUS 9,764,386 B2\n\nTI-6A-4V WROUGHT COVER PLATE\na\n\nJ\n\ni\xe2\x80\xa2a-s\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2i-ar\n\nJ\nJ F\n\na\ni~fr\n\nF~\n\nt\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2a\xe2\x80\xa2r-:s\n\n`\n\nJ\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2rs\n\ner\nff\ni4f\n\ni\xe2\x80\xa2r-:\n\n<\ni 83 :S\n\nf\ni\n\ni\xe2\x80\xa2-\n\n1\n.\xe2\x80\xa2F\nFF\n\n4\nA\n\nJf\n\nr\n\nF~\n\nTi-6A-4V-SHAPE MEMORY\nALLOY COMPOSITE\n\nf/\n\na,\xe2\x80\xa2\nf/\nr~\n\nf\n\n~ fF.,y\n\nf ff\n\xe2\x80\xa2\' f\n\nf/ r\n\n--Ti-6A-4V EBM FABRICATED MATRIX\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2,\n\nff\nFF\nt\n\nF~\n\nF\nF\n\n11<\n1\n\n11\n\nI\n\n-MACHINING CUT LINE\n\n\'\n--` MACHINING CUT LINES\n\\\n\nDIRECTION OF CUT FOR\nCUT COMPLIANCE TESTING\n\nU.S. Patent\n\nSep.19,2017\n\nSheet 7 of 8\n\nUS 9,764,386 B2\n\nU.S. Patent\n\nSep.19,2017\n\nUS 9,764,386 B2\n\nSheet 8 of 8\n\n100\nCOMPOSITE\nTi-6AI-4V-SMA\nAREA\n\n80\n60\n40\nf\ncn\n\n20\n\nLu\n\n0\n\nJ\no\nLu\n0-1\n\n-20\nTOP SURF)\n-40\n-60\n-80\n-100 1\n0.00\n\n-o- SAMPLE A\n-fl- SAMPLE B\nSAMPLE C\n0.10\n\nBOTTOM SURFACE\n\n0.20\nDEPTH (in)\n\nFIG. 7\n\n0.30\n\n0.40\n\nUS 9,764,386 B2\n2\nFUNCTIONALLY GRADED METAL-METAL\nCOMPOSITE STRUCTURES\nCROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED\nAPPLICATIONS\nThis patent application claims the benefit of and priority\nto U.S. provisional patent application No. 61/869,297\nentitled "Functionally Graded Metal-Metal Composite\nStructures" filed on Aug. 23, 2013, the entire contents of\nwhich are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.\n\n5\n\n10\n\nSTATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY\nSPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT\n15\n\nThe invention described herein was made by an employee\nof the United States Government and may be manufactured\nand used by or for the Government of the United States of\nAmerica for governmental purposes without the payment of\nany royalties thereon or therefore.\n\n20\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\nFrom a broad perspective, monolithic metallic materials\noften suffer from the fact that they are monolithic. In order\nto improve the properties, alloying additions are made that\ncreate secondary phases and/or precipitate structures. These\nimprovements must occur during melt solidification and are\ngoverned by the thermodynamics of the process. That is,\noptimizing the microstructure is possible but only as much\nas thermodynamics allow.\nWhile various approaches for layering two-dimensional\nmaterials exist, their capabilities are typically limited and\nnon-isotropic. Further, while three-dimensional composites\nmay be formed with conventional powder metallurgy processes, it is generally very difficult to control the arrangement of the phases, for example due to randomness created\nby mixing powders.\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\nThe systems, methods, and devices ofthe various embodiments provide for creation of a multiple alloy composite\nstructure by forming a three-dimensional arrangement of a\nfirst alloy composition, infusing the three-dimensional\narrangement of the first alloy composition with at least a\nsecond alloy composition, and consolidating the three-dimensional arrangement into a fully dense solid structure, in\nwhich an original shape of the second alloy composition is\nset for reversible transformation.\nIn some embodiment systems, methods, and devices, the\nthree-dimensional arrangement ofthe first alloy composition\nhas a substantially open and continuous porosity. In some\nembodiment systems, methods and devices, the second alloy\ncomposition is a shape memory alloy. In some embodiment\nsystems, methods and devices, forming the three-dimensional arrangement of the first alloy composition is performed using additive manufacturing. In some embodiments, consolidating the three-dimensional arrangement\ninto a fully dense solid structure includes applying a first\nheat treatment comprising vacuum heat pressing, trimming\nthe multiple alloy composite structure to consistent dimensions using waterjet cutting, and applying a separate shape\nsetting heat treatment to the multiple alloy composite structure, in which the separate shape setting heat treatment\ncomprises heating the structure, for example to about 500\xc2\xb0\nC. for about 15 minutes.\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\nEmbodiment methods may also include mechanically\nworking the fully dense solid structure to alter the structural\narrangement of the infused three-dimensional arrangement,\nand treating the fully dense solid structure with heat such\nthat the shape memory alloy composition becomes memory\nactivated to recover the original shape, in which an interwoven composite of the first alloy composition and the\nmemory-activated second alloy composition is formed.\nThese and other features, advantages, and objects of the\npresent invention will be further understood and appreciated\nby those skilled in the art by reference to the following\nspecification, claims, and appended drawings.\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL\nVIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS\nThe accompanying drawings, which are incorporated\nherein and constitute part of this specification, illustrate\nexemplary embodiments of the invention, and together with\nthe general description given above and the detailed description given below, serve to explain the features of the\ninvention.\nFIG. 1 is a representative diagram of transitions between\ncrystal structures in shape memory alloys.\nFIG.2 is a schematic representation ofthe Arcam electron\nbeam powder bed additive manufacturing system.\nFIG. 3 is a process flow diagram illustrating an embodiment method of creating a multiple alloy composite structure with has a compressive residual stress field.\nFIG. 4A is a schematic representation of cut-away sections of open net structures having periodic and random test\ncoupon designs.\nFIG.4B is a side view of cross-sections of periodic design\nand random design test coupons fabricated using electron\nbeam melting.\nFIG. 5 is a schematic representation of a cross-section\nconfiguration of test coupons prepared for cut compliance\ntesting.\nFIG. 6 is a side view of three as-tested cut compliance\ncoupons that present different combinations of open net\nstructure designs and memory activation heat treatment.\nFIG. 7 is a graph illustrating residual stress results as a\nfunction of depth from the top surface of the cover plate\nstructure.\n\n45\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE\nINVENTION\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\nFor purposes of description herein, it is to be understood\nthat the specific devices and processes illustrated in the\nattached drawings, and described in the following specification, are simply exemplary embodiments of the inventive\nconcepts defined in the appended claims.

In block 302 of method 300, a partially enclosed\nbox with solid walls and an internal open cell metallic\ncellular structure (e.g., a foam structure, periodic structure,\netc.) may be created using additive manufacturing techniques. The metallic cellular structure(e.g., a foam structure,\nperiodic structure, etc.) may be a metal alloy primary phase,\nfor example, a titanium alloy or an aluminum alloy.\nIn block 304, the metallic cellular structure (e.g., a foam\nstructure, periodic structure, etc.) may be infused with a\npowder containing at least one shape memory alloy (e.g.,\nNitinol), thereby creating a co-continuous second phase in\nthe composite structure. In block 306, the composite structure may be sealed with a cover plate and consolidated to full\ndensity, thereby "setting" the shape memory alloy in an\noriginal shape (i.e., austenite structure) for later reversible\ntransformation. In some embodiments, the consolidation to\nfull density may be performed using hot isostatic pressing.\nIn an embodiment, the shape setting may include heating the\nstructure to various temperatures for various times, such as\nto about 500\xc2\xb0 C. for about 15 minutes. In an embodiment,\nthe shape setting heat treatment selected, the temperature of\nthe treatment, and the time of the treatment may be selected\nbased on the shape memory alloy selected, and different\nshape memory alloys may receive different shape setting\nheat treatments at different temperatures and/or for different\ntunes. For example, a nickel titanium composition may be\nheated to about 500\xc2\xb0 C. for about 15 minutes, while a\ndifferent composition may be heated to a higher or lower\ntemperature and/or for a shorter or longer time.\nIn block 308,the consolidated composite structure may be\nallowed to cool (e.g., transition to martensite twinned structure). In block 310,the composite structure may be mechanically cold worked through roiling such that the limit for\nrecoverable strain in the shape memory alloy is reached\n(e.g., about 8% plastic strain for Nitinol). In other words,\ndeformation to the composite structure may cause detwinning ofthe martensite structure. In block 312, the composite\nstructure may be subjected to shape recovery heat treatment,\nthereby causing the shape memory alloy to attempt to revert\nto the original shape that was set prior to rolling i.e.,\ntransition back to austenite structure). Since the shape\nmemory alloy may be constrained by the metal alloy primary phase, the resulting composite structure may be a\nlayered structure with outer walls formed by a solid monolithic metal alloy (e.g., titanium alloy), and an interior\nstructure tuned by an interwoven composite of the metal\nalloy (e.g., titanium alloy) and the shape memory alloy (e.g.,\nNitinol. In various embodiments, the multiple alloy composite structure created by method 300 may have a net\ncompressive residual stress field.\nBased on their advantageous qualities, the embodiment\nmultiple alloy composite structures may be used to form\nparts in a number of practical applications. One example\napplication may include use in pressure vessels (e.g. propellant tanks) that are subject to sustained unidirectional\npressure loads (i.e., hoop stresses) where the residual stress\nfield could reduce the overall net effective stress and allow\nthe tank to be either thinner or carry higher pressure.\nAnother example application may include improving the\nfatigue performance of structural aerospace components\nthrough crack closure and/or turning. Other example applications may include uses for ballistic impact resistant structures, such as micrometeoroid protection is space habitats,\nprotective vehicle/personnel armor, etc.\nAdditionally, the various embodiments of the multiple\nalloy composite structures may be used for various acoustic\n\napplications. In particular, transmission of sound through a\nstructure is based on the acoustic impedance of that particular material. Since monolithic materials have unique and\nwell defined acoustic impedances, in various embodiments\na tailored structure may be created that uses a combination\nof materials with very different impedance and at the same\ntime arranges these materials in a manner that results in\nacoustic attenuation. The various embodiment structures\nmay be used for limiting sound transmission into the cabin\nand in other applications where quieter acoustics are important (naval propellers, etc).\nFurther variations of the embodiment methods may be\nused to create composite structures of other materials,\nincluding metallic glass alloys.\nThe various embodiments may be understood by reference to the following non-limiting example, which is provided by way of illustration.\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\nEXAMPLE\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n4o\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n6o\n\n65\n\nAn Arcam electron beam melting(EBM)additive manufacturing machine at the WM.

The\nperiodic structure was designed using a three-dimensional\ncomputer-aided design(CAD)modeling program, while the\nrandom structure was reverse-engineered using X-ray computed tomography from a piece ofeast aluminum foam.

The coupons were 1.18 inches wide by 3.90\ninches long by 0.48 inch thick, with net structure areas of\napproximately 0.60 inch wide by 2.35 inches long by 0.20\ninch thick.\nThe open cell net structure area of the coupons was filled\nwith Nitinol shape memory alloy(SMA)powder. The SMA\npowder was 54.6 wt% Ni and 45.4 wt% Ti. The mesh size\nused was \xe2\x80\x94140. The powder was poured into the void area\nin the net structure scaffolding and vibrated for a period of\n15 minutes such that the powder could achieve peak tap\ndensity. A piece of wrought Ti-6A1-4V alloy plate (about\n1.17 inches wide by about 3.90 inches long by about 0.22\ninch thick) was then used to cover the top surface of the\ncoupon and the entire structure was vacuum hot pressed at\n930\xc2\xb0 C. for 4 hours at 1,000 psi.\nOne of the hot pressed samples was examined via X-radiography in order to confirm that the filling and consolidation procedure yielded a void-free structure (>99% density).\nThe samples were machined using traditional milling\ntechniques to achieve a final sample width of 0.61 inch and\na final thickness of 0.53 inch.
