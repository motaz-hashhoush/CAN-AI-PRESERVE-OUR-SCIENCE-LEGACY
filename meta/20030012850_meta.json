Today, as defense secretary for President George W. Bush, Rumsfeld is the most senior appointee to hold that post. Between political assignments, he became an expert at turning around troubled corporations. His work at G.D. Searle-now a subsidiary of Pharmacia-earned him awards as an outstanding chief executive officer in the pharmaceutical industry. Rumsfeld's management philosophy is unique and direct, and the best part is he's written it down. While serving in the Ford administration, Rumsfeld wrote a white paper titled Rumsfeld's Rules. These rules were written as guiding principles for White House staff. First published in 1980, the rules were revised and expanded in 2001 to include broader insights on management, work and leadership. They reflect more than 40 years of Rumsfeld's wisdom and experience.", "title": "Pragmatic Leadership Advice from Donald Rumsfeld", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-21T01:08:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20030012850, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Teany, Douglas R."}, "organization": {"name": "Teany (Douglas R.)", "location": "Indianapolis, IN United States"}}, "id": "ecb9bea78ddb4ddfb45b40912ce89178"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-03-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20030012850, "publications": [{"volume": "10", "submissionId": 20030012850, "id": "e02cc11e9fc64b48b20f019912db6f50", "publicationName": "ASK Magazine", "publicationDate": "2003-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20030012841, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "ASK Magazine", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20030012850.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20030012850/downloads/20030012850.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20030012850/downloads/20030012850.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20030012850/downloads/20030012850.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
