b'Pipe Line Control The array of tanks, pipes and\nvalves in the photo below is a petroleum tank\nfarm in Georgia, part of a petrochemical pipe\nline system that moves refined petroleum\nproducts from Texas and Louisiana to the\nmid-Eastern seaboard.\nThe same pipes handle a number of different products, such as gasoline, kerosene, jet\nfuel or fuel oil. The fluids are temporarily stored\nin tanks, pumped into the pipes in turn and\nrouted to other way stations along the pipe line.\nThe complex job of controlling, measuring and\nmonitoring fuel flow is accomplished automatically by a computerized control and communications system which incorporates multiple\nspace technologies.\nDeveloped by SCI Systems, Inc., Huntsville,\nAlabama, the pipe line\'s brain is known as the\nRemote Data Acquisition Control System II\n(RDACS 11). A departure point for its development was .SCl\'s Remote Automatic Calibration\nSystem, which provided measurements used to\ncalibrate telemetry equipment in the Saturn\nlaunch vehicles that boosted NASA\'s Apollo\nspacecraft. Digital data transfer techniques\ndeveloped by SCI for NASA\'s S ~ a c e\nShuttle are\nalso incorpoiated in RDACS II, as is spacederived "redundancy managementw-automatic\ntakeover by a backup system when a primary\nunit malfunctions.\n\nThe RDACS II shown in the small photo is\none of six located at hub control centers along\nthe pipe line. A seventh at Atlanta, Georgia\n-called the "granddaddyM-oversees the operation of the other six. Collectively, the RDACS\ncontrol the entire fuel-movement function: turning valves to feed fuel from tanks into the line,\nchecking to make sure that the proper valves\nare open or closed, measuring fuel flow, assuring maximum efficiency of the pumping equipment, and generally monitoring the progress of\nthe fluids in the pipe line to make sure that the\nright amount of the right fuel gets to the proper\ndestination.\n\n'
