For part of the\ninvestigation of the engine speed decay characteristics, an accessory\nload. was used on the engine. The accessory load was approximately constant at 7.8 horsepower for engine speeds above 4000 rpm and decreased\nwith decreasing engine speed. An analysis of the engine speed decay\ndata was made and engine speed decay rates were determined for several\nhypothetical accessory load conditions.\nCorrected steady -state engine windmilling drag and speed without\nan accessory load are presented as a function of flight Mach number.\nThe effect of higher alt itudes was to increase the time re~uired\nfor the engine speed to decay from the initial speed to the steadystate engine windmilling speed, while the effect of increasing flight\nMach number was to decrease the time re~uired.\nAt an altitude of 5000 feet and a flight Mach number of 0 . 27, an\naccessory load of the magnitude used in this investigation had negligible effect on the engine speed decay characteristics. At 40,000 feet,\na maximum difference of 500 rpm occurred in the engine speed range\nnear 2000 rpm.\nAnalysis of the engine speed decay data with hypothetical accessory\nloads from\nto 40 horsepower at altitudes of 5000 and 40,000 feet and\nwith a flight Mach number of 0.27 indicated that the engine decelerates\nmore rapidly at 5000 feet altitude than at 40,000 feet when the engine\nspeed is over 3000 r pm. At engine speeds below 2000 rpm the deceleration is more rapid at 40,000 feet. Under steady-state windmilling\nconditions, greater accessory power may be extracted fr om the engine\nat 5000 than at 40,000 feet altitude.\n\n\xc2\xb0\n\nNACA RM E51I06\n\n2\n\nINTRODUCTION\nAs part of an over-all investigation of the performance and opera-\n\ntional characteristics of a J34-WE-32 turbojet engine in the NACA Lewis\naltitude wind tunnel~ a brief study was made of the steady-state engine\nwindmilling characteristics and engine speed decay characteristics (the\nrate of engine speed decay occurring after fuel cut-off).\nThere is a trend in modern aircraft design to depend increasingly\non accessory power for safe flight. In the event of combustion blowout or other engine failure, the time sufficient power is available for\nrapid, sure operation of landing gear, flaps, control power boost, etc . ,\nmay be critical. Consideration is given herein to the problem of\navailable duration of auxiliary power obtained from engine driven accessories in the event of combustion blow-out or other engine failure. The\ntime, following blow-out, in which the pilot has a chance to restart the\nengine is also indicated. The steady-state engine windmilling characteristics were obtained only for the condition of no accessory load.\nThe engine speed decay characteristics were obtained with and without\nan accessory load. Typical windmilling accessory power re~uirements\nfor a modern fighter type airplane are of the order of 20 horsepower at\n4000 rpm and 5 horsepower at 2000 rpm. However, the accessory load\navailable for this investigation was limited to 7.8 horsepower at\n4000 rpm, and it decreased to zero at about 1000 rpm. An analysis was\ntherefore made which extends the experimental speed decay data to\nhigher accessory loads.\nData are presented herein to show the effects of altitude from 5000\nto 50,000 feet and flight Mach numbers from 0.19 to 1.06 on the steadystate engine windmilling characteristics. Also presented are the effects\nof altitude from 5000 to 40,000 feet, flight Mach number from 0.27 to\n0.7, and, to a limited extent, an accessory load on the engine speed\ndecay characteristics.\nDESCRIPTION OF APPARATUS\nThe J 34 -WE-3 2 turbojet engine (fig. 1) used in this investigation\nhad a static sea-level rating of 3370 pounds thrust at an engine speed\nof 12,500 rpm and an exhaust gas temperature of 1280 0 F. Main components of the engine included an eleven-stage axial -flow compressor, an\nannular direct-flow combustor, two-stage turbine, diffuser, afterburner,\nvariable -area exhaust nozzle, and integrated electronic control.\nTo simulate an accessory load, a generator was installed on the\nengine. The generator was loaded by passing the output current through\na resistor of approximately 0.141 ohms. Accessory horsepower was then\ndetermined from the following e~uation :\n\n. ~-- ~~-~~\n\n---\n\nNACA RM E51I06\n\n3\n\nAccessory horsepower\n\n= [Generator\n\nvOltage]2\n( 0.141)(746)\n\nThe generat or voltage regulator maintained approximately constant voltage\n( and therefor e power) at engine speeds above 4000 rpm. At engine speeds\nbelow 4000 rpm, the voltage d ecreased with engine speed. Because the\ngenerator was designed for use on an engine of lower rated speed, a continuous operation of the engine at engine speeds above 8000 rpm was not\npossible.\nThe engine was mounted on a wing in the test section of the altitude\nwind tunnel (fig . 1) . Dry refrigerated air was supplied to the engine\nthrough a t unne l make-up air system. The air, approximately at sea - level\npressure at the entrance of the make-up air s ystem, was thrott led to a\npressure at the engine inlet corresponding to the desired flight conditions . Engine inlet temperatures correspond to NACA standard altit ude\nconditions except for conditions re~uiring temperatures below -20 0 F ,\nwhich could not be obtained .\nTo record the transient condition of the engine during an engine\nspeed decay run, oscillograph instruments were used to record engine\nspeed, indi cated a ir s peed, and accessory generator voltage. Convent i onal forms of instrumentation were also used t o calibrate the oscillo graph data and to determine the steady -state engine windmilli ng\nperformance (f i g . 2 ).\nA list of the symbols and methods of calculations used in this\nreport are presented in appendixes A and B, respectively.\nPROCEDURE\n\nThe steady -stat e engine wi ndmilling data were obtained without the\naccessory load at al t itudes from 5000 to 50,000 feet and over a range of\nf l ight Mach numb ers from 0.19 to 1 . 06.\nAll engine speed decay data were obtained by simula ting combust or\nb l ow - out by clos i ng a solenoid operated valve in the engine fuel l i ne ,\nwhen the engine was in steady -state operation. Because of the accessory\ndesign limit ation, as mentioned earlier, an initial engine speed of\napproximate l y 8000 rpm was used for the main portion of the engine s peed\ndecay runs. Data were taken at altitudes of 5000, 10,000, and 40,000 fe et\nat sever al fli ght Mach numbers, with and without an accessory load. The\nonly d ata obtained with an initial engine speed of 12,000 rpm were t aken\nat an altitude of 5000 feet and a flight Mach number of 0. 27, with and\nwithout an acc essory load .\n\nl\nNACA RM E51I06\n\n4\n\nI\n\nBecause of the nature of the test equipment used, it was impossible\nto prevent small variation in engine inlet pressure during an engin~\nspeed decay run. However, an investigation of the data indicated that\nthe effect of the variation of engine inlet pressure from the desired\nvalue was negligible. Because of the large volume of the wind tunnel,\nthe tunnel static pressure remained approximately constant during an\nengine speed decay run.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nSteady -State Engine Wiruimilling Characteristics\nThe corrected steady-state engine windmilling drag and speed,\nwithout an accessory load, are presented as functions of flight Mach\nnumber in figures 3 and 4, respectively. Changes in altitude did not\naffect corrected steady-state engine windmilling drag up to a flight\nMach number of approximately 0.5j however, for flight Mach numbers\nabove 0.5, the corrected steady-state engine windmilling drag decreased\nslightly as the altitude was increased above 25,000 feet. The corrected\nsteady-state engine wiruimilling drag at altitudes up to 25 ,000 feet\nvaried from 0.6 percent of the rated static sea-level engine thrust at\na flight Mach number of 0.2 to 25.8 percent at a flight Mach number of\n0.95. The variation of corrected steady-state engine windmilling speed\nwith flight Mach number (fig. 4) was sufficiently small that data for\naltitudes from 5000 to 25,000 feet could be represented by a single\ncurve. Above 25,000 feet, the corrected steady-state engine windmilling\nspeed decreased as the altitude was increased . For altitudes up to\n25,000 feet, the corrected steady-state engine windmilling speeds for\nflight Mach numbers of 0.2 and 0.95 were 1150 and 6950 rpm, respectively.\nEngine Speed Decay\nTypical oscillograph traces for an engine speed decay run with an\naccessory load are shown in figure 5. The extent of the indicated air\nspeed variations is typical of all the runs which were made from an\ninitial engine speed of approximately 8000 rpm.\nData from similar oscillograph traces were transferred into a more\nconvenient form and have been combined to show the effects of altitude,\nflight Mach number, and accessory load on engine speed decay in figures 6, 7, and 8, respectively.\nEffect of altitude . - The rate of engine speed decay is dependent\non : (1) the inertia of the rotating elements, (2) ram energy of the\nincoming air into the engine inlet, (3) mechanical friction of the\nrotating parts, and (4) internal aerodynamic friction of the engine.\n\nto\n\nm\n\n(\\J\n(\\J\n\nNACA RM E51I06\n\n5\n\nAs altitude is increased, the inertia and mechanical friction of the\n\nrotating parts remain essentially constant, while the magnitudes of the\nram energy of the incoming air and the internal aerodynamic friction of\nthe engine decrease. The effect on the rate of engine speed decay, of\nincreasing altitude at a flight Mach number of 0.27 is shown in figure 6.\nThe time re~uired for engine speed to decay from approximately 8000 rpm\nto 2000 rpm increased from 16 seconds at 500\'0 feet to 43 seconds at\n40,000 feet. Therefore it is evident that the difference between the\ninternal aerodynamic friction of the engine and the energy of the ram\nair is greater at low than at high altitude. Extrapolation of the speed\ndecay curves to an initial speed of 12,000 rpm indicates that deceleration from 12,000 to 8000 rpm would occur in approximately 2 seconds at\nan altitude of 5000 feet and in about 4 to 6 seconds at an altitude of\n40,000 feet. Thus the speed decay time from 12,000 to 2000 rpm would be\nincreased from 18 seconds at 5000 feet to about 48 seconds at 40,000 feet.\nEffect of flight Mach number. - From figure 7, it is seen that speed\ndecay rates between engine speeds of 8000 and 6000 rpm were not appreciably\naffected by flight Mach number at any altitude within the range investigated. The probable reason is that at high engine speeds the rotor\ninertia is high as compared to the friction losses and ram energy of the\ninlet air stream. At engine speeds below 6000 rpm, the rate of speed\ndecay decreased with an increase in flight Mach number. However, .because\nthe difference between the initial engine speed and steady-state engine\nwindmilling speed decreased with increasing flight Mach number, the\neffect of increasing flight Mach number was to decrease the time re~uired\nfor the engine speed to decay from the initial speed to the steady-state\nengine windmilling speed. At 10,000 feet the time required for the engine\nspeed to decay from the initial speed to the steady-state windmilling\nspeed was decreased from 48 to 19 seconds by increasing flight Mach\nnumber from 0.27 to 0.7. At 40,000 feet, the time decreased from 84 to\n58 seconds when flight Mach number was increased from 0.27 to 0.53.\nEffect of accessory load. - The expected effect of adding an\naccessory load to an engine is to increase the speed decay rate. However, in this investigation, the magnitude of the accessory load was\nsmall (7.8 hp for engine speeds above 4000 rpm and decreasing with\nspeed at lower speeds) ~ compared to the other forces acting on the\nengine during a speed decay, particularly at the higher\nspeeds. Consequently, at 5000 feet altitude, the load and no-load speed\ndecay curves shown in figure 8 are coincident, while at 40,000 feet the\nmaximum difference between the two conditions was about 500 rpm, and this\noccurred in the range of engine speeds near 2000 rpm. The accessory load\nat 40,000 feet altitude had decreased to approximately one horsepower at\nan engine speed of 2000 rpm. I f loads of the order of one or two horsepower had been maintained at speeds lower th~ 2000 rpm, it is possible\nthat the decay curves would have been affected considerably in this speed\nrange.\n\n6\n\nNACA RM E51I06\nAnalysis of Engine Speed Decay Data\n\nBecause of the previously mentioned limitations of the power\nextraction device, the effect of larger or more representative accessory loads on engine speed decay characteristics (particularly near\nthe steady-state windmilling speed) were not defined. Conse~uently,\n~ analysis was made and speed decay rates were determined for several\nhypothetical load conditions. Experimental data were used to determine\nslopes of decay curves and were applied in the analysis. No attempt\nwas made to extend this analysis for engine speeds below the steadYstate engine windmilling speed obtained with no accessory load, because\nexperimental data showing the effect of accessory load on steady-state\nengine wiruimilling speed were not obtained. A more complete description\nof the analysis is given in appendix B.\nThe results of the analysis, in which constant hypothetical accessory loads of 5, 10, 20, and 40 horsepower were imposed on the engine\nduring an engine speed decay, are presented in figure 9. For engine\nspeeds over 3000 rpm, the slopes of the speed decay curves, with any\ngiven accessory load, are greater at 5000 than at 40,000 feet altitude.\nAs speed decreases below 2000 rpm the slopes of the curves for 40,000\nfeet become steeper than those for 5000 feet. Extrapolation indicates\nthat accessory loads of the order of 5 horsepower might stop che engine\nat 40,000 feet altitude while it may be possible to attain steady-state\nwiruimilling with loads as high as 10 horsepower at 5000 feet altitude.\nSince rotor inertia and mechanical friction are independent of altitude, the differences between the constant accessory load curves for\n5000 and 40,000 feet in figure 9 must be due to the relative values of\ninternal aerodynamic drag and the energy of the ram air (see section\nentitled "Effect of altitude"). Ram energy is independent of engine\nspeed, but aerodynamic drag increases with engine speed . Conse~uently,\nat high engine speeds, the aerodynamic drag is considerably larger than\nthe ram energy . Then, since both ram energy and aerodynamic drag are\ndecreased when altitude is increased and since \xc2\xa3he aerodynamic drag is\nlarger than the ram energy, the engine decelerates more rapidly at low\nthan at high altitude. As engine speed is decreased, however, the\naerodynamic drag becomes less than the ram energy with the result that\nmore power may be extracted from the engine at low altitude than at\nhigh without stopping the engine .\nSUMMARY OF RESULTS\n1. The corrected steady - state engine windmilling drag, without an\naccessory load and at altitudes up to 25,000 feet, varied from 0 . 6 per cent of the rated static sea -level engine thrust at a flight Mach number\nof 0 . 2 to 25.8 percent at a flight Mach number of 0.95 . The corresponding\nvariation in corrected steady - state engine i-lindmilling speed was from\n1150 to 6950 rpm.\n\nN\nN\nt!)\n\nO\'l\n\nJ\n\nI\n\n(\n\nJ\n\nI\n\nI\nj\n\nI\nj\n\nNACA RM E51I06\n\n~\n\n7\n\n2. At altitudes of 5000 and 40,000 feet and without an accessory\nload, the time required for the engine speed to decay from the initial\nspeed of 8000 rpm to 2000 rpm was 16 and 43 seconds, respectiyely. At\nan altitude of 10,000 feet, increasing flight Mach number from 0.27 to\n0.7 decreased the time required for the engine speed to decay from the\ninitial speed of 8000 rpm to the steady-state engine windmilling speed\nfrom 48 to 19 seconds. At an altitude of 40,000 feet, increasing flight\nMach numbers from 0.27 to 0.53 reduced the speed decay time from 84 to\n58 seconds.\n\n<D\n\nO\'l\n\n3. At an altitude of 5000 feet, the engine speed decay rates with\nand without an accessory load were equal, wh ile at 40,000 feet a maximum\ndifference of 500 rpm occurred between the two conditions in the engine\nspeed range near 2000 rpm.\n4. Analysis of the data at a flight Mach number of 0.27 and for\nthe engine speed decay range between 8000 rpm and no-load steady-state\nengine windmilling speed indicates that with any giyen accessory load\nand with engine speeds oyer 3000 rpm the engine decelerates more\nrapidly at 5000 feet than at 40,000 feet altitude . With engine speeds\nbelow 2000 rpm the deceleration is more rapid at 40,000 feet. It is\npossible that a 5-horsepower load would completely stop the rotor at\n40,000 feet, but at 5000 feet a steady-state windmilling condition\nmight be achieyed with a load as high as 10 horsepower.\nLewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory\nNational Adyisory Committ ee for Aeronautics\nCleyeland, Ohio\n\n8\n\nNACA RM E51I06\n\nAPPENDIX A\n\nSYMBOLS\n\nThe following symbols are used in this report:\nDw\n\nengine windmilling drag, lb\n\ng\n\nacceleration due to gravity, 32.2 ft/sec 2\n\nI\n\nmoment of inertia, lb-ft-sec 2\n\nMO\n\nflight Mach number\n\nN\n\nengine speed, rpm\n\nP\n\ntotal pressure, lb/sq ft absolute\n\np\n\nstatic pressure, lb/sq ft absolute\n\nQ\n\ntorque, lb-ft\n\nR\n\ngas constant, 53.3 ft-lb/(lb) (OR)\n\nT\n\ntotal temperature, OR\n\nte\n\nequivalent ambient static temperature, ~\n\nV\n\nvelocity, ft/sec\n\nwa\n\nair flow, lb/sec\n\n~\n\nangular deceleration, radians/sec\n\ny\n\nratio of specific heats\n\n~\n\nsmall increment\n\n50\n\nratio of absolute tunnel static pressure, PO \' to absolute static\npressure of NACA standard atmosphere at sea level\n\neO\n\nr atio of absolute equivalent ambient static temperature, t e , to\nabsolute static temperature of NACA standard atmosphere at\nsea level\n\nCD\n\n(J)\n\nN\nN\n\n2\n\nN\n\nNACA RM E51I06\nSubscripts:\n0\n1\n\n(j)\n(j)\n\nengine inlet\n\n7\n[\\)\n[\\)\n\nfree -a ir s tream.\n\nexhaust- no zzle i nlet\n\nj\n\njet\n\n9\n\n-~--\n\n-- - -\n\n10\n\nNACA EM E51I06\n\nAPPENDIX B\n\nMETHOD OF CALCULATIONS\nFlight Mach number. - In calculating flight Mach number, complete\nram pressure recovery at the engine inlet was assumed and the following\nformula was used:\n\nEquivalent ambient - air temperature. - Equivalent ambient-air\ntemperature was determined from the following expression:\n\nte\n\n=\n\nfp o)7\nTl\\P\nl\n\nsteady-state engine windmilling drag.\nwas calculated by the following equations:\nD\n\nw\n\nwa\n\n= -g\n\nThe engine windmilling drag\n\n(V -V )\n\n0\n\nj\n\nwhere\n\nand\n\nDuring an engine speed decay, the aerodynamic and mechanical\nfriction forces tend to decelerate the engine, while the force due to\nthe ram energy of the incoming air tends to acc elerate the engine.\nThese forces are reflected in the engine as torques.
