Their magnificent new Pontiac Stadium has a domed, air-supported, fabric roof that admits light but protects the playing field and patrons from the elements. The 80,000-seat Silverdome is the world s largest fabric-covered structure-and aerospace technology played an important part in its construction. The key to economical construction of the Silverdome--and many other types of buildings--is a spinoff of fiber glass Beta yarn coated with Teflon TFE fluorocarbon resin. The big advance it offers is permanency.The team of DuPont, Chemical Fabrics and Birdair have collaborated on a number of fabric structures. Some are supported by air pressure, others by cables alone. Most of the structures are in the recreational category. With conventional construction costs still on the upswing, you're likely to see a great many more permanent facilities enclosed by the aerospace spinoff fabric.", "title": "A Roof for the Lions' House", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T11:36:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20040071140, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20040071140, "id": "5565936342904697a0722f62bdf05e38", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1978", "publicationDate": "1978-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20040071140.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20040071140/downloads/20040071140.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20040071140/downloads/20040071140.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20040071140/downloads/20040071140.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
