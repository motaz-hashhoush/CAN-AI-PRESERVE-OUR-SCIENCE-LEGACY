b'Consumer, Home and Recreation\n\nWater Purifier\n\nelow is the Floatrona water purifier, a\nproduct that combines two space technologies: NASA ionization technology\nfor water purification and solar\nelectric power generation. Marketed by\nFloatron Inc., Phoenix, Anzona, the\nFloatron device measures only 12 inches in\ndiameter but it can purify a swimming pool,\npond, fountain or\nother water container holding up\nto 50,000 gallons.\nFloatron\n?rovides an alterna:ive to chemical\nzontrol of algae\nand bacteria\nthrough a process\n\nB\n\ndeveloped by NASA for purifying water\naboard manned spacecraft (see page 110).\nThe process involves introduction to the\nwater of ionized minerals that kill microorganisms, such as algae and bacteria.\nIn use, the unit floats on the water,\nits solar panel (below) collecting sunlight\nthat is converted directly to electricity. The\nharmless, low power current thus generated\nenergizes a specially alloyed mineral electrode below the waterline and causes release\nof metallic ions into the water.\nFloatron costs nothing to operate.\nThe only part requiring replacement is the\nelectrode, which has a service life of approximately two years and can be changed in\none minute.\nFloatron-purified water falls within\ndrinking water standards established by the\nEnvironmental Protection Agency.\nAdditionally, the water remains clear and\nstable for extended periods because the\nminerals do not evaporate.\n"Floatron is a registered trademark of Floatron Inc.\n\n'
