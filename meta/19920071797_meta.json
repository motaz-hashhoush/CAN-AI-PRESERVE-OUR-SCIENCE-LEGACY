Of the 22 variables observed, TiO absorption was detected in eight, and 10 variables displayed hydrogen-line emission at some phase. Spectral classifications were assigned relative to the MK process. Color excesses were determined for those variables for which spectroscopic and photometric data were obtained within a few days of each other. The spectra obtained at a resolution of 2.5 A were fitted with synthetic spectra to determine the stellar atmospheric parameters. The range in metallicity among the variables was found to be quite extensive, -0.3 to -0.7, and may reflect a mixture of stellar populations or masses.", "title": "The metallicity and luminosity of RV Tauri variables from medium-resolution spectra", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-15T16:39:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19920071797, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Wahlgren, Glenn M."}, "organization": {"name": "Ohio State University, Columbus; Computer Sciences Corp.; NASA, Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD, United States"}}, "id": "6bb5671a44bb4447a90f801779bdfa25"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19920071797, "sourceIdentifiers": [{"number": "doi:10.1086/116306", "type": "DOI"}], "publications": [{"volume": "104", "submissionId": 19920071797, "issue": "3, Se", "issn": "0004-6256", "id": "51bf85d439c244d6b329fc6c7bfbc8bd", "publicationName": "Astronomical Journal", "publicationDate": "1992-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
