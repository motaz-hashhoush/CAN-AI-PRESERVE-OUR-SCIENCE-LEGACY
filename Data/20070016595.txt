Indeed, the same principles of physics apply to SST-rainfall\nrelationships on monthly to seasonal as well as interannual time-scales. However, distinguishing\namong remote and local SST influences remains a challenging problem. Scores of scientists have\ndealt with the problem by categorizing data andor analyzing specific situations but without a\ngeneral methodology for distinguishing among them analytically. By running 2-10 year\natmospheric model integrations with two different SST-datasets with a General Circulation\nModel (GCM), we simulated enough data to attack the problem from \xe2\x80\x9cfxst principles\xe2\x80\x9d. In sorting\nthe data by SST bins, we discovered: i) evaporation, vertical velocity, and precipitation were\nvery robust and remarkably similar for both simulations; ii) the evaporation increased almost\nlinearly with SST up to about 27OC where after it leveled off, while the precipitation did not; iii)\nfor almost all SST bins, precipitation correlated much better with the vertical velocity suggesting\nthe influential role of dynamical circulation in addition to SSTs.\nMathematically, the analysis of influence of small perturbations to forcing fields on an.\noutput field is well developed. With modern computers, one could use as many fields as\nphysically conceivable and let the perturbation analysis sort out the important ones among them\nfor the problem on hand; however, such an exercise will-be prohibitively complex. Alternatively,\n.\n\none can use physical intuition to identifl the most important forcing field(s). Since SSTs\ninfluence surface evaporation and near-surface moisture transport, we investigated the SSTrainfall relationship through these two fields. Accordingly, the simulated precipitation was\n\n1\n\nbinned by SST and boundary-layer moisture supply. The sorted data helped us compute\nprecipitation change due to i) evaporation increase caused by increase in local SST, but with\nsame external moisture supply, and ii) external moisture supply increase caused by same increase\nin local SST, but with the sanie evaporation. The sum of the two gives a quantitative measure of\nthe influence of local SST on the local precipitation everywhere as well as helps to calculate the\ninfluence of seasonal variations in SST on the seasonal variations in local rainfall. Several\nremote and local SST influences were distinguished to better understand the influence of local\n\nSSTs on local rainfall vis-&-visthe total simulated rainfall. We found that a double ITCZ of the\nspring season was caused by remote forcing. The local SST support was paramount for many\nother tropical rainfall anomalies. Our andysis holds the key to understanding the cause of\nrainfall anomalies through local andor remote SST-forcings.\n\n2\n\n\xe2\x80\x99\n\nInfluences of Local Sea-Surface Temperatures and Large-scale Dynamics\non Monthly Precipitation Inferred from Two 10-year GCM-Simulations\nY. C. Sud, G. K. Walker +, Zhou*,\nY.\n&\n\nW. K.-M. Lau\nLaboratory for Atmospheres\nNASA Goddard Space Flight Center,\nGreenbelt, Maryland\n\nABSTRACT\nTwo parallel sets of 10-year long: January 1, 1982 to December 31, 1991, simulations were made\nwith the finite volume General Circulation Model (fvGCM) in which the model integrations were forced\nwith prescribed sea-surface temperature fields (SSTs) available as two separate SST-datasets. One\ndataset contained naturally varying monthly SSTs for the chosen period, and the oth& had the 12monthly mean SSTs for the same period. Plots of evaporation, precipitation, and atmosphere-column\nmoisture convergence, binned by l0C SST intervals show that except for the tropics, the precipitation is\nmore strongly constrained by large-scale dynamics as opposed to local SST. Binning data by SST\nnaturally provided an ensemble average of data contributed from disparate locations with same SST; such\naverages could be expected to mitigate all location related influences. However, the plots revealed: i)\nevaporation, vertical velocity, and precipitation are very robust and remarkably similar for each of the\ntwo simulations and even for the data from 1987-ENSO-year simulation; ii) while the evaporation\nincreased monotonically with SST up to about 27OC, the precipitation did not; iii) precipitation correlated\nmuch better with the column vertical velocity as opposed to SST suggesting that the influence of\ndynamical circulation including non-local SSTs is stronger than local-SSTs.\nThe precipitation fields were doubly binned with respect to SST and boundary-layer mass and/or\nmoisture convergence. The analysis discerned the rate of change of precipitation with local SST as a sum\n\nof partial derivative of precipitation with local SST plus partial derivative of precipitation with boundarylayer moisture convergence multiplied by the rate of change of boundary-layer moisture convergence\nwith SST (see Eqn. 3 of Section 4.5). This analysis is mathematically rigorous as well as provides a\nquantitative measure of the influence of local SST on the local precipitation. The results were recast to\nexamine the dependence of local rainfall on local SSTs; it was discernible only in the tropics. Our\nmethodology can be used for computing relationship between any forcing function and its effect(s) on a\nchosen field.\n\n1\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\nIt is common knowledge that during the warm and cold phases of El Nino Southern\nOscillation (ENSO), the intensely raining regions of tropical oceans follow the wann SSTs\n(Giannini et aI., 2001). This is reasonably simulated by most of the modern General Circulation\nModels (GCMs; Latif et a]., 2001). One naturally finds scores of articles employing observations\nas well as model simulations which show that local SST anomalies are the primary driver of\nmany observed precipitation anomalies particularly in the tropics (e.g., Chen 2005, Hui et at.,\n2001, and several others). However, we also know that ENS0 induced changes in tropicaI\ncirculation vitally inff uence both weather and climate in several mid- and high- latitude regions,\nwhere SSTs did not change. Evidently therefore, the tropical SST-anomalies have the ability to\ninfluence distant regions through dynamics. It can be argued pedagogically that both in situ SSTs\nand dynamic influences are important for precipitation; therefore, discerning among their\ncontributions is vital for understanding the relationship of observed precipitation anomalies in\nresponse to large-scale SST anomalies, the primary drivers of observed weather and climate\nvariations in many parts of the world. However, because the dynamics and local SST-influences\ninteract with each other, any modulation of one would affect the other as well as the overall\noutcome. Therefore, for a broad-view, the influence of only small SST-perturbations that do not\nalter the large-scale circulation substantially is plausible; otherwise, the only option is a full\nblown GCM simulation.\n\nThe posed question has bees var;,~us!y addressed fer sonc tzrgeted regions both for\natmospheric and oceanic circulation regimes (e-g., Lin et al., 2006, Lohmann et d.,\n2002,\nHarrison and Craig, 1993; Yu et al., 1991; Bony et al, 1997; Lau et al., 1997). There are parallel\nexamples for land rainfall wherein the influence of soil moisture on rainfall is investigated (e.g.,\n\nKoster et al., 2004). In the Koster et al. multi-model data analysis, different models produced\nsuch widely different outcomes that the importance of a model\xe2\x80\x99s ability to represent the influence\nrealistically was noted, but it remained an unresolved issue. Indeed, even for our investigation,\nthe SST-evaporation-rainfall interaction may be GCM-dependant. However, first and foremost,\nwe need a robust methodology for delineating the competitive roles of local-SST and all nonlocal SSTs with feedback processes influencing the circulation dynamics (hereafter dynamic\ninfluences) that affect near-surface moisture convergence and precipitation. Nevertheless, both\nlocal SST and dynamics are often intertwined and without a mathematically rigorous\nmethodology, the SST-rainfall relation might not be satisfactorily addressed. Lin et al. (2006)\nanalyzed the increase of precipitation efficiency and boundary layer moisture transport toward\nupper troposphere as a function of SST in tropical deep-convective systems. The work illustrated\nthe need to include the dynamically induced boundary layer moisture convergence as a key\ncomponent of the SST-rainfall relationship.\nThe 4-Dimensional Data Assimilation (4DDA) data are commonly called \xe2\x80\x9cthe best es6mate\nof observations\xe2\x80\x9d. These data can be very useful for the analysis of issues such as SST-rainfall\nrelationship except that the 4DDA process infuses a discernible degree of pollution into some of\nthe key fields such as vertical velocity and precipitation, which renders the data unfit for a\ncredible scientific research. Moreover, all data assimilation processes have intrinsic mismatches\nbetween observed and simulated data; it is partly due to biases of the assimilation-system, the\ncenterpiece of which is a GCM and partly due to mismatches of scales of observations and grid\nmea= vahes of the 4DDA system. IE comparison, GCM-simiAitims z e vahab!e iztemdjy\nconsistent data sources and allow controlled simulations as well as save the key diagnostic\ncritical to the analysis of the issues. But, if the chosen GCM has large biases, the GCM-based\ninferences merely contxibute to uncertainty as opposed to useful solutions of the problem(s), e.g.,\n2\n\nin Koster et al. (2004) study, the authors simply averaged all model outputs for the best answer.\nSince,.precipitation is one outcome of complex interactions among SSTs, large-scale dynamics,\nand a host of physical processes some of which are not well represented in models, GCM results\nare often viewed as a model dependant calculation. Therefore one faces the proverbial dilemma-how to discern between the model-characteristics and the true behavior of the atmosphere.\n\nNevertheless, we advocate, if 4DDA fields and observations are used as a guide, simulated data\ncan be very helpful for addressing such problems. Hence we chose the model simulation route\nand use a well validated GCM with the hope of validating our results with other GCMs.\nThe finite volume GCM (hereafter fvGCM) is the model of our choice. It is a GSFC model\nwith fv-hydrodynamics and several features of NCAR surface fluxes and NASNGSFC physics,\nis described in Section 2. Even though it is one of the best, it shows some biases in the strength\nof the ITCZ and/or some regional precipitation patterns; however, the simulated precipitation\nfields in the 10-year mean (Fig. la) and observations (Fig. lb) agree reasonably. Its seasonal\ncycle (not shown) also has several remarkable similarities with observations. This motivated us\n\nto examine the SST-precipitation relationship using its simulations. Regardless, a GCM based\ninferences are only as good as the GCM simulating them. However, we can expect our results to\nserve as background for the simulated precipitation analysis in selected regions, such as\nevidenced in Bony et al. (1997) and Lin et al. (2006) research.\n\n2. MODEL DESCRIPTION\nThe fv-NCAR GCM used ix this research has\n\ni\n!\n\nfi,nite-v~!~ms p ~ m i c d\nd\ncow that was\n\ndeveloped and extensively evaluated by Lin and Rood (1996) and comprehensively documented\nby Lin (2004). Except for the radiation and cloud schemes, the model-physics (including the\nCommunity Land Model version 2.0\n\n- CLM2)\n\nare from the NCAR CCM3.6 community model\n3\n\n(Hurrell et al., 1998).\n\nMicrophysics of clouds with Relaxed Arakawa-Schubert Scheme\n\n(McRAS) is the cloud physics employed in this fv-NCAR GCM version. McRAS was developed\nat GSFC and was variously found superior to other potential choices (Maloney and Hartman,\n2002; Maloney, 2003; Sud et al., 2005). McRAS is structured around the moist convective core\nof the Relaxed Arakawa-Schubert Scheme (RAS) developed by Moorthi and Suarez (1992)\ntogether with Sundqvist (1988) and Tiedtke (1993) cloud microphysics. Its evaluations and\nupgrades are described in four key papers {Sud and Walker 1999a, b, 2003, 2004). McRAS\ntracks cloud amounts through a prognostic cloud mass and cloud water substance equation in\nwhich cloud and precipitation microphysics remain fully interactive at all times for all simulated\nclouds and for cloud types.\nThe radiation physics schemes (Chou and Suarez, 1994) were also developed and extensively\ntested at GSFC. Several radiation-transfer algorithms were upgraded and extensively discussed in\nChou et al. (1998) & Chou et al. (1999). The scheme performs radiative transfer calculations\nusing cloud water, water vapor, and temperature fields simuIated and/or modified by McRAS.\nThese schemes have replaced the cloud and radiation schemes of the fv-NCAR GCM and our\nnew version may be called fv-McRAS GCM (hereafter, simply fvGCM). This model was\nassessed vis-&-visthe original fv-NCAR GCM by Sud et al. (2005) for influence of SSTs on\nrainfall and found superior to the original fv-NCAR GCM. The model resolution is 1.0 x 1.25\ndegrees latitude by longitude, with 55 vertical levels covering the atmosphere from the ground\nsurface td an altitude of approximately 75 km.\n\n3. DATA & SIMULATIONS\nAll numerical simulations were made with the fvGCM described in Section 2 and forced\nwith monthly prescribed SST and sea-ice boundary conditions available as monthly data. The\n4\n\ninitial conditions for the simuIation are taken from a 47-year \xe2\x80\x9cspin-up\xe2\x80\x9d of the standard fv-NCAR\nGCM with several months of daily soil moisture updates using observed circulation data. This\nprocedure has its usual drawbacks of not providing observations quality analysis, but it is a better\nalternative to p e r f o d n g extensive soil moisture analysis with a crude land-hydrology model of\nn\nanother data assimilating model using i situ observations that in likelihood are likely to be\ninconsistent with the GCM\xe2\x80\x99s resolution.\n\nWe made two integrations spanning the 10-year\n\nsimulation period, January 1, 1982 through December 31, 1991. The first integration was forced\nwith the naturally varying monthly SSTs taken from Jones et al. (2001) analysis, and the second\nwas forced with mean monthly SST generated for the 10-year period defined above. All SSTs\nwere prescribed as monthly data, and linearly interpolated to yield the daily SSTs estimates\nneeded by the fvGCM. Besides SSTs, the biosphere, with its phenology and morphology, was\n\nalso prescribed. In the upper atmosphere, the ozone was climatological and prescribed as\nmonthly data. Everything else, e.g., clouds, cloud-radiation interaction, land hydrology in\nassociation with soil moisture, as well as the simulated circulation are fully prognostic and\ninteractive. Thus fvGCM simulations, with additional diagnostics of PBL-moisture convergence\nand vertical velocity at sigma levels can help us delineate the local SST versus dynamic effects\nwithin a model-environment in which all other biogeophysical feedback interactions are\nsimuIated by the model\xe2\x80\x99s physics and dynamics.\n\n4. RESULTS\n\n-- -\n\nWe have used both sets of simulations described above to infer the local vesus fim-locd\n\nSST influences on the simulated monthly precipitation using the monthly mean fields and using a\nmathematically rigorous methodology outlined in Sections 4.4 and 4.5.\n\n4.1 SST- Precipitation Fields\n\nIn\n\nthe 10-year averages shown as 2-D plots, the SST distributions are shown through\n\nbackground colored patterns, whereas the precipitation distribution is contoured--both for\nobservations p i g . la) and fv-McRAS GCM simulations with analyzed SSTs (or Cs; Figs. Ib).\nThe isopleths of SST are not parallel to isopleths of precipitation except in the tropics. The\nintersection angle between them varies from place to place. This essentially suggests that SSTprecipitation fields do not correlate well outside of tropics. However, even ocean evaporation can\nalso be complex. It is forced by SST as well as affected by other geophysical fields, such as\nwinds, humidity, and removal of water vapor by the moist processes such as moist convection\nand PBL growth. Moreover, the annual cycle of evaporation (with interannual SST variability)\nand associated changes in circulation makes the outcome quite complex; however, in the second\nparallel set of simulations in which the SST was devoid of interannual variations, a number of\ninferences were self-evident, which indicate that SSTs affect precipitation distribution either\nthrough local effect or by its inff uence on large-scale dynamics/circulation patterns. Hence we\nprobe into different aspects of the SST-precipitation relationship more critically.\n\n4.2. Precipitation, Vertical Velocity, and Evaporation Binned by SST\nThe 10-year simulated monthly data for evaporation, precipitation, and vertical velocity were\nbinned by l\xc2\xb0C SST intervals and plotted. Figure 2 shows each of the four fields with superposed\nstandard deviation (displayed as grey background) for the interannually varying SST simulation\n(or Cs). Similar means and standard deviation were prodirced for cfirnatlologjcal SST-simu!aticns\n(or Cc) as well as for a single ENS0 year, 1987 (or Ce). However, for clarity only the mean\nfields (without the standard deviation) are superposed on the Cs fields. This conveys the picture\nquite well because the standard deviations of Cc and Ce simulation were very similar to Cs. We\n6\n\nalso see that the bin-averaged values of Cc and Ce simulations are also very similar to Cs except\n\nfor high-end SSTs, i.e., SSTs greater than 29OC, where the standard deviation is very large and\ninfluence of local SSTs dominate (as we shall see). Thx clearly suggests that binning captures\nthe essence of the SST-influence for each of the key fields (Figs. 2a-d).\nWe note that only the bin-averaged monthly evaporation increases monotonically with\nSST (not exponentially as may be expected from Clausius-Clapeyron relation between saturation\nhumidity and temperature) up to about 26OC and then it levels off (Fig. 2a); in fact, it reduces\nslightly at SSTs close to 3U\xc2\xb0C. This happens in intensely raining regions. Regions of reduced\nevaporation appear in strongly converging humid regions, such as the warm pool. In these\nregions, the wind-speed decreases while the near surface humidity remains high and that is a\nprime cause of lower evaporation (Chou et al., 2005). We also know that convective downdrafts\nand sudden wind bursts help to promote local evaporation and presumably that is how the surface\nevaporation gets some of its boost to maintain the level of local evaporation of the comparatively\ncooler regions. Alternatively, since moist convection is the primary sink of boundary-layer\nmoisture; its by-product, i .e., precipitation, generates condensation heating that counters the\nregional radiative cooling. According to Larson and Hartmann (2003) analysis, cooling by\nradiation is the primary determinant of convective condensation and rising motion over tropical\noceans; evaporation merely balance the energy budget at the surface and fulfills the water vapor\ndeficit between moisture consumption by moist convection and moisture convergence that\ntransports moisture into the region. Even the standard deviation of evaporation is quite similar all\nthrough except for the warmer SST bins, where intense convective activity generates transients\nand large temporal variability. Thus large standard deviation of all four quantities at around\n3OoC is an outcome of variations due to episodic behavior of the dynamics of deep convection as\n\nwell as reduced bin-population (smaller by a factor of 50-100). Moreover, some geographic\n7\n\nlocation may have persistent warm SST and low precipitation. This suggests that intensity of\nepisodic convection increases with SST while the mean does not change much (elaborated\nfurther in Section 4.3). On the other hand, the relationship between SST and precipitation is\nmuch more constrained by dynamics. The bin-averaged precipitation has four regimes. In the\nhigh latitude regime comprising of SST range of O-gOC, the precipitation increases with SST; in\nthe second mid-latitude regime comprising of SST range of 9-24\'C, the precipitation decreases\nwith SST. Thereafter, in the tropical regime comprising of SST range of 26-2goC, the\nprecipitation increases very quickly with the SST. Finally, for SST warmer than 29OC, the\nprecipitation starts to decrease again. These patterns have a good correlation with the binaveraged vertical velocity (Fig. 2c). Since the mid-latitudes supply moisture to the tropics\nthrough the Hadley circulation and to the high latitudes through Farrel circulation, the\nprecipitation in mid-latitudes is less than the evaporation. The precipitation reduction is far larger\non the tropical side of mid-latitudes as compared to the baroclinicdly dominated high-latitudes.\nConsequently, the behavior of the precipitation in the binned SST plots is an outcome of rate of\nmoisture transport out of mid-latitudes. Hadley circulation of the tropics, associated with\nrelatively smaller Coriolis force, but with abundance of moisture, produces significantly large\ncondensation heating. Accordingly, Hadley circulation is much stronger (than the Ferrell\ncirculation) and is accompanied by larger circulating air masses and associated moisture\nconvergencefs). In short, the moisture loss and associated precipitation reduction on the tropical\nside of mid-latitudes leads to large precipitation reduction in the regions of increasing SST and\nevaporation, a finding counter to popular nxionzs like precipitation increases with SST. .\nHowever, there is much better correlation between the tropospheric-mean (800-300hPa) vertical\nvelocity and precipitation (Figs 2b & c), both of which are dynamics-controlled and SST-forced.\nSuch a correlation gives the appearance of a large vertical velocity precipitation relationship.\n\nHowever, it is an outcome of the much stronger ability of tropics to utilize diabatic heating\ncaused by large condensation to force near surface mass convergence that brings warm moistureladen air carrying mid-latitude evaporation (Fig. 2d). In fact, it is the joint influence of large-scale\ndynarnical organization of circulation systems in response to large-scale structures of SSTs that\nare so ubiquitous in the tropics. These structures manifest through negative correlation between\n\nSST and vertical velocity and precipitation in the medium-SST mid-latitude regions. The\noutcome is robust while dynamic constraints convolve to exacerbate the SST forcing; but any\nconclusion about the influence of SST on vertical velocity and the associated precipitation has its\npitfalls unless it is viewed in the light of the dynamical response of the circulation. This is\ndiscussed in Bony et al. (1997). Indeed, there is large variability in the standard deviation of each\n\nof the fields; while a large reduction in all of them near the highest SSTs represent regions that\nlack alignment of atmospheric convection with SSTs because it is modulated more by\natmospheric dynamics and not by oceanic circulation with its radiative forcing that generates hot\nspots. The emergence of hot spots in the sinking tropical regions was noted by Waliser\xe2\x80\x99s (1996)\nwho suggested that solar heating in non-precipitating clear regons is its primary cause; however,\nin the prescribed SST simulations, cloudiness-SST feedbacks do not exist and we still find\nreduction of average rainfall with SST larger than 3OoC. Such an outcome is a consequence of the\ninability of some wann regions to better align with the circulation systems of the region due to\ntheir geophysical juxtaposition enabling precipitation to be out of phase with warm SST in\ncertain area and some times. In other words, even though there are warm regions, they are unable\nIO\n\ncapture as much convergence and precipitation as others region with smaller SST becmse they\n\nare not well aligned with large organized tropical systems that benefit from significant large-scale\nmoisture convergence. Large tropical convergence not only promotes deep convection but also\ndries and cools the near surface region by downdrafts (Sud and Walker, 1993), an essential player\n9\n\nthat has been inadequately parameterized in the cloud physics of GCMs up until recently. Why\nthen does the influence of non-alignment emerge at high temperatures? It is because at the higher\nend of SSTs, the grid cells involved are much fewer and their collective ability to affect the\n\natmospheric circulation is accordingly reduced. In other words, the alignment of atmospheric\ncirculation to SSTs is based on large-scale SST fields wherein the total number of grid cells\ninvohed also count for the outcome.\nOne also notes that a strong SST precipitation relationship starts to emerge above 27OC\nwhere the bin-averaged sinktng motion (seen at lower SSTs), suddenly changes into the binaveraged rising motion. This enables upward transport of moisture and that triggers moistprocesses which consume moisture provided by local evaporation and moisture convergence.\nThus, above 27OC SST, the precipitation begins to exceed evaporation. This is roughly the\ntemperature at which deep convection ensues. Its characteristic behavior has been exhaustively\ndiscussed by Sud et al. (1999) using TOGA-COARE data and appIying fundamental principles of\nmoist convections enunciated by Arakawa-Schubert (1974) and used in RAS\n\n--\n\nthe backbone of\n\nmoist convective physics of McRAS. However, there are some discernible biases in the moist\nconvective parameterizations of our times and those naturally warrant some caution even though\nour analysis is principally rigorous (see Section 5). The SST-binned PBL moisture convergence\nclosely corresponds with vertical velocity, particularly in the tropics: SST between 26OC and\n29OC, this represents large-scale convergence associated with ITCZ/SPCZ; it is only partly due to\nthe increase of PBL moisture content as suggested by Lin et aL(2006) for deep convective\nsystems of tropics.\n\n4.3 Global Evaporation and Column Moisture Convergence\n\n10\n\nThe primary moisture sources for precipitation are surface evaporation (Fig 3a) and\ntropospheric moisture flux convergence:\n\nPt\n-\n\nJVp.Vpqdp (Fig 3b). Here\n\nV, is the horizontal\n\nPs\n\nvelocity, q is water vapor mixing ratio and V,.w is the horizontal divergence of a vector field,\n= Vpq . We can subdivide the column moisture convergence into two parts, one associated\nPt\n\nwith the mass flux convergence: - JqVp.Vp dp, so called first term (Fig 3c), and one associated\nPs\nPt\n\nwith humidity gradient: - jVp.Vpq dp , so called second term (Fig 3d). We note that the\nPs\n\nsimilarity of patterns between the total moisture convergence and the first term is quite\nremarkable; it shows moisture carried by mass convergence is a primary contributor of total\nmoisture convergence. It also explains the relationship between binned precipitation and vertical\nvelocity discussed in Section 4.2 and delineated by Bony et a]. (1997). The second tern is\nnegative over most oceanic areas. It shows that the entire humidity gradient fields of the tropical\nand exptratropical oceans work as moisture source for a few intensely precipitating regions such\nas the ITCZ, the SPCZ, and the warm pool. The only exception is the cold-tongue region of the\nEquatorial Western Pacific as well as small precipitating regions at high latitudes. The negative\ncorrelation between SST and precipitation, in 9-24OC SSTs range, is closely associated with\nsinking region of mid-latitudes. The reduced precipitation at SST warmer than 29OC is also\nassociated with reduced rising motion. However, they were adequately discussed in Section 4.2.\n\n4.4 Evaporation, Moisture Convergence in the PBL, and Precipitation\n\n11\n\nA general understanding of the role of SSTs and near surface (PBL) and upper\n\nlevel moisture flux convergence can be addressed by a standard differential equation of nvariables of which we use only three:\n\nwhere T,, and\n\nMb & Mt\n\nare SST and associated moisture flux convergences in\n\nthe boundary layer and aloft that primarily modulate a scalar ( . Such an analysis can be\nuseful if the other effects are either small or cancel out in the bin-averaged data. The\n\n<\n\nfield could be any diagnostic quantity such as precipitation or cloudiness. Assuming that\nevaporation, SSTs, and PBL mass and moisture flux divergences are the primary\ndeterminant of precipitation, the analysis can reveal the relative roles of small changes in\nlocal and non-local SSTs and resultant moisture convergence changes. We cIaim that\n\nSST, through surface fluxes, and PBL mass/moisture convergence are two dominant\nforcing functions that affect precipitation. In doubly binned analysis, Fig. 4, evaporation,\nPBL moisture convergence and precipitation are binned by equal intervals of SST and\nO\nPBL-mass divergence. A 2 C SST-bin interval mitigates the influence of small change in\n\nSSTs due to daily varying SSTs whose non-linear effect could not be taken onto account.\nClearly, d< = 0 defines isopleths of 5 . Vertically (horizontally) oriented isopleths show\nlesser (larger) dependence on near-surface mass divergence and hence the vertical\nvelocity. Moreover, lesser dependence on mass divergence may imply larger dependence\non SSTs since we know that both mass/moistwe convergence and evaporation are\nn\naffected by SST. L addition, large gradients among the isopleths imply stronger\ndependence.\n\nWe now probe into the individual fields to get a little better insight. As shown in\n800\n\nSection 4.3, the PBL moisture flux convergence: - JVp.Vpqdp , too can be divided into\nPS\n\ntwo terns. The first term gives mass convergence dependant moisture convergence:\n800\n\n-\n\njqV,.Vp dp , while the second tern gives humidity gradient dependant moisture\n\n800\n\nconvergence: - 1Vp.V,q dp - The plots for the thusly partitioned terms are not shown (see\nPS\n\nSection 4.3), but moisture convergence as such helps to relate the near surface\nevaporation and moisture convergences as functions of SST and PBL mass convergences\nthat primarily influence the moisture supply to the cloud base for moist convection.\nThe new analysis provides a lot of valuable insight. Surface evaporation increases\nwith SST as should be expected (Fig. 4a); however, the isopleths of evaporation requires\nhigher SSTs athear zero convergence, particularly for SSTs colder than 15OC. These\nSSTs are associated with the baroclinic activity in the atmosphere aloft; strong\nconvergence or divergence is often associated with synoptic scale circuIation systems.that\ninfluences PBL mass convergence (divergence) into a low (or a high) pressure system.\nSince regions of larger mass convergence are associated with stronger wind speeds that\npromote evaporation, larger convergence or divergence would be able to maintain the\nsame evaporation at lower SSTs, which explains the peculiar shape of the isopleths. The\npattern breaks down for warmer SSTs because there is more quasi-stationary flow at those\nlatitudes. Between 18-24OC, the mid-latitude subsidence regions are major suppliers of\nmoisture to the lTCZ/SPCZ regions with precipitation using local surface evaporation and\nwater vapor transported as horizontal moisture flux. The maximum evaporation occurs at\n\nsome moderate divergence (-0.005 Kg m-2s-l). The regions of high convergence and less\nevaporation as well as precipitation (Fig. 4c) are mostly coastal re$ons in the SST range\nof 15-22OC with mass convergence of 0.01 to 0.02 Kg m-2s-\'}. Some of them are off the\nwest coast of North and South America where high vertical velocities are generated by\norographic features of the Andes without much precipitation. In large-convergence highSST regions, there is larger evaporation as well as precipitation. These are the well known\n\nITCZ and warm pool regions. Overall, in almost all converging (diverging) regions,\nprecipitation is larger (smaller) than evaporation. However, the dependence of\nprecipitation on SST and mass convergence can be inferred from the gradients of\nisopleths. The ITCZ is found in strongly converging regions of SSTs > 28OC. The\nstrongest convergence is in the western tropical pacific where the dependence on SSTs is\nquite strong; whereas the influence of mass convergence is less, as inferred from the\nvertical orientation of the precipitation isopleths. The tongue of larger precipitation\nbetween 18-24OC and around 0.003 to 0.006 Kg\n\ns-\' convergence is largely associated\n\nwith mid latitude (-30N and -305) storm tracks.\nThe associated PBL moisture convergence (Fig. 4b), which again correlates to\nmass convergence related moisture convergence (not shown), is evidenced in the\ncorrelation; it is positive (negative) in converging (diverging) regions. In the ITCZ\nregions, both PBL moisture convergence and surface evaporation are much larger than the\nprecipitation. Such differences can be viewed as precipitation efficiency. In the coastal\n\nze2s, it is vexy !ow. Lnl ether areas, it gets very dose to 100%becmse moistus is also\nbeing supplied by moisture flux-transports above the boundary layer. In binning\nprecipitation by l0C for tropicaI regions, one sees more details (not shown, because such\na fine resolution is unsuitable for the analysis in Section 4.5). It shows reduced\n14\n\nprecipitation above 30*C, the so called non-aligned warm regions that hang in without\nmuch convergence or evaporation.\n\n4.5 Splitting Precipitation by SST and PBL Moisture Convergence\nWe extend the analysis defined by Eq. (1) to compute partial derivatives of key\ndeterminants of precipitation in order to better analyze the behavior of precipitation in\nresponse to local SST and then obtain the dynamic influence that include all other effects\nincluding that of non-local SSTs as a residue. We rewrite (1) to apply it to precipitation in\neach bin and use the first two terms as follows:\n\nFor total derivative of P with Tss,Eq. (2) is recast as:\n\nHere P is precipitation, and MC is PBL moisture convergence in Kg m\' 2 d-1 . Evidently,\nthe upper level convergence (term 3 of Eq.1) is dropped as secondary to the influence of\nSSTs on local precipitation. Clearly, the effect of SST is through evaporation; it is\nimplicit in the first term whereas the second term includes the local SST effect in\naffecting the dynamic moisture convergence. The partial derivatives are determined for\nthe mean values of the data in each bin separated by 2OC SST and 1 Kg m-2 day-\' moisture\nconvergence. The assumption being that these bins contain data of similarly forced grid\npoints because the moisture convergences and SSTs are similar for the entire population\nexcept for the variability associated with the bin-size. To solve Eq. (3),we calculated the\npartial derivatives of the bin-mean fields in the horizontal and vertical directions to obtain\n\n15\n\nthe two partial derivatives (Fig. 5a). To obtain the best estimates ofdMc/dTss ,the least\nsquare regression was attempted first because it had the potential to yield best estimates\nof dMc/dTss . However, this calculation failed to provide reasonable derivatives. Indeed,\nwhen we examined the sample data, we were unable to see any trend; this is partly caused\nby daily interpolated SSTs and is compounded by data obtained from disparate places;\nhowever, average dMc/ dTsscould be estimated from BL-Mc binned by SSTs (Fig. 2d).\nThe two terns of Eq. (3) are shown in Fig. 5a. where the rate of change of precipitation is\nplotted as a function of SST and PBL moisture convergence.\nTypically, dP/dTss can be expected to be positive, but sometimes it can become\nnegative when higher SST warms the PBL and helps to mix the evaporating, even\nconvergmg, moisture into drier sinking and diverging air aloft; under such conditions,\nvertical mixing hefps the moisture to escape (classical Sahara desert scenario where near\nsurface moisture convergence escapes by mixing into the dry diverging air aloft, Sud and\nMolod, 1988), however, aP/aMc is almost always positive while dMc/dTss is strongly\npositive in tropics and discernibly negative in regions of subtropical high.\nThe focat relationship is between rates of change of SST versus rate of change of\nprecipitation, dP/dTss. It is large in the tropics (SSTs between 25-30\'C). Here local SSTinduced evaporation and near surface moisture convergence work in concert to increase\nthe precipitation and that is a well known tropical phenomena which lead Bony et al.\n\n(1997) and Lin et a1 (2006) to search the tropics for SST-rainfall relationship.\nInterestingly, its dependence on PBL moisture convergence is not so critical for the\noverall outcome because the calculation is for obtaining the inff uence of SST on\nincreased Me as opposed to the other way around; however, the outcome is also evident\n\n16\n\nin the verticality of isopleths. The response of precipitation to increasing SST in the\ntropics is up to 1.5 mm d" C-\'. On the other hand, in the diverging region of high SST,\nboth partial derivatives are small while dMc/dTss is negative; so the sum of the two can\nbe slightly negative. In other words, small increase in SST can lead to reduction in\nprecipitation, a picture that is consistent with Fig. 2b. The values range from 0.5-1.00\nm d d a y for SSTs and 0-0.4 &day\n\nfor moisture convergence. This circulation is\n\nconsistent with warm regions transporting moisture into the ITCZ or SPCZ regions.\nNevertheless, how-so-ever small, there is a positive contribution of both SST and\nmoisture convergence except for highly subsiding regions. Some areas of small\nnegative dP / dTss < 0 imply that the increase in evaporation is mitigated by increased\nupward mixing of moisture that subsequently manages to escape with subsiding and\ndiverging dry air aloft. It represents the drying influence of shallow convection. In lowSST high latitude regions, SSTs are not very important, while boundary layer Mc\ncontributes to majority of the precipitation, but with less than 100% precipitation\nefficiency. Precipitation yields larger than 100%of Mc imply moisture supply at the\nupper levels and that was seen in some of the regions (not shown).\nFigure 5b shows the projection of dP/dTssanalysis on to the global scale SSTfields - This graphically illustrates how different SST-domains are affected by varying\nSSTs on monthly time; the data was averaged over the 10-year simulation period. Its\nstandard deviation reflects both inter-annual and intra-annual variability of the monthly\nrainfall response to local SST. Such a result is useful for global change scenarios and\neven understanding the influence of sudden perturbations in SST in limited regions due to\nanthropogenic activity or extra terrestrial impingements.\n\n17\n\n4.6 Local SST-Rainfallyields in the 10-year Annual Cycle\nFigure 6 shows very interesting correspondences between total and local SST\nproduced rainfall changes projected from calculations of Section 4.4 and based on the\nfvGCM simulations for each of the 4-seasons. The first inference is that many regions of\nlarge positive (negative) total rainfall differences correspond well with the local SST\ncaused rainfall changes. In examining JJA differences, Northern tropical latitudes at\naround 20N produce large increases in total rainfall; this is in unison with increased\ninfluence of local SST. The opposite is the case for JJA over Southern Pacific Oceans.\nThe Atlantic lTCZ rainfall increases also happen in concert with local SSTs produced\nincreases in rainfall and vice versa. Nevertheless, over northern Atlantic, where SSTs are\nwanner (suggesting an increase in rainfall due to local SSTs), actuaIIy there is a decreases\ndue to large scale dynamics that enhances moisture divergence over the oceans while MC\nover North\'America and Africa increases due to significant increase in thermally induced\nlarge-scale fIow.\n\nIn winter, D E , the Sun is in the Southern Hemisphere where the landmass is\nlimited, therefore the SSTs dominates the outcome that is reflected through a better\ncorrespondence between local SST produced rainfall increases and total rainfall. On the\nother hand, spring season, MAM, is well known for its double ITCZ in the tropical\nwestern Pacific. It happens in both the fvGCM simulations and observations data. Since\nthe SST based local rainfall changes have no such structure, we argue that double ITCZ of\nI\n\nthe spring season is largely a dynamics phenomenon and the current findings agree with\n\nour past analysis of model simulations. Interestingly, fall-season, SON, always has a\nsingle ITCZ, while as compared to the spring season, it emerges as a double negative\nrainfall anomaly (a negative image of NIAM) on either side of the ITCZ; this too is largely\n\ndynamic controlled even though it has some SST support because the local SST influence\nis positive at the ITCZ location and slightly negative on both sides of it. We can interpret\n\nit as a small positive contribution of local SSTs. In comparing MAM[ and SON rainfa11\nanomalies of the tropics, one sees dramatic reversal of anomaly patterns, and those are\nconsistent with warmer (cooler) western tropical Pacific in the MAM (SON) seasons. The\ndifferences in rainfall anomalies may also be related to larger (smaller) solar forcing is\n\nMAN (SON). Hence, it is reasonable to expect that the dynamic influences must be\nparamount for the simulated pattern-differences. Overall when ever and where ever\nrainfall anomaly patterns parallel the SST produced local rainfall change patterns, local\nSST has some influence, but often it is partial, e.g., over Southern Pacific in DJF or\nNorthern Pacific in JJA on the western side; but when the patterns do not align, the\ninfluence has to be largely dynamic, e.g., emergence of double ITCZ in western tropical\nPacific in MAM. However, the influence of differential land heating due to s o h forcing\nas a dynamic influence can not be ruled out.\nIndeed, the analysis shows that most of the SST influence on rainfall is through\nlarge-scaled organization and not as a response to local SSTs, a finding consistent with all\nthe previous diagnostics. The explanation for the emergence of hot spots at high-end of\n\nSSTs is also consistent with the notion that grid-scale changes in SST are unable to\ninfluence the globaI circulation.\n\n5.\n\ncoIu;cLusIoIu;s SXrn-VARY\nand\nSeveral investigations have explored the influence of SST and remote forcing on the local\n\nprecipitation, particularly with the goal of understanding the influence of tropical SSTs on\nprecipitation. However, because the local SST and dynamic effects are intertwined, it is difficult\n19\n\nto discern among them without a binning-type of analysis. Some earlier works made concerted\nefforts to untangle the puzzle for the tropics by binning and categorizing the data by SST and\nvertical velocity at 5OOhPa (Bony et al., 1977) and even mass divergence (Lau et al., 1997) while\nseveral others relied on physical arguments to resolve the puzzle, but a quantitative assessment of\nthe influence of SST anomalies on rainfall that is mathematically rigorous and would have\nuniversal application has not emerged so far. Indeed, two of the coauthors of Bony et al. (1997)\nwere unable to separate these two effects in quantitative way which has now become possible.\nIf SST changes are large, the only realistic option is to perform simulation experiments;\nhowever, for a broad understanding of issues, a binning analysis could serve as a useful guide for\nthe specific modeling and/or observational studies. Binning is a way of averaging out the\ninfluence of geographic juxtapositions and grouping data fur similarly forced regions. However,\nin binning by SST-alone, the influences of dynamic forcing does not cancel out even with\naveraging disparate data drawn from different locations! On the hind side, it is evident why it\nshould not be expected. The coupled Earth-Atmosphere system has a lot of intrinsic internal\norganization together with large systematic (zonally and temporally stratified) solar forcing.\nBony et al. (1997) worked around it by categorizing data by vertical velocity. However, a straight\nforward SST-binning for simulations with normally varying and climatologically varying SSTs\nled\n\nUS\n\nto infer that: i) the SST-binned moisture, vertical motion and precipitation fields are very robust;\n\nii) the evaporation increases monotonically with SST up to about 27\'C after which it plateaus, iii) the\nprecipitation correlates more with vertical velocity and not as much with local SST or evaporation; iv)\novera!!, LIZ ir,fluence of dp-zvjcal c i r c ~ k i o n stronger than that of the SST; v) moisture convergence\nis\n\nis strongly associated with mass convergence as opposed to humidity gradients (missing in the analysis)\nthat are functions of SST-gradient, vi) the hot spots, defined as small regions of large SSTs but lesser\n\n20\n\nrainfall comprise of regions that do not align with centers of organized convergence so they also emerge\nin prescribed SST simulations.\nWhen we examined doubly binned precipitation fields with respect to SST and PBL mass as well\n\nas moisture convergence to determine dP/dTss, there was a very worthwhile result. We interpreted the\n\nfvGCM-simulated data through a partial differential equation that could be applied to doubly\nned precipitation. This delineated rigorously the influences of local SST versus dynamically\nforced PBL moisture convergence effects. In the context of a ten year global circulation, the\nprecipitation is seen to emerge as a function of local SST given by aP/T,, , and moisture\nconvergence aP / M c , and the influence of SST on changes in moisture convergence, aMc /Tss\nwhose joint effect is captured by Eq. (3). We produced global plots revealing the key roles of\nSST in influencing the global circulation.\nClearly, even though we have not discovered anything fundamentally different from\nseveral earlier pioneering works, the present analysis quantifies the influence of local SST on\nprecipitation in a manner not performed before. The new analysis provides a quantitative solution\nto the SST rainfall relationship problem. We advocate that our analysis may be more useful for\nclimate change assessment and in deciphering the influence of SSTs on rainfall in different\nclimate regimes. The outcome of the anaIysis has aIso been projected on to SSTs globally; it\nhelped us to quantify rainfall changes in response to IocaI SST changes. Its potential advantage\ncan be for more realistic assessments of consequences of SST-changes, e.g., in a global warming\nscenario, on rainfall in which other binning variables such as cloudiness must be invoked.\nHowever, our resuits aiso warrant some caution because\n\nOUT\n\ndata is \xe2\x80\x9cvsed\n\n03\n\nthe F,GC?JI\n\nsimulation, therefore the findings are limited by the ability of the model to simulate the annual\ncycle of circulation and rainfall accurately. In the Koster et al. (2004) multi-model analysis of\nsoil moisture rainfall relationship, the major surprise was the wide scatter of predictions even in\n21\n\nwell-known models selected for the research; something similar might happen for SST-rainfall\nrelationship! Nevertheless, the proposed methodology with n-variables is mathematically\nrigorous even though it requires some physical intuition in appropriately choosing the variables\ninfluencing the outcome. Overall our results appears reasonable, however, the aforestated caution\nis our way of informing the readers about the pitfalls. Nevertheless, our analysis provides useful\ninsights for many practical applications while our results remain open to potential upgrades with\nbetter model or 4DDA data products.\n\nAcknowledgments.
