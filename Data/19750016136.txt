Twenty-one geomagnetic storm\nI\n\nj\t\n\nevents during 1966-70 have been studied by using simultaneous inter-\n\nplanetury magnetic field and plasma parameters. ::xplorer 33 and 35\nfield and plasma data have been analyzed on large-scale (hourly) and\n\nsmall-scale (3 min. ) during the time interval coincident with the initial\nphase of the geomagnetic storms. The principal results show that the\nsolar-ecliptic B z component turns southward at the end of the initial\nphase, thus triggering the main phase decrease in Dst geomagnetic\n\nfield. When the B z is already negative, its value becomes further\nnegative. The B component also shows large fluctuations along with\nY\nB z . When there are no clear changes in the B component, the B\nY\nshows abrupt changes at the main phase onset. On the small-scale\na a\nbehavior of the magnetic field and electric field (j^=-VXB ) studied in\ndetails for the three events, it is found that the field fluctuations in\n\nBy B and E and E are present in the initial phase. These fluctuations\nbecome larger just before the main phase of the storm begins. In the\n\nlarge-scale behavior field remainsquiet because the small-scale variations\nare averaged out. The power spectrum analysis for few events using\n\n5.2 s data show the steepening of the spectrum after the shock wave\nassociated with ssc. It appears that large as well as small time-scale\nfluctuations in the interplanetary field and plasma help to change the internal electromagnetic state of the magnetosphere so that a ring current\ncould start causing a geomagnetic storm decrease.\n\nPreliminary results were presented at the IAGA assembly in Kyoto,\nJapan 1 and the final results are published in a technical report of the\n2\nUniversity of Denver.\n1.\n2.\n\nV.

Hourly values of\nthe interplanetary field components in solar-ecliptic coordinates:\nBx, By, Bz are compared with the hourly Dst index representing\nstorm variations. In most of these events Bz is found to be southward near the beginning of the main phase of the storms. However,\nthere are events in which By component becomes more important\nthan Bz component in correlation with Dst during initial and :vain\nphases of the storms. We have further examined Ex, Ey and Ez\ncomponents of the interplanetary electric field E = -V x B where V\nis plasma velocity. Detailed analysis of three geomagnetic storms\nshow that botn Ey and Ez components have effects on Dst near the\nmain phase.
