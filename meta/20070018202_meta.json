Two performance parameters of interest are loiter time and dash speed as these define the persistence and responsiveness of an aircraft. The geometrical characteristics that optimize loiter time and dash speed require different geometrical planforms. Therefore, radical shape change, usually involving wing area and sweep, allows vehicle optimization across many flight regimes. The second phase of the MAS program consisted of wind tunnel tests conducted at the NASA Langley Transonic Dynamics Tunnel to demonstrate two morphing concepts and their enabling technologies with large-scale semi-span models. This paper will focus upon one of those wind tunnel tests that utilized a model developed by Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company (LM). Wind tunnel success criteria were developed by NASA to support the DARPA program objectives. The primary focus of this paper will be the demonstration of the DARPA objectives by systematic evaluation of the wind tunnel model performance relative to the defined success criteria. This paper will also provide a description of the LM model and instrumentation, and document pertinent lessons learned. Finally, as part of the success criteria, aeroelastic characteristics of the LM derived MAS vehicle are also addressed. Evaluation of aeroelastic characteristics is the most detailed criterion investigated in this paper. While no aeroelastic instabilities were encountered as a direct result of the morphing design or components, several interesting and unexpected aeroelastic phenomenon arose during testing.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20070018202, "endDate": "2007-04-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Society of Civil Engineers", "location": "New York, NY, United States"}}, "meetingId": "5bd11944a83e419fb7af60e36babaa82", "id": "90b4936f145943058f32e5084cade4b6"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Society for Composites", "location": "Dayton, OH, United States"}}, "meetingId": "5bd11944a83e419fb7af60e36babaa82", "id": "ba0987eb123545b5881865d62c4e8c20"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Society of Mechanical Engineers", "location": "United States"}}, "meetingId": "5bd11944a83e419fb7af60e36babaa82", "id": "e85077debbea40c2b373aaa13f07a121"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Helicopter Society, Inc.", "location": "United States"}}, "meetingId": "5bd11944a83e419fb7af60e36babaa82", "id": "1baf6e700db34e81ba132780ddc59542"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "United States"}}, "meetingId": "5bd11944a83e419fb7af60e36babaa82", "id": "aa8fb6cb4f0d41dfb3150706a1a2ae01"}], "name": "48th AIAA/ASME/ASCE/AHS/ASC Structures, Structural Dynamics, and Materials Conference", "location": "Waikiki, HI", "id": "5bd11944a83e419fb7af60e36babaa82", "startDate": "2007-04-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20070018202, "id": "9e3c974b9f5c4a3ebe9908db279bc775", "publicationDate": "2007-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20070018202.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20070018202/downloads/20070018202.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20070018202/downloads/20070018202.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20070018202/downloads/20070018202.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
