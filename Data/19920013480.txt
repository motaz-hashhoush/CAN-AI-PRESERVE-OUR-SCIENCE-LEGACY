Vranish\nNASA/Goddard\nGreenbelt,\n\nSpace Flight Center\nMaryland 20771\n\nABSTRACT\n\nA capacitive proximity/tactile sensor with unique performance capabilities ("Capaciflector" or capacitive reflector) is\nbeing developed by NASA/GSFC for use on robots and payloads in space in the interests of safety, efficiency, and\nease of operation. Specifically, this sensor will permit robots and their attached payloads to avoid collisions in space\nwith humans and other objects and to dock these payloads in a cluttered environment. The sensor is simple, robust,\nand inexpensive to manufacture with obvious and recognized commercial possibilities. Accordingly, NASA/GSFC,\nin conjunction with industry, is embarking on an effort to "spin" this technology off into the private sector. This\neffort includes prototypes aimed at commercial applications. The principles of operation of these prototypes are\ndescribed along with hardware, software, modelling, and test results. The hardware description includes both the\nphysical sensor in terms of a flexible printed circuit board and the electronic circuitry. The software description will\ninclude filtering and detection techniques. The modelling will involve finite element electric field analysis and will\nunderline techniques used for design optimization.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe objective for NASA purposes is to develop a proximity sensing skin that will permit a robot to sense intruding\nobjects without blind spots (up to one foot). This is a muff-purpose sensor. When used as an array on its arms, the\nrobot can be prevented from colliding with an object in space, particularly a human being. When sensing skin\nelements are placed on an Orbital Replacement Unit (ORU), these units can be manipulated, berthed and fastened\ndown with unprecedented accuracy and safety-no possibility of unwanted collisions. NASA research has also\ndemonstrated that scanning the sensor can produce clear images and that the near range resolution is so accurate that\nprecontact virtual force control is possible. The sensor is capable of becoming central to NASA space robot control.\nThis sensing skin must be able to function reliably in the extreme environment of space and not disturb or be\ndisturbed by neighboring NASA instruments. It should be simple, compact and be incidental to the robot design.\nAn approach based on an array of capacitors appears promising in solving both the proximity and tactile models [1].\nHowever, the system must be able to detect objects (including humans) at ranges in excess of one foot so that the\nrobot can react. To obtain such a range, a capacitive sensor typically must be "stood off" from the grounded robot\nann a considerable distance (approximately one inch). This would disfigure the robot ann, causing it to be bulkier\nthan necessary. It would also make cross-talk between the sensor elements more pronounced and would likely\nimpede the flow of heat from the robot arms to outer space (a serious problem for the Flight Telerobotic Servicer\n(Frs)). The "Capacifleetor" (capacitive reflector) described in this paper solves these problems and, in so doing,\nadvances the state-of-the-art in capacitive sensor performance.\nNASA is now in the process of developing a commercial version of the "Capaciflector", 2.5 cm (1 in.) on a side.\nThis sensor will be ultra simple, inexpensive and compact (essentially a piece of flexible printed circuit board with\nelectronic circuitry mounted on its reverse side). But, with ranges in excess of 13 cm (5 in.) vs 2.5 cm (1 in.) for\ncomparably-sized commercially available capacitive sensors, the commercial "Capaciflector" will use both an analog\noutput (signifying range) and an on/off switching signal that can be reset as required.\n\n423\n\nTHE "CAPICIFLECTOR"\nThe "Capaciflector" is a capacitive sensing element backed by a reflector element which is driven by the same\nvoltage as the sensor to reflect all field lines away from the grounded robot arm, thus extending the range of the\nsensor. This approach is an extension of the technique used in inslrumentation systems where a shield or guard is\nused to eliminate stray capacitance [2].\nFig. 1 shows the principles of operation in terms of charges and eleclric fields. Fig. la shows a capacitive sensor not\nusing the "capaciflector" principle. Since we are using relatively low frequencies (approximately 20 kHz) we have\nthe quasi-static condition and static charges and electric fields can be used to determine the capacitance the sensor\n"sees". We can see that the smaller the stand-off from the grounded robot arm, the larger the capacitive coupling\nbetween the sensor and ground. This, of course, has the effect of reducing the relative coupling between the sense\xc2\xa2\nand the object being sensed and hence reducing sensor range and sensitivity. On the other hand, increasing the standoff increases the bulk of the robot arm and adds wires and wiring complications. And, when the insulation materials\nare added to support the stand-off, the ability of the robot arm to dissipate thermal energy into space is impeded.\nWhen the "capaciflector" principle is used (Fig. lb)[3), the field lines from the sensor ere prevented from returning\ndirectly to ground. The effective stand-off is approximately the width of the active shield or capacitive reflector.\nThus, we can have a skin with very little thickness (on the order of 0.060 inches) and a robot ann with very little\nbulk and still have the performance of a large stand-off. Fig. 2 shows the electronic circuitry. The capacitive\ncoupling between the sensor and the object being sensed is used as the input capacitance tuning the oscillator\nfrequency. As an object comes closer, the capacitance increases and the oscillator"frequency decreases. On the other\nhand, the reflector is attached to the output of the voltage follower so it is electrically isolated and prevented from\naffecting the tuning of the oscillator frequency. At the same time, the voltage of the reflector follows that of the\noscillator. Thus, the reflector is in phase with (and reflects) the electric field of the sensor without being affected by\nthe coupling between the sensor and an approaching object.\n\n424\n\nSensor\n\n(a)w_loutreflector\nFig.\n\n1 : "Capaciflector"principle[3]\n\nReflector\n\n\'-_\n\ndriver\n\n"\n\nR1\n\nVo\n\nCT\nFig. 2 : "Capaciflector"circuitry[3]\nDETECTION\nWe will now examine the means by which the sensor detects an object[3]. The discussion will be limited to\nconductors for simplicity although dielectrics are also easily detected. Both the grounded and ungrounded (Fig. 1)\ncases will be examined. Since we have low frequency, (approximately 20 kHz), the quasi-static case holds.\nAssuming a momentary positive potential V in Fig. lb. we can see that the electric field lines emanating from the\nsensor towards the object induce negative charges on the object surface nearest the sensm\'. Thus that surface can be\nconsidered one plate of a capacitor and the sensor"the other. But, an ungrounded conductive object is charge neutral\nso an equal amount of positive charge will form on the surface away from the sensor so as to ensure that there is no\nnet electric field in the conductor. These charges couple back to ground which creates a second capacitor in series\nwith the one mentioned above. These are labeled in Fig. 2 respectively as:\n\n425\n\nCSO and Cog\nBut; there also is a path where the electric fields from the sensor can go axound the active shield and couple to ground\ndirectly. This is labeled as:\n\n%\nThus our tuning capacitance is:\n\nCso\n%\nCso, \xc3\xb7% .c,\n%\n\nO)\n\nIn the case where the object is grounded, equation (1) reduces to:\nCt = Csg + Cso\n\n(2)\n\nExamining equations (1) and (2) above, since we are looking for small changes in Ct it is clear we want Csg to be\nsmall. Therefore, we want the shield or reflector to force the field fines from the sensor towards the object as much\nas possible.\nWe now turn to the case where the object is not grounded [4,5,6]. We know:\n\nC= Q\n\n(4)\n\nWe also know that a good conductor must have the same potential everywhere on its surface. Therefore the potential\non the object will be that of its furthest point from the sensor, we will call the potential on the sensor V and the\nobject potential Vo. Thus we have:\n\nand\nv- vo=Cso -_o =%\n\n(5)\n\nwhere\n\nQ.\nI fficharge induced in the objecL\nIt is apparent that an object with any dimension more than a few inches in any direction (for example length) forces\nthe potential on the entire surface of the object to be very low. And, as the experimental evidence shows,in practice,\nall objects are approximately grounded.\n\n426\n\nElectric field details\n\nV\n\nGround\n\nFig.\n\n3\n\n:\n\nElectric\n\nF\n\nfield\n\ndetails[3]\n\nMODELING\nIn order to verify the experimental results, and to further iml_ove the sensor, a static electric field model was\ndeveloped. The objective was to determine the percentage change in frequency of the oscillator resulting from the\nintroduction of an object within the field of the capaciflector. The frequency of oscillation of the circuit in Figure 2\ncan be shown to be\nf-\n\nIn 0.5\n2R1C\n\nWhere: R3 = R4 = 2R 2\nThis implies\n\nAf\nfo\n\nAC\n\nt\n\nCto+ACt\n\nwhere fo and Ct 0 represent the frequency and the capacitance of the sensor in the absence of an object, and A f and\n\nA\n_t represent the change in frequency and capacitance respectively because of the introduction of an object.\nThe method of moments approach was chosen to determine the capacitances, as it allows one to model systems with\nno boundaries.\nThe modeling approach is therefore similar to that used by Volakis et al. [7]. In our case, the\nsystem consists of the grounded robot arm, the sensor shield, the sensor, and the detected object. The system is\napproximated by a two dimensional model -- we solve the problem for a cross section of the system assuming that\nthe system extends to infinity along the axis perpendicular to the plane.\n\n427\n\nIn this method, after discretizing the two dimensional system entities, each discrete element of length Ds with a\ncharge density of r, is approximated\nto a point charge of magnitude r Ds, located at the center of mass of the\nelement. The charge densities are then determined by solving the following set of M linear equations, M being the\ntotal number of elements in the system.\nM\n_Pm\n\nK nm = V n -\n\nV k ;n = 1,2,...,M\n\n,n ;_\n\nk\n\nm=l\nM\n__jA\n\nSm Pm = 0\n\nrn =1\nwhere V is the voltage of an element, Knm\nreference element.

One of the outputs the program provides is a data file for drawing\nthe frequency change vs distance plots for each such configuration.\nThe program was used to plot graphs for the four configurations shown in Fig. 5 which were tested in the\nlaboratory, and the results are shown in Fig. 6. The abscissa represents the distance of the object from the sensor,\nand the ordinate the percentage change in frequency.

The results of the experiment are shown in Fig. 7 and are similar to the model results.\nSince the computer model only simulates a two dimensional configuration, the results of the simulation assume\ninfinitely long strips of the sensor, reflector, and object. The experimental set-ups were similar; the sensors was\napproximately six inches long, the reflector approximately fo_\ninches long, and the object one inch in diameter\nand thirty six inches long. The reflector was made from strips of copper foil that could be connected in the\nconfigurations shown in Figure 5b. Subsequent testing has shown that the sensor must be shorter than the reflector\nto reduce end effects which substantially reduce sensitivity. The explanation is that the reflector must totally\nsurround the sensor to contain the field. Otherwise, the flux lines from the sensor will simply shift to the lower\nfield s_\'ength and return to the ground at the ends of the sensor, thereby reducing the coupling to the object.\n\n430\n\n8\n"\n\nI\n\n"\n\nI\n\n"\n\nI\n\n"\n\ni\n\n"\n\n6\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nObject distance\nFig.\n\nExperimental\nDISCUSSION\n\nresults\n\n[3]\n\nOF RESULTS\n\nThe results from the modeling and the experiment are similar. Both show the frequency change is inversely\nproportional to the object distance distance from the sensor. They both show that the sensitivity increases\ndramatically as the the shield width increases. The increase is approximately 7-fold for the experimental result and\n\nalmost 9-fold for the model.\nThe substantial difference shown between the modeled results and the experimental\nresults are probably due to our\nprimitive models used to date. The model program assumes infinitely long strips for the sensor, shield, and object,\nwhile our experiment\nused a 6 inch sensor with 14 inch shield. End effects or the short sensor may account for the\ndifference; our modeling has not progressed far enough to determine.\nThe rate of variation between the curves is\nalso different. The model shows almost no difference between the curves for no shield and shield=sensor\nwidth,\nwhile the experimental\nresults show a substantial difference.\nThis result may be entirely due to inaccuracies\nin the\nmodel. Similarly, there is a difference between the rate of change between the upper two curves on the graphs. The\nmodel shows an increasing rate of change difference while the experimental\nresult shows almost a constant difference.\nWe cannot presently account for this result, but it may be due to either the model or to electronic circuit limitations.\nThis latter conjecture comes from the fact that the frequency changes are substantial and nonlinearities\nmay limit the\nfrequency shift. Investigations\nare continuing.\n\n431\n\n7\n\nCommercial "Capaciflector"\n\n1 Inch (2.5 Era)\n\n0.5 Inch (1.3 C\n\nield\n\n/ ......\nFixture Mounting\n\n_...Sensmr Mounling\nSurface (Ground)\n\nSurface\n\nI\nFig.\n\n8:\n\nCommercial\n\n"Capaciflector"\n\nThe commercial "Capaciflector" (Fig. 8) should be as small as possible so that it can be placed in grounded, confined\nareas, the typical situation in industrial applications. Thus, its reflective shield will be smaller than that of the\nNASA space version and, accordingly, the range and sensitivity/dynamic range will be compromised. For a sensor 1\nin. dia and 0.50 in thick, we have measured a range of 7 in. ,when mounted on an insulator, 5 in. when mounted on\na conductor. This is still 5 to 7 times the range and sensitivity achieved by commercially available capacitive sensors\nin a package 1/2 the volume (to include the sensor head and electronics-signal amplification and filtering). Thus, we\nhave a significant increase in performance. In addition, the cost of fabrication will be much reduced. The sensor head\nand input/output leads is essentially a flexible printed circuit board. The electronics is ultra simple and straight\nforward and will be attached to the reverse side of the sensor.\nWith such an increase in performance, it seems sensible to have an analog signal which measures range in addition\nto the customary on/off switching output. Furthermore, the switching output will be electronically adjustable so that\nthe sensor can be calibrated at the worksite, in real time, to respond to any of several object shapes and materials at\nany of several ranges.\nThese features will permit the sensor to have unprecedented performance and flexibility. It will be able to be used in\nthe classic sense as a switching noncontact sensor. And, in this role, it will have a marked advantage over existing\nsensors with a greater range and superior signal to noise ratio in that range. Or alternately, it can provide a crisper,\nmore certain switching point at a less than maximum range to include a crisper detection of edges. And, with the\n\n432\n\nelectronically adjustable switching output, it will be able to be calibrated against a given object of a given material,\nat a given range in real time. This will result in exwaordinary operational flexibility, as well. It can be used to\ndetermine range, which is also unprecedented for industrial-type capacitive (or inductive) sensors. And, with the\nsuperior range available, close-in range determination now becomes practical. This, in turn, suggests an entire new\ndimension in adaptive control for automated techniques in robots and machine tools. For example, automated,\nmachine contour following will become practical. Also, robots and machine tools will be able to slow down just\nbefore contacting an object, switch from position control to force control mode before contact and thereby minimize\nthe shock inherent in contacting the object and the instabilities that attend. This will also minimize the need for\npassive compliance; add-on solutions that have been used in the past.\nSUMMARY\nThe NASA "Capaciflector" is well on its way towards becoming a central part of collision avoidance, docking and\nberthing and pre-contact force control in space and will be used extensively on robot arms, robot end effectors and\npayloads. It will also likely find uses inside robot mechanisms in support of their controllers. Thus GSFC has a\nlarge and growing in-house capability regards this sensor and this capability can easily be applied to the Commercial\n"Capaciflector".\n\n433\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.
