NASA\xe2\x80\x99s\nEnvironmentally Responsible Aviation (ERA)\nproject has set aggressive goals in these three\nareas including a noise goal of 42 dB\ncumulative below the Stage 4 certification level.\nThe goal for the reduction of oxides of nitrogen\nis 75% below the current standard. The fuel\nburn reduction goal is 50% below that of a\ncurrent state-of-the-art aircraft. Furthermore,\nthe overall goal of ERA is to mature\ntechnologies that will meet these goals\nsimultaneously and with a timeframe of 2020\nfor technical readiness. This paper outlines the\nkey technologies and the progress achieved to\ndate toward the goals.\n2. Reducing community noise \xe2\x80\x93 goal setting\nand identification of key technology areas\n2.1. Overview\nOver the last decade an increasing amount of\nresearch effort has been focused specifically on\nthe aeroacoustic effects related to advanced\naircraft configurations and to the associated\neffects of propulsion airframe integration\n(distinguished by the term Propulsion Airframe\nAeroacoustics (PAA)). This is recognition of\nthe opportunity for both noise reduction [2] and\nperformance gains. The opportunity is attributed\n\nboth to the growing evidence of the number of\nPAA effects as well as their magnitude. PAA\ncan include both reducing the noise sources that\narise specifically from integration of propulsion\nand airframe and using the installation itself as a\nmeans to reduce noise. From a research point of\nview, the challenges have been daunting, largely\na result of the far more complex experimental\nand predictive approaches required to address\nintegrated propulsion and airframe aircraft\nsystems. Furthermore, sufficient definition of\nthe aircraft and engine systems is required both\nin the formulation of experiments, for prediction\nmethods and then again to develop overall\naircraft noise assessment. However, those same\nsystem models, particularly for unconventional\naircraft, have been hampered by the lack of\nsufficient\nexperimental\nand\npredictive\ncapability.\nTherefore, to advance through these significant\nchallenges, NASA has emphasized all three key\nelements, those of PAA experiments, higher\nfidelity system noise prediction methods, and\nsystem assessment. The first two are the focus\nof this section as they relate more to the\nacoustics discipline. Furthermore, the PAA\nelement of ERA is pursuing a technology\ndevelopment cycle in three stages, an initial\npathfinding study (2003-2005), a critical stage\n(2008-2010), and currently a high fidelity stage\n(2008-2012). This three-stage process will aim\nto produce a relatively high level of\nunderstanding, technology readiness, and\nsystem noise benefit assessment for the Hybrid\nWing Body (HWB) concept in particular, and\nalso serve as a foundation for other advanced\nconcepts.\nThe key components of the\n1\n\nCOLLIER, ET.AL.\n\ndevelopment cycle, key results to date, and\nfuture plans are outlined in the sections below.\n2.2 Pathfinding Acoustic Assessment of HWB\nConcept\nWith the growing interest over the last decade in\nadvanced aircraft configurations that could\nenable a step change in noise reduction, there\nhave been several very successful international\nworkshops\nincluding\nthe\n8th\nCEAS\nAeroacoustics of New Aircraft and Engine\nConfigurations held in Budapest, Hungary,\nNovember, 2004 and the Revolutionary Aircraft\nfor Quiet Communities Workshop held in\nHampton, Virginia, USA in July, 2007. These\nworkshops showed a breadth of innovative low\nnoise aircraft concepts and prediction methods\nunder development. However, these workshops\nalso point out the many gaps in methods and\ndata that are required to perform high quality\nassessments of an advanced aircraft concept.\nFor these reasons NASA began a pathfinding\nstudy in 2003 focused on the hybrid wing\nconcept both for the obvious noise reduction\npotential but also because there was a growing\ndatabase related to the Boeing BWB, a\nrepresentative example of a HWB concept. The\nHybrid Wing Body aircraft configuration\nrepresents an unconventional aircraft concept\nthat introduces the fundamental change of\ninstalling the engines on top of the airframe and,\nin addition, producing lift with the fuselage\nitself with the implication of eliminating the\ntraditional high lift system with flaps. By\nthemselves, relative to the paradigm of\nconventional aircraft, these changes represent\nthe potential for a step change in noise\nreduction.\nThe primary objective of this NASA\npathfinding study was a basic understanding of\nthe PAA effects due to the differences in\nconfiguration between a conventional tube-andwing and the HWB. To accomplish this the two\nconfigurations were matched with the same\ncurrent technology turbofan engines and sized\nto meet the same mission requirements. The\nsecond objective was to understand the\nimplications for noise of the hybrid wing body\nconfiguration and assess the potential noise\n\nreduction achievable by using fewer and\nrelatively near term technologies. The study\nwas primarily performed by Geoffrey Hill of\nNASA and concluded in 2005 with only some\nelements of the study published [2,3] and the\nfinal results compiled in presentation form by\nThomas [4] in 2007. In contrast to flight\ndynamics or aerodynamics, this study was\nlimited by the almost complete lack of high\nquality acoustic data or prediction methods for\nmany of the aircraft components, a situation that\nis generally the case when attempting a\ncomplete noise assessment of an unconventional\naircraft. The shielding of engine sources, a key\nPAA effect representing much of the noise\nreduction potential of the HWB, could not be\ndone adequately at that time with prediction\nmethods. A detailed shielding experiment [5]\nalbeit with a simplified point noise source [6]\nand no flow effect was used to supply the noise\nassessment with the effect of shielding. Within\nthe constraints of this study, the baseline HWB\nwas assessed at a level of 22 dB cumulative\nbelow Stage 4 with aft radiated noise from the\njet and fan exit as the components clearly\nrepresenting the potential for additional noise\nreduction. The potential for noise reduction was\nassessed by moving the engines two fan nozzle\ndiameters upstream of the trailing edge to\nprovide some shielding surface for aft radiated\nnoise. Next, a significant assumption was made\nthat PAA technology from advanced chevrons\nand the pylon effect could, in the physical limit,\nmove jet noise sources, across the whole\nfrequency range, all the way to the nozzle exit.\nFinally, assuming complete success of this\nstrategy, the potential noise reduction of the\nHWB was assessed at 42 dB cumulative below\nstage 4. This result then became the basis for\nthe aggressive N+2 noise goal of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s ERA\nproject. This study showed that with a few key,\nrelatively near term PAA technologies, if\nsuccessfully developed and applied, the HWB\ncould produce a step change in aircraft noise\nreduction without a large array of higher risk\nand longer term technologies and operational\nchanges.\nThe pathfinding study resulted in setting the 42\ndB cumulative goal as well as a foundation for a\n2\n\nENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE AVIATION \xe2\x80\x93 REAL SOLUTIONS\nFOR ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES FACING AVIATION\n\ncritical stage of development that would require\nhigh fidelity, large scale experimental data and\nPAA technology for the key jet noise related\nsource (section 3). It would also require that the\nnext step in the aircraft system definition and\nsystem noise assessment be made in this critical\nstage (section 4).\n2.3. Critical Stage 2009 HWB PAA LSAF\nExperiment\nTo meet a critical level of experimental\ninvestigation of HWB aeroacoustics required an\nexperiment that focused on what was expected\nto be the most difficult noise source to predict\nand reduce, jet noise and it\xe2\x80\x99s PAA effects. This\nPAA experiment had to be large enough in scale\nfor both frequency scaling and high fidelity\ngeometry, include forward flow effect, and\ninclude the PAA effects through the relevant\npropulsion airframe integrated model geometry.\nBoeing in the Low Speed Aeroacoustics Facility\n(LSAF) accomplished this experiment [7] in\n2009. The LSAF was configured for a 9 ft by 12\nft free jet in the very large anechoic chamber\nwith far field polar angle microphones at three\nazimuthal angles and a high resolution phased\narray traversing system. There were three parts\nto the experiment. The first part used a high\nfidelity airframe model with flow through\nnacelles to document airframe noise sources\nincluding the slat, trailing edge, and elevon.\nThe second part used a broadband point source\nto produce a basic database of shielding for\npoint sources that could be an approximation for\nthe shielding of engine sources internal to the\nnacelle. The largest part of the experiment\nfocused on the key PAA effects of jet noise.\nThe objective was to provide an understanding\nof the shielding effectiveness as a function of\nengine gas condition and location as well nozzle\nconfiguration. A 4.7% scale separate flow\nnozzle of a bypass ratio seven engine was run at\ncharacteristic cycle points under static and\nforward flight conditions. The effect of the\npylon and its orientation on jet noise was also\nstudied as a function of bypass ratio and cycle\ncondition.\nThis critical stage study also selected the PAA\ntechnology for the nozzle system and developed\n\nthe PAA technology through configuration of\nthe nozzle and pylon system. PAA technology\noptions were selected based on prior PAA\nresearch\nof\ninterest\nfor\nconventional\nconfigurations, specifically the acoustic effect\nof the engine pylon [8-13] and unique PAA\nchevron nozzles designed to reduce source noise\n[14] including favorable interaction with the\neffect of the pylon [14-16].\nIn order to assess jet noise shielding, a planform\nrepresentation of the airframe model, also at\n4.7% scale was traversed relative to the jet\nnozzle from downstream to several diameters\nupstream of the wing trailing edge. Installations\nat two fan diameters upstream of the wing\ntrailing edge provided only limited shielding in\nthe forward arc at high frequencies for both the\naxisymmetric and a conventional round nozzle\nwith pylon. This was consistent with phased\narray measurements suggesting that the high\nfrequency sources are predominantly located\nnear the nozzle exit and, consequently, are\namenable to shielding. The mid to low\nfrequencies sources were observed further\ndownstream and shielding at these frequencies\nwas insignificant. Chevron designs generally\naim to reduce low frequency noise while at the\nsame time minimizing an increase in the high\nfrequency region. The design intent for the\nchevrons in this study considered the potential\nimpact of shielding through altering the location\nof jet noise sources. A more aggressive chevron\nwas designed with enhanced immersion to\nimpact the source locations more significantly\nwith the anticipation that the increase in the\nhigh frequency part of the spectra could be\nshielded.\nIn general, shielding effectiveness varied as a\nfunction of cycle condition with the cutback\ncondition producing higher shielding compared\nto sideline power. The configuration with the\naggressive chevron and a pylon oriented\nopposite to the microphones produced the\nlargest reduction in jet noise, a combination of\nreducing the source and relocating jet sources\nupstream for more effective shielding. More\ndetailed discussion of this database can be found\nin Czech, Thomas, and Elkoby [7] including the\n3\n\nCOLLIER, ET.AL.\n\neffects of point source shielding, additional\nshielding from vertical and elevon surfaces, and\nthe source and shielding effects from nozzle and\npylon technologies. This database provided the\nnew high quality data for critical elements of an\nupdated HWB system noise assessment in 2010.\n2.4. Critical Stage 2010 HWB System Noise\nAssessment\nThomas, Burley, and Olson [17] performed a\ncritical stage system noise assessment of a\nhybrid wing body configuration in 2010. They\nused updated NASA HWB aircraft [18] and\nturbofan engine models and the best available\nNASA system noise assessment method based\non ANOPP. The experimental results from\nCzech, Thomas, and Elkoby [7] were used for\nthe key noise sources and their interaction\neffects with the airframe to provide data directly\ninto the noise assessment where prediction\nmethods are still inadequate. NASA engine and\naircraft system models were created to define\nthe hybrid wing body aircraft concept as a twinengine aircraft for a 7500 nautical mile mission.\nThe engines were modeled as existing\ntechnology high bypass ratio (approximately 7)\nturbofans.\nThe potential for additional noise reduction with\nrelatively near term technologies was assessed,\nhowever, with high quality data and improved\nassessment methods compared to the\npathfinding study. Several configurations were\nstudied and the results are summarized in Figure\n1 in Effective Perceived Noise Level (EPNL),\n\nFig. 1. Critical system noise assessment results\nsummary from 2010 study [17].\n\ndB. The baseline HWB assessed at 22 dB below\nStage 4, a level that results primarily from lower\nairframe noise on approach (absence of flaps\nand a lower approach speed), shielding of fan\ninlet noise, and the faster climb on takeoff.\nConfiguration 2 reduces the aircraft noise to\n31.6 dB below Stage 4 due to simple shielding\neffect from the two diameters of shielding\nsurface that primarily impacts fan exit and core\nnoise but has little impact on jet noise.\nConfiguration 7 includes a package of\ntechnologies that can reduce source levels and\nimpact the source distribution so as to enhance\nthe effectiveness of the same shielding surface\nlength.\nThis configuration includes the\nadvanced PAA type of chevrons that reduce\nsource noise and also relocate sources upstream\nacross a wide frequency range. The standard\npylon with a known strong acoustic effect is\nrotated to the crown position above the nozzle\nand airframe resulting in a favorable azimuthal\ndirectivity of jet noise. Of course, an\nimplementation of this configuration would\nrequire a second pylon in the keel position of a\ndesign that creates a weak acoustic effect but\nwould also meet other vehicle requirements.\nThis could be accomplished in the simplest\napproach if the pylon could be closed out before\nthe exit plane of the core nozzle, or better before\nthe exit plane of the fan nozzle. Configuration 7\nalso takes advantage of the crown pylon by\nadding an acoustic liner to the wall surfaces of\nthe crown pylon, internal to the fan nozzle. The\nfan exit noise component is the second highest\ncomponent on both approach and cutback and it\ncould be further attenuated with the application\nof acoustic liner to the crown pylon. This\nincreases the area of acoustic liner in the bypass\nduct that can reduce fan exit noise and,\nfurthermore, projections of more advanced liner\ntechnology can be factored in based, in part, on\nprior computational results [19, 20]. Therefore,\nthe crown pylon can be a rare dual noise\nreduction device reducing jet noise as well as\nfan exit noise simultaneously. The resulting\nsystem noise of Configuration 7 showed a\ncumulative 40 dB below Stage 4.\nConfiguration 11 adds three additional\ntechnologies to address the noise components\n4\n\nENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE AVIATION \xe2\x80\x93 REAL SOLUTIONS\nFOR ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES FACING AVIATION\n\nthat are still highest after the effect of the\ntechnologies on Configuration 7.\nAdding\nprojected benefits from more advanced\nchevrons, pylon technology and, quiet landing\ngear, Configuration 11 adds 2.4 dB more noise\nreduction for a total of 42.4 dB below Stage 4.\nFigure 1 compares levels to the noise of the\nreference SOA configuration and to the noise\nlevel for an advanced technology tube-and-wing\naircraft. This advanced technology aircraft with\nultra high bypass ratio (BPR 16) engines\nmounted under the wing was assessed by\nBerton, Envia, and Burley [21] at 29 dB\ncumulative below Stage 4. Configuration 11,\neven with the existing technology high bypass\nratio (BPR 7) turbofan engine, meets the NASA\nN+2 noise goal of 42 dB and exceeds the\nadvanced technology tube-and-wing by more\nthan 13 dB.\nBy meshing the approach and takeoff flight path\ninformation for a simulated single event landing\nand takeoff, ground contours of sound exposure\nlevel (SEL) can be assembled. Figure 2 plots\nthe ground contours for the SOA aircraft and the\nHWB with Configuration 11.\nThe HWB\nconfiguration shows a dramatic reduction in the\narea within a given ground contour level. If the\narea of the SOA aircraft is normalized to 1.0,\nthen for the parameters of this calculation the\narea for the HWB C11 is 0.34 for an overall\nreduction of 66% in ground area. This\ncalculation clearly demonstrates the significant\npotential benefit to airport communities of the\nHWB aircraft designed for low noise.\n\nFig. 2. Calculated ground contours of Sound\nExposure Level (SEL), dB, for the state-of-theart reference aircraft and the HWB with\ntechnologies applied (C11) [17]\nSeveral conclusions were achieved at this\ncritical stage. Jet noise is the dominant\n\ncomponent at both cutback and takeoff\nconditions and is a particular challenge because\nof the distributed sources. The total installation\nof the jet through the combination of the pylon\norientation at the crown with the aggressive\nchevron design was very effective at reducing\nthe jet source level and increasing shielding\neffectiveness. Chevron technology has advanced\nrapidly in recent years for jet source noise\nreduction. The fact that chevrons can be\neffective at the combined objective of source\nreduction and relocating sources upstream,\nmaking the shielding more effective, opens a\nnew design space for integrated pylon and\nchevron technology. The benefit of the crown\npylon is especially valuable for its simultaneous\nimpact on jet source relocation and fan exit\nnoise attenuation. This benefit of the crown\npylon should be studied with higher fidelity\nexperiments and assessment because fan noise\nradiating from the crown area of the fan duct,\naway from the airframe, has a higher angle\nrelative to the airframe and is less likely to be\nshielded. The additional attenuation of fan\nnoise from the crown acoustic liner can mitigate\nthis.\nThis study has also identified the\nimportance of reducing landing gear noise at the\nsource.\nStarting from Configuration 11, additional\nreductions could be obtained from a few logical\napproaches. First, the verticals could be moved\nfrom the inboard position to winglets for a small\nnoise benefit and for the better aerodynamics of\nthe original HWB concept. This change in the\nverticals together with deflection of the elevons\nup would likely assess the concept at more than\n43 dB. Because jet (at sideline and cutback\npoints) and landing gear noise (at approach\npoint) would still be the dominant noise\ncomponents, the technologies relevant to\nreducing these sources and enhancing jet\nshielding should be advanced further. And\nfinally, considering a configuration that would\ninclude\nhigher\nbypass\nratio\nengines\n(approaching BPR 10) that are currently being\nintroduced into service (or even higher bypass\nratio engines being considered for application in\na few years) this next configuration should be\n5\n\nCOLLIER, ET.AL.\n\nable to exceed the 42 dB goal by a considerable\nmargin.\nA new configuration like the HWB does\nintroduce a new paradigm for noise reduction.\nEven with its inherent potential, a low noise\nHWB must be designed from inception with\nnoise as a goal in order to maximize the noise\nreduction especially including the propulsion\nairframe aeroacoustic technology developed\nsimultaneously for source reduction and\nincreased shielding effectiveness. The capability\nis growing to conduct additional trade studies\nfor low noise, efficient HWB configurations\ngiven the prior knowledge base from other\ndisciplines, the high quality experimental data\nand system noise assessment methodology\nassembled for this study, and the identified\nadvanced airframe, acoustic liner, and PAA\ntechnologies.\n2.5. High Fidelity ANOPP2 System Noise\nMethodology\nNASA introduced the Aircraft NOise Prediction\nProgram [22] (ANOPP) about 30 years ago to\nprovide a capability for predicting the noise\nfrom aircraft in flight. Since that time the\nANOPP system has continuously been used by\ngovernment agencies, academia and the aircraft\nindustry to assess aircraft noise and evaluate the\nnoise reduction potential of new technologies.\nANOPP relies primarily on semi-empirical\nmethods for predicting the various aircraft noise\nsources and hence is most accurate and\napplicable for those configurations in which the\nempirical\nmodels\nare\nbased.\nThose\nconfigurations are dominated by the basic tubeand-wing designs with under-the-wing mounted\nengines.\nApplication\nof\nANOPP\nfor\nconfigurations that deviate much from those\ndesigns is considered outside the range of\nvalidity for which the models were intended. To\nremedy this limitation, NASA is developing a\nnext generation aircraft noise prediction\ncapability called ANOPP2.\nThe objective of ANOPP2 is to provide a\nsystem noise prediction capability that is\napplicable to current and future aircraft designs.\nANOPP2 is being designed to be of varied-\n\nfidelity, ranging from the current empirical\nbased models to higher fidelity prediction\ncapabilities that can be used to provide accurate\nassessment of future designs and new\ntechnologies. The current ANOPP assumes that\nthe sources are at a single point, typically the\ncenter of gravity of the vehicle. The effects due\nto shielding or reflection of noise from the\nairframe are estimated using the ANOPP\nmethod based on Maekawa [23] or may be\nprovided to ANOPP as experimentally\ndetermined noise suppression. In contrast, the\nnext generation ANOPP2 will locate the noise\nsources at their true locations thereby allowing\nfor the effects of installation to be examined.\nThe\npropulsion\nairframe\naeroacoustic\ninstallation effects such as noise scattering and\nthose effects associated with flow interactions\nbetween components will be an integral part of\nthe noise source computation. Methods for noise\npropagation through the atmosphere will\naccount for changes in environment, such as\nwind and temperature gradients as well as\nvariable ground impedance and elevation. The\nengine and airframe noise prediction methods\nwill range from the current empirical methods to\nhigher order methods and be selectable by the\nuser based on the fidelity required. In order to\naccommodate and implement these ANOPP2\nfeatures and requirements an adaptable\nframework\nis\nbeing\ndeveloped\nthat\naccommodates\ncurrent/future\nprediction\nmethods, propagation algorithms, and flow\nsolutions components. At this time the\nframework is in its initial stages of\ndevelopment. Several capabilities including the\ncurrent ANOPP and advanced jet noise\nprediction codes have been implemented within\nthe ANOPP2 framework and are being tested.\nOf particular emphasis, critical to analysis of\nHWB configurations is the inclusion of\ncapabilities to predict acoustic shielding and\nscattering effects. The ANOPP2 options being\ndeveloped and validated for noise scattering\nprediction vary in fidelity and include a method\nbased on Kirchhoff diffraction theory [24], a jet\nnoise scattering method based on a wave packet\nnoise model coupled with a boundary element\nscattering method [25] and the Fast Scattering\n6\n\nENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE AVIATION \xe2\x80\x93 REAL SOLUTIONS\nFOR ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES FACING AVIATION\n\nCode, which is based on the equivalent source\nmethod [26].\n2.6. High Fidelity 14 by 22 Wind Tunnel\nHWB Validation Experiment\nWhile much progress has been made through\nthe pathfinding and critical stages of\ndevelopment, the next stage aims to achieve a\nhigher level of readiness by filling in significant\ngaps through a coordinated, interconnected set\nof efforts. These efforts include, first, a\nmultidisciplinary design of a low noise HWB\ndrawing on the experience of past efforts.\nSecond, development of prediction methods\nrelevant to unconventional aircraft that are then\nintegrated into ANOPP2. Third, a large-scale\nhigh fidelity experiment that includes the full\nHWB aircraft model with integrated airframe\nand propulsion simulation. And finally, the\nANOPP2 system noise prediction method will\nbe validated with the high fidelity experimental\nresults including EPNL system noise assessment\nto be compared with the 42 dB N+2 noise goal.\nA team funded by NASA and led by Boeing\nResearch and Technology [27] is developing\ntwo HWB aircraft concept designs referred as\nN2A and N2B with the basic airframe of both\nconcepts evolved from the original SAX40\naircraft of the Cambridge-MIT\xe2\x80\x99s Silent Aircraft\nInitiative [28]. The N2A configuration has twin\nhigh bypass ratio turbofan engines mounted on\npylons above the HWB airframe. The N2B is an\nembedded engine version of the HWB concept\nand will include boundary layer ingestion and\nadvanced engine architecture with a single core\ndriving multiple fans. Both concepts are\ndesigned to be HWB freighters with a payload\nof 103,000 pounds and a range of 6,000 nautical\nmiles. NASA is collaborating with the Boeing\nteam by providing engine system definition and\naircraft noise prediction expertise. The Boeing\nteam includes the Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology (MIT); the University of California\nat Irvine (UCI); and the United Technologies\nResearch Center. The university teams are\nfocusing much of their effort on developing new\nmethods to model and predict jet and\nturbomachinery noise shielding. Once validated,\nthese new prediction methods will be integrated\n\ninto NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Aircraft Noise Prediction\nProgram, or ANOPP2, which is itself being\nexpanded to incorporate prediction capabilities\nfor advanced vehicle designs such as the HWB.\nThe N2A configuration is the initial focus of the\nNASA HWB test program, with testing of the\nN2B configuration to follow in later years. The\nN2A HWB configuration is being designed to\nachieve the targeted noise reduction level of 42\ndB and a fuel burn reduction of at least 25%\nrelative to a conventional aircraft for the\nequivalent mission. At present, laminar flow\ncontrol is not included in the N2A design.\nLaminar flow will be required to achieve the\nfuel burn reduction goal of 40%, and will be\ninvestigated in future system studies and\nexperiments as a design iteration on N2A.\nNASA and the Boeing team are collaborating on\nthe plans for large-scale wind tunnel\naerodynamic and acoustic testing of the N2A\nHWB configuration. Initial testing in 2011 will\nexamine the basic aerodynamic characteristics.\nIn 2012, detailed aeroacoustic testing will\nvalidate the low noise characteristics of the N2A\ndesign. Subsequent tests will focus on much\nmore detailed aerodynamic and low speed flight\nstability and control characteristics. The\nobjectives of the aeroacoustic test will be to\ndetermine the noise spectral levels and\ndirectivity of the N2A HWB and its\ncomponents, and examine noise shielding\nparameters such as engine location, vertical tails\nand nozzle configurations to determine their\neffect on noise. Finally, results from this test\nwill be used to validate new acoustic shielding\nprediction methods being developed by MIT,\nUCI, and NASA as well as NASA\xe2\x80\x99s upgraded\nsystem noise predictive capabilities for multiple\naircraft noise sources.\nThe HWB aeroacoustics test will be conducted\nin the 14- by 22-Foot Subsonic Tunnel,\ncommonly referred to as the 14x22, at NASA's\nLangley Research Center in Hampton, Va. The\nwind tunnel test section will be configured for\nacoustic testing, with its side walls removed and\nthe ceiling raised and positioned well above the\nflow\xe2\x80\x99s shear layer. The test section floor will be\n7\n\nCOLLIER, ET.AL.\n\ndesigned specially to provide a streamlined\nsurface for the wind tunnel flow while\nmaintaining good aeroacoustic absorption. The\nfloor will be formed by lowering the model cart\nand mounting embedded acoustic wedges under\nan acoustically transparent surface. Surfaces\naway from the tunnel flow will be covered with\nstandard acoustic treatment. A full-span wind\ntunnel model of the N2A HWB with engine\nnoise simulators will be positioned inverted in\nthe test section. A traversing overhead phased\nmicrophone array as well as stationary\nmicrophones will be used to perform the\nacoustic measurements.\nThe wind tunnel model will be built by Boeing.\nIt will be a 5.8% scale, 12-foot span model. The\nmodel scale was determined by the wind tunnel\nsize and microphone frequency limitations. It\nwill allow acoustic measurements to be\nperformed over the full scale equivalent range\nof 230 Hz to 4.1 kHz (4 to 70 kHz, model scale)\nthat is critical to aircraft noise assessment. The\ntest model will have a modular design to\nmaximize testing capabilities. It will consist of a\nfixed wing to which various components such as\ncontrol surfaces, flow-through nacelles and\nlanding gear will be attached. The control\nsurface components will include a drooped and\na stowed leading edge to model high lift and\n\xe2\x80\x9cclean\xe2\x80\x9d wing configurations, twelve elevons\nthat will be deflected along the wing trailing\nedge to match specific flight conditions, and\nvertical fins of several sizes and dihedral angles\nwith movable rudders and multiple fuselage\npositions for the engine noise shielding study.\nThe modularity will also allow for the model\nsupport strut to attach to either the top or bottom\nsurface of the model for upright or inverted\ntesting, and the aft body section will be\nremovable to enable testing of other types of\nexhaust nozzles such as embedded engines. The\nhigh fidelity of the geometric details that are\nimportant to acoustics, particularly on the\nlanding gear assembly, the trailing edges and\ncontrol surfaces also will be emphasized.\nThe jet noise will be generated by two, dualstream, hot-jet engine simulators. The mid and\nrear portion of the simulators will match the\n\n5.8% scale nacelles of the N2A HWB. The\nfront-burner region of the simulators, along with\nthe air and propane supply lines and mounts,\nwill be faired to minimize effect on the HWB\nfuselage flow field. The simulators will be\nconfigured to match the engine bypass ratio and\noperating cycles of the N2A HWB design.\nEnclosed high-intensity broadband noise\ngenerators will be used to determine insertion\nloss due to shielding by the HBW airframe of\nthe fan and turbomachinery inlet and exhaust\nnoise. The broadband noise will be generated by\na series of opposing jet-impingement devices in\nthe open interior of specially designed engine\nnacelles. The nacelles inlet and exhaust will be\ncapped alternately to isolate noise radiation\nfrom either the inlet or outlet of the nacelles.\nThe inlets and exhausts also will be\ninstrumented with unsteady surface pressure\nsensors to monitor the noise source strength.\nAcoustic characteristics of jet-impingement\ndevices of different sizes and air pressures are\nbeing evaluated to determine the most suitable\ndesign.\nThe phased microphone array will consist of 97\nquarter-inch microphones flush mounted to a\nlightweight, 8-foot diameter, rigid circular\npanel.\nIntegrated\ninclinometers\nand\naccelerometers will be used to monitor tilt and\nvibration of the panel. A two-dimensional\ntraverse system will be used to position the\narray at different locations above the test model.\nThe array and the traverse structure will remain\npositioned outside of the test section flow and\nshear layer. The array traverse, as well as the\nmodel stand and the engine simulators\xe2\x80\x99 support\nhardware, will be streamlined, faired and\nacoustically treated where possible to minimize\nnoise and acoustic reflection. The acoustic\nphased array data will be processed using\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s advanced array processing method\nDAMAS, which stands for deconvolution\napproach for the mapping of acoustic sources.\nThis method is used to accurately quantify\nposition and strength of the noise sources. The\nresulting deconvolved array output is explicit\nand used to generate high spatial resolution\nnoise source localization maps. The phased\n8\n\nENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE AVIATION \xe2\x80\x93 REAL SOLUTIONS\nFOR ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES FACING AVIATION\n\nmicrophone array will be able to measure noise\nsources that are well below the wind tunnel\nbackground noise level.\nThe new jet engine noise simulators and the\nadvanced phased microphone array acquisition,\ntraversing and processing system, together with\nthe installation of new acoustic wall treatment,\nwill result in a major capability upgrade to the\n14x22 wind tunnel. This upgrade is necessary to\nmeet the unique acoustic challenges of\nmeasuring such a low-noise aircraft model.\nWhen completed, this aeroacoustic test will\nhave produced the first detailed noise mapping\nof a high fidelity geometry, HWB aircraft\ndesign using new advanced acoustic\nmeasurement capability, as well as a benchmark\nacoustic data base for HWB that is applicable to\nfull scale vehicles.\n2.7. Open Rotor Propulsion Airframe\nAeroacoustics\nUltra high bypass turbofan engines and open\nrotor engines both offer the prospect of further\nfuel burn reduction potential. Both engine\noptions also have system installation challenges\nthat are the subject of current study. The\nassessment of the integration effects for both\nengine options is essential to determining the\ntotal system performance and how the two\nengine options will compare. When open rotor\nresearch and development reached a peak in the\n1980\xe2\x80\x99s, the aircraft noise of open rotor engines\nwas seen as a significant issue. In the present\ntime, against the backdrop of lower aircraft\nnoise levels, currently and in the future; the\nnoise challenges for open rotors are more\nsignificant. Again, the assessment of propulsion\nairframe aeroacoustic integration effects is\nimportant for an accurate assessment of the\naircraft system noise. As discussed above, PAA\neffects also promise the potential for noise\nreduction with a favorable configuration and\ninstallation. Given the HWB study of Thomas,\nBurley, and Olson [17] showing the potential of\nmeeting the N+2 noise goal with a turbofan\nengine, the logical progression is to study the\nPAA effects for an open rotor to determine the\npotential of meeting the N+2 noise goal with an\nopen rotor HWB.\n\nFor this reason, ERA has funded Boeing to\nperform an open rotor PAA experiment in the\nBoeing LSAF patterned after the successful\nPAA experiment of Czech, Thomas, and Elkoby\n[7]. This open rotor PAA experiment is\nscheduled for late 2010. A 12-inch diameter\ncounter rotating open rotor rig will be the\npropulsion noise source. The PAA effects of\nthe open rotor with two aircraft types will be\nstudied to provide a more comprehensive PAA\neffect database. A state-of-the-art tube and\nwing aircraft and a HWB will be the two aircraft\ntypes. The open rotor rig will be positioned in\nvarious locations on both aircraft and the axial,\nheight, and spanwise spacing with respect to the\nairframe will be key parameters. The rig pylon\nwill be configured with trailing edge blowing as\na noise reduction device. Additional parameters\ninclude angle of attack, wind tunnel Mach\nnumber, and variations in the vertical surfaces\non the HWB. The speed of the front and aft\nrotors will be varied in order to impact the\nsource directivity pattern.\nThe effect of\nshielding of the airframes can be documented\nfor the different source directivity patterns\nthereby expanding the understanding of the\nPAA effects for open rotors.\nThis new database, together with updated open\nrotor source prediction methods and aircraft\nsystem models, will be used by NASA to assess\nthe system noise of HWB aircraft with open\nrotors and other potential unconventional\naircraft configurations.\n3. Reducing fuel burned \xe2\x80\x93 goal setting and\nidentification of key technology areas\nFuel burn reduction is a second key focus area\nfor ERA. In order to identify a feasible, yet\naggressive goal for this critical metric, a\nsystems analysis study was performed. A\nbaseline vehicle was identified and modeled,\nthen three advanced concepts were designed and\ntheir performance was compared to the baseline\nvehicle. The potential for a 50% reduction in\nfuel burn was estimated as a result of this study.\n9\n\nCOLLIER, ET.AL.\n\nThis section describes the technical basis for\nthis estimate.\n\nmore detailed description of the baseline\ncalibration modeling process utilizing FLOPS.\n\nThe 777-200LR with GE90-110B engines was\nselected as the baseline vehicle. This is a large,\ntwin-aisle long range transport in the passenger\nclass of interest to ERA. The 777-200LR was\nintroduced into service in 2006, however the\nfirst 777 entered service in the mid-1990\xe2\x80\x99s, and\nis representative of technology levels of that\ntimeframe. State-of-the-art technology is\nrepresented by the 787; however, calibration\ndata for the 787 is not yet available. Therefore,\nthe 777 was selected as the baseline due to the\navailability of calibration data. When 787 data\nis available, this baseline will be updated. A\n\xe2\x80\x9c777-200LR-like\xe2\x80\x9d baseline model was created\nutilizing geometry, weight, and performance\ndata found in reference [29]. The operating\nempty weight was obtained from reference [30].\nA baseline mission of 7,500 nm with maximum\npayload was selected as the calibration point.\nThe maximum payload of 118,100 lb is\ncomprised of 301 passengers in a three-class\nseating arrangement, their baggage, and\nadditional bulk cargo. A \xe2\x80\x9cGE90-110B-like\xe2\x80\x9d\nengine model was developed at the NASA\nGlenn Research Center utilizing their Numerical\nPropulsion System Simulation (NPSS) code.\nThe engine deck, geometry and mission\nparameters served as inputs to the Flight\nOptimization System (FLOPS) code, and the\nresulting performance estimates were compared\nwith the published data. Next, weight and drag\nestimates were adjusted to achieve a close\nmatch to the published data. These calibration\nadjustments are necessary to correct the model\nto account for \xe2\x80\x9cunknown unknowns\xe2\x80\x9d. In this\ncase, the empty weight was increased by 7.0%,\nand the overall drag was decreased by 3%. In\naddition, 11,600 lb of cargo container weight\nwas included, in order to match operating empty\nweight. These calibration adjustments are then\napplied to the advanced tube and wing\nconfiguration as well, in order to maintain\nconsistency. The resulting calibrated model for\nthe \xe2\x80\x9c777-200LR-like\xe2\x80\x9d baseline predicts TOGW,\nempty weight, and total fuel to within 0.25% of\nthe published values. See reference [31] for a\n\nTechnology increments were then applied to the\nbaseline model in order to create an advanced\ntube-and-wing design. The focus of ERA is on\ntechnologies with the potential to mature to\nTRL=6 in 2020, to support a 2025 entry into\nservice (EIS). These \xe2\x80\x9cN+2\xe2\x80\x9d technologies\ninclude advanced structural materials and\nconstruction concepts, advanced engines,\naerodynamic drag reduction techniques, and\nadvanced subsystems. In the materials arena,\nstitched composites have the potential to\nprovide significant weight savings compared to\nconventional sandwich composite construction\nor aluminum. Reference [32] highlights a\nspecific application of stitched composite\ntechnology, named Pultruded Rod Stitched\nEfficient Unitized Structure (PRSEUS), for the\ndesign of a hybrid wing body. PRSEUS, or\nother instantiations of stitched composites, are\nalso applicable to other aircraft concepts,\nincluding traditional tube-and-wing shapes.\nSandwich composites are assumed to enable a\n5% weight reduction to the fuselage compared\nto an all-metal design, and a 15% weight\nreduction for the wings and tails. Stitched\ncomposite construction (PRSEUS) is estimated\nto save an additional 10%, for a total weight\nsavings of 14.5% for the fuselage, and 23.5%\nfor the wing and tails. Additional structural\nweight savings are assumed for the wing by\nutilizing an active gust load alleviation system,\ndescribed in references [33] and [34]. This\nsystem is predicted to reduce the wing bending\nmaterial weight by 1.7% by actively utilizing\nthe aircraft\xe2\x80\x99s flight control system to counter the\neffects of gusts.\nAdvances in engine technology are expected to\nyield significant fuel burn reductions in the\n2025 timeframe. An in-depth design study was\nrecently completed with a major commercial\naircraft engine developer to model estimated\n2025 engine performance assuming a host of\nadvanced materials, cooling, sizing and\ninstallation technologies applied to ultra-high\nbypass ratio direct drive and geared turbofan\nengine architectures. This proprietary study\n10\n\nENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE AVIATION \xe2\x80\x93 REAL SOLUTIONS\nFOR ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES FACING AVIATION\n\nindicated that a specific fuel consumption (SFC)\nof 0.46 is feasible for this engine size, with an\ninstalled engine thrust-to-weight ratio of 4.\nThese estimates yield an engine capable of\nsignificantly lower fuel burn (and emissions)\ncompared to the baseline engine.\nAerodynamic technologies include laminar flow\ncontrol, riblets, and variable trailing edge\ncamber. In addition, the wing aspect ratio is\nallowed to grow from 9.8 (baseline) to 11\n(slightly higher than the 787) in order to\ndecrease induced drag. Laminar flow is a well\ncharacterized phenomenon that can provide\nsignificant reductions in skin friction drag.\nHowever, achieving laminar flow on swept\nwings operating at high Reynolds numbers is\nchallenging. Active flow control (e.g., suction\nsystems) can be utilized to achieve laminar flow\nin cases when fully natural laminar flow is not\nfeasible, however active systems require power,\nweight and volume. Hybrid laminar flow control\n(HLFC) combines elements of active flow\ncontrol with natural laminar flow (NLF) in an\nattempt to achieve the benefit of laminar flow\nwith minimum power, weight and volume\nincrements. Reference [35] provides an\nexcellent overview of this technology area. For\nthe HLFC system, 50% chord laminar flow was\nassumed for the wing upper surface, and both\nsurfaces on the horizontal and vertical tails.\nAlso, 50% chord natural laminar flow was\nassumed for the engine nacelles. The HLFC\nsystem weight was predicted to be 3,155 lb, and\na 0.2% fuel flow penalty was applied to account\nfor the energy required to operate the system. In\naddition, a 1% cruise drag penalty was assumed\nfor the NLF airfoil relative to an optimized\nturbulent airfoil design. No laminar flow was\nassumed for the wing lower surface, due to the\nuse of a Krueger flap. The Krueger flap enables\nthe required high lift performance for takeoff\nand landing, and also helps to shield the leading\nedge from contamination. Riblets are very\nsmall, flow-aligned grooves that can be applied\nto the aircraft surface to reduce turbulent skin\nfriction drag. Reference [36] describes flight test\nresults that demonstrated a 6% drag reduction.\nThis technology was applied to the turbulent\nfuselage to capture these projected drag\n\nreductions. Variable trailing edge camber\nutilizes a \xe2\x80\x9csmart\xe2\x80\x9d trailing edge consisting of\nsegmented flaps that are optimally deflected for\nminimum drag throughout the flight profile.\nReference [37] presents a design optimization\nstudy for a three-segment active trailing edge\nflap system. An overall drag reduction of 1%\nwas assumed for this technology.\nSubsystem improvements were assumed in the\nareas of hydraulics, controls and auxiliary\npower. Traditional hydraulic lines and actuators\nare replaced with wires and electromechanical\nactuators resulting in a 10% weight savings\ncompared to the baseline system. Reference [38]\nprovides an overview of this technology. In\naddition, the baseline auxiliary power unit\n(APU) is replaced by a solid oxide fuel cell/gas\nturbine hybrid system that runs during cruise as\nwell as on the ground. This advanced APU is\nassumed to provide a 1% reduction in fuel burn.\nReferences [39] and [40] provide additional\ndetails for this advanced system.\nUtilizing the calibrated baseline model as a\npoint-of-departure, each of the preceding\ntechnologies was applied one at a time, and the\nresulting fuel burn reductions were estimated. A\nfully optimized design, meeting all constraints\nand mission requirements, was produced for\neach of the technology increments. Finally, all\nof the technologies were applied simultaneously\nto represent the advanced tube-and-wing\nconfiguration. The total fuel burn reduction in\nthe \xe2\x80\x9call-on\xe2\x80\x9d case is less than the summation of\nthe incremental fuel burn reductions, as a result\nof the interactions between the technologies.\nThe results are presented in a \xe2\x80\x9cwaterfall\xe2\x80\x9d chart\nformat, see Figure 3. Reference [31] provides\nadditional details regarding this type of analysis\nand presentation format.\nThe hybrid wing body (HWB) configuration\noffers engine noise shielding, as well as the\npotential to further reduce fuel burn compared\nto an advanced tube-and-wing configuration.\nReferences [41] and [42] provide additional\ndetails on the HWB concept. Therefore, an\nadvanced HWB was modeled, following the\nprocedure described in Reference [31]. The\n11\n\nCOLLIER, ET.AL.\n\ncenterbody was sized for 301 passengers, and\npylon mounted, podded engines were installed\nabove the aft centerbody. A 12.8% weight\nincrement was applied to account for the pylon\nweight, and a 10% skin friction\n\ntherefore, centerbody laminar flow has the\npotential to make a significant contribution\ntowards fuel burn reduction. Laminar flow was\nassumed on the centerbody upper surface from\nthe leading edge to the BLI inlets. Increments\nfor weight (1.5 times the air conditioning\n\nFig. 3 \xe2\x80\x93 Advanced tube and wing waterfall\nchart.\nincrease was applied to account for the pylon\ndrag. The advanced technologies described\nabove for the tube-and-wing design were then\napplied to the HWB design. The only difference\nis the assumption of HLFC for the outer wing\nlower surface, due to the elimination of the\nleading edge high lift system. The HWB has a\nmuch greater wing area than a tube-and-wing\ndesign sized for the same mission, and it was\nassumed adequate low speed performance could\nbe obtained without a leading edge high lift\ndevice, enabling laminar flow on both the upper\nand lower wing surfaces. Figure 4 presents the\nHWB waterfall chart (HWB300A design),\nwhich shows an overall fuel burn reduction of\n49.8% compared to the 777 baseline.\nFinally, two additional technologies were\napplied to the HWB design; embedded,\nboundary layer ingesting (BLI) engines, and\nlaminar flow control on the centerbody upper\nsurface. Embedded BLI engines have been\nstudied for application to the HWB\nconfiguration in detail, and, if successfully\nintegrated, they may provide an increase in\npropulsive efficiency relative to the podded\nengine installation. See references [43] and [44]\nfor additional information. The HWB has a\nrelatively large centerbody surface area;\n\nFig. 4 \xe2\x80\x93 Advanced Hybrid Wing Body\nHWB300A waterfall chart.\nsystem weight) and fuel flow (0.2% fuel flow\nincrease) were assumed as well. Of course,\napplying laminar flow to the centerbody negates\nthe need for riblets, and reduces the embedded\n\nFig. 5 \xe2\x80\x93 Advanced Hybrid Wing Body\nHWB300B waterfall chart.\nBLI benefit. However, Figure 5 (HWB300B\ndesign) shows that the overall benefit of\ncenterbody laminar flow outweighs these\ndisadvantages, and a 5.5% reduction in fuel\nburn is estimated. This contributes to an overall\n12\n\nENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE AVIATION \xe2\x80\x93 REAL SOLUTIONS\nFOR ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES FACING AVIATION\n\nTable 1. Key Design Parameters\n\nreduction of 54.1% compared to the 777\nbaseline.\nBased on the results of the HWB modeling, a\nfuel burn reduction goal of 50% compared to\nthe 777 baseline was recommended. This\nrepresents an aggressive, yet feasible goal for\nthe 2025 timeframe. Table 1 summarizes key\ndesign parameters for the baseline model and\nthe three advanced designs.\n4. Reducing oxides of nitrogen \xe2\x80\x93 goal setting\nand identification of key technology areas\nThe fuel-flexible, low-NOx combustor task of\nthe ERA Project is developing concepts to\nreduce NOx 75% below the current standard of\nthe Committee on Aviation Environment\nProtection (CAEP) while reducing aircraft fuel\nburn by 50% and achieving perceived noise\nlevels 42 dB below Stage 4 limits. In order to\nsatisfy future efficiency and fuel burn goals, an\nadvanced cycle running to a high overall\npressure ratio is envisioned. The high pressure\nratio engines will increase the challenge of\nsimultaneously achieving the N+2 NOx goal.\nVarious promising combustor concepts are\nbeing investigated. Those concepts are: Lean\nDirect Injection (LDI); Partial Premixed\nInjection (PPPI); and Rich Burn/Quick\nMix/Lean Burn (RQL).\nIn addition to meeting N+2 goal for NOx,\nseveral key combustion technologies must be\n\novercome before those combustor concepts can\nbe developed. Those technologies are: ignition,\nlean blow out, turn down, efficiency, low power\nemissions, smoke, durability, exist temperature\nprofile, and pattern factor target.\nIn addition, several enabling technologies will\nalso be investigated.\nFor example, lean\ncombustion is susceptible to combustion\ninstability, so improved understanding of the\nfactors that influence and could mitigate\ndynamics will be needed. Reduced cooling\nairflow and higher inlet temperatures will drive\nthe need for Ceramic Matrix Composite (CMC)\nliners. CMC material property and durability\nare the key focus. Other enabling technologies\nthat will also be investigated are advanced\nignition and active combustion dynamics\ncontrol. Active dynamics control would allow\noptimization of fuel splits for combustor\nperformance and still maintain protection to\navoid combustion dynamics.\nThe other key goal to be addressed is fuel\nflexibility. ERA Project will investigate jet fuel,\nFischer-Tropsch, or hydrotreated renewable jet\nfuel. Testing of others suggests that synthetic\nfuels help to mitigate particulate and smoke\nemissions.\nCeramic Matrix Composite DevelopmentCeramic-matrix composites (CMC) offer\nopportunities for revolutionary changes in\npropulsion system design and operation. The\nlower density and higher temperature capability\nof CMC components, relative to that of metallic\n13\n\nCOLLIER, ET.AL.\n\ncomponents, offer multiple engine advantages,\nsuch as weight saving, efficiency and thrust\nimprovements, and reduced specific fuel\nconsumption. NASA has been developing\ndurable, high-temperature CMCs with silicon\ncarbide (SiC) matrices and SiC or carbon fibers\nfor high-temperature structural applications.\nThese SiC/SiC composites are designed to be\nlightweight (~30% of metal density). A key\nchallenge to the realization of SiC/SiC CMC\nhot-section components is the environmental\ndegradation of the CMCs in combustion\nenvironments. With the advances in the\ndevelopment of thermal/environmental barrier\ncoatings (TEBCs) for CMC applications, also\nunder the ERA program, the performance of\nCMC components has improved significantly.\nRecently, SiC/SiC CMC combustor liner and\nturbine vanes have demonstrated cyclic\ndurability at temperatures up to 1650\xc2\xb0C\n(3002\xc2\xb0F), a temperature significantly higher\nthan the thermal capability of metal alloys\n(~1093\xc2\xb0C or ~2000\xc2\xb0F).\nConcluding Remarks\nTechnology development paths have been\nestablished to pursue the noise, fuel burn, and\nemission reduction goals of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s\nEnvironmentally Responsible Aviation project.\nEnabling technologies are under development\nwith critical progress having been accomplished\nrecently by demonstrating that achieving the\nnoise goal of 42dB cumulative below Stage 4 is\nindeed feasible with relatively near term\ntechnology options integrated on a hybrid wing\nbody aircraft concept.\nSimultaneous\nachievement of all three goals is envisioned\nthrough\nthe\nintegration\nof\nadvanced\ntechnologies with the hybrid wing body aircraft\nconcept.\nAcknowledgement\nThe authors wish to thank the ERA and\nSubsonic Fixed Wing project teams for\ncontributions to this paper.\n\nReferences\n[1]\nBurleson, C., \xe2\x80\x9cAviation and the Environment \xe2\x80\x93\nManaging the Challenge of Growth,\xe2\x80\x9d Plenary presentation\nat the First NASA Fundamental Aeronautics Annual\nMeeting, New Orleans, LA, October 30, 2007.\n[2]\nHill, G.A. and Thomas, R.H., \xe2\x80\x9cChallenges and\nOpportunities for Noise Reduction Through Advanced\nAircraft\nPropulsion\nAirframe\nIntegration\nand\nConfigurations,\xe2\x80\x9d presented at the 8th CEAS Workshop on\nAeroacoustics\nof\nNew\nAircraft\nand\nEngine\nConfigurations, Budapest, Hungary, Nov. 11-12, 2004.\n[3]\nHill, G.A., Brown, S.A., Geiselhart, K.A., and\nBurg, C.M., \xe2\x80\x9cIntegration of Propulsion Airframe\nAeroacoustic Technologies and Design Concepts for a\nQuiet Blended Wing Body Transport,\xe2\x80\x9d AIAA Paper 20046306.\n[4]\nThomas, R.H., \xe2\x80\x9cSubsonic Fixed Wing Project\nN+2 Noise Goal Summary,\xe2\x80\x9d presentation at the NASA\nAcoustics Technical Working Group, December 4-5,\n2007, Cleveland, OH.\n[5]\nReimann, C.
