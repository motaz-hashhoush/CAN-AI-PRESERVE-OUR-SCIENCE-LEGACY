The associated technology has matured to the point where two lidar facilities, Geodynamics Laser Ranging System (GLRS), and Laser Atmospheric Wind Sensor (LAWS) were accepted for Phase 2 studies for Eos. A third lidar facility Laser Atmospheric Sounder and Altimeter (LASA), with the lidar experiment EAGLE (Eos Atmospheric Global Lidar Experiment) was proposed for Eos. The generic lidar system has a number of components. They include controlling electronics, laser transmitters, collimating optics, a receiving telescope, spectral filters, detectors, signal chain electronics, and a data system. Lidar systems that measure atmospheric constituents or meteorological parameters record the signal versus time as the beam propagates through the atmosphere. The backscatter arises from molecular (Rayleigh) and aerosol (Mie) scattering, while attenuation arises from molecular and aerosol scattering and absorption. Lidar systems that measure distance to the Earth's surface or retroreflectors in a ranging mode record signals with high temporal resolution over a short time period. The overall characteristics and measurements objectives of the three lidar systems proposed for Eos are given.", "title": "Lidar instruments proposed for Eos", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T15:30:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19900017829, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Grant, William B."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Langley Research Center", "location": "Hampton, VA, United States"}}, "id": "ec47e65001634b8a97a3d1b5f723eab3"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19900017829, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Browell, Edward V."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Langley Research Center", "location": "Hampton, VA, United States"}}, "id": "17051af4bd64423e9b36378a27e76312"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19900017829, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19900017829, "id": "b7e3dc03f0f643b7951aba7ffebada44", "publicationName": "Earth Sciences Requirements for the Information Sciences Experiment System", "publicationDate": "1990-07-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19900017829.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19900017829/downloads/19900017829.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19900017829/downloads/19900017829.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19900017829/downloads/19900017829.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
