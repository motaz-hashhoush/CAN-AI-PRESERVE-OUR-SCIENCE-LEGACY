Currently, it is envisioned that a portion of the component and system testing will be pursued at NASA Stennis Space Center (SSC). To realize the greatest benefit of the test data, uncertainty analyses are being performed on the relevant RBCC components and systems to be tested at NASA SSC to ascertain the needed measurement requirements. These studies pertain to the existing E-Complex test stands as well as a new facility, E-4. This paper describes the approach used in the studies and gives examples to demonstrate the approach and the usefulness of the results. Future work will greatly increase the reliability of the test data while minimizing costs by focusing expenditures in the proper areas that are critical to program success and not allowing resources to be wasted in areas that are not significant relative to overall program goals.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20040051127, "endDate": "2002-07-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Society for Electrical Engineers", "location": "United States"}}, "meetingId": "b18712604db643998e67479841829c5d", "id": "2893cec9a23f40df9628431937e75c78"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "United States"}}, "meetingId": "b18712604db643998e67479841829c5d", "id": "f755f5eceaf447aa8ba46cb7a11ca79e"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Society of Mechanical Engineers", "location": "United States"}}, "meetingId": "b18712604db643998e67479841829c5d", "id": "805e5a9b315547c0a9476b5917682759"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.", "location": "United States"}}, "meetingId": "b18712604db643998e67479841829c5d", "id": "d380f562dd1c4c48b0dec12756a64555"}], "name": "38th AIAA/ASME/SAE/ASEE Joint Propulsion Conference", "location": "Indianapolis, IN", "id": "b18712604db643998e67479841829c5d", "startDate": "2002-07-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20040051127, "id": "700b58af41af423e8ff53709b0d8bddf", "publicationDate": "2002-06-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20040051127.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20040051127/downloads/20040051127.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20040051127/downloads/20040051127.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20040051127/downloads/20040051127.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
