The sequence of events which would occur in the process of building an infrastructure is examined. The human needs which must be met on a lunar base are discussed, including minimal life support, quality of life, and growth stages. The technology available to meet these needs is reviewed and further research in fields related to a lunar base, such as the study of the moon's polar regions and the limits of lunar agriculture, is recommended.", "title": "Development of a lunar infrastructure", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-13T23:53:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19890024186, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Burke, J.
