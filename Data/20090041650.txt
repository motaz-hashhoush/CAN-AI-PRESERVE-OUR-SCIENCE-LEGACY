The core of the system is\na wiped-film rotating-disk (WFRD) evaporator, which removes inorganic salts\nand nonvolatile organic compounds\nfrom the wastewater stream and concentrates these contaminants into a recycleand-bleed stream. The WFRD evaporator is also part of a subsystem that distills\nwater from the wastewater stream. This\nsubsystem operates in a vacuumvapor/compression distillation configuration in the temperature range from 20\nto 65 \xc2\xb0C. Volatile organic compounds\nand ammonia, distilled along with water,\nare oxidized to CO2, H2O, and N2O in a\npacked-bed, high-temperature catalytic\nreactor placed at the outlet of the vaporphase compressor of the distillation subsystem. A VPCAR engineering demonstration unit is expected to be included\nin a human-rated simulation of a mission to Mars.\nThis work was done by Michael Flynn,\nJohn Fisher, and Mark Kliss of Ames Research Center; Bruce Borchers of Orbital Sciences Corp.; Badawi Tleimat and Maher\nTleimat of Water Reuse Technology Inc.; and\nGregory Quinn, James Fort, Tim Nalette,\nGale Baker, and Joseph Genovese of Hamilton\nSundstrand Space Systems International,\nInc.

The first report discusses proposed\noptoelectronic tracking of retroreflective\nobjects located at intervals or of retroreflective coats along the entire length of a\ntether to measure lateral motions. The\nsecond report describes digitally controlled spooling machinery that retracts\nor extends a tape tether at controlled\nspeed and tension in the spool isolated\nfrom uncontrolled tension on the outside. The third report discusses part of\nthis machinery that pivots to accommodate misalignments between the deployed and spooled portions of the tether\nand contains rollers used to exert tension\nand speed control. The fourth report discusses aspects of designs of proposed\nelectrodynamic tethers, which would be\nelectrically conductive and would interact\nwith the magnetic field of the Earth to\nexert forces to modify orbits of deploying\nspacecraft. The fifth report discusses electrical aspects of designs of electrodynamic tape tethers, including the use of\nsolar cells or motional electromagnetic\nforce to generate currents in tethers and\nthe use of electron emitters and electron\nand ion collectors at opposite ends of\ntethers to make electrical contact with\nthe thin plasma in surrounding space.\nThis work was done by Andrew Santangelo\nand Rich Sturmfels of The Michigan Technic\nCorp. and Neal Rothwell of Double R Controls for Marshall Space Flight Center.

The design incorporates a nuclear fission power system to provide long range, long life, and\nhigh power capabilities unachievable\nthrough the use of alternative solar or\nradioisotope power systems. The concept described in the report draws on\nprevious rover designs developed for the\n2009 Mars Science laboratory (MSL)\nmission to minimize the need for new\ntechnology developments.\nThe surface fission power system that\nwould be used consists of a 15 kW (thermal) heat-pipe-cooled reactor coupled\n\nwith a Stirling generator to provide 3\nkW of electrical power. This power system would be compact enough to fit\nreadily into prior rover chassis concepts, allowing further adaptation of\npreviously designed MSL elements, including the aeroshell and pallet lander\nsystem, with modifications to support\nthe significant mass added by the nuclear reactor and its associated shielding. The estimated mass of the fission\npower system, including its mission-specific shielding, is 1,169 kg.\nThis work was done by John Elliott of Caltech, Dave Poston of Los Alamos National\nLaboratory, and Ron Lipinski of Sandia National Laboratory for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory.

NPO-30865\n\nFormation-Initialization Algorithm for N Spacecraft\nA paper presents an algorithm to initialize a formation of N distributed\nspacecraft in deep space. Such formations will enable variable-baseline interferometers in future NASA missions designed to study the structure and origin\nof the universe. The algorithm described in the paper reflects some basic\nassumptions:\n1. Each spacecraft is capable of omnidirectional radio communication with\nany other spacecraft,\n2. Each spacecraft is equipped with a\nlimited field-of-view sensor relative position sensor (RPS) to measure the\nrelative positions and velocities of\nother formation members, and\n3. Spacecraft maneuvers must satisfy\nSun-angle pointing constraints to\nshield sensitive optical equipment\nfrom direct sunlight.\nThe formation initialization algorithm proceeds by first dividing the\nspacecraft into two groups with anti-parallel RPS sensor boresights. Next, the\nspacecraft perform a three-phase (inplane, out-of-plane, and near-field) sky\nsearch involving synchronized maneuvers to ensure full sky coverage while\nmaintaining front-to-front, simultaneous\nRPS sensor lock. During the sky search,\nthe spacecraft are grouped into two\nclasses of sub-formations. The initialization problem is then reduced to the simpler problem of joining the sub-formations. The paper includes an analytical\n\n35\n\n'
