The length of the weather interruption is one of the main influences determining the size of the storage needed to save the data to be sent at a later time. This analysis uses the Markov chain probabilities for weather to determine how many cloudy or rainy time steps in a row will not allow data transmission. The mean and standard deviation are computed, which along with the average data rate to be sent can be used to help size storage buffers in which to save data between periods of good weather.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20180005295, "id": "3038ec5ae3ef4d88802010aaba7a911c", "publicationDate": "2018-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20180005295.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20180005295/downloads/20180005295.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20180005295/downloads/20180005295.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20180005295/downloads/20180005295.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
