COTS Project established to implement policy. COTS strategy: Phase 1) Assist industry with system development/demonstrations (COTS Demos); Phase 2) Procure commercial services for ISS logistics support. COTS Demonstrations competition completed in 10 months. Two industry partners selected for funded Space Act Agreements: 1) SpaceX & Rocketplane-Kistler; and 2) Unfunded Space Act Agreements in work with other competitors. COTS budget of $500 M thru 2010, with pay for performance milestone approach. Cargo flight demonstrations planned for 2008 and 2009: Crew flight demonstration options for 2011-2012. Commercial cargo transportation services potentially available as early as 2009-2010. Successful COTS partners may open new space markets and provide reliable, cost effective cargo and crew transportation services, a new era for commercial space.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "Germany", "submissionId": 20060050052, "endDate": "2006-11-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "Multilateral Medical Operations Panel", "location": "Cologne", "id": "1697016a9dc848fabc0dd3b588e59b66", "startDate": "2006-10-30T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20060050052, "id": "49edbd2788604d9198a9879e094316a6", "publicationDate": "2006-09-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20060050052.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20060050052/downloads/20060050052.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20060050052/downloads/20060050052.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20060050052/downloads/20060050052.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
