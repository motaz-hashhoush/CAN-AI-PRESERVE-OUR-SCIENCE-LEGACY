b'Final: Approved for release by MSFC Export Control On 3/22/13\n\'Snow White\' Coating Protects SpaceX Dragon\'s Trunk Against Rigors of Space\nHe described it as "snow white." But NASA astronaut Don Pettit was not referring to the\npopular children\'s fairy tale.\n\nRather, he was talking about the white coating of the Space Exploration Technologies\nCorp. (SpaceX) Dragon spacecraft that reflected from the International Space Station\xe2\x80\x99s\nlight. As it approached the station for the first time in May 2012, the Dragon\xe2\x80\x99s trunk\nmight have been described as the "fairest of them all," for its pristine coating, allowing\nPettit to clearly see to maneuver the robotic arm to grab the Dragon for a successful\nnighttime berthing.\n\nThis protective thermal control coating, developed by Alion Science and Technology\nCorp., based in McLean, Va., made its bright appearance again with the March 1 launch\nof SpaceX\'s second commercial resupply mission. Named Z-93C55, the coating was\napplied to the cargo portion of the Dragon to protect it from the rigors of space.\n\n"For decades, Alion has produced coatings to protect against the rigors of space," said\nMichael Kenny, senior chemist with Alion. "As space missions evolved, there was a\ngrowing need to dissipate electrical charges that build up on the exteriors of spacecraft,\nor there could be damage to the spacecraft\xe2\x80\x99s electronics. Alion\'s research led us to\ndevelop materials that would meet this goal while also providing thermal controls. The\noutcome of this research was Alion\'s proprietary Z-93C55 coating."\n\nKenny said Alion thoroughly tested the newly formulated coatings in the lab and\nprovided them for NASA\'s Materials International Space Station Experiments (MISSE)-1\nand 2 for further evaluation. MISSE-1 and 2, a test bed for materials and coatings flown\non the outside of the station, evaluated the effects of atomic oxygen, direct sunlight, and\nextremes of heat and cold. The experiment allowed the development and testing of new\nmaterials to better withstand space environments, and the results provided an improved\nunderstanding of the durability of various materials when they are exposed to the space\n\nenvironment.\n\n"Z-93C55 performed beyond expectations on MISSE, so it is now a viable alternative to\nthe standard thermal control coatings," said Kenny. "The flight data provided through\nthe MISSE experiments was essential to its development."\n\nNASA\'s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., was responsible for performing\nthe pre- and post-flight measurements of these coating materials.\n\n"We measured the optical properties the same as we would for flight hardware, before\nand after the MISSE flight," said Miria Finckenor, Marshall engineer and MISSE\ninvestigator. "We also looked for any mass loss, any cracking or flaking, and any\nchanges in fluorescence due to space environmental effects.\n\n"The optical properties needed to be stable," added Finckenor. "If the coating darkened,\nthen the capsule would be warmer, causing any active thermal control system to work\nharder, which could limit the life of the thermal control system and thus the life span of\nthe spacecraft."\n\nZ-93C55 is a two-part system consisting of a pigment and a binder solution. Special\nadditives enhance electrical conductivity without affecting thermal control properties, so\nthe cured coating can handle high temperatures and survive the stresses of launching.\n\n"The coating is actually an improved version of our Z-93P coating, which has had a long\nhistory in the aerospace industry," said Kenny. "It was used on Apollo missions, the\nstation\'s radiators and many other missions. Z-93C55 is a thoroughly tested and\nqualified material, having gone through extensive testing in space simulation chambers\nand experimental missions."\n\nThe coating also was used on NASA\'s Juno, Gravity Recovery and Interior (GRAIL) and\nMars Reconnaissance Orbiter missions, among others.\n\nBecause shipping aerospace hardware to coating facilities is often challenging, costly\nand time consuming, the Alion engineers created a portable coatings application system.\nThis unit can be easily transported to anywhere in the world efficiently and is much\nmore cost-effective. Experts sprayed more than 250 square feet of coatings -- about 10\ngallons for each trunk -- onsite at SpaceX facilities in California and Florida to prepare\nfor launch.\n\n"When most people think about coatings, they\'re probably thinking about paint that\nmakes their bedroom or kitchen look good, or a shiny coat of wax for their car," said\nKenny. "But we get to work on coatings that help critical systems perform better and last\nlonger, in space and here on Earth. And that means we\'re helping important missions of\nall kinds succeed, every day."\n\nBy Jessica Eagan\t\nInternational Space Station Program Science Office\nNASA\'s Marshall Space Flight Center\t\n\nPost video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDGKwKDbphc&feature=youtu.be\nCutline: NASA astronaut Don Pettit talks about Alion Science and Technology Corp.\'s\nprotective thermal control coating being snow white beginning at 2:22.
