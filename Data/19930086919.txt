H. Madelung has given an illustration of such\n\nproc~dure\n\n.\n\n1:J. A. C.

E.\n\nIt \'is therefore very logical that Dr.\n\nPrandtl\'s theories shall be ela.borated upon to a considerable extent further along in these articles.\nNaturally after the publication of German records the French\nand English were desirous of trying their hands.\n\nConsequently,\n\nthe year 1922 saw some very fine flights in those countries.\n\nA\n\ngroup of students from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nconstructed a glider for entry in one of the French competitions.\nThis was probably the first serious American attempt at soaring\nsince the Wright\'s experiments at Kitty Hawk,\n\nThe greatest re-\n\nsult of these trials was not that fine records were obtained but\nthat they gave birth to the light airplane idea.\nThe Europeans thought that if they could make such wonderful\nflights relying solely upon the wind for the power of suste:i.1tation,\nby installing a small auxiliary engine they might solve the problem of cheap and practical aviation.\n\nConsequently, at the Lympne\n\ncompeti tion in England during the fall of 1923, and at various\nFrench trials somewhat earlier we have the\nlight airplane.\n\nViewed in the light of our\n\nad~jent\n\nof the so-called\n\ny~owledge\n\na few years\n\nago the 1923 single seater light airplane was a revelation.\n\n,.\n\nAl-\n\nthough nearly every meet was marred by incessant engine trouble\nthe results obtained exceeded the wildest expectations.\n\nThe\n\nFrench very quickly developed small engines for their craft\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nbut the English were forced to rely upon standard motorcycle engines, which proved hardly suitable for full power airplane serv-\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nN.A.C.A.

Munk, in N.A.C.A. Tech-\n\nnical Note No. 94, has worked out a formula for propeller diameter,\n\nD,\n\nbased upon this theory.\n\nLet\n\nPM\n\n= Power\n\nof engine at\n\nN = Revolutions per minute of propeller\xc2\xb7 shaft.\n\n= Velocity in miles per hour at which the p-rope11er\nefficiency is desired to be a maximum, normally\nthe designed high speed of the airplane.\n\nD\n\n= Propel1~r\n\ndiameter in feet.\n\n3 (P;;-\n\nThen D =564/\n\'.\n\nIn\n\n(8)\n\n-\n\nIf equation (8) gives a diameter such that .0524DN exceeds\'\n820 ft. per sec., the diameter will have to be reduced until that\nlimit is not exceeded.\n\nThis is due to the fact- that as the speed\n\nof the propeller tips appr\'oaches the velocity of sound the cornpressibi1ity of the air becomes a noticeable factor and lowers\n,\n...\n\nthe efficiency very rapidly.\n\nEquation.(8) will give diameters\n\nin excess of present practice, which is based upon the assump-\n\n..\n\ntions that 1/2 the diameter divided by the maximum blade width\nshall be approximately\n\n6.\n\nThat is, with the diameter above corn-\n\nN.A.C.A. Technic(ll Memorandum No. 311\n\n29\n\nputed, the maximum blade width will be smaller than present pract ice would allow.\n\nDue to the fc.ct t:1U t t:1e weight and\n\nt~1rust\n\nare\n\nlow, the stresses imposed upon the light airplane propeller permit this increased ratio of diameter to blade wiQth.\n\nThe reason-\n\ning is similar to that which allows a larger span in proportion\nto weight for a light airplane than for the-larger type.\nThe pl\'opeller used on the D-J-l 1;\'[as 58 inches in diameter\nand but\nienced.\n\n3t\n\ninches maximum\n\n~idth.\n\nNo trouble whatever was exper-\n\nWeros, grass, etc. ,had no appreciable effect except to\n\nwear the fabric tips.\nThe influence of increasing the diameter is two-fold.\n\nThe\n\nslipstream velocity is less and therefore the energy losses are\nalso decreased TIith a consequent increase in propeller efficiency.\nThe velocity of the slipstream being less and distributed further\naway from the fuselage causes less interference between the body\nand propeller.\n\nBoth of these considerations make for better all\n\naround performance.\nA numerical example will serve to show more clearly the differances between ordinary practice and diameters given by equation\n(8) \xe2\x80\xa2\n\nVD = 95 miles per hour.\nN = 3000 revolutions per minuteo\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nD\n\n1\nH.
