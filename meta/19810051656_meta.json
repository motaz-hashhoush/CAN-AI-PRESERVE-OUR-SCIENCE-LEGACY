The atmospheric regions susceptible to rocket exhaust effects are examined. The major perturbations occur in those regions where the sun's radiation causes partial ionization to occur. These regions include the D, E, F1, and F2 regions of the ionosphere. It is found that the dominant cause of atmospheric perturbations due to rocket exhaust rests in the variety of chemical reactions that can occur between the exhaust material (usually molecular species, e.g., H2O, H2, CO2) and the neutral and ionized components of the atmosphere. The observational evidence for artificially-induced ionospheric modifications is discussed and a description is presented of physical processes responsible for ionospheric holes. Attention is given to scientific and technological interest in artificially-created ionospheric holes, and to the large-scale, artificially-induced depletion of the earth's ionosphere which could be monitored in connection with the launch of NASA's third High Energy Astrophysical Observatory.", "title": "The effect of rocket launches on the ionosphere", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-11T04:35:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19810051656, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Mendillo, M."}, "organization": {"name": "Boston University", "location": "Boston, Mass., United States"}}, "id": "bee1c68c3cdb40bcb4d0a6dc75e4cdb4"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19810051656, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19810051656, "id": "bbd2f10caad14bbc9b0efff5496cd872", "publicationDate": "1981-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
