Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Florida. The activities summarized include: 1) Annual Hot Spot 1 (HS1) eastern bioremediation interim measure (IM) performance monitoring (December 2019); 2) Annual HS1 western bioremediation IM performance monitoring (December 2019); 3) Annual Interim Groundwater Monitoring (IGM) activities (December 2019); 4) Sub-slab soil gas (SSSG) sampling to investigate potential vapor intrusion (VI) (June 2019). Bioremediation IM activities were implemented in two phases at the CRHE. The first event was implemented in November and December 2016 in the eastern portion of HS1. In April and May 2018, bioremediation IM was implemented in the western portion of HS1. The bioremediation IM targeted chlorinated volatile organic compound (CVOC) concentrations greater than 10 times their Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) Natural Attenuation Default Criteria (NADC). Bioremediation IM activities included the injection of a diluted solution of SRS\u00ae-SD\n(electron donor) and microbial culture (KB-1\u00ae) into the subsurface via direct push technology\n(DPT) injection down to 50 feet below land surface (ft bls).", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "", "submissionId": 20205001518, "nctsn": "", "name": "", "location": "", "id": "aa7f09d78b8b49a98cb1ec7fb6107a34", "url": ""}], "status": "CURATED", "publications": [{"issue": "", "isbn": "", "eissn": "", "url": "", "volume": "", "submissionId": 20205001518, "issn": "", "publisher": "", "id": "9c680d519b034cea87018c35efe873d7", "eisbn": "", "publicationName": "", "publicationDate": "2020-05-30T04:00:00.0000000+00:00", "doi": ""}], "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "CRHE_Perf_Mon_and_IGM_Rpt_202004 Optimized.pdf", "notes": "Information is data sets, document is clear", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20205001518/downloads/CRHE_Perf_Mon_and_IGM_Rpt_202004%20Optimized.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20205001518/downloads/CRHE_Perf_Mon_and_IGM_Rpt_202004%20Optimized.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20205001518/downloads/CRHE_Perf_Mon_and_IGM_Rpt_202004%20Optimized.pdf.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
