Pre-calibrated, engraved\nwavelength scales and a large aperture\nsimplify alignment and tuning.\nThey\'re everything you\'d\nwant in optical isolators: the most\nprotection for your diode laser,\nthe most convenience for you.

A scientist at the General Motors Research\nLaboratories has identified how these filaments grow and why they take\ntheir characteristic form.\n\nD\n\nFIGURE 1: Scanning electron micrograph of a\ncross sectiOlI of a vapor-grown carbon fiber.\nFIGURE 2: Typical carbon filament grown from\nnatural gas by an iron catalyst particle.\nFIGURE 3: Schematic model showing inner and\nouter radii, the precipitation inter/ace, and the\nnested basal planes of the outer surface.\n\nFig. 2\n\nr. Gary Tibbetts was measuring the diffusion rate of carbon\nin iron when his carefully planned\nexperiment took an unexpected tum.\nDr. Tibbetts, a physicist at the\nGeneral Motors Research Laboratories, had been introducing carbon to\nthe inside surface of a hot stainless\nsteel tube while extracting carbon\nfrom the outer surface.\nAt the end of one particular trial,\nhe found the inside surface covered\nwith a mass of black "whiskers." His\ninitial investigations verified that the\nfibers were made of carbon and that\nthey had characteristics typical of the\ncrystal structure of graphite. But the\nquestion of how they formed was not\nso easily answered. The search for an\nanswer would change the course of\nhis investigation and dominate his\nresearch for the next ten years.\n\nThe fibers that surprised Dr.\nTibbetts were made up of concentric\nlayers primarily composed of basal\n(0001) plane graphite, resembling in\ncross section the annular rings of a\ntree (Figure 1). Research showed\nthat they were formed by vapor deposition of carbon on a hollow central\nfilament. The central filament itself\nwas grown by catalytic action on a\nsmall metal particle (Figure 2).\nThese long, slender, uniform filaments had been widely observed\nsince the availability of the electron\nmicroscope. Still, no valid explanation\nhad been advanced to account for\ntheir hollow structure. Many scientists thought that surface diffusion of\ncarbon-containing molecules around\nthe catalytic particle caused the\nhollow core.\nInstead, Gary Tibbetts proposed a model in which carbon atoms\nfrom decomposing hydrocarbons diffuse through the bulk of the catalytic\nparticle and precipitate as graphite in\nthe growing filament. The diffusion\nprocess is driven by the carbon\ngradient-the difference between carbon concentrations at the adsorbing\nsurface of the particle and at its\nopposite, precipitating surface\n(Figure 3).\nThe exterior surfaces of these\ncarbon cylinders expose the basal\nplane of graphite because the (0001)\nplane has a surface free energy at\n970\xc2\xb0C of about 77 erg cm-2, while a\ntypical surface perpendicular to the\nbasal plane has a surface energy in\nexcess of 4000 erg cm- 2 \xe2\x80\xa2 The free\nenergy required for filament growth,\n\ntherefore, will be a minimum when\nthe exterior surface is made up of\nbasal planes- as observed in these\nfilaments.\nThe entire filament, then, should\nconsist of nested, rolled-up basal\nplanes of graphite. Bending these\nplanes into cylinders, however,\nrequires that extra elastic energy be\nprovided during the precipitation process. The core is left hollow because\ntoo much energy would be required\nto bend the planes near the axis into\nvery small diameter tubes.\n\nI\n\nn describing the total energy necessary for filament formation, Dr.\nTibbett\'s model takes into account\nthe chemical potential change\n(~J.lo)when a carbon atom precipitates from the dissolved phase, as\nwell as the energy required to form\nthe surface, plus the energy needed\nto bend the basal planes into nested\ncylinders.\nThe change in chemical potential\n(~J.l) driving the precipitation can be\nexpressed as follows:\n\nafL - afLo- 2(1n\nr _ r,\no\n\nI\n\n-\n\ncalculated by maximizing ~J.l.

" If you let people handle\nspatial things, you \'re taking advantage of something they knew long\nbefore they heard the word com 18\n\nputer."\nMcAvinney\'s patented device looks\nlike a deep picture frame mounted\nover the front of a video monitor. Optical sensors embedded in the corners of the frame detect hand movements and reproduce them on the\nscreen. Fingers placed in the frame\nblock a continuous infrared light\nsource and cast shadows onto the\nsensor array. An onboard 68000based controller then triangulates\nthe positions and sizes of the fingers\nbased on the sensor data.\nThe device can concurrently track\nthe independent movements of the\nfingers in real time, which permits,\nfor example, the simultaneous translation, rotation , and scaling of an ob-\n\nject with a single ges\\ure. The ability\nto combine these actions into one\nfluid motion distinguishes the Sensor Frame from touch screens, mice,\nand other input methods that are\nlim ited to pointing, McAvinney said.\nThe Carnegie-Mellon University\nresearcher was inspired to build a\ncomputer system that would respond\nto hand signals because he " always\nwanted to conduct an orchestra." He\ndevised a scheme to connect multiple. synthesizers to a computer, but\nneeded a way to control the various\npieces. " I figured I could project an\norchestra layout onto the computer\nscreen," he recalled, " and then just\nwave at a section to tell it to play\nfaster or louder. That required my\ndeveloping a multiple-finger gesture\nsensor. "\nMcAvinney began experimenting\nwith various image sensors in the\nearly 1980s and eventually developed\nan optical gesture-sensing system\nthat could be applied to control many\ndifferent computer tasks. The technology interested NASA scientists,\nwho saw its potential for spacecraft\noperation and robot manipulation. In\n1986, the Space Agency provided partial funding for McAvinney\'s work on\nan optical device capable of tracking\nup to three fingers of one hand in a\nplane. This version of the Sensor\nFrame treats each finger movement\nas a separate gesture, limiting recognition to simple gestures such as toggling two switches simultaneously.\nLast spring, NASA awarded\nMcAvinney\'s Sensor Frame Corporation $500,000 to build an advanced\nsystem that will track fingertips in\nthree dimensions and enable such\ncomplex gestures as grasping and rotating a knob . The 3D Sensor Frame\nmay be used as an interface for soft\nor virtual control panels on board\nSpace Station Freedom, according to\nLinda Orr, Manager of the Graphics\nAnalysis Facility at NASA\'s Johnson\nSpace Center. "An astronaut could\ncontrol a number of onboard systems\nfrom a single display terminal," Orr\nsaid . " He\'d just call up the appropriate screen and manipulate a virtual\ndial to make adjustments." One Sensor Frame could replace numerous\ninstrumentation panels, saving precious space on the orbiting facility.\n\nTraining Comes First\nMcAvinney currently has Sensor\nFrame test units at the Software\nEngineering Institute and Carnegie\nMellon University\'S Computer Music\nLaboratory, both in Pittsburgh.

" If you\nwant to use a keyboard , you can just\ntake your hand away from the screen\nand type," explained Ms. Orr. " You\ndon \'t have to keep donning and doffing a glove."\nEarly applications of the Sensor\nFrame are likely to be in the area of\ntraining and simulation. Due to the\nhigh cost and risk of training personnel on real equipment, many\ngroups (especially the military) are\nturning to computer-based systems\nthat simulate equipment with software and display images of controls\nand instruments on banks of video\nmonitors. One major drawback is that\nexisting input devices do not let\ntrainees use the virtual system in the\nsame way they would the real McCoy.\n" It\'s just not very realistic, " commented Colburn , " and that hampers\nthe training effectiveness." On a conventional system equipped with a\ntouch screen, the trainee can only\npoint at the displays with one finger.\n" He can \'t turn a knob or grab a lever,"\nsaid the engineer. " But with a Sensor\nFrame, he can sit in a virtual cockpit ,\nfor example, and operate the controls\nessentially the same way he would\nduring an actual flight.

" We\' re going after the highend workstation market first ," said\nEric Colburn, Engineering Manager\nfor Sensor Frame Corp.\nSensor Frame\' s main competition\nwill come from the DataGlove developed by VPL Research of Redwood\nCity, CA. The sensor-lined glove\ntranslates hand and finger movements into electrical signals that are\ncarried by thin cables to a computer.\nAn image of the glove follows the\nhand \'s movement on the screen , allowing the glove wearer to virtually\ntouch and hold graphic objects.\nWhile the Sensor Frame restricts\nhand movements to the small area\nsurrounding the screen , the DataGlove wearer is free to move about\nthe room .

" You\ncould reach into the screen and grab\na virtual tool , perhaps a drill or a\nwrench, and instantly modify a part\'s\ndesign," McAvinney said . Add on a\nvoice recognition system and " you\ncould just say the name of the tool\nyou want and it would instantly appear on the screen."\nThe inventor hopes to one day\ncombine the 3D tracking device with\na stereolithography machine which employs a laser to extrude\nparts from liquid plastiC - to create\na new type of CAD workstation he\ncalls an " interactive fabricator." It\nwould enable rapid production of prototypes. The designer would specify\nor modify an object\'s shape using\nspatial gestures and virtual tools. A\nhost computer would then send instructions to the stereolithography\ndevice to fabricate a prototype, which\nmay take only a few minutes ,\nMcAvinney said.\n" If we can significantly shorten\ndesign time," he predicted, " designer\nproductivity will increase and customization will be easier. Learning\n\ntime for the designer will also be\nshorter if he can see immediate feedback on his ideas."\nInteractive fabricators might come\nin handy on future space missions,\nhe said. " If you had a fabricator\naboard the spacecraft, you wouldn \'t\nneed to lug as many spare parts into\norbit. On a large space station or\nplanetary outpost you could have\nbins of various raw materials to\ncreate replacement parts from. And\nif in the course of your research you\nfound you needed a totally new type\nof tool or instrument, you could use\nthe fabricator to design and extrude\nit right there in space. It wouldn \'t\nhold up your work."\n\nA One-Man Orchestra\nThis year, Sensor Frame technology came full circle when McAvinney\nintroduced a prototype musical instrument that emulates the sounds\nof an entire orchestra. Dubbed the\nVideoHarp, it is based on gesturesensing techn iques used in the Sensor Frame. The instrument has clear\nplastic sides and is rimmed with\nneon tubing. An optical sensor inside\nthe harp measures the positions and\nsizes of the user\'s fingers as they\nslide across the glowing surface. The\ninformation is fed to a synthesizer,\nwh ich produces music corresponding to the hand signals. Waving your\nhand in one direction will evoke viol in\nstrains, for instance, while pointing\nto another area will bring a horn section to life.\nThough he has fulfilled his\ndream of conducting an orchestra,\nMcAvinney is not satisfied . He next\nwants to build a VideoHarp the size\nof a concert stage. Dancers would\nmove across the massive instrument,\ncreating their own musical accompaniment, while melding man and\nmachine in a way the Sensor Frame\nonly hints at. 0\nSensor Frame\'s main competition: VPL\'s\nDstsGlove, shown here In use with\nNASA\'s Vlrtusl Workststlon.\n\n19\n\n~I\n\nElectronic Components and Circuits\nHardware Techniques, and\nProcesses\n20 Reflection Oscillators\nContaining SeriesResonant Crystals\n22 Multiplying Video Mixer\n22 Monolithic Microwave\nSwitching Matrix\n\nBooks and Reports\n24 Prediction of Critical Crack\nSizes in Solar Cells\n24 Encapsulants and\nCorrosion in Photovoltaic\nModules\n26 Relationship Between\nLatchup and Transistor\nCurrent Gain\n\nReflection Oscillators Containing Series-Resonant Crystals\n~J Transistors operate beyond their normal rated frequencies.\n\nGoddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland\nA crystal-controlled transistor reflection\noscillator is easily tunable and stable, con\xc2\xb7\nsumes little power, and costs less than do\nother types of oscillators that operate at\nthe same frequencies. This unusual combination of features is made JXlssible by a\ndesign concept that includes operation of\nthe transistor well beyond the 3-dB frequency of its current-versus-frequency\ncurve. The concept takes advantage of\nnewly available crystals that resonate at\nfrequencies up to about 1 GHz.\nThe top of the figure shows a biJXllartransistor version of the oscillator. The\nemitter of transistor Q is connected with\nvariable (tuning) capacitor C1 and seriesresonant crystal X. The emitter is also connected to ground through bias resistor R1.\nThe base is connected to the parallel combination of inductor L and capacitor C3\nthrough dc-blocking capacitor C4 and is\nforward-biased with respect to the emitter\nby resistors R3 and R 4. Impedance Z could\nbe the 22().Q resistor shown or any small\nimpedance that enables the extraction of\nthe output signal through coupling capacitor C2" If Z is a tuned circuit, it is tuned to the\nfrequency of the crystal.\nThe circuit shown at the bottom of the\nfigure is approximately equivalent, at the\nfrequencies of interest, to the circuit shown\nabove and can be used to determine the\nconditions for oscillation. The analysis of\nthis circuit shows that the input admittance\nat the base includes a negative conductance and a parallel capacitive susceptance reflected from C1 and X on the emitter side. The conditions for oscillation (zero\nnet conductance and zero net susceptance) are approximated by\n\n~\n\nI~\n\n+icoC3+icoC1(1 +corRxC1)\n\nthe admittance related to the total losses in\nthe base circuit, including both the losses\nin inductor L and the losses in resistors R3\nand R .\n4\nThe second equation shows that the\nparallel combination of R3 and R4 must be\nselected to provide an amount of JXlsitive\nconductance that balances part of the negative conductance reflected from the emitter side at the frequency of oscillation. Alternatively, one can consider the oscillation\nto take place at the frequency for which\nthis condition is satisfied. An approximate\n\nsolution of the first equation is\nco 2 = 1IL(C3 +C/4)\nThis is useful in determining the approximate frequency of oscillation and the major elements that determine that frequency.\nThis work was done by Leonard E.\nKleinberg of Goddard Space Right Cen\xc2\xb7\nter.

The overlay might be computergenerated graphics, text, or another image. If additional circuitry is included, the\noverlay can also be made opaque.\nThe circuit is a multiplying mixer. In a fullcolor television system, one such mixer\nwould be needed for each of the three primary colors, and the multiplicity of mixers\nwould provide great flexibility in the choice\nof contrasts, components of the overlay in\ndifferent colors, intensities, and degrees of\ntransparency or opacity.\nThe background video brightness signal\nis fed into one input terminal of the circuit,\nwhile the overlay brightness signal is fed\ninto the other input terminal (see figure).\nThe amplitude of the background brightness signal is thus modulated by the overlay brightness signal, resulting in a video\nimage in which the background image appears as though viewed through the overlay.\nThe additional circuitry (not shown in\ndetail) would provide a choice of transparent or opaque overlays. In the transparent mode, the mixer would function as described above. In the opaque mode, the\nadditional circuitry would replace the background-image brightness signal with an\nauxiliary full-brightness signal in the overlay region . Thus, the overlay image would\nbe a full-brightness image modulated by\nthe overlay video signal and would contain\nno background image at all; that is, the\noverlay would appear opaque.\nThis work was done by Neil W Heckt of\nBoeing Aerospace Co. for NASA\'s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

The approach and results of this study\nmay be useful in the development of guidelines for the acceptance or rejection of\nslightly flawed cells during manufacture.\nThe propagation of cracks from flaws\ninitially on the edge or on one of the broad\nsurfaces of a circular wafer is analyzed\nfrom a fracture-mechanics point of view.\nFracture mechanics defines a critical\ncrack size for a given level of operating\nstress as the size below which an initial\ncrack can withstand the first application of\nstress but beyond which the crack propagates rapidly to fracture. Repeated loading\nor time under load may cause a subcriticaJ\ncrack to grow to the critical size, whereupon the part suddenly fails.\nThe basic equations of fracture mechanics are used to derive an equation\nfor the critical crack size in the openingmode propagation of an edge or broad-surface crack in a wafer subjected to bending.\n(This is the predominant mode of failure 0bserved in the field.) Similarly, an equation is\nderived for the critical size of an edge\ncrack in the tearing-mode propagation of a\nwafer subjected to twisting. These critical\nsizes depend in part on the Young\'s moduli\nand critical-stress-intensity factors of the\nmaterial (which are different in different\n\n24\n\ncrystalline orientations with respect to the\ncracks and stresses) and on the Poisson\'s\nratio of the material.\nUsing the known properties of Si and\nGaAs, the equations were used to obtain\nplots of crack sizes in solar cells made of\nthese materials as functions of the bend or\ntwist radii, with the thicknesses of the cells\nas a parameter. The analysiS was also extended to predict critical sizes for cracks in\na Ge substrate coated with a thin film of\nGaAs.\nThe analysis leads to the following general conclusions:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The cracks in a silicon wafer subjected to\nbending are more critical than in one subjected to twisting.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 AA edge crack is more critical than is a\nsurface crack. Thus, an edge can be\nfinished to increase the strength of a\nwafer.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 For a given bending or twisting load, the\nallowable critical crack slze in a thinner\nwafer is greater than that in a thicker\nwafer.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The calculated allowable critical crack\nsizes of Si and Ge are nearly equal. The\ncritical crack size in a GaAs wafer is approximately 3.5 times as small as that in an\nSi wafer under the same load. This suggests that GaAs wafers cannot be handled\nin the same manner as that of Si or Ge\nwafers.\nThis work was done by Chern P. Chen of\nCaltech for NASA\'s Jet Propulsion lab0ratory.

For the purposes of\nthis analysis, "Iatchup" denotes the transition of such a device from a looer-currentconducting steady state to a distinct higher-current-conducting steady state. The\nstudy focuses upon the conventional twocoupled-transistor model of a one<1imensional SCR. ,AJthough this model gives an\noversimplified view of latchup in CMOS circuits, it is useful for qualitative predictions\nof electrical characteristics.\nThe currents in and voltages across the\ntransistors in the model are assumed to behave according to the Ebers-Moll equations. The npn and pnp transistors are\ncharacterized by normal-mode, short-circuit, common-base current gains c:r 1 and\n0\'2\' respectively; by the open-emitter collector saturation currents ICOl and IC02! respectively; and by the thermal voltage Vr.\n\nWith brilliant color.\n\nThe Ebers-Moll equations are solved to 0btain an exact equation for the current I\nflowing through the device as a function of\nthe collector-junction voltage Vc\nI\n\n= [(ICOl + \'C02)/\n\n(1- c:rl - 0\'2)][1 - exp(VdVr)]\nIf, as is physically reasonable for at least\nsome devices, it is assumed that the as for\nthe inverted mode are negligible and that\nthe emitter junctions are sufficiently\nforward-biased so that the exponential of\nthe bias voltage over the thermal voltage is\nmuch greater than 1, then the current can\nbe expressed approximately as a function\nof the terminal voltage, V. by\n\n[\'Eol\'EO/(/eol\n\n+ le02) 2] exp(VlVr)\n\n=\n\n(/\')21[1 - (1 - 0\'1 - 0\'2)11\nwhere IEOl and IEQ2 are the open-collector emitter saturation currents and I\' =\n1/(lCOl +1002 ),\nWhether or not the c:rS depend on the\ncurrent, the first equation predicts that the\ncondition c:r 1 +0\'2 = 1 will result in a high\ncurrent. Consequently, this condition has\nbeen quoted frequently in literature as the\ncondition for latch up. Hooever, the study\nexamines the current-versus-voltage behavior predicted by these equations and\nshOYJs that reliance on this condition can\nlead to contradictions and physically unrealistic conclusions. In particular, the\nstudy reaches the follooing conclusions:\n\n=\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The condition c:r 1 + c:r 2 1 is neither necessary nor sufficient for latchup, and indeed it has no special significance at all.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 If small signal alphas are defined in terms\nof large signal alphas in the usual way.\nthen the condition that the small-signal-alpha sum is unity is not a general criterion\nfor locating switching and holding points.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Although the condition c:r 1 + c:r 2 = 1 has\nnothing to do with whether or not a device\nwill latch up, it is relevant to the destructiveness of a latchup in the event that it\noccurs. For example. if 0\'1 + 0\'2 < 0.9\nunder all conceivable operating conditions, then there Is sufficient margin to\nprevent destructively high current in the\nevent of a latchup, regardless of external\ncircuitry.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The way to predict the holding and\nswitching voltages and currents of a twoterminal device is to plot its currentversus-voltage curve from equations that\nrepresent the device correctly under all\nbias conditions, rather than to make a\n"shortcut" search for the conditions underwhich c:rl +0\'2\n1.\nThis \'NOr!< was done by Larry D.

The receiver is\nintended for use in the Deep Space Network, but presumably the basic design\ncould be modified for such terrestrial uses\nas communications or laboratory instrumentation where signals are weak and/or\nnoise is strong.\nThe receiver uses IF sampling and digital phase-locked loops to track the carrier\nand subcarrier signals and to synchronize\nthe data symbols. The digital processing\nscheme avoids such inherent deficiencies\nof analog systems as de offsets in mixers\nand amplifiers and the need for precise\nradio-frequency (RF) calibration and adjustment. In addition, the digital scheme\nprovides more flexibility and reliability while\nreducing the size and cost of the receiver.\nThe receiver (see figure) consists of\nthree modules: an IF assembly, a signalprocessing assembly, and a test-Signal as-\n\nsembly. The IF assembly performs the IF\nsampling and serves as the point of closure\nfor the carrier and symbol feedback loops.\nThe signal-processing assembly contains\nall of the digital signal-processing hardware and software necessary to operate\nthe feedback loops. The test-signal assembly provides modulated IF signals to test\nthe other two assemblies.\nIn the IF assembly, the carrier is not\ndemodulated to analog baseband for the\ndetection of phase but instead is locked in\nphase to one-quarter of the sampling\nclock, or roughly 5 MHz. This signal is then\ndigitized and passed to the signal-processing assembly for demodulation and\nphase detection. This technique removes\nthe effect of any bias in the analog-to-digital converter because the dc component is\nout of band when the Signal is digitally\nmixed to baseband. Locking to a submultiple of the sample rate also eases the implementation of the carrier-demodulation\nfunction.\nIntermedlate\xc2\xb7Frequency Assembly\n\nThe signal-processing assembly performs the digital operations that implement\nthe phase detectors and loop filters for the\ncarrier, subcarrier, and symbol loops. It\nalso contains hardware and software for\nfast acquisition and estimation of the parameters of Signals.\nIn the test-signal assembly, the reference frequencies can be generated by\ninternal oscillators that supply fixed frequencies or by external synthesizers. An\ninternal noise generator injects noise into\nthe signal. Signal-to-noise ratios and modulation indices are controlled by attenuators.\nThis work was done by D. H. Brown and\nW J.

The\nedges thus cool and solidify at more nearly\nthe same rate as does the center of the ribbon, and thermal stress in the ribbon is reduced. Because of the more-effective\nedge cooling, a wider ribbon can be grown,\nand it can be withdrawn at a faster rate.\nThe productivity of a dendritic-web growth\nfurnace is thereby increased.\nIn the previous version, the susceptor lid\nintercepted a greater portion of the heat radiation from the solidifying melt at the\nedges of the ribbon than that from the middle of the ribbon. The edges of the ribbon\ntherefore could not lose heat as quickly as\nthe middle could, and the resulting con-\n\ncave upward isotherm in the ribbon gave\nrise to undesirable thermal stresses. Such\nstresses can cause the ribbon to buckle\nand break, thus interrupting growth and requiring a new startup. Even if the ribbon\ndoes not break, the stresses can be incorporated in the ribbon.\nWith the trenched lid, the radiation from\nthe melt is still intercepted, as it should be.\nHowever, less radiation from the ribbon\nedges is intercerted. As a result, the heat\nloss across the ribbon is more nearly uniform, and, consequently, thermal stresses\nare reduced.\nAn experimental furnace with the new\nlid produced about 80 percent more material per unit time than the old one did. The\ntrenched lid enabled the growth of a ribbon\n\n4.2 cm wide, whereas ribbons grown with\nthe untrenched lid had deformed at that\nwidth. In addition, the ribbon grown with\nthe new lid is thinner and can therefore be\nused more efficiently in semiconductor devices. A trenched lid with a slot to accommodate a 5.2\xc2\xb7cm-wide ribbon is under construction. Eventually, ribbons 6 to 7 cm\nwide are likely to be grown in trenched\nslots.\nThis work was done by C.

A z-axis force that\ntends to compress or elongate the peg\nmay be displayed as changes in the diameters of the circles, and torsion (torque\nabout the longitudinal axis) may be represented as the rotation of an index mark on\na circle.\nThis concept has already been implemented at NASA Langley Research Center.

High-level programming facilitates\nthe use of additional convenient features in\nthe software that extend the usefulness of\nthe sensor data and display.

In an alternative\nversion, the system would control the\nlateral motion of the camera to generate\nstereoscopic views to measure distances\nto objects. In yet another version, the motion of the camera would be controlled to\nkeep an object in view.\nThe heart of the system would be a digital image-data processor called a "Jittermiser" (for jitter minimizer), which would include a frame buffer and logic circuits to\ncorrect for jitter in the image (see figure).\nSignals from motion sensors on the camera would be sent to the logic circuits and\nprocessed into corrections for motion\nalong and across the line of sight. These\nwould include the zoom setting of the lens,\nwhich would provide data for scaling the\n\n32\n\nmotion of the image to the motion of the\ncamera. The logic circuits would expand,\ncontract, and/or laterally shift the image to\ncompensate for the motions of the camera\n\nso that, when transmitted to the television\nmonitor, the image would contain only the\ntrue motion in the scene.\nIf the buffer and logic circuits take too\nTelevi sion\nMonitor\n\nDigital\n\n~--------~~__________~~__\npr_o_ce_s_so_r,-~~--~\n\n0\n\nCamera Mount\n\nThe Motion of the Television Camera would be measured and/or controlled to compensate\nfor motion in the image and/or extract useful information from it.\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1989\n\nlong to correct for the jitter, they could reintroduce jitter into the image. If, for example,\nthe corrected image lags n frames behind\nthe motion signals, this jitter would represent the difference between the locations\nand orientations of the camera at present\nand n frames ago. When this jitter becomes unacceptable, the system could respond by selecting a less-complete, faster\nimage-processing algorithm.\nThe image-processing capability could\nbe exploited to stabilize only a portion of a\njittering image - for example, to get a stationary view of a vibrating object. By use of\na keyboard, joystick, or other control , one\ncould select the coordinates of a compo-\n\nnent so that the processor could locate the\ncomponent digitally in its frame buffer.\nThereafter, the processor would shift the\nimage digitally to keep the component at\nthe same position on the television screen,\nwhether or not the camera is jittering. This\nfunction could be combined with feedback\ncontrol of the camera to keep a moving 0bject within view. The outputs of the system\ncould include data on the motion of the 0bject - for example, the velocity of a balloon as a measure of wind.\nFor the measurement of distances to\nobjects or for stereoscopic viewing, the\nprocessor would both control and measure the lateral motion of the camera. From\n\nthe parallax motions of each component of\nthe image, the distance from the camera to\nthe corresponding object could be computed. The processor could then superimpose depth labels on the television image\nto show the distance to each object of interest. The processor could shift the components of the image so that they would\nappear at their true depths when viewed\nstereoscopically.\nThis work was done by Daniel B. Diner\nand Derek H.

NPO~17499\n\nDesign of Feedforward Controllers for Multivariable Plants\nControllers are based on simple low-order transfer functions.\nNASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nMathematical criteria have been derived\nfor the design of feedforward controllers\nfor a class of multiple-inputlmultiple-output\nlinear plants. The controllers are represented by simple low-order transfer functions, which are obtained without reconstruction of the states of commands and\ndisturbances.\nFor the system shown at the top of the\nfigure, the plant is described by\nY(s) = Gc(s)U(s) + Gd(s)W(s)\nand the open-loop control law is\nU(s) = P(s)W(s) + Q(s)V(s)\nwhere s is the Laplace-transform complex\nfrequency, U is an m x 1 vector representing the control input to the plant, W is an\nx 1 vector representing the measurable\ndisturbance input to the plant, V is an 1 x 1\nvector representing the command input, Y\nis an 1 x 1vector representing the output of\nthe plant, and Gc and Gd are the 1 x m and\n1 xm transfer-function matrices that relate\nthe control and disturbance inputs, respectively, to the output. The problem is to determine the transfer-function matrices p(s)\nand O:s) of the feedforward controllers so\nthat, in the steady state, the output y(t)\n(where t = time) obeys the command v(t)\nand does not include a response to the disturbance w(t). The plant is assumed to be\nstable.\nThe linearity of the system permits the\ndecomposition of the problem into two separate subproblems: the rejection of the disturbancebyP(s)whenv = Oandthetracking of the command by O:s) when w = O\n.\nThe main result of the analysis of the rejection subproblem is a requirement that the\nzeros of a specific rational vector composed of elements of p(s) and of a specific\nformulation of Gc(c) and Gd(s) contain the\npoles of W(s). There must be at least as\nmany control inputs as outputs (m~1). and\nthe poles of the disturbances must not\n\nDisturbance\n\nw\n\nControl\nu\n\nCommand\n\nv----t~\n\nOutput\nPlant\n\nPLANT WITH FEED FORWARD CONTROLLERS\n\nDisturbance\nw\n\nm\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1989\n\n.......- -.... y\n\nCommand\n\nControl\nu\n\n+\n\nv\n\nOutput\nPlant\n\ny\n\nPLANT WITH FEEDFORWARD AND FEEDBACK CONTROLLERS\n\nThe Feedforward Controllers P(s) and O(s) enable the plant to track the command v while remaining unresponsive to the disturbance w in the steady state. The feedback controller K(s)\ncan be added independently of P(s) and O(s) to stabilize the plant or to make the control system less susceptible to variations in the parameters of the plant.\n\ncoincide with the transmission zeros of the\nplant. Provided that these reqUirements\nare satisfied, the designer can choose any\nof a wide variety of transfer functions and is\nfree to make P(s) consist of relativelysimple proportional, derivative, and loworder dynamic terms.\nThe main result from the tracking subproblem is a requirement that the zeros of\nanother specific rational vector composed\n\nof elements of O:s) and of the same specific formulation of Gc(s) and Gd(s) contain\nthe poles of V(s). The poles of the commands must not coincide with the transmission zeros of the plant, and, as before,\nthere must be at least as many control inputs as outputs. N; in the case of p(s), the\ndesigner is otherwise free to choose sim\xc2\xb7\npie proportional, derivative, and low-order\ndynamic terms.\n33\n\nIf the plant is unstable, it can be stabilized by a feedback controller described by\nK(s), as shown in the lower part of the\nfigure. K(s) can be based on the open-loop\nplant, selected independently of p(s) and\nQ(s) by methods developed previously.\nFor a plant with appreciable time constants, a disturbance-feedforward controller p(s) produces immediate corrective\ncontrol action to counteract the effects of\ndisturbances on the outputs of the plant,\nwhereas a feedback controller is ineffective until the disturbance has acted on the\n\nplant for some time and the output is perturbed . Consequently, unlike feedback\ncontrollers, feedforward controllers are\ncapable of decoupling of the disturbances\nand matching of the commands.\nAs in the case of all open-loop controllers,\nthe disturbance-rejection and commandtracking properties of the feedforward system are loot in the face of unpredictable variations in the parameters of the plant.\nHowever, when these variations are known\na priori and the feedforward controllers are\n"updated" to cope with these variations,\n\nthen the steady-state output-control properties are preserved. Although feedback is\nnot required when the plant is stable, the\nuse of feedback is often recommended to\nreduce sensitivity to these variations and\nthereby increase the robustness of the\noverall control system.\nThis work was done by Homayoun Seraji\nof Caltech for NASA\'s Jet Propulsion laboratory.

In contrast, a conventional optoelectronic incremental-shaft-angle encoder has to be "indexed" (that is, calibrated\nwith respect to the absolute angle) by turning it until the index or starting angle is\nfound; in some cases, this can require\nnearly a complete revolution. Thus, the\nnew angle encoder helps to save energy\nand reduce wear in the bearings. Its prinCiple of operation is also applicable to\nincremental-linear-position encoders.\nAs in a conventional encoder, the relative angular position is measured with fine\nresolution by optoelectronically counting\nfinely- and uniformly-spaced light and dark\nareas on the encoder disk as the disk turns\npast the position-sensing device (see figure). However, the disk also includes a\ntrack containing coarsely- and nonuniformly-spaced light and dark areas, the\nangular widths of which vary in proportion\nto the absolute angular position. This second track provides a gating and indexing\nsignal.\nThe output Signals from the position sensor - one for each track - are fed to the\ncounting circuit. The circuit counts the\nnumber of fine-increment pulses that occur during each coarse-increment pulse.\nThis count gives a measure of the absolute\nangle because each coarse interval can\nbe identified by its unique number of fine increments. Thereafter, the angle is determined to a finer resolution by counting the\nnumber of fine increments after the start of\n\nr----------- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ,\n\nTrack With\nProportlonallySpaced Coarse Marks\n\n<II\nIII\n"0\n\n~\n\n~ II / II IIIIII SS 1111111111 Sf III III IIIII I~ II\n~\nI\n\nUniformly-Spaced\nFine-Increment Pulses\n\n~ ~~~ Coarse-Increment Pulses\nproportlonaIlY-SpaCed\no\n~\n\nFine-Increment Pulses\n\ncQ\n\ng\n\n~\n\ntr.\n\nStart of\nCoarse\nIncrement 4\n\nStart of\nCoarse\nIncrement 5\n\nGated by Coarse-\n\nStart of\nIncrement Pulses\nCoarse\nIncrement 6\n\nAngle\n\nThe Number of Fine Increments In Each Coarse Increment of angle can be counted to determine the absolute angle of the device.\n\nthe gating signal.\nThis work was done by Philip R.

The system yields data on pressure faster than do\nmanual image-analyses techniques, and\nthese data compare favorably with those\nobtained by manual analysis and by probe\nmeasurements of pressure.\nThe equipment is illustrated by the block\ndiagram of Figure 1. A video camera views\nthe interferometric hologram. The video\nimage has a resolution of 512 x 512 picture\nelements, the intensity of each of which is\ndigitized to 8 bits. The digitized image is\nstored in two memory planes. Another\nmemory plane stores a graphical and alphanumerical overlay digitized to 4 bits.\nThe system includes an arithmetic logic\nunit (ALU), which performs addition, subtraction, or comparison of the data in one\nor more memory planes in real time. The\ncontents of each memory plane can be\nrouted through lookup tables before entry\ninto. the ALU and can be shown on a color\ndisplay. A joystick control device is used for\ninteractive input. It controls two cursors,\nwhich can be used in a number of operating modes. A color printing system augments the color monitor.\nThe system uses computer programs\nthat evaluate the interferograms along\nstraight or curved lines represented by\npolygon segments. The user is prompted\nfor such inputs as reference points and\n\nfringe numbers. After starting the program,\na fringe pattern is digitized and frameaveraged to improve the signal-to-noise\nratio. The user enters the location of two\nreference points to map the image-processor coordinates to the user\'s coordinate\nsystem by directing a cursor to the appropriate locations and entering the corresponding positions in the user\'s system.\nThe selected reference points are usually\n\nthe leading and trailing edges of the airfoil.\nDuring numbering, the cursor can be\nmoved along the segmented polygon line,\npositioning itself along the white segments.\nA reference fringe, the density along which\nis known, is selected and assigned the\nvalue O. Subsequent fringes are numbered\nrelative to the reference fringe in increments of 1.

If the surface pressure is\nknown to increase to a certain point and\nthen decrease, the user correspondingly\nassigns fringe numbers that indicate this\nincrease and decrease. Depending on the\npolygon line being used, some fringes have\nthe same number as the fringe pattem\nbends in the cwosite direction. Two different numbering modules can be used to\nset the fringe numbers. Only one number\nand the direction in which the fringe\nnumbers increase have to be entered by\nthe user to number the entire line. During\nthe numbering process, the black segments are overwritten by colors to show\nthe difference in the fringe order of two adjacent fringes. The color coding is an\nergonomic feature that facilitates the\ndetection of errors in numbering.\nTo be able to handle a wide range of\nfringe frequencies or increase the accuracy of the detection of fringes, the image processor can handle digitizations of\nseveral sections of one interferogram\ntaken with different resolutions. Altemate\nlenses on the video camera are used to\nfocus on appropriate sections. Each section is digitized separately until the entire\npolygon line has been evaluated. The data\nfrom different portions of the interferogram\nare then merged into one set of data. The\noutput consists of the fringe numbers and\nlocation (fringe-order function) along the\npolygon line being evaluated. The fringeorder function is automatically fed to a file\nfrom which it can be converted to the distribution of pressure coefficients by a postprocessing program (see Figure 2).\nThis oork was done by Francisco J.

With modifica\xc2\xb7\ntions, the apparatus performs any of three\nbasic image-processing functions: transfer\nto a different light beam, enhancement of\nedges, and autocorrelation.\nGaAs offers important advantages over\nsuch crystalline oxides as BaTi0 3 and\nUNb03. Its photo refractive response occurs within tens of microseconds - about\n100 times as fast as that of the oxides.\nGaAs devices operate in the infrared\nwavelength range of 0.9 to 1.6 \xc2\xa2T1 and are\ntherefore compatible with semiconductor injection lasers and miniature diodepumped yttrium aluminum garnet lasers.\nIn contrast, the oxides operate in the visible\nwavelength range of 0.4 to 0.7 J.IrTl and\ntherefore require gas lasers, which are\nlarge, expensive, and fragile. Thus, the applications of the oxides are limited, while\nGaAs is suitable for integration of optical\nprocessing with optoelectronic, electrooptical, and electronic systems that are\nfast, compact, and consume little power.\nThe apparatus includes a crystal of\nGaAs of 5 by 9 by 9 mm with its cubic crystalline axes oriented as shown in the figure.\nThe crystal is illuminated from opposite\nsides bywr~ing laser beams 1 and 2, which\nare polarized in the plane of the paper.

The method can be used to select\nthe best catalysts for electrochemical batteries and fuel cells. It predicted, for example, that a platinum/lead electrocatalyst of\nspecified composition would provide the\nlowest overvoltage of an oxygen electrode\nin an acidic or basic medium in a lithium\nbattery. This prediction was borne out by\nexperiment.\nThe method is based on one used to analyze the activities of nonelectrical catalysts in reactions involving hydrogen or oxygen. The rate of such a reaction increases\nwhen the solubility parameter of the catalyst matches that of the reactant.\nThe only difference between a catalyst\nand an electrocatalyst is that the latter\nmust also be a good conductor of electrons and be chemically stable in the electrochemical environment in which it is to\nbe used. Accordingly, it seemed that the effectiveness of electrocatalysts in metallic\nsolutions could be calculated from thermodynamic relationships that describe the\nformation of solid solutions, in combination\nwith models for the appropriate solutions.\nFrom such calculations, three alloys appeared promising: lead/platinum, gold/silver, and silver/palladium. Of these, the\nleadlplatinum system had previously\nshown high activity in anodic oxidation in\nan ethylene glycol fuel cell.\nAccordingly, lead/platinum was selected for experimental evaluation. The electrochemical electrode overvoltage was\nmeasured as a function of the solubility\nparameter (see figure). The lower the overvoltage, the more efficient the electrocatalytic kinetics are.

Unlike conventional linear\nalgorithms, it does not require site-specific\nand weather-dependent empirical parameters other than standard meteorological\ndata, latitude, and altitude for use in conjunction with published standard atmospheric data.\n38\n\nA water-vapor radiometer measures the\nbrightness temperature along a line of\nsight at frequencies close to the 22.2-GHz\nresonance of water. These temperatures\ndepend on the distributions of kinetic temperature, pressure, water vapor, and liquid\nwater along this line of sight. The microwave wet-path delay depends on the distributions of water vapor and kinetic temperature along the line of sight. The problem is\nto estimate the wet-path delay from the\n\nbrightness temperatures without detailed\nknowledge of the actualline-of-sight distributions of relevant quantities.\nThe basic premise of the profile algorithm is that the wet-path delay is approximated closely by the solution to a simplified\nversion of the nonlinear delay problem ana\ncan be generated numerically from each\nradiometer observation and simultaneous\nmeteorological data. The algorithm first\nchooses various simple vertical distributions of water vapor and liquid and inserts\nthem in a mathematical model of emission\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1989\n\nby the atmosphere at the radiometric\nwavelengths. When it finds a distribution\nfor which the output of the model matches\nthe radiometric observations, it uses this\ndistribution in an integration along the\ndesired line of sight to obtain the delay.\nIt is assumed that the vertical distribution of relative humidity can be represented adequately by the two-piece linear function shown in the figure. At the surface, the\nrelative humidity is measured conventionally. The relative-humidity profile is then approximated by connecting the two endpoints by straight lines to the relative\nhumidity at an altitude of 3 km. This relative\nhumidity is adjusted by the algorithm and\nused to estimate the trial vapor distributions via standard-atmosphere temperature and pressure profiles calibrated to the\ntemperature and pressure measured at\nthe surface.\nThe emission model accounts for the\ncontinuum emission from droplets of water\nby assuming that the density of liquid water\nis proportional to the saturation watervapor density as set by the temperature\nand pressure at each point. The algorithm\ntries different constants of proportionality\nuntil it obtains a fit.\nThe intrinsic accuracy of the profile algorithm, excluding uncertainties in radiometer data and the emission model, has\nbeen estimated with the help of archival\nradiosonde data.

In normal\noperation , the optical-flat piezoelectric\ntransducer is driven by an ac signal at a frequency of 5,000 Hz. The photodiode-output Signal from which the displacement is\ninferred is detected by a lock-in amplifier,\nwhich is locked to the same reference oscillator that controls the motion of the\ntransducer. Differential amplifiers isolate\nthe relatively high voltage necessary to\ndrive the piezoelectriC transducer from the\ndc power supply and lock-in amplifier. (A\ntransformer can be substituted for differential amplifier 1 to enhance the signal-tonoise ratio.)\nIn one test, it was found that the inner\xc2\xb7\nmost ring of the interference pattern\nmoved by half a fringe when a dc potential\nof 300 V was applied to the piezoelectric\ntranslator.

The device goes from a\ncold start up to full operation in less than\n5 s after the initial application of power. It\ncan be exposed to moist air between operations without significant degradation of its\nstarting and running characteristics. Designed for the neutralization of static electrical charges on spacecraft, the device\nmight be modified for use as a source of\nplasma in laboratory experiments or industrial processes.\nThe source includes an emitter tube within the hollow cathode barrel and a keeper\nelectrode just outside the orifice at the end\nof the barrel (see figure). A flow of the working gas is established within the barrel, and\na starting potential of 300 to 400 V is applied, causing the cathode barrel to act as\nan anode with respect t01he emitter tUbe.\nInitially, the working gas breaks down electrically in a glow diSCharge to the end of the\nemitter tUbe. Bombardment by ions from\nthe discharge heats the end of the tube to\nthermionic temperatures within the short\nstarting time. (The much larger heat capacity of the cathode barrel prevents the\nbarrel from heating significantly during the\nstarting process.)\nThe emitter tube then begins to emit electrons, and the discharge changes from a\nglow to an arc. In this condition, the device\nis considered to be "on" and acts as a\nstable source of dense plasma. The arc discharge is sustained at the lower barrell\nemitter potential of about 55 V. The discharge consumes about 350 W during startup and about 100 W during steady operation .\nFlows of plasma containing either predominantly electron or predominantly ion\ncurrents are extracted through the orifice\nin the cathode by applying positive or negative bias, respectively, to the keeper electrode.

Ambipolar diffusion ensures that a plasma will be drawn from the\ncathode at keeper biases up to a few tens\nof volts.\nThe tip of the emitter tube is optimized\nfor the minimum heat capacity (for rapid\nstartup and low consumption of power)\nconsistent with adequate mechanical\nstrength. The emitter tube is made of pure\ntantalum, which can be exposed to humid\nair, then placed in a vacuum again and restarted with no adverse effects. Because\nthis tube is not impregnated (as many cathode tubes are) with rare-earth oxides to\nlower its electron work function , there is no\nneed to take the customary precautions to\n\nprevent contamination of the oxides by exposure to the atmosphere.\nThe dimensions (e.g., orifice diameter\n1.00 mm) and separation (1.83 mm) of the\nemitter tube and the cathode barrel are\nchosen so that the stagnation pressure of\nthe working gas is in the proper range\n[about 2 torr (270 Pa)] for a minimum-potential glow discharge. The rate of flow of\nthe gas is chosen to yield this pressure.\nThis work was done by W D. Deininger,\nG. Aston, and L C. Pless of Ca1tech for\nNASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

The mode-selection problem\narises because the output of a typical laser\ndiode contains multiple longitudinal modes\nand/or hops from one mode to another as\nthe temperature or the diode current\nchanges.\nThe etalon provides an amount of feedback that varies periodically with wavelength. The superposition of this feedback\non the gain versus wavelength of the laser\ndiode reduces the threshold Ioss(es) of the\nmode(s) near the peak(s) of the feedback\nvs. wavelength more than it reduces the\nthreshold Ioss(es) of other modes. Consequently, lasing in the mode(s) near the feedback peak(s) is favored over lasing in other\nmodes. The etalon also helps to increase\nstability by reducing the sensitivity to minor\n46\n\nfeedback from external objects other than\nthe etalon itself.\nThe figure illustrates an experimental c0nfiguration used to test the etalon-feedback\nconcept with two types of AlGaAs laser\ndiodes. The cover glass of each diode was\nremoved. The clear room-temperature-vulcanizing silicone-rubber adhesive provided\na good match between the indices of refraction of the diode and of the uncoated,\nfused-silica etalon. The thickness of the\netalon was chosen to obtain feed>ack with\nintensity peaks 1.9 nm (5 to 6 longitudinal\nmodes) apart in wavelength.\nMeasurements were performed on\nthree types of commercial AlGaAs laser\ndiodes. Two of these were tested both\nwithout and with the external etalon. The\nthird , of a type called "thin , tapered\nthickness" (TTT), was tested without the\nexternal etalon, in its original package.\nWithout the external eta Ion , the first two\ndiodes exhibited hops to longitudinal\nmodes two to three modes away, consistent with etalon feedback from their cover\nglasses. The mode hops of the TTT diode\nwere larger because of what amounts to in\n\nCenter.

Using a pulsed\nArF excimer laser operating at a wavelength of 193 nm, the instrument would\nmeasure the density of the upper atmosphere in the viCinity of the flightpath, with\nan uncertainty of less than 1 percent and a\nspatial resolution of 1 km, over the range of\naltitudes from 50 to 90 km. With this accuracy and resolution, the measurements\nshould be adequate for the detection of\nsmall-scale meteorological structure that\ncan affect the analysis of flight dynamic\ndata of reentering spacecraft.\nRayleigh scattering is attractive because it is the simplest of all radiative interactions with gases. In essence, it can be\ndescribed as the nonresonant elastic scattering of light by molecules. The scattered\nlight is at nearly the same wavelength and\nbandwidth as those of the source, and its\nintensity is proportional to the number density of the particles. The cross section for\nRayleigh scattering increases sharply with\ndecreasing wavelength, but in the absence\nof resonance-enhancement effects, it has\nno sensitivity to any resonant transitions in\nthe gas and is therefore insensitive to the\ntemperature.\nIn the case of backward scattering from\ngases, the intenSity of the scattered light is\nalso independent of the polarization of the\nincident light. Furthermore, in air at ambient temperatures, the yield of photons\nfrom Rayleigh scattering is greater than\nthat from any other radiative interaction.\nHence, the restrictions on the energy and\nspectral qualities of the laser are minimal.\nTheArF laser and its wavelength of 193nm\n\nwere chosen to take maximum advantage\nof the large Rayleigh signal and the low\nsolar background at that wavelength.\nIn the proposed instrument, the laser\nbeam would emerge from the window in\nthe middeck crew hatch and propagate\nperpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of\nthe vehicle. The light scattered backward\nby the ambient air would be collected during each pulse by optics attached to the inside of the window. For this application, the\ncollection optics would be arranged so that\nonly light scattered from the length of the\nbeam beyond the shock layer would be detected. The intensity of the scattered light\nwould be integrated over a selected period\nfollowing each pulse, then divided by the\nlaser-pulse energy to obtain a signal proportional to the ambient density in the 0bserved length of the beam.\nFor this kind of measurement, the performance of the laser is characterized primarily in terms of its average power, which\nshould be at least 0.6 W to yield an adequate signal-to-noise ratio. In practice, one\nwould most likely use a commercial laser\nof about 5 W. Extrapolating from tests on a\ncommercial laser, it appears that the laser\nand its power and gas supplies would have\na total mass up to 300 kg and would require\n1 to 2.5 kW of electric power and 1 gpm\n(0.06 Us) of liquid coolant.\nThe authors also discuss extensions of\nthe concept to measurements of the location of, and the density as a function of position in, the shock wave of the Space Shuttle. The same ultraviolet system would be\nused to take time- and space-resolved\nRayleigh-scattering measurements of the\nshock layer. Such measurements would\nprovide baseline data for verification of\ncomputer models of high-enthalpy hypersonic, nonequilibrium, and viscous conditions.\nThis work was done by Robert L.\nMcKenzie of Ames Research Center.\nFurther information may be found in AIM\npaper A87-43052, "A Method of Atmospheric Density Measurements During\nShuttle Entry Using UV Laser Rayleigh\nScattering."\nCopies may be purchased [prepayment\nrequired] from AIM Technicallnformation\nServices Ubrary, 555 West 57th Street,\nNew York, New York 10019, Telephone\nNo. (212) 247-6500.\nARC-11841\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1989\n\nAfter centuries of practice,\nmankind perfects engineering\ncalculations: MathCAD.\nNGINEE\\\\ING\n\n~\\ONJ>.\\Ssp..NC\\O\n\nAnnouncing MathCAD 2.5:\nThe Dawn of a New Age.\n\nequations ~ywhere on the screen,\nadd text to support your work, and\ngraph the results.

In an experimental\nsynthesis, ammonium neodecanoate soap\nwas prepared by reacting neodecanoic\nacid with ammonium hydroxide; this soap\nwas then reacted with silver nitrate, producing impure silver neodecanoate and\nammonium nitrate (see figure).

Such glasses cannot be made by conventional melting because the ingredients\nare immiscible liquids.\n50\n\nThe sol-gel process involves the hydrolysis and polycondensation of silicon tetraethoxide [Si(OC2H~J and magnesium nitrate hexahydrate to form a clear gel (see\nfigure). Because the free energy of a gel is\nhigher than that of a glass of the same\n\ncomposition, the gel can be converted into\nglass at temperatures far below the liquidus temperature. Besides producing glasses of new composition at lower processing\ntemperatures, the sol-gel method leads to\nimproved homogeneity and higher purity.\nIn experiments, magnesium nitrate hexahydrate was dissolved in alcohol and\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1989\n\nstirred with Si(OC~~4 that had been diluted in alcohol. Water was added, drop by\ndrop, and stirred in vigorously. The alcohol\nacted as a mutual solvent for Si(OC2H~4\nand water, which are immiscible with each\nother. A clear, homogeneous solution resulted.\nThe solution was allowed to stand for\ngelling, in some cases at room temperature and in other cases in a warm, constant-temperature bath. Gelation took several hours to many days, depending on the\nratio of water to Si(OC 2H~ 4\' the concentration of magnesium, and the temperature.\nThe gels were clear and monolithic and\ncracked into smaller pieces when dried for\nseveral days at room temperature. The\ndried gels were then sintered into glasses\nat temperatures up to 1,200 \xc2\xb0e.\nNo organic groups were detected in\nglasses heated to 800 \xc2\xb0e, but infrared\nspectroscopy showed trace amounts of\nhydroxyl groups even in specimens heated\nto 890 \xc2\xb0e.

The\nstand-alone profile program mathematically mcx:lels the environment of the spacecraft and generates a set of prOfile data for\nuse by the simulator. This set contains such\nttems as individual external torques; ephemerides of the GRO spacecraft, of the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TORS), and of\nthe Sun and Moon; and data on stars. The\nstand-alone prOfile program is run before a\nsimulation.\nThe SCIO subsystem is the executive\n\ndriver for the simulator. It accepts input\nfrom the user, initializes parameters, controls simulation, and generates output files\nof data and a display of the status of the\nsimulation. The TM subsystem mcx:lels the\nsensors, actuators, and dynamics of the\nspacecraft. It accepts ephemerides, data\non stars, and environmental torques from\nthe stand-alone profile program. With\nthese and actuator commands from the\nOBC subsystem, the TM subsystem propagates the current state of the spacecraft\nand generates sensor data for use by the\nOBC and SCIO subsystems.\nThe OBC subsystem uses sensor data\nfrom the TM subsystem, a Kalman filter (to\ndetermine the attitude), and control laws to\ncompute actuator commands to the TM\nsubsystem. The OBC subsystem also provides output data to the SCIO subsystem\nfor output to the analysts.\nThe postprocessor program is run after\nsimulation is completed. It generates\nprinter and cathode-ray-tube plots and\ntabular reports of the simulated data at the\ndirection of the user.\nGROSS is written in FORTRAN 77 and\nassembler and has been implemented on\na VP\\)( 111780 computer under VMS 4.5. It\nrequires a virtual memory of 255K. GROSS\nwas developed in 1986.\nThis program was written by J. Garrick\nof Goddard Space flight Center.

BOSOR4 performs large-deflection\naxisymmetric stress analysis, small-deflection nonsymmetric stress analysis, modal\nvibration analysis with axisymmetric nonlinear prestress included, and buckling\nanalysis with axisymmetric or nonsymmetric prestress. One of the main advantages\nof the BOSOR4 code is the provision for\nsuch realistic engineering details as eccentric load paths, internal supports, arbi\xc2\xb7\ntrary branching conditions, and a "library"\nof wall constructions.\nThe program is based on the finite-difference energy method and offers very rapid\nconvergence with increasing numbers of\nmesh points. The BOSOR4 analyses are\nbased on minimization of energy with con\xc2\xb7\nstraint conditions. The total energy of the\n\nsystem is taken to include the strain energy\nof the segments of the shell, the strain energy of the discrete rings, the potential energy of applied line loads and pressures,\nthe kinetic energy of the shell segments,\nand the kinetic energy of the discrete rings.\nThe constraint conditions arise from displacement conditions imposed anywhere\nin the composite shell and from conditions\nof compatibility between segments and\nbranches of the composite shell. These\ncomponents of energy and the constraint\nconditions are expressed in differential\nform in terms of the components of displacement of the reference surface of the\nshell at the finite-difference mesh points\nand in terms of the Lagrange multipliers.\nThe integration is performed numerically\nby means of the trapezoidal rule.

This formulation is logical\nand concise, making maximum use of vector.matrix algebra. It is also "error-free "\nand attempts to anticipate unexpected errors and situations that would hinder the\ncontinuity of the solution.\nThe OMAT program is developed for a\ntwo-body exoatmospheric problem with\nthree degrees of freedom in an inversesquare force field. The program offers two\ndifferent options: impulsive changes in\nvelocity and finite burns with low thrust-toweight ratios. Therefore, two distinct solutions are available from the program the optimal multi-impulse (OMI) solution\nand the optimal multiburn (OMS) solution.\nThe two solutions can be obtained separately, or the results of the OMI solution can\nbe used to guess the unknown parameters\nof the OMS solution. This capability allows\nfor nearly automatic design of missions\nwithout the requirement to guess controls.\nThe state, costate, and variational equations are propagated numerically on the\nburn arcs with a unique Runge-Kutta-Nystrom integrator and analytically on the\ncoast arcs. A combined gradient/NewtonRaphson iterator adapts readily to any reasonable guess of the unknown elements in\nthe parameter vector.\nThis program is written for the DEC Vtv<series computer. It is written completely in\nFORTRAN 77 and has a central-memory\nrequirement of 232,000 8-bit bytes. The\nprogram was made available in 1987.\nThis program was written by Donald J.\nJezewski of McDonnell Douglas Corp. for\nJohnson Space Center.

The objective of such testing\nis to identify the parameters (e.g., nodal\nmasses, stiffnesses of elements, and other\nquantities related to the shapes, sizes, and\nfrequencies of vibrational modes) of mathematical models used to predict the vibrations of such structures in the absence of\ngravitation and air.

This procedure may be repeated\nseveral times under different support/restraint (boundary) conditions.\nNo single test of this type yields data on\nall the parameters of the structure, and, in\nparticular, a test yields no data on the\nparameters of the parts located at the restraints. However, each test under different boundary conditions excites different\nportions of the structure and can be related\nto a small subset of the total mathematical\nformulation; this facilitates the modification\nor verification of the affected parts of the\nmathematical model, and recent theoretical developments make it possible to determine quantitatively the sensitivities of\nthe parameters to the results of a given\ntest. In addition, many different combinations and positions of the mechanical constraints can be used to obtain many different estimates of any desired parameter.\nStatistical theory suggests that the data\nfrom many different boundary conditions\ncan increase the accuracy of the mathematical model.\nExperiments were performed on an aluminum beam of uniform cross section, an\n\n~rst ~coordinate axIS,. and\naspect to time\xc2\xb7\n\n~VuP~g:~~:~:r citet~eo~::O~:1\n\nExperiments build confidence in this emerging technique,\n\nThe multiple-boundary-condition testing\n\nd Reports\n. andbOOl<s are\n\nsecond linl<S, .r~ the CNerdots\n\nrts studIes. h Technical\nThese re PO \'NASA as\n_\n(TSP\'s) when a ~e\nailable from\n\nMultiple-Boundary-Condition Vibration Tests\n\nmethcx:l is gaining acceptance as a tech-\n\nfNe~, andan\n\n54 Computing Optimal\nMultlarc Trajectories\n\n.\n01 the stead\'!\nted as a1\nractlon ,E,\nn\nis represe\nrth\n\naluminum beam of two different cross sections altemating along the length, and a 12bay truss structure.

A principal objective of this\nand related studies is to contribute to the\nunderstanding of chaotic motions in robot\nmanipulators and other deterministic mechanical systems. In this context, "chaotic" and "unstable" are not restricted to\ntheir customary meanings but are also\nused to characterize motions that are deterministic and may even remain finite but\nare unpredictable over long times.\nThe discussion begins with a brief review of previous studies of chaotic motion\nand introduces the notion of orbital instability in nonlinear systems. The authors introduce a geometric approach that is useful\nin the representation of orbital instability.\nIf the equations of a conservative, frictionless dynamical system can be put in the\nform of the equations of a point mass moving on a smooth nonplanar surface in the\nabsence of external forces, then, analogously to the motion of the point mass, the\nevolution of the system can be represented as a motion along a geodesic line on the\nsurface.\nA measure of the chaos in the motion is\nprovided by the distance d(t) between two\nsystems that started moving on two ge0desics a small distance do apart at t = 0\n(where t\ntime or other parameter that\ncharacterizes the motion along the trajectory). From differential geometry\nd(t)\ndo exp(tV-G)\nwhere G = the Gaussian curvature. Thus,\nif the curvature is negative, the separation\nincreases exponentially with time; I.e., the\nsystem is unstable or chaotic. If the curvature is positive, the separation oscillates,\nbounded by its initial value. (This is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for stability.)\nThe geometric approach is applicable to\nthe two-link planar mechanism. The kinetic\nenergy, E, of this system is given by the\nnonlinear equation\n\n=\n\n=\n\nE all~ + a\'2(f,.f2) ;l2 + a22;~\nwhere all and a22 are moments of inertia;\na 12 is a coordinatEHJependent product of\ninertia; fl and f2 are the angles between the\n\n=\n\n58\n\nfirst and second links, respectively, and an\ninertial coordinate axis; and the overdots\nrepresent derivatives with respect to time.\nThis equation is equivalent to that of a point\nmass moving on a two-dimensional surface characterized by coordinates fl\' f2\nand a curvature G that can be calculated\nas a function o~ f, and f2It tums out that the sign of G depends\nonly on COfi..f2 - f1). Therefore, the system\nis orbitally stable in some regions of the f"\nf2 p1ane but not in others. In particular, folded-arm configurations tend to be orbitally\nunstable (as one might expect intuitively),\nwhile extended-arm configurations tend to\nbe orbitally stable. Furthermore, the orbit\nof the system can pass through both stable\nand unstable regions.\nBecause the instability causes the arms\nto unfold eventually, it is apparent that no\ntrajectory can remain in the unstable region indefinitely. Though it is not obvious\nwhether one can find a trajectory that remains in the stable region, the authors may\nhave found one. In one of their numerical\nsimulations of this system, the arms were\nstretched out at the start and continued to\nrotate around the origin almost as a single\nrigid rod.\nThis -work was done by Anatoly Lokshin\nand Michail A. Zak of Caltech for NASA\'s\nJet Propulsion Laboratory. To obtain a\ncopy of the report, "Chaotic Motion in\nRobot Manipulators," Orele 39 on the TSP\nRequest card.\nNPO-17387\n\nVibrating Beam With\nSpatially Periodic Stiffness\nVibrational modes are\nanalyzed via a\nperturbation expansion.\nA report presents a theoretical analysis\nof the vibrations of a simply supported\nbeam, the bending stiffness of which varies\nabout a steady value, sinusoidally with\nposition along its length. This is a problem\nof practical importance because it is related to the vibrations of twisted-pair electric-power transmission lines. The twists\nare meant to promote the nonuniform\nshedding of vortexes and to prevent the\nresonant accumulation of vibrational energy from wind.\nThe beam is assumed to be long in c0mparison with its width and thickness, to have\nnegligible rotary inertia about its centerline,\nand to undergo negligible dynamic shear\ndistortions. Hooke\'s law is assumed to hold.\nThe equation of motion for vibrations of the\nbeam is written in the norrnal-mode form.\nThe equation is put in a dimensionless form\nin which the sinusoidal variation of stiffness\n\nis represented as a fraction,\xc2\xa3, of the steady\nvalue.\nThe exact equation is a nonlinear fourthorder differential equation with variable c0efficients. Because an exact analytic solution in closed form is not available, the\nauthor solves the equation approximately\nin closed form by expressing the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues as perturbation\nexpansions to first or second order in f..\nThe perturbation solutions are characterized in terms of the ratio Pin, where Pis\nthe number of half periods of the stiffness\nfunction in the length of the beam and n is\nthe number of the vibration mode. These\nsolutions exhibit two distinct ranges in\nwhich the effects of the perturbations are\nthe strongest: Pin < 1 and Pin near 2. The\nresults of the perturbation analysis are\nconfirmed by a finit~lement numerical\nsimulation and by measurements of vibra\xc2\xb7\ntions in a twisted-pair cable.\nAt Pin = 1, the maximum and minimum\nstiffnesses occur at the vibrational nodes\nin alternating sequence along the beam.\nAn anomaly occurs at Pin\n2, when the\nlengths of the vibration loops match the\nperiod of the stiffness function, the nodes\nare at the points of maximum stiffness, and\nthe antinodes are at the points of minimum\nstiffness. Furthermore, at the anomaly, the\nstiffnesses of the vibration loops vary most\nsharply with Pin , there is a jump in the\nnatural frequency of vibration, and the perturbation solution loses some accuracy\n(though it is still adequate to describe the\nqualitative characteristics of the vibrations).\nThe changes in the shapes of the vibrational modes with changes in Pin can be\nexplained in terms of energy principles. Afr\nparently, there is a tendency toward minimization of the elastic strain energy stored\nin the dynamic span via adjustment of the\nlengths of the vibrating loops until the same\naverage bending stiffness exists across\neach loop. Equalization of loop stiffnesses\nmay require the loops to have different\nlength~ depending on the vibrational\nmode. Because longer loops have greater\nmasses, the equal distribution of potential\n(and, therefore, kinetic) energy among the\nloops requires that longer loops vibrate at\nsmaller amplitudes.\nThis work was done by John S. Townsend\nof Marshall Space R ight Center. Further\ninformation may be found in NASA TP2697 [N88-23988].

The\nsystem ranks third in the nation among all universities and first among public universities in total\nfunding for research and development.\nThe Wisconsin Genter for Manufacturing and Pro\xc2\xb7\nductivity, established in 1977, brings the resources of\nthe state\'s seven engineering colleges to serve client\ncorporations with research assistance and technology\ntransfer.\nFor more information about a business environment in which technology prospers, call Forward\nWisconsin at (414) 223-3999 (outside Wisconsin), or\nthe Department of Development (in-state) at (608)\n266-1018.\n\n~/4\n\nTommy G.

UWMadison research has brought the\nworld vitamins , photoelectric\nastronomy, the eradication of infantile rickets, hybrid corn , bone\nmarrow transplants , the world\'s\nfirst orbiting observatory, digital\nsubtraction angiography, and synthetic genes.\nIn the space sciences and\nastronomy, UW-Madison has few\npeers. NASA alone spends almost\n$9 million annually to support\nWisconsin research , and sustains\nprojects ranging from studies of\nthe effects of microgravity on living creatures to the development\nof a global interactive computer\nnetwork to instantly track world\nprecipitation.\nThe university houses the\n.~\n.~ Wisconsin Center for Space\ng Automation and Robotics\n(; (WCSAR), one of NASA\'s Centers\nj for the Commercial Development\n8 of Space. WCSAR features three\ng thrusts: astrobotics, astroculture,\n-g and astrofuel.\n~\nAstrobotics is geared to the\n=>\n\n~\n\n\xc2\xa7\n~\nCl.\n\nResearchers from the Wisconsin Center\nfor Space Automat/on and Robotics plan\nto use robots In orbit and on the moon\nfor plant growth and harvesting.\n\ncreat ion of technologies that allow\nrobots to perform routine and\ncompl icated tasks in space. By\ndeveloping modular, add-on\nsystems to enhance dexterity, sensory perception , performance, and\ntelepresence in robots, humans\nwill be able to safely extend their\nreach beyond the confines of\nspacecraft or space stations.\nAstroculture focuses on the\ndevelopment of automated plant\ngrowth facilities for space. These\n" galactic gardens" promise to\nenhance life in space by providing\na plentiful source of oxygen and\nfood , and by removing carbon\ndioxide from the air and purifying\nwater for long-duration space\nflights and permanently manned\nspace stations .\nThe third research thrust ,\nastrofuel , aims to design and\ndevelop equipment to mine the\nmoon for helium-3, rare on Earth\nbut abundant on the moon . Conservative estimates put the moon\'s\nhelium-3 supply at one million\nmetric tons. A spacecraft the size\nof the shuttle could bring back a\nliquified load of 20 tons , enough\nhelium-3 to power the United\nStates for a year.\nHelium-3 would be the best\npossible fuel for nuclear fusion\n\nreactors because it would produce\nfar less radiation than other poten tial fuels, said Gerald R. Kulcinski ,\na UW-Madison professor of nuclear\nengineering and the director of the\nastrofuel project.\nThe roots of space-based\nastronomy - the placing of\ntelescopes and other astronomical\ninstruments above the haze of the\nEarth \'s atmosphere - lie in UWMadison\'s Space Astronomy\nLaboratory. When the rocketpowered X-15, considered to be\nthe first true spacecraft, coursed\nabove the atmosphere to begin the\nU.S. push into space, it carried\nwith it four UW-Madison-built\nultraviolet photometers.\nUW-Madison astronomers next\ndeveloped a payload of seven\ntelescopes which were placed in\nEarth orbit in 1968 aboard the\nworld\'s first space observatory, the\nOrbiting Astronomical Observatory\n(OAO), which resulted in the\ndiscovery of the hydrogen\nenvelopes that surround comets\nand provided the first real\nevidence that stars are still being\nborn throughout the galaxies.\nThe evolution of space\n\nthe development of powerful computing and imaging tools for\nmeteorologists and space\nscientists.\nAmong SSEC planetary instruments is the Net Flux\nRadiometer, now aboard the\nGalileo planetary probe awaiting\nan October launch to Jupiter. After\na six year voyage with its companion orbiter, the probe will descend\nbelow Jupiter\'s cloud tops and\nmake the first direct measurements of the planet\'s atmosphere.\nThe Net Flux Radiometer will\nmeasure solar and thermal energy\nfluxes which drive atmospheric\nmotions on Jupiter.\nAlthough putting hardware in\nspace is the prime mission of\nSSEC, it is also a world center for\nthe development of interactive\ncomputing systems capable of\nprocessing, organizing and displaying satellite images and other\nweather data in real time.\nMclDAS, or Man Computer Interactive Data Access System, is\nthe gold standard for such\nsystems. Conceived and developed\nat SSEC, MclDAS uses three- and\nfour-dimensional computer\n\nsystems that could disrupt their\npackage delivery system, Federal\nExpress in 1986 became one of\nthe first commercial users of\nMcIDAS. With MclDAS, Federal Express meteorologists can quickly\nalert pilots to changes in the\nweather that may affect flight\noperations.\nIn one example, a Federal Express flight to Salt Lake City had\nbeen deflected to Boise, Idi\'iho,\nbecause of fog . Using MclDAS,\ncompany meteorologists noticed\non a satellite image a downslope\nwind that was clearing the Salt\nLake airport of fog.

Wisconsin\nastronomers built one of HST\'s\nfive scientific instruments and\nhelped in the development of two\nothers. UW-Madison is the only\nuniversity to have contractor\nstatus for an HST instrument, the\nHigh-Speed Photometer.\nThe photometer will act as a\nsophisticated light meter to\nmeasure the quick changes in a\nstar\'s brightness, which could help\nastronomers locate black holes,\nobjects so massive and compact\nthat even light cannot escape their\ngravitational pull. The instrument\nmay detect the variability of light\nproduced by blobs of material as\nthey make their last few orbits\naround the hole before be ing\nsucked in .\nMuch of the spaceflight hard ware built on the UW-Madison\ncampus emanates from the Space\nScience and Engineering Center\n(SSEC).

With MclDAS, meteorologists\ncan analyze the weather at varying\nscales - 10 to 100 miles - every\nminute.\nThe computerized weather\nsystem is used by the National\nHurricane Center, the Air Force\nGeophysics Laboratory, the National Weather Service at its Centralized Storm Information Center\nin Kansas City, the Australian\nBureau of Meteorology, and by\nNASA\'s Johnson Space Center to\nsuppo rt stHJ t tie flights.\nTo keep a close eye on weather\n\n..\n\n>1\n\na;\n\nE\n\n<{\n\na\nc.\n\no\n\nu\n\nwhat the word processor is to\nwriters," said Richard Daly, a Colorgraphics founder and former\nSSEC staffer.\nIts principal applications, Daly\nsaid , lie in news and weather\ngraphics, computer animation , and\nadvertiSing .

The process\ninvolves implanting a target , such as a steel punch\nor drill bit, with a thin layer of ions of a different\nsubstance, such as nitrogen . Ions are atoms with\nthe electrons stripped off, leaving just the electrically charged nuclei.\nIon implantation may mean a tool such as a\npunch will last 80 times longer, Conrad said . Also ,\nthe cost of punches to produce 100,000 holes in a\nmanufacturing process could drop from more than\n\n.. ~\n\n$1000 to under $40.\nThe conventional ion implantation method requires complicated equ ipment to scan the beam\nacross targets and wastes many of the ion particles.\nIn Conrad \'s technique, called Plasma Source Ion\nImplantation , or PSII , the target is placed directly\ninto a vacuum chamber. The chamber is then filled\nwith plasma ions, and pulsed high voltage is applied\nto the target to attract ions to it.\nThe simplicity and economy of PSII means corporations now forced to send materials away for ion\nimplantation may be able to treat materials inhouse. It also allows ion implantation of a variety\nof large, small , and odd-shaped industrial tools that\ncannot be economically implanted by conventional\nmethods. Field tests of the new process are being\nrun at several Wisconsin companies . 0\n\nComputers\nUniversity\nResearch Park\n\n~I.\n~~ University of Wisconsin- Madison\n\nInnovation\nis BIG News ...\nbut it starts small\nWe\'re recognized worldwide as offering an environment for business growth\nthat fits each stage of a business\'s\ndevelopment:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Access to the largest public research\ninstitution in the United States, the\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Madison Gas and Electric\'s\nInnovation Center, committed to\ncreating and developing tomorrow\'s\nbusinesses, today.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The University Science Center-seven affordable, flexible-use\nbuildings designed to meet the most demanding office, laboratory\nor assembly needs.\nCall for complete information today.

Wiscons in\'s food\nmanufacturers have traditionally\nused biotechnology to produce\nfoods such as yogurt, soy sauce,\nand beer by harnessing\nmicroorganisms such as yeast and\nbacteria. Recent advances in\ngenetics and cell biology, however,\nhave resulted in the development\nof powerful new tools and\nmethods, collectively known as\nthe new biotechnology, that have\nsignificantly broadened our\ncapabilities to develop and improve products and processes.\nOne Wisconsin company that\nhas made the transition from the\nold to the new biotechnology is\nBio-Technical Resources (BTR).\nFounded in 1962, BTR grew out of\na brewing and malting laboratory.\nHaving long been experts in\ndeveloping microbial processes for\nbrewing and fermentation , BTR\nscientists are now adapting their\nknowledge to devise a cheaper\nand more efficient method for producing a chemical compound\nimportant to the aerospace industry - meta-hydroxy phenylacetylene. This compound is a key\nintermediate in the production of\nacetylene-terminated (AT) resins ,\nwhich are considered the leading\ncandidate materials for advanced\naerospace structural composites\nand adhesives .\nAT resins offer good thermooxAn Agracetus researcher hand\xc2\xb7\npollinates soybeans as part of a\nproject to develop hybrid soybean\nplants.\n\nidative stability, mechanical properties, and processability, as well\nas low moisture pick-up. They\nmay, for example, replace steel as\na structural component in\nairplanes and have the added\ndefense-related benefit of helping\nto make jet fighters "invi sible " to\nradar detection. The resins\'\ntemperature-resistant quality might\nalso prove useful in making computer circuit boards that tend to\nget hot.\nPerhaps the greatest impact of\nthe new biotechnology will be in\nagriculture, and Middleton \'s\nagricultural biotech firm ,\nAgracetus , is leading the way in\nbringing genetically engineered\ncrops closer to the marketplace.\nAgracetus was the first in the U.S.\nto conduct a field test of a\ngenetically engineered plant. Last\nsummer it tied Monsanto in producing the first genetically\nengineered soybeans. And in April\nof this year, Agracetus began the\nworld \'s first field test of cotton\nplants that are genetically\nmodified to resist insect attack.\nPart of their success is due to\nthe development of an innovative\ntechnology, called electric\ndischarge particle acceleration ,\nthat gives scientists a more efficient way to introduce for.eign\ngenes into plant cells . The " particle gun" method fires DNA-coated\ngold particles directly into the\nmeristem of the soybean embryo\n(the part of the seed that normally\ndevelops into a plant). By allowing\nthe "transformed" cells to grow\ndirectly into plants, the method\nbypasses the tissue culture step\nrequired in other plant transformation systems. This in turn reduces\nproduct development time by up\n\nto 2.5 years and decreases the incidence of mutation that is frequently introduced during tissue\nculture. More importantly, it extends sc ientists \' capabilities by\ntransforming important crops that\nwere previously not amenable to\ntissue culture.\nWhat is the sign ificance of\nthese events? Consider that U.S.\ncotton growers spend $150-200\nmillion annually to control damaging caterpillar infestation with\nchemical insecticides. Also consider the environmental and health\nhazards that a farmer is exposed\nto during the course of the multiple chemical sprayings that are\nnecessary to control these pests.\nAs chemicals are coming under\nclose public scrutiny, alternatives\nsuch as those provided by\nbiotechnology are greatly needed .\nFor example, by adding the gene\nfrom a common soil bacterium into the chromosome of a commercial cotton variety , Agracetus\nscientists have engineered a plant\nto produce a protein that kills\ncaterpillars. The bacterium is\nharmless to other insects, man,\nand animals, and has been widely\nused in biological pest control\nsince the early 1960s.\nBiotechnology is also creating\nnew opportunities in the computer\nsoftware business - opportunities\nthat the Genetics Computer Group\n(GCG) is taking full advantage of.\nThe genetic code is made up of\nfour nucleic acid bases, where\neach gene is composed of hundreds of these bases in a unique\nsequence. The business of\nunderstanding and manipulating\ngenes requires that the gene\'s se\xc2\xb7\nquence of nucleic acids is known\nand can be compared to other\nknown sequences.\nGCG distributes a software\npackage that includes over 100\nprograms and utilities for the\nanalysis of DNA and protein sequences. Five sequence databases\nare also distributed with the software, which is used by over 12,000\nscientists at hospitals, universities, and government research\nfacilities in 27 countries.\nCurrently, there are approximately 30,000 DNA sequences and 9000\nprotein sequences in the database.\nIt is estimated that these numbers\nare doubling every year. In addition , the Department of Energy\nand the National Institutes of\nHealth will be coordinating a major effort to sequence the entire\nhuman genome. Software such as\nthe GCG Package will figure prominently in completing this task and\nanalyzing the data.\n\nMedical Technology\nWaukesha-based General Electric (GE) Medical Systems is the\nonly American manufacturer that\nstill builds and sells all five of the\nso-called diagnostic imaging\nmodalities - x-ray, CT (computerized tomography) scanners,\nultrasound , nuclear medicine, and\nMR - or magnetic resonance scanners.\nGE leads the world market in\nMR technology. Images produced\nby MR are exquisitely detailed .\nUnlike x-ray or CT scanners, which\nuse ionizing radiation , MR scanners employ a strong magnetic\nfield and radio frequency signals\nto produce images of organs and\nsoft tissue. GE has sold hundreds\nof its Signa MR models.\nA Signa system, which can cost\nmore than $2 million , is noted for\nthe high magnetic-field strength of\nits superconducting magnet. Last\nyear, GE also introduced a midstrength, lower priced model , the\nMR Max, which it produces\nthrough a joint venture with\nYokogawa Medical Systems in\nTokyo.\nMetritlow, a small Milwaukee entrepreneurial company, is using\nmagnetic resonance imaging to\nbuild dedicated MR scanners that\nmeasure blood flow in patients\'\narms and legs. Just as the arteries\nthat carry blood from the heart can\nbecome blocked , so can blood\nvessels in the limbs. If flow cannot\nbe restored, the tissue dies and\nthe limb must be amputated .\nAs with heart disease, vascular\nsurgeons sometimes treat a\nblockage of blood vessels in the\nlegs with bypass surgery. But one\nof the more exciting and fastmoving developments is a treatment called laser angioplasty.\nUsing an argon laser, the surgeon\ncan insert a catheter precisely at\nthe point of blockage and reopen\nthe blood vessel.\nBefore surgery, Metriflow\'s\n\nAFM -100 scanner can diagnose the\nproblem and help determine the\nseverity of circulatory impairment.\nAfter the laser procedure, it can\nmeasure the patient \'s blood flow\nand quickly produce a printout\nthat determines whether the procedure has worked .\nLast year Metriflow took a leap\nforward by developing software\nthat makes a scan simpler and\nquicker for both patient and\noperator.

This\nmodification would improve the performance of the engine by allOWing the use of\nhigher chamber pressure. The concept\nmay also be applicable to advanced, highperformance terrestrial engines or some\nkinds of industrial combustion chambers.\nHeretofore, a typical liquid-fueled rocket\nengine has used regenerative cooling, in\nwhich fuel or oxidant is pumped along\nchannels in the wall of the combustion\nchamber. The pumped propellant absorbs\nheat from the wall, and the heat aids in the\nvaporization of the fluid upon subsequent\ninjection into the chamber. AA attempt to\nimprove performance by increasing pressure in the chamber requires a higher coolant-pump discharge pressure and a higher\npressure drop in the coolant. The latter two\neffects impose a limit beyond which the\nengine cannot be regeneratively cooled\nwith propellant and/or the power or other\nmeasure of overall performance of the\nengine cannot be increased.\nThe combination of transpiration and regenerative cooling should make it possible\nto exceed this limit. In the new cooling\nscheme (see figure), the chamber and nozzle sections of the wall of the combustion\nchamber would be cooled regeneratively\nwhile the throat section would be cooled by\ntianspiration. The fuel v\'/ou!d diffuse into\nthe chamber through small holes in the\nthroat section of the wall from bypass\nchannels that connect the chamber and\n\n~----------------------------------------------~\n--+---Throat Sectlon - ----t-\n\nRegeneratlve-Cooling\nChannel\n\nTranspiration Flow\n\nThe Throat Section of the combustion-chamber wall would be cooled by transpiration, while\nthe chamber and nozzle sections would be cooled by fluid flowing in closed channels.\n\nnozzle sections. The transpiration and regenerative flows can be apportioned with\nmetering channels, manifolds, and compartments. The bypass of the coolant\naround the throat section (as opposed to\npumping it through regenerative-cooling\nchannels in the throat section) should reduce significantly the pressure drop in the\ncoolant circuit, thereby reducing the required pumping power and discharge\npressure.\nTranspiration cooling degrades the performance of the engine somewhat by disturbing the fuel/oxidant mixture. The magnitude of this effect depends on the coolant\nfluid. However, the new cooling scheme\n\nshould increase the net output power. A\ntranspiration-cooled throat should be more\nreliable than a regeneratively cooled throat\nis when designed near its state-of-the-art\nlimit. With proper design, the new cooling\nscheme should make it possible to achieve\nhigher chamber pressure and higher overall performance in a smaller engine.\nThis work was done by Charles J.\nO\'Brien of Aerojet TechSystems Co. for\nMarshall Space Right Center.

The actuator is designed for use\nas part of a relief valve in a system that\nstores liquid oxygen.\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1989\n\nThe actuator rod is connected to a small\npiston that slides inside a large piston. The\nlarge piston slides in the bore of a housing,\nsupported at one end by a spring-energized two-piston-ring seal and at the other\n\nend by a split ring (see figure). A return\nspring pushes the rod away from the housing (to the right in the figure).\nWhen no pressure is applied to the pistons through the supply port, the actuator\n75\n\nrod remains at its outermost (rightmost)\nposition. When the applied pressure is increased to Pl\' the iarge piston moves to the\nleft, pulling the small piston and the rod\nwith it, until it comes to a stop against the\nouter face seal in the bore. This stop\nestablishes the intermediate position of the\nactuator rod.\nWhen the pressure is increased from P\nl\nto P the small piston is driven to the left in\xc2\xb7\n2\'\nside the large piston until it comes to a stop\nagainst the inner face seal in the large\npiston.

When\nthe pressure is decreased, the return\nspring rmves the actuator rod back to the\nright, in the reverse of the preceding sequence.\n\'Nhen the pressure is cycled up and OOwn,\nthere is little hysteresis in the back-andforth motion of the actuator rod because\nthe seals are designed for low friction.

Langley Research Center has nearly 40 wind tunnels\nvarying in size and complexity from small,\ninexpensive research tunnels to the new,\n$85-million National Transonic Facility. The\nestimated replacement cost of Langley\'s\nwind tunnels approaches $1 billion. The\nreport focuses on 14 major tunnels, 8 of\nwhich are unique in the world and 3 of\nwhich are unique in this country.\nScrne of Langley\'s wind tunnels are over\n50 years old. During the past decade, more\nthan $100 million has been spent in up-\n\ngrading the major existing tunnels, and approximately another $100 million on new\nconstruction. In addition to routine repair,\nrefurbishment, and modernization, emphasis has been placed on increased capability. Row quality has been Improved\nacross the speed regime. Cryogenic technology has been used to achieve full-scale\nReynolds-number capability and increased\nflexibility. Advances in instrumentation,\nparticularly non intrusive techniques, have\nbeen exploited. Two new supersonic tunnels are being added to increase Langley\'s\ncapability for supersonic tests. The hypersonic complexes are being upgraded and\nexpanded in both propulsion and aerothermal capabilities.\nThe report covers the Langley Spin Tunnel, which is uniquely designed to free-spin\ntest dynamically scaled models to determine-spin and recovery characteristics\nof aircraft. Despite the age of this facility\n(45 years), it is serviceable and is in continuous two-shift operation.\nThe report includes the new National\nTransonic Facility (NTF), a cryogenic, fandriven wind tunnel designed to provide fullscale Reynolds-number capability in the\ncritical flight regimes of most current and\nplanned aircraft. It can operate at mach\nnumbers from 0.2 to 1.2.\nThis report also surveys the Langley\nUnitary Plan Wind Tunnel (UPWT), a\n\nclosed-ci rcuit, variable-pressu re facility\nwith a mach-number range of 1.47 to 4.6.\nVirtually every supersonic airplane, missile, and spacecraft in the United States inventory has undergone extensive tests in\nthis facility since it began operating in\n1955.\nThe report addresses the resurgence of\nthe inexpensive Oess than $100 thousand),\nsimpie-tO<Jperate research tunnels. Several of these tunnels exist at Langley to perform fundamental research that is not appropriate for the larger, more expensive\ntunnels.\nThe report predicts that there will be no\nshortage of tools for the aerospace researcher and engineer in the next decade\nor two. There will be new major wind tunnels and many research tunnels. New advances will prOVide unparalleled diagnostiC\ntools.\nThis work was done by Robert E. Bower\nof langley Reeeerch Center.

The obscuration ratio is the fraction of surface area\ncovered by the particles. It is useful as an\nindex of cleanliness in clean-room operations in the manufacture of semiconductor\ndevices, magnetic recording media, optical devices, and pharmaceutical and biotechnological products.\nThe complete description of the cleanliness of a surface requires the areal density of particles as a function of their sizes. In\nmany cases, the data available are too limited to provide this distribution. Limitations\ninclude the granularity of the particle-size\nintervals and the statistics of the particle\ncounts. In addition, the complete distributions for two surfaces do not, in general,\npermit the comparison of their cleanliness.\nOnly in the special case in which the distri78\n\nbution for one surface is bounded by the\ndistribution of another for all particle sizes\nmay one state that the first surface is\ncleaner than the second. Nevertheless,\nthe obscuration ratio is a convenient measure of contamination with respect to effects that are proportional to the squares of\nthe sizes of particles.\nFor the purpose of this estimation, it is\nassumed that the available measurements\nand counts of particles can be fitted to a\ncontinuous areal-<1ensity distribution. To\naccommodate fibers, particles of roughly\nspherical shape, and various size-dependent quantities, the cross-sectional area of a\nparticle in the distribution is considered to\nbe proportional to an arbitrary power of the\nsize of the particle (e.g., diameter2 for a\nsphere or length1 for a fiber).\nThe assumed distribution is a generalized\nform of the one in MIL-STD-1246A:\n\n=\n\nlog n(>d)\nlog no + s log 2 d\nwhere n(>d) the number of particles per\nunit area of size greater than d, no\nthe\nnumber of particles per unit area of size\ngreater than 1 j.IITl, s = the slope (s is\nnegative), and d = the particle size in\nmicrometers (d greater than or equal to 1).\nUsing this distribution, the obscuration\nratio R for spherical particles is given by\nR\n(nI4)no{1 +21n10\n\n=\n\n=\n\n=\n\nY.\n\n[10 - 1/S\n\n(\n\n11\n\n-s In(10)\n\n)\n\nP.

In conventional isothermal-forging\nequipment, the forging stroke must be at\nleast twice as long as the shaft being\nforged to enable the loading and unloading\nof the workpiece. In the proposed equipment, which is based on the modification\nof conventional isothermal-forging equipment, the required stroke could be cut by\nmore than half. This would enable the forging of shafts as long as 48 in. (122 cm) on\na typical modified conventional forging\npress, which would otherwise be limited to\nmaking shafts no longer than 18in. (46cm).\nThe principal feature of the modified apparatus would be a removable punch (upper die) (see figure). The upper die would\nbe part of a stack that would include\nspacers. Some of the spacers could be removed to enable the workpiece and punch\nto be loaded into the forging chamber. After\ncompletion of a forging cycle, the workpiece and punch would be removed from\nthe forging chamber together and disassembled outside the press.\nOnly the region of the workpiece at the\njunction of the disk and shaft undergoes\nsignificant plastic deformation; therefore,\nthe existing heating elements on a conventional isothermal-forging press would be\nadequate for use In the modified version.\nThe workpiece would not remain isothermal during the forging process in the\nmodified apparatus. Once the material extruded past the orifice in the punch, it\nwould move out of the heat zone and shrink\naway from the punch.\nThe process and equipment are suited\nto the forging of alloys that exhibit superplasticity at some range of temperature\nand strain rate. A workpiece of an alloy\notherwise difficult to process could be preformed by end upset, and a shaft could be\nisothermally forged into it, producing a\nhigh-integrity disk/shaft component that\nwould have radial flow of grain in the disk\nand axial flow of grain in the shaft.

From the calibration\ndata, it is also possible, in principle, to calculate the equilibrium position and orientation in the presence of Earth gravitation.\nThe sample is not levitated acoustically\nduring the calibration.\nThe technique relies on the BoltzmannEhrenfest adiabatic-invariance principle,\none consequence of which is that the effective potential energy of an object in an\nisolated acoustic mode of a cavity is proportional to the resonant frequency of that\nmode. The factor of proportionality depends on the properties of the mode. Such\nequilibrium levitation properties as the\nposition and orientation of the object are\ndetermined by measuring the conditions\nunder which the total energy of the objecUcavity system is minimized. Thus, by\nmeasuJing the resonant frequency as the\norientation or position (or both) of the 0bject is varied, one can find the equilibrium\norientation or position (or both) as that\nwhich minimizes the measured resonant\nfrequency.\nFigure 1 illustrates the use of this technique in a round cylindrical levitation\nchamber. (However, the technique is applicable to objects and chambers of arbitrary\nshape.) The object is rigidly supported at a\nselected position and orientation, and the\nfrequency of the acoustic driver is adjusted\nto resonance, as indicated by maximum\nsound-pressure amplitude detected by the\nmicrophone. The process is repeated for\nother positions and/or orientations to find\nthe minimum resonant frequency and to\nobtain plots of the relative shifts in the resonant frequency as functions of position and!\nor orientation. The process can be automated 3nd controlled by a computer.\nBy use of the Boltzmann-Ehrenfest principle, one can convert the resonant-frequency-shift data into data on the normalized acoustical potential energy. Of course,\nthe minimum of this energy occurs at the\nequilibrium point. From the gradients of the\nacoustical potential energy, one can calculate the acoustical restoring force or\ntorque on the object as a function of the deviation from the equilibrium position or\norientation.\n80\n\nData Bus\n\nFrequency\nSynthesizer\n\nDigital\nVoltmeter\n\nComputer\n\nPower\nAmplifier\n\nMicrophone\nPreamplifier\n\nMicrophone\n\nAcoustic\nDriver\n\nCylindrical\nChamber\n\nFigure 1.

The sYStem does not damage the\ninspected article, is easy to operate, and\ncan be used to perform "goIno-go" evaluations or as a supplement to conventional\ndestructive pull-plug testing.\nThe system applies a vacuum to a small\narea of the foam panel and measures the\ndistance through which the foam is pulled\ninto the vacuum. (The rest of the panel remains at atmospheric pressure.) The measurable deflection is greater in an unbonded\nthan in a bonded area, and the magnitude\nof deflection that signifies a failure of adhesion can be determined on specimens of\nknown condition for subsequent use as a\n"g~n<>9o " criterion.\nThe system consists primarily of a probe\nhead connected through wires and a hose\nto a controller/monitor unit (see figure). The\nprobe head is a transparent cylindrical\nchamber 81,4 in. (21.0 cm) long and 6 in.\n(15.2 cm) in diameter that applies the\nvacuum to the area of foam to be tested. A\nsoft rubber seal bonded to the rim of the\nchamber helps to maintain the vacuum. A\nspring-mounted linear variable-differential\ntransformer (LVOT) on the axis of the\nchamber measures the deflection of the\nfoam during a test. The controller/monitor\nunit contains a mechanical pump that\nevacuates the probe head through the\nhose and a digital voltmeter that indicates\nthe displacement of the LVOT.\nThe testing procedure is simple. The\nprobe head is positioned on the specimen\nand pumped to a low vacuum. After waiting\nabout 15 s for the specimen to stabilize, the\ndisplacement of the LVOT is recorded. The\nprobe head is then pumped to a high vacuum, and again the specimen is allowed to\nstabilize for 15 s before a reading is taken\nwith the LVOT. The difference between the\nLVOT readings is the measured deflection\nto be compared with the "standard" value.\nThe ability to detect flaws via this measurement decreases with the thickness of the\nfoam.\nThis work was done by James F.

Although the\nloss of the cross-correlation information\nmakes this a suboptimal approach, the\nsacrifice in optimality may not be substantial in comparison with the prior error\ncaused by the erroneous assumption of\nwhite noise in the Kalman-filter eauations.\nThe new technique for conversion of the\nrange-domain state estimates to the navigation-state estimate involves the" conversion" algorithm, which enables the filtered\nrange-domain state estimates from each\nsatellite to be incorporated sequentially\ninto the navigation-state estimate as they\nbecome available. The conversion algorithm consists basically of a conventional\n\nThe mathematical basis has been developed for Kalman filtering of sequential\nmeasurements of the range (that is, the\ndistance) from a single-channel receiver in\nthe Global Positioning System (GPS) to\neach of several navigation satellites. The\nmain advantages of the new range-filtering\ntechnique, in contrast with the more-conventional navigation-filtering technique,\nare simplification of tuning and decreases\nin the required amounts of storage and\nprocessing of data for navigation in ships,\nairplanes, and ground vehicles.\nRange filtering involves the separate application of a kinematic Kalman tracking\nfilter to the measurements of the signal\nfrom each satellite in use (see figure). The\nstate vector consists of the pseudorange\nand its time derivatives. Typically, the first\none or two derivatives are used, giving two\nor three state variables, respectively.

Instead, an equivalent state-error-covariance matrix is based on the individual\nrange-filter state-error covariances and on\nthe satellite geometry. The conversion algorithm can be set up to operate under\n"clock coasting"; that is, navigation can\ncontinue for a short time when the accessible satellites become insufficiently numerous to determine the clock error.\nMeasurements from auxiliary sensors\ncan be integrated into the filtering scheme\nin several ways, depending on the type. For\nexample, by use of a mathematical "virtual\nsatellite," altimeter measurements can be\ntreated equivalently to satellite range\nmeasurements. Inertial measurements\ncan be used as a navigation-domain process driver in the conversion filter, and the\npredicted navigation-domain state estimate can then be used to compute the predicted range-domain state estimates, thus\nenabling the use of narrower range-filter\nbandwidths for improved rejection of\nnoise.

The purpose of such\nstudies is to optimize dual-camera configurations used to view the workspaces of\nremote manipulators at distances of 1 to\n3 m from the cameras. On the basis of\ntheir findings, the authors propose a\nstrategy that minimizes the stereoscopic\ndepth distortion without sacrificing stereoscopic depth resolution.\nTo provide high depth resolution with\nadequate overlap of the stereo image\npairs, the viewing axes of the cameras are\nmade to converge on the point of interest.\nAs the intercamera distance increases, the\ndepth resolution increases, but so does the\ndepth distortion. Conversely, the depth distortion can be reduced by decreasing the\ndistance between cameras, but depth resolution is decreased. Heretofore, some researchers have advocated orthostereoscopic camera alignments (those that\nimitate natural human viewing conditions),\nwhile others have advocated hyperstereoscopic alignments (those with unnaturallylarge camera separations).\nThe authors note that the small-angle\napproximations used in most previous\nanalyses obscured the relationship between the stereoscopic distortion and the\nmajor parameters of the camera configurations. To explore this relationship more\nfully, they present a rigorous geometric\nanalysis without small-angle approximations. They also ask whether human observers\' responses follow the predictions of\n\nthe geometric analysis despite internal\nhuman perceptual corrections and distortions.\nExperiments were performed to answer\nthe latter question. Human observers used\na Honeywell (or equivalent) field-sequential\nstereoscopic viewing system and viewed\ntwo vertical rods through two television\ncameras. One rod was placed at a distance of 1.3 m from the line between the\ncameras; the other was placed at various\ndistances a few centimeters closer or farther than 1.3 m. In one set of experiments,\nthe cameras were translated to different\ndistances along the line between them. In\nanother set of experiments, the cameras\nwere rotated about a point between them.\nIn all the experiments, the observers were\nasked to report their perceptions of which\nof the two rods appeared closer to the\nviewer.\nThe experimental results show that although uncertainties in depth perception\nvary among observers, the perceived\ndepth distortions follow the predictions of\nthe geometric analysis. Thus, the observers\' internal corrections and distortions do\nnot invalidate the usefulness of the\ngeometric analysis in the prediction of optimal camera configurations.\nAccording to this analysis, the static\nstereoscopic depth distortion can be decreased, without decreasing the stereoscopic depth resolution, by increasing the\ncamera-to-object and intercamera distances and the camera focal length. The\nanalysis further predicts that the dynamic\nstereoscopic depth distortion can be\nreduced by rotating the cameras around\nthe center of the circle (the Vieth-Mueller\ncircle)that passes through the point of convergence of the viewing axes and the first\nnodal points of the two camera lenses.\nThis work was done by Daniel B.

But I like to get closer\nthan that.\nSo before I load the skill onto my machine, I go over the whole table\nwith a polishing stone. Then I check the numbers after every cut and make\nadjustments as I go. That way I hold my tolerances tighter-to plus or\nminus three instead of five.\nThere\'s a guy down the line that has to do his job with the skin I\nmake. I\'m just making sure he can rely on me. He\'s doing his job the same\nway. That\'s the best way-maybe the only way-to build reliability into\nour rockets." -Joe Hall, Delta Rocket, Numerical Control Machine Operator\n~CDONNELLDOUGLAS\n\nA company of leaders.\nCircle Reader Action No. 501\n\n'
