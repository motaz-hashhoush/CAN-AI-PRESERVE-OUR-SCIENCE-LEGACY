b'waveguide structure should maintain the\ncharacteristics of the periodically poled\nbulk substrate, allowing for the efficient\nfrequency conversion typical of waveguides and the high optical damage\nthreshold and long lifetimes typical of\nthe 5% doped bulk substrate. The low\ncost and large area of 5% MgO:LN\nwafers, and the improved performance\nof the proposed ridge waveguide structure, will enhance existing measurement\ncapabilities as well as reduce the resources required to achieve high-performance specifications.\nThe purpose of the ridge waveguides\nin MgO:LN is to provide platform tech-\n\nnology that will improve optical power\nhandling and conversion efficiency\ncompared to existing waveguide technology. The proposed ridge waveguide\nis produced using standard microfabrication techniques. The approach is enabled by recent advances in inductively\ncoupled plasma etchers and chemical\nmechanical planarization techniques.\nIn conjunction with wafer bonding,\nthis fabrication methodology can be\nused to create arbitrarily shaped waveguides allowing complex optical circuits to be engineered in nonlinear optical materials such as magnesium\ndoped lithium niobate. Researchers\n\nhere have identified NLO (nonlinear\noptical) ridge waveguide structures as\nhaving suitable value to be the leading\nfrequency conversion structures. Its\nvalue is based on having the low-cost\nfabrication necessary to satisfy the challenging pricing requirements as well as\nachieve the power handling and other\nspecifications in a suitably compact\npackage.\nThis work was done by Phillip Himmer of\nMontana State University and Philip Battle,\nWilliam Suckow, and Greg Switzer of AdvR\nInc. for Goddard Space Flight Center.

GSC-16031-1\n\nModifying Matrix Materials to Increase Wetting and Adhesion\nImprovements are achieved at lower cost and without degradation of fibers.\nMarshall Space Flight Center, Alabama\nIn an alternative approach to increasing the degrees of wetting and adhesion between the fiber and matrix\ncomponents of organic-fiber/polymer\nmatrix composite materials, the matrix\nresins are modified. Heretofore, it has\nbeen common practice to modify the\nfibers rather than the matrices: The\nfibers are modified by chemical\nand/or physical surface treatments\nprior to combining the fibers with matrix resins \xe2\x80\x94 an approach that entails\nconsiderable expense and usually results in degradation (typically, weakening) of fibers.\nThe alternative approach of modifying the matrix resins does not entail\ndegradation of fibers, and affords opportunities for improving the mechanical properties of the fiber composites.\n\n16\n\nThe alternative approach is more costeffective, not only because it eliminates expensive fiber-surface treatments but also because it does not\nentail changes in procedures for manufacturing conventional compositematerial structures.\nThe alternative approach is best described by citing an example of its application to a composite of ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE)\nfibers in an epoxy matrix. The epoxy matrix was modified to a chemically reactive, polarized epoxy nano-matrix to increase the degrees of wetting and\nadhesion between the fibers and the matrix. The modification was effected by incorporating a small proportion (0.3\nweight percent) of reactive graphitic\nnanofibers produced from functional-\n\nized nanofibers into the epoxy matrix\nresin prior to combining the resin with\nthe UHMWPE fibers. The resulting increase in fiber/matrix adhesion manifested itself in several test results, notably\nincluding an increase of 25 percent in\nthe maximum fiber pullout force and an\nincrease of 60\xe2\x80\x9365 percent in fiber pullout energy. In addition, it was conjectured that the functionalized nanofibers\nbecame involved in the cross linking reaction of the epoxy resin, with resultant\nenhancement of the mechanical properties and lower viscosity of the matrix.\nThis work was done by Katie Zhong of North\nDakota State University for Marshall Space\nFlight Center.
