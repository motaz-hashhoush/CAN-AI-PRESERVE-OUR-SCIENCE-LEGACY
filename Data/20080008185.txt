Tresansky; John R.\nManning; Harry Lupuloff\nABSTRACT\n1571\nA temperature responsive transmitter is provided in\nwhich frequency varies linearly with temperature. The\ntransmitter includes two identically biased transistors\nconnected in parallel. A capacitor, which reflects into\nthe common bases to generate negative resistance effectively in parallel with the capacitor, is connected to the\ncommon emitters. A crystal is effectively in parallel\nwith the capacitor and the negative resistance. Oscillations occur if the magnitude of the absolute value of the\nnegative resistance is less than the positive resistive\nimpedance of the capacitor and the inductance of the\ncrystal. The crystal has a large linear temperature coefficient and a resonant frequency which is substantially\nless than the gain-bandwidth product of the transistors\nto ensure that the crystal primarily determines the frequency of oscillation. A high-Q tank circuit having an\ninductor and a capacitor is connected to the common\ncollectors to increase the collector current flow which\nin turn enhances the radiation of the oscillator frequency by the inductor.\n9 Claims, 2 Drawing Figures\n\nU S Patent\n..\n\n4,689,621\n\nAug 25,1981\n\nP\nFIG.\\\n\n1\n\n4,689,621\n\nTEMPERATURE RESPONSIVE TRANSMI\xe2\x80\x99ITER\nORIGIN O F THE INVENTION\nThe invention described herein was made by an em- 5\nployee of the U.S. Government, and may be manufactured and used by or for the Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties\nthereon or therefor.\n\n10\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\nThe invention relates to temperature indicating devices, and more pmicularly to a transmitter in which\nfrequency varies with temperature.\n15\nBACKGROUND ART\nto\nAccurate temperature measurement is\nIt is particUlar1y important in the\nmany\nwhere\nand\ntemperature mea- 20\nsurements indicate the health of a patient, or how the\npatient is reacting to various conditions. Measuring the\ninternal temperature Of a pm Of a patient\xe2\x80\x99s body may be\na temperaaccomP1ished by implytingy Or\nture responsive transmitter.\n25\nTemperature responsive klWd&ers generally utilize\na temperature sensitive component which varies in\nsome physical characteristic, such as resistance, inductance, or capacitance, as temperature changes. This\nvariation, in turn, is employed to change the frequency 3o\nof the transmitter. Factors of interest which affect the\ndesign of a temperature responsive transmitter include\nlinearity with temperature, frequency stability, freWencY range, Power consumption, output Power, ternperature range, accuracy, physical size, and cost.\n35\nTypical components which have been utilized in\ntemperature responsive transmitters as temperature\nsensitive components to Cause the frequency O the\nf\ntransmitter to change with temperature are thermistors,\ndiodes, and Piezoelectric crystals. Where a thermistor is 40\nused to vary the frequency of a transmitter, linearity\nand stability have proved to be unsatifactory. Where a\ndiode is used, the voltage across the diode varies with\ntemperature, and this voltage change must be converted\nto a change in frequency. To change the diode voltage 45\nto frequency requires complex circuitry, and the linearity of conversion is generally not satisfactory. The complex circuitry also increases the size of the transmitter\nwhich makes it more suitable for external use rather\nthan internal use. When a piezoelectric crystal is used as 50\nthe frequency determining element of a transmitter,\nlinearity and frequency stability are satisfactory if the\ncrystal is specially cut to have a large linear temperature\ncoefficient. Previously, these specially cut crystals were\nrelatively expensive, and this limited their use to situa- 55\ntions in which the probability of loss of the temperature\nresponsive transmitter was low.\n\n2\n\nIt is still another object of this invention to provide a\ntemperature responsive transmitter in which frequency\nis stable over a broad range of frequencies.\nIt is still a further object of this invention to provide\na temperature indicating transmitter which is accurate.\nIt is yet a further object of this invention to provide a\ntemperature responsive transmitter with low power\nconsumption and constant output power over its operating frequency range.\nYet a further object of this invention is to provide an\noscillator circuit in which frequency varies linearly\nwith temperature over a broad temperature range.\nAccording to the present invention, these and other\nobjects are attained by providing two identically biased\ntransistors connected together in parallel. A capacitor is\nconnected to the common emitters such that its capacitance is reflected to the common bases to generate negative resistance. The negative resistance and the capacitor are effectively in parallel, and oscillations will occur\nwhen an inductor, such as a crystal, is placed effectively\nin parallel with them and when the positive resistive\nimpedance of the capacitor and the inductor is less than\nthe negative resistance. The crystal is selected to have a\nlinear temDerature coefficient and a resonant freauencv\nwhich is \xe2\x80\x98substantially less than the gain-banciwidt;\nproduct of the transistors. A high-Q tank circuit having\nan inductor and a capacitor is connect to the\ncollectors.\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION O F THE DRAWINGS\n\nFIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of the temperature\nresponsive transmitter of\ninvention.\nFIG. 2 is a schematic diagram of the temperature\nresponsive oscillator of this invention.\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION O F THE\nINVENTION\nReferring now to the drawings wherein like reference numerals and characters designate identical or\ncorresponding parts throughout the several views, and\nmore particularly to FIG. 1 wherein the temperature\nresponsive transmitter 10 of the present invention is\nshown as including two transistors, TIand T2, connected in parallel.
