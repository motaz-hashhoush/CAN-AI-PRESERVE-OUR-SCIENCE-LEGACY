Nine members of the aircraft turbine engine community were invited to participate in an evaluation of these gauges.

(ref. \t\ndescribes the development and evaluation, of high-temperature (700 \xc2\xb0C) gauges\nfabricated from specially developed Fe-Cr-A1-V-Ti-Y (26 Cr, 5 Al, wt %) alloy\n\n)\n\nwire. As part of the Lewis Research Center HOST program, a number of these\ngauges and a quantity of P12-2 ceramic adhesive were purchased for evaluation\npurposes from the China National Aero-Technology Import and Export Corporation\nof Beijing, China.\nNine members of the aircraft turbine engine community were invited to\nparticipate in an evaluation of these gauges. Each participant was sent one\nstrain gauge, a small amount of ceramic adhesive, instructions for mounting\nthe gauge or a test beam (not supplied) and a set of suggestions for the\nevaluation experiment.\nThe discussion which follows includes data on the variation of gauge factor, apparent strain and drift as a function of temperature. The reported\nresults are f.,m six participants.\n\nDISCUSSION\nGauge Factor\nFigure 1 is a plot of percent change in gauge factor from its room temperature value versus temperature for five different evaluators. The trend is\nfor gauge factor to decrease with increasing temperature. The average slope\nis -3.5 percent/100 K, with a maximum data spread of \xc2\xb18 percent. The curve\nlabeled Wu is from reference 1 and is based on eight gauges bonded `o both\nsides of a constant-moment beam strained to 938 microstrain. Curves from the\nother evaluators are averaged data in both tension and compression at several\nstrain levels in the range 300 to 2000 microstrain.\nBy way of comparison, some interesting results have recently been reported\non by Stetson (re.. 2) with Kanthal A-1 (Fe, 22 Cr, 5.7 Al, 0.5 Co, wt %)\ngauges. These ,,uges exhibit gauge factor characteristics similar to the\nChinese gauges as shown in figure 2. The solid line curves are the envelope\nof curves from figure 1 and the dashed line curves show the data spread on the\neight Kanthal A 1 gauges tested in reference 2.\nthe average values of gauge factor at room temperature and the indicated\nhigh temperatures are listed in table I. All the Chinese gauges used in the\nevaluation had a specified room temperature g auge factor of 2.62, which is\nwithin 4 percent of the average of the five gauges listed in table I.\n\nApparent Strain\nThe comparison of apparent strain data between evaluators is difficult\nbecause several factors influence the shape of the resistance-temperature\ncurve. Aside from the sensor temperature coefficient of resistance, the magnitude and curve shape appear to be most strongly affected by the cooling rate\nof the previous temperature excursion and to a lesser degree by the difference\nin temperature coefficient of expansion between the gage alloy and 0e substrate material. A further consideration is the construction of the Chinese\ngauges. These gauges have a relatively large amount of ceramic cement which\nencapsulates the wire and, together with the large size of the gauge could\ninfluence apparent strain by causing a bending moment to occur, especially if\nbonded to a thin substrate.\n\n_D\n\nTable II lists the evaluator, the substrate material used in the test and\nthe number of thermal cycles reported.\nFigure 3, a plot of apparent strain versus temperature, is based on an\naverage of the number of cycles from table II. All curves are normalized to\npass through zero at room temperature. A gauge factor of 2.0 was used to calculate microstrain.\nIn order to compare the Kanthal A-1 data to the Chinese gauges, figure 4\nwas drawn to show the envelope of the curves from figure 3, shown as solid\nlines, and the Kanthal A-1 data plotted as dashed lines. It is obvious from\nfigure 4 that both alloys have similar S-shaped curves, but the Kanthal A-1\nhas a much higher value of apparent strain at elevated temperatures. It can\nalso be noted that the maximum data spread at any temperature for both alloys\nis similar in spite of the fact that the Kanthal data were obtained from a single facility and the same substrate material for all eight gauges as opposed to\nhow the Chinese gauge data were obtained. The implication here is that under\ncarefully controlled tests, the Chinese alloy should exhibit much better\nrepeatability in cycle-to-cycle apparent strain testing.\nFigure 5 has been reproduced directly from the report of evaluator 5.\nThis figure is a typical slow heat!5 9 cycle and is presented to illustrate the\ninflection point which is present in each cycle at about 700 K (425 \xc2\xb0C;. Two\nother evaluators also show a "bump" occurring near that same temperature. A\npossible explanation for this anomaly is the extremely high negative drift\nrate in the range of 700 to 870 K, as reported by evaluator 3. This behavior,\nrelated L^ some specific metallurgical process, reinforces the s}atements in\nthe Conclu.ions pertaining to the care required in usiny these gauges in that\nunstable temperature region.\n\nDrift\nDrift test results are shown in figure\ndrift data agree on the slope of the curves,\nResearch Center data having an overall drift\nShort-term drift rates, however, are higher,\nstrain for the first hour.\n\n6.

Data are also included from\nwork done by Professor Wu frc,n his criginal paper describing the Chinese\nalloy. K. Stetson of UTRC and H. Grant, PWA, as part of a recent contract\neffort for NASA, have published data in a contractor report on Kanthal A-1\'\ngauges. Kanthal A 1 is a ternary alloy similar to the Chinese alloy, each\nwith different trac? elements.\t\nThese data are also included.\n\n3\n\nGauge factor. - Results of gauge factor versus temperature tests show\ngauge factor decreasing with increasing temperature. The average slope is\n-3.5 percent/100 K, wi\'h an uncertainty band of \xc2\xb18 percent. Values of room\ntemperature gauge factor for the Chinese and Kanthal A-1 gauges averaged 2.73\nand 2.12, respectively. The room temperature gauge factor of the Chinese\ngauges was specified to be 2.62.\n\nApparent strain. - The apparent strain data for both the Chinese alloy\nand Kanthal A-1 showed large cycle to cycle nonrepeatability. This variability is influenced by heating and cooling rates of the previous cycle, dwell\ntimes at various temperatures and type of substrate on which the gauge is\nbonded. H. Grant of PWA CT, as a result of extensiv? testing, has identified\ncooling rate as the predominant factor.\nAll apparent strain curves had a similar S-shape, first going negative\nand then rising to posi^-^ value with increasing temperatures. The mean\ncurve for the Chinese gauges between room temperature and 1000 K has Z: total\n\nappareni strain of 1500 microsilr?in. The equivalent value for Kanthal A-1 was\nabout 9000 microstrain.\nDrift. - Drift tests at 950 K for 50 hr show an average drift rate of\nabout 9 microstrain/hr. Short-term (1 hr) rates are higher, averaging about\n-40 microstrain for the first hour. In the temperature range 700 to 870 K,\nhowever, short-tsrm drift rates can be as high as 1700 microstrain for the\nfirst hour. Therefore, static strain measurements in this temperature range\nshould be avoided and care must be taken in making drift corrections, especially when drift rate is expressed as a small hourly rate based on some\nlong-term test.\nThe results of these tests indicate that to use these gauges at high\ntemperatures irr measuring static strain to a reasonable accuracy level, cer-\n\ntain precautions are required. Gauge temperature must be known to allow compensation for gauge factor and apparent strain; also, gauges must be calibrated\nat known cooling rates to establish repeatable apparent strain. A hightemperature soak for at least 1 hr appears necessary to assure the apparent\nstrain reaches the same value "starting point" for each cycle. The actual\nstrain measurement should then be made at the same cooling rate if possible.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.\n\nWu, Tsen-tai et al., "Development of Temperature-compensated Resistance\nStrain Gauges for Use to 700 \xc2\xb0C," Fourth International Congress on\nExperimental Mechanics, Boston, MA, May 25-30, 1980.\n\n2.\n\nStetson, K.
