Kennedy Space Center, FL 32889\nsteven.trigwell-1@nasa.gov\n\nABSTRACT\nLaunch structures, hardware, and ground support equipment, at NASA's John F. Kennedy Space\nCenter in Florida, are exposed to a highly corrosive natural coastal marine environment. In addition,\nduring launches, rocket exhaust deposition is also highly corrosive. Superhydrophobic coatings are\nbeing considered for additional corrosion protection on existing structures to enhance corrosion\nresistance and add an additional layer of protection against harsh environmental elements. These\ncoatings have come into their own recently, and are now being investigated as corrosion protective\ncoatings due to their water repelling capability. These coatings can be used on existing coatings, newly\ncoated materials, or used on bare substrates. The coatings are not suitable for permanent corrosion\nprotection, but can be used where additional corrosion control is desired or only when temporary\ncorrosion control is needed, such as in hardware sitting on a launch pad for 30-45 days prior to a\nlaunch. In this study, superhydrophobic coatings were applied on various coated and uncoated\nsubstrates and exposed to the spaceport environment for various times up to 60 days. This paper\nhighlights the current results of the superhydrophobic coatings performance evaluated by X-ray\nphotoelectron spectroscopy, and contact angle measurements.\nKey Words: superhydrophobic coatings, corrosion protection, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, contact\nangle\nINTRODUCTION\nThe work presented on this paper was performed as part of a project to identify, test, and develop\nqualification criteria for the use of environmentally friendly corrosion protective coatings and corrosion\npreventive compounds (CPCs) for flight hardware and ground support equipment at NASA's John F.\nKennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida. Typically, when a bare metal surface could or should not be\ncoated with a permanent coating (barrier or sacrificial coating), a temporary coating, CPC, is used to\nprotect the exposed surface from corrosion. CPCs commonly contain corrosion inhibitors dispersed in a\nmixture of solvents and a base oil or grease. The base oil acts as a carrier fluid for the inhibitors and\nalso as a protective barrier to environmental elements. The solvent acts as a base oil and inhibitor\ndispersant and is intended to evaporate after application. CPCs can be soft or hard films, and can be\nprimarily composed of a petroleum, hydrocarbon, or fluoropolymer material depending on their end use\nrequirements.\nSignificant research has previously been performed in identifying and testing numerous CPC coatings\nover several years at KSC. Recent advances in the development of superhydrophobic (SHP) coatings\ncoatings have made them suitable to be considered as corrosion protection coatings (1-5). SHP coatings\nare based on the naturally observed \xe2\x80\x9clotus leaf\xe2\x80\x9d effect, called such by the observation that water\ndroplets ball up and are easily displaced from the surface of lotus leaves. Examination of the leaf\nsurfaces revealed that they are coated in nanometer sized fine hairs that prevent the water droplets\nfrom spreading and wetting the surface. Recent developments in nanotechnology, have prompted\n\nattempts to mimic this effect by creating surfaces with similar topographies utilizing nanoparticles in\nsurface films. This has led to a plethora of research activities with new commercial SHP coating\nproducts starting to hit the market.\nThe first step of this study was to coat various common substrates with commercially available SHP\ncoatings to test their performance by standard beachside atmospheric exposure testing. A literature\nsearch revealed that there are several commercially available SHP coatings. Three were chosen for the\ninitial phase of the study (Table 1). During this first part of the study, the effects of beachside\natmospheric exposure on the superhydrophobicity, and therefore water repelling capability of the\ncoatings, were analyzed by contact angle measurements. The changes in surface chemistry were\nanalyzed by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS).\nSHP coatings are characterized by a contact angle of greater than 151\xc2\xba on a water droplet on a\nsubstrate. Monitoring the contact angle as a function of atmospheric exposure time gives valuable\ninformation regarding the robustness and long-term corrosion protection effectiveness of the coatings.\nFor ideal corrosion protection, an SHP surface will repel water and not let the surface get wet.\nHowever, if the contact angle falls below 90\xc2\xba, the water will wet the surface. It is also important that the\nsurface of the coating stays intact. Changes in the substrate composition with exposure will indicate\nbreakdown of the SHP.\nTable 1.

The first three specimens were standard\nmetals used in the aerospace industry: carbon steel (CS), stainless steel (SS), and aluminum (Al). The\nnext two are stainless steel coupons physical vapor deposition (PVD) coated with 1000\xc3\x85 pure silver\nand copper, respectively. These specimens were used to determine the effects of highly thermal\nconductive and reflective metal layers on the SHP coatings. Table 2 contains a listing of the types of\nsubstrates that were used for testing.\n\nTable 2.

These coatings were chosen primarily for the ease\nof availability. Coating 1 is a single part liquid that claims to dry transparent. Coating 2 is a 2-part spray,\nbut is only available for industrial use. Coating 2 is a readily commercially available 2-part spray\nproduct. Coatings 2 and 3 cure to form a \xe2\x80\x9cmilky\xe2\x80\x9d opaque coating.\nTable 3.

The coating application was performed in\na lab hood, due to the fumes from the solvent base, and allowed to cure for 1 hour. Coating 2 came as\na base coat and a top coat. In this case, the liquids were more viscous and it was determined that spin\ncoating produced the most even coatings. After the application of the base coat, the specimens were\nallowed to cure in a lab hood for 1 hour prior to applying the top coat. Coating 3 came in 2 spray cans:\na base coat and a top coat. The coatings were spray applied also in a lab hood and allowed to fully\ncure for 2 hours.\nSpecimen coupons of control (uncoated, as-prepared coupons), and the coated coupons were placed\nout at the Beachside Atmospheric Exposure Test Site. The coupons were mounted in racks as shown\nin Figure 1. Specimens of each were retrieved after 3, 7, 14, 30, and 60 days of exposure for analysis.\n\nOptical micrographs were taken of each coupon before coating, as-coated, and after each exposure\nperiod.\n\nFigure 1: Coupons mounted on a rack at the Beachside Atmospheric Exposure Test Site\nXPS Analysis\nThe XPS analysis was performed on a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha system. The system uses a Al K\xce\xb1 xray source utilizing a 1436.6 eV x-ray beam in a 400 \xc2\xb5m spot size. The base pressure for each analysis\nwas better than 5 x 10-9 mbar. The system was calibrated as per ASTM E2108, Practice for Calibration\nof the Electron Binding-Energy Scale of an X-Ray Photoelectron Spectrometer (6). Spectra were taken\non three points on each sample and the mean elemental composition taken. Quantification was\nperformed by measuring the area under each elemental peak identified and normalized by using\nsensitivity factors. The sensitivity factors are based on the ionization potential for each element and are\nunique to the instrument. The data is presented as relative atomic percent. XPS is a very sensitive\nsurface analysis technique, as the escape depth of the escaping photoelectrons is in the order of 50100\xc3\x85.\nContact Angle Measurements\nASTM D7334, Standard Practice for Surface Wettability of Coatings, Substrates and Pigments by\nAdvancing Contact Angle Measurement (7), was used to measure the wettability of the SHP coatings on\nthe specimen surface in ambient conditions. A droplet of deionized (DI) water was placed, via a 100 \xc2\xb5l\nsyringe and needle, onto the specimen surface and the corresponding angle of the droplet was\nmeasured immediately. The contact angle instrument used was an AST Products Optima XE, utilizing a\nprecision motor controlled attachment for the syringes allowing precise accurate deposition of known\namounts of fluid. For this study, 3 \xc2\xb5l in volume of DI water was deposited onto the specimen surface.\nDue to the spreading of the hydrophilic fluids, any larger droplet size would have spread out of the\nvisual angle of the camera. The method of deposition was to allow the droplet to form on the end of the\nsyringe, and raise the platform containing the coupon to meet the droplet. The platform was lowered\n\nAs received\n\nControl Day\n60\n\nCoating 1\nDay 60\n\nCoating 2\nDay 60\n\nCoating 3\nDay 60\n\nAl\n\nSS\n\nCS\n\nCu\n\nAg\n\nFigure 2: Optical micrographs of the metal coupons exposed at the Beachside Atmospheric\nExposure Test Site for 60 days.\nwith the deposited droplet. The image of the droplet was captured within 3 seconds of the droplet\ndeposition.\nPrior to the actual analysis on the coupons, the system was calibrated using DI water on cleaned\npolytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). Ten drops were deposited and the mean contact angle was measured\nat 94\xc2\xba. This is consistent with values obtained from the literature for PTFE in the laboratory ambient\nconditions. Ten droplets of DI water in total were deposited for SHP coated coupons and the mean was\ntaken.\nRESULTS\nOptical micrographs of the control and coated coupons, as\xe2\x80\x93received and after exposure for 60 days at\nthe Beachside Atmospheric Exposure Test Site, are shown in Figure 2. Only the final exposure pictures\nare shown for brevity.\n\nAll the Control samples showed considerable corrosion after 60 days with no evidence of the Cu and\nAg coatings. The CS sample showed the most severe corrosion as expected. Coating 1 did not fare\nmuch better. The optical images (not included) showed corrosion after only the 3rd and 6th day\nexposure. Coating 2 fared a lot better, with only the CS sample showing signs of severe corrosion after\n60 days. Coating 3 performed the best of the three coatings. Corrosion was only observed around the\nedges of the Al and CS samples. This was probably due to edge effects because the coupons were not\ncoated on the backside. The Ag coupon showed some minor corrosion spots, but on the Cu and SS\ncoupons, the coating still appeared intact.\nContact Angle Measurements Results\nExample images for the contact angle measurements are shown in Figure 3.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n74\xc2\xba\n\n(c)\n44\xc2\xba\n\n152\xc2\xba\n\nFigure 3: Contact angle for (a) bare metal surface, (b) SHP coated surface, and (c) surface\ncoated with coating 1 after 60 days exposure.\n\nThe contact angle results for the metal control and coated specimens as a function of exposure time\nare shown in Figures 4 to 7.\n160\nAl Control\nSS Control\nCS Control\nAg Control\nCu Control\n\n140\n\nContact Angle [\xcb\x9a]\n\n120\n100\n\n80\n60\n40\n20\n\n0\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\nExposure Time [Days]\n\nFigure 4: Contact angle as a function of atmospheric exposure time for the control (uncoated)\ncoupons.\n\n160\nAl Coating 1\n\n140\nSS Coating 1\n\n120\n\nContact Angle [\xcb\x9a]\n\nCS Coating 1\n\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\nExposure Time [Days]\nFigure 5: Contact angle as a function of atmospheric exposure time for the coated (Coating 1)\ncoupons.\n\nThe Control coupons showed contact angles on the as-received surfaces in the order of 90\xc2\xba (Figure 4)\nwhich is considered neither hydrophilic or hydrophobic. This is typical of metal surfaces exposed to\nambient conditions where they are coated with a natural oxide layer. The CS sample was the first to\nshow a significant drop, with complete wetting of the surface after only 3 days exposure.\n\nFigure 6: Contact angle as a function of exposure time for the coated (Coating 2) coupons.\n\nFigure 7: Contact angle as a function of exposure time for the coated (coating 3) coupons.\n\nThis was followed by the Al samples after 14 days exposure. The SS, Ag and Cu coated samples\nshowed a steady drop in the contact angle to approximately 20\xc2\xba - 40\xc2\xba after the 60 days. This is\nindicative of a hydrophilic surface.\nCoating 1 (Figure 5) performed marginally better. Although all samples showed a superhydrophobic\ncontact angle of approximately 150\xc2\xba -155\xc2\xba after coating, the CS sample showed complete wetting after\n14 days. There was also an initial significant drop of the contact angle for the Al and Cu coated\nsamples at 14 days, but they stabilized after that showing a slight improvement over the control\nsamples to 40\xc2\xba \xe2\x80\x93 45\xc2\xba after the 60 days. Coating 1 showed the best results on the SS coupon. However,\nafter 60 days, the contact angle was measured at 60\xc2\xba which makes it hydrophilic.\nCoating 2 (Figure 6), showed significant improvement with the contact angles dropping from an initial\nvalue of approximately 150\xc2\xba - 155\xc2\xba to a lowest of 90\xc2\xba for the SS and Cu coatings. Interestingly, the CS\nsample showed the highest contact angle of 130\xc2\xba after 60 days, even though, visually it showed signs\nof corrosion.\nCoating 3 proved to be the best performer, with only a slight drop in the contact angle for all samples\nafter 60 days to about 145\xc2\xba - 150\xc2\xba. Although this in no longer considered superhydrophobic, for the\napplication of a temporary coating for that time period, it showed significant potential.\n\nXPS Analysis Results\nTypical XPS spectra of an SHP as-coated surface and the SHP coated carbon steel after 30 days\nexposure are shown in Figure 8.

XPS spectra of anSHP coated specimen and SHP coated carbon steel after 30 days\nbeachside atmospheric exposure where the Fe from the substrate in now clearly detected.\nXPS analysis was performed on the as-coated samples to get a control composition of the coated\nsurfaces. In each case, the metal surface composition underneath the coating was not detected. XPS\nanalysis was performed on each coupon as it came back from the Beachside Atmospheric Exposure\nTest Site. In all tests, three points were analyzed on each sample. The survey scans of the surface in\nall cases after the various periods of exposure showed minor amounts of sodium (Na), chlorine (Cl),\nmagnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), nitrogen (N), and sulfur (S). This is expected of surfaces exposed in the\nbeachside environment. The combination of ionic contaminants and coastal marine environment is the\nleading cause of such high corrosion rates. For this study, the time period in which the metal substrate\nunderneath the superhydrophobic coating was detected in the surface scan was recorded and taken as\nthe point at which the surface coating was considered to have arbitrarily broken down. For the SS and\nCS samples, the predominant element scanned to detect the substrate was Fe. A summary of the XPS\ndata for each specimen is shown in Figure 9.\n60\n55\n50\n45\n\nExposure [Days]\n\n40\n35\nCoating 1\n\n30\n\nCoating 2\n\n25\n\nCoating 3\n\n20\n15\n\n10\n5\n0\n\nAl\n\nSS\n\nCS\n\nCu\n\nAg\n\nFigure 9. Detection of the substrate metal as a function of atmospheric exposure time for all\nthree superhydrophobic coatings.\n\nFrom Figure 9, it can be seen that for coating 1, the CS sample showed the worst performance with Fe\nfrom the subsrate detected after only 3 days exposure. The contact angle at this point was\napproximately 140\xc2\xba, but after 14 days the surface was completely wetted, and the XPS showed that the\ncoating had completely dissappeared. The Ag and Cu samples did not fare much better, with the Ag\nand Cu substrates detected after 3 and 7 days, respectively. The Al sample lasted 14 days, and the SS\nperformed the best at 30 days.\nCoating 2 performed a lot better, with only the CS sample showing Fe after 30 days. The other samples\ndid not show evidence of the substrate through the coating after 60 days.\nNo substrate elements were detected on all samples for coating 3. Although corrosion was observed\naround the edges of the Al and CS samples after 60 days, it was not detected in the areas analyzed at\nthe center of the coupon. The Ag coupon showed some small discoloration spots aftre 60 days, but no\nAg was detected.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAs expected, the data collected on the control specimens showed severe corrosion on unprotected\nmetals, with the carbon steel showing the worst effect. The stainless steel specimen fared better, but it\nis interesting to note that by the contact angle measurements, the Ag and Cu coated stainless steel\nspecimens actually fared slightly worse as shown by a drop in the contact angle indicating that they\nbecame more hydrophilic. This may have to do with the different oxidation kinetics of the Ag and Cu\ncoating compared to the 304 stainless steel that typically forms a chromium (Cr) enriched passive layer.\nThe coating 1 specimens fared better than the control, but the coating failed as a corrosion protection\ncoating. Significant corrosion was detected after a few days, with most specimens severely corroded\nafter 60 days. This cannot be considered a candidate as a long term corrosion protection coating. This\nwas the only coating that was transparent and was applied with a single application. Coating 2\nperformed well, but was only good up to 30 days of exposure on carbon steel, compared to coating 3\nthat lasted all 60 days with minimal degradation and therefore shows excellent potential for additional\ncorrosion protection on spaceport structures.\nFuture Work\nMetal panels have been coated with several selected good performing CPCs, and additionally coated\nwith the two better performing superhydrophobic coatings, 1 and 2. These panels are currently\nundergoing exposure testing at the Beachside Atmospheric Exposure Test Site. Future work will\ninclude uncoated and superhydrophobic coated scribed panels to compare corrosion protection\nperformance.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis project was funded by NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Ground Systems Development and Operations (GSDO) Program.\nThis is one of three NASA programs based at the agency\xe2\x80\x99s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
