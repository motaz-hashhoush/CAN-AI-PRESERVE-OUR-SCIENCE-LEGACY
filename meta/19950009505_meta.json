There are particular difficulties in acquiring Asian materials, in cataloguing them and providing access, and in incorporating them in library systems. There is, however, an urgent and growing need for access to Asian materials. Part of the response of the Australian library community to the difficulties and to the increasing need has been the Australian National CJK (Chinese, Japanese and Korean) Project. The CJK Project is a co-operative project involving seven Australian universities and the National Library of Australia. Membership is expected to grow to include other Australian research libraries, some public research libraries and some overseas libraries.", "title": "The Austrialian National Chinese Japanese Korean Project", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T23:10:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19950009505, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Groom, Linda"}, "organization": {"name": "National Library of Australia", "location": "Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia"}}, "id": "421888dba98f47479a1294aba373ce7d"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19950009505, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19950009505, "id": "eb9d39028d1743b889c5ebc0c941f72d", "publicationName": "NASA, Washington, Fourth Annual International Acquisitions Workshop: Access to Multiple Media Worldwide", "publicationDate": "1994-09-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19950009412, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "The Diffuse Interstellar Bands: Contributed papers", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19950009505.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19950009505/downloads/19950009505.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19950009505/downloads/19950009505.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19950009505/downloads/19950009505.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
