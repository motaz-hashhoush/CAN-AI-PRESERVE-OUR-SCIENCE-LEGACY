The collision between Cosmos 2251 and the operational Iridium 33 in 2009 signaled a\npotential collision cascade effect, also known as the \xe2\x80\x9cKessler Syndrome\xe2\x80\x9d, in the environment. Various\nmodelling studies have suggested that the commonly-adopted mitigation measures will not be\nsufficient to stabilize the future debris population. Active debris removal must be considered to\nremediate the environment. This paper summarizes the key issues associated with debris removal and\ndescribes the technology and engineering challenges to move forward.\n\n1. Introduction\nFifty-four years after the launch of Sputnik 1, satellites have become an integral part of human society.\nUnfortunately, the ongoing space activities have left behind an undesirable byproduct \xe2\x80\x93 orbital debris. This\nenvironment problem is threatening the current and future space activities. On average, two Shuttle window panels\nare replaced after every mission due to damage by micrometeoroid or orbital debris impacts. More than 100 collision\navoidance maneuvers were conducted by satellite operators in 2010 to reduce the impact risks of their satellites with\nrespect to objects in the U.S. Space Surveillance Network (SSN) catalog. Of the four known accident collisions\nbetween objects in the SSN catalog, the last one, collision between Cosmos 2251 and the operational Iridium 33 in\n2009, was the most significant. It was the first ever accidental catastrophic destruction of an operational satellite by\nanother satellite. It also signaled the potential collision cascade effect in the environment, commonly known as the\n\xe2\x80\x9cKessler Syndrome,\xe2\x80\x9d predicted by Kessler and Cour-Palais in 1978 [1].\nFigure 1 shows the historical increase of objects in the SSN catalog. The majority of the catalog objects are 10 cm\nand larger. As of April 2011, the total objects tracked by the SSN sensors were more than 22,000. However,\napproximately 6000 of them had yet to be fully processed and entered into the catalog. This population had been\ndominated by fragmentation debris throughout history. Before the anti-satellite test (ASAT) conducted by China in\n2007, the fragmentation debris were almost all explosion fragments. After the ASAT test and the collision between\nIridium 33 and Cosmos 2251, the ratio of collision fragments to explosion fragments was about one-to-one. It is\nexpected that accidental collision fragments will further dominate the environment in the future.\n\nFigure 1: Increase of the historical SSN catalog population through April 2011.\n\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 2011 by J.-C.

Additional radar data indicate that at the 1 cm level the total is\napproximately 500,000. At the 1 mm level, the population is estimated to be on the order of hundreds of millions.\nDue to the high impact speed in space, objects as small as 0.2 mm pose certain safety concerns to satellite operators.\nThe well-shielded U.S. modules of the International Space Station (ISS) are protected against debris smaller than 1.4\ncm. For a typical operational spacecraft, however, a hypervelocity impact by debris 5 mm and larger is likely to lead\nto mission-ending damage. Figure 2 depicts the historical increase of the mass of objects in orbit. Unlike the curves\nin Figure 1, which are heavily influenced by major breakups, the mass increase is relatively steady over time and\nshows no sign of slowing down. The total mass is dominated by rocket bodies (R/Bs) and spacecraft (S/Cs). They\ncombine for approximately 96% of the mass in orbit. Although more than half of the catalog objects are\nfragmentation debris, they only account for less than 3% of the total mass in space.\nMonthly Mass of Objects in Earth Orbit by Object Type\n6.5\n6.0\n5.5\n\nMass in Orbit (millions of kg)\n\n5.0\nTotal\n\n4.5\n4.0\n3.5\n\nSpacecraft\n\n3.0\n2.5\n2.0\n\nRocket Bodies\n\n1.5\nMission-related Debris\n\n1.0\n0.5\n\nFragmentation Debris\n\n2012\n\n2010\n\n2008\n\n2006\n\n2004\n\n2002\n\n2000\n\n1998\n\n1996\n\n1994\n\n1992\n\n1990\n\n1988\n\n1986\n\n1984\n\n1982\n\n1980\n\n1978\n\n1976\n\n1974\n\n1972\n\n1970\n\n1968\n\n1966\n\n1964\n\n1962\n\n1960\n\n1958\n\n1956\n\n0.0\n\nYear\n\nFigure 2: Historical mass increase of objects in Earth orbit. Variations due to Shuttle missions are not included.\nThe current total mass of materials orbiting the Earth is close to 6300 tons, and 43% of it (2700 tons) is in the low\nEarth orbit (LEO) region. The distribution is not uniform (Figure 3). The three major peaks are located near 600,\n800, and 1000 km, respectively. Spacecraft and rocket bodies account for 97% of the mass in LEO. The 600 km peak\nis dominated by spacecraft while the other two peaks are dominated by rocket bodies. Source breakdown of the LEO\nmass is shown in the right panel of Figure 3. Nearly 86% of the mass is in vehicles belonging to the Commonwealth\nof Independent States (CIS) and the Unites States.\nMass\xc2\xa0Distribution\xc2\xa0in\xc2\xa0LEO\n\n350\n\nChina,\xc2\xa0\n4.2%\n\nMass (metric ton) per 50 km Altitude Bin\n\n300\nAll\nRocket\xc2\xa0Bodies\xc2\xa0(46%\xc2\xa0of\xc2\xa0All)\n250\n\nothers,\xc2\xa0\n10.0%\n\nSpacecraft\xc2\xa0(51%\xc2\xa0of\xc2\xa0All)\nOthers\n\n200\n\nUSA,\xc2\xa0\n23.4%\n\n150\n\nCIS,\xc2\xa0\n62.4%\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n1200\n\nAltitude (km)\n\n1400\n\n1600\n\n1800\n\n2000\n\nLEO only\n\nFigure 3: Left \xe2\x80\x93 Mass distribution in LEO (the region below 2000 km altitude).

It is a summary of a recent study based\non the LEGEND model developed by the NASA Orbital Debris Program Office. The study assumed nominal\nlaunches in the future, but no mitigation measures were implemented. In essence, the \xe2\x80\x9cno mitigation\xe2\x80\x9d assumption\nrepresents the worst-case scenario, but the results can be used to bound the future debris population projection. The\nenvironment is divided into three zones. The geosynchronous (GEO) region is 200 km within the geosynchronous\naltitude. The region between LEO and GEO is defined as medium Earth orbit (MEO). Each projection curve is the\naverage of 100 LEGEND Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. The 1-\xcf\x83 standard deviation for each curve is also included\nin the figure.\n\n2\n\nFirst Author, Second Author.

The\nsimulations assumed nominal launches, but no mitigation measures were implemented in the future.\nThe rapid increase of the debris population in LEO is a well-known trend [1]. It was the motivation for the\ndevelopment of the mitigation measures, such as passivation and the 25-year rule, by the international community in\nthe last two decades. However, recent analyses have shown that the commonly-adopted mitigation measures will not\nbe sufficient to stabilize the environment [2, 3]. Therefore, to better limit the growth of the debris population in LEO,\nactive debris removal (ADR) must be considered [4]. (The definition of ADR is to remove debris beyond the\nmitigation guidelines currently adopted by the international space community.)\nThe projected population growths in MEO and GEO over the next 200 years are not as severe as that in LEO. Even\nunder the worst-case, non-mitigation assumption, the increase is very moderate. When postmission disposal (PMD)\noptions are implemented, such as maneuvering satellites at the end of life to the graveyard orbit region, the increase\nwill be further reduced. Since there is no atmospheric drag to clean up the environment in MEO and GEO, the longterm build up of debris will continue. However, there is no urgent need to consider ADR in MEO and GEO in the\nnear future.\n\n2. Active debris removal\nRemoving debris from orbit is far more complicated than launching satellites. Several key questions must be\naddressed at the beginning of any ADR planning. They include (1) where is the most critical region for ADR, (2)\nwhat are the short- and long-term mission objectives, (3) what debris should be removed first, (4) what are the\nbenefits to the environment, and finally, (5) how to carry out the operations. The answers to these questions will\ndefine the top-level requirements, drive the necessary technology development, and guide the implementation of the\nADR operations. In addition, non-technical issues, such as policy, coordination, ownership, legal, and liability, at the\nnational and international levels will also influence the direction of ADR planning and implementation.\nBased on the projection curves shown in Figure 4, it is obvious that any environment remediation in the foreseeable\nfuture should focus on ADR operations in LEO. Mission objectives will set the measures for success. Common\nmission objectives, such as maximizing the benefit-to-cost ratio and following practical mission constraints (in\naltitude, inclination, class, size, etc.) are always applicable to any ADR concepts. Specific mission objectives, on the\nother hand, are very diverse and will lead to very different forward paths. These objectives include, for example,\ncontrolling the LEO population growth (for small and large debris), limiting collision activities, mitigating short- or\nlong-term risks (damage, not necessarily catastrophic destruction) for selected payloads, or mitigating risks for\nhuman space activities. Once a specific mission objective is selected, it needs to be further quantified (e.g., limiting\nthe population growth or reducing mission-end threat to a pre-set level) to better define the mission requirements.\nWhat debris objects should be removed first depends on the specific mission objective. The cumulative size\ndistribution, plotted at the half-decade points, of the LEO-crossing objects in 2011 is shown in Figure 5. The\npopulations at 10 cm and larger come from the SSN catalog. The populations at 5 mm, 1 cm, and 5 cm are estimated\nfrom the Goldstone, Haystack, and HAX radar data [5]. The populations below 10 cm roughly follow a power-law\nsize distribution \xe2\x80\x93 meaning there are far more smaller debris than larger ones. This means the main mission-ending\nthreat for operational S/Cs in the environment comes from debris just above the threshold of the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s impact\nprotection shields. Since S/Cs all have different configurations and shielding designs, the \xe2\x80\x9ccritical debris size\xe2\x80\x9d varies\n\n3\n\nSESSION NUMBER & NAME\n\nfrom S/C to S/C. For most operational S/Cs, any impact by debris between 5 mm and 1 cm is likely to cause missionend damage. The chances of similar damage diminish if the S/C is impacted by smaller debris.\n\n5 mm\n\n1 cm\n\nMain threat to\noperational S/Cs\n\nMain driver for\npopulation growth\n\n5 cm\n10 cm\n50 cm\n\n1m\n\nFigure 5: Cumulative size distribution, between 5 mm and 1 m, of the LEO-crossing objects in 2011.\nBased on the size distribution of Figure 5, debris in the 5-mm-to-1-cm regime represent about 80% of all objects\nlarger than 5 mm. Therefore, if the goal is to reduce the mission-ending threat for most operational S/Cs, then the\nADR operations should focus on the 5-mm-to-1-cm objects. If the mission objective is to limit the growth of the\ndebris population or to reduce the catastrophic collision activities in the environment, then the ADR operations\nshould focus on the root cause of the problem \xe2\x80\x93 the massive and large (at least several meters in dimension) R/Bs and\nS/Cs). Additional analyses of these two different objectives and the associated challenges are described below.\n\n2.1 Targeting the main threat for operational spacecraft\nThe main challenges for removing 5-mm-to-1-cm debris from LEO are related to the dynamic nature of the small\ndebris and the huge number of their presence in the environment. The former is illustrated in Figure 6, where the\nsimulated evolution of the 5-mm-to-1-cm Cosmos 2251 fragments between 2009 and 2019 is shown. The initial\nfragments were generated via the NASA Standard Breakup Model [6]. Individual fragments were then propagated\nforward in time, including Earth's J2, J3, J4, solar-lunar gravitational perturbations, solar radiation pressure, and\natmospheric drag. NOAA\xe2\x80\x99s solar flux F10.7 projection was combined with the Jacchia 1977 atmospheric model for\nthe drag calculation [7]. Small debris tend to have high area-to-mass ratios (A/Ms). For those with perigees below\nabout 1000 km altitude, they are subject to strong atmospheric drag perturbation. What the curves in Figure 6 show is\nthat, at any given altitude below 1000 km, the 5-mm-to-1-cm debris rapidly decay toward lower altitudes. At the\nsame time, the region is rapidly replenished by debris spiraling down from higher altitudes on a yearly basis. The\nenvironment is highly dynamic, and could have strong short-term (i.e., monthly to yearly) episodic variations.\nEvolution\xc2\xa0of\xc2\xa0Cosmos\xc2\xa02251\xc2\xa0Fragments\xc2\xa0(5\xc2\xa0mm\xc2\xa0to\xc2\xa01\xc2\xa0cm)\n50,000\n\n2009\xc2\xa0(~163,000)\n\n40,000\n\nNumber\xc2\xa0of\xc2\xa0Objects\xc2\xa0per\xc2\xa050\xc2\xa0km\xc2\xa0Bin\n\n45,000\n\n2011\xc2\xa0(~100,000)\n2013\xc2\xa0(~87,000)\n\n35,000\n\n2015\xc2\xa0(~67,000)\n30,000\n\n2017\xc2\xa0(~59,000)\n\n25,000\n\n2019\xc2\xa0(~43,000)\n\n20,000\n15,000\n10,000\n5,000\n0\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\n900\n\n1000\n\n1100\n\n1200\n\nAltitude\xc2\xa0(km)\n\nFigure 6: Altitude distributions of the simulated 5-mm-to-1-cm Cosmos 2251 fragments between 2009 and 2019.\nNumbers in the parentheses indicate the total number of objects still in orbit.\n\n4\n\nFirst Author, Second Author. INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE PREPARATION OF PAPERS\n\nThe ISS example provided below outlines the analyses needed and the technical challenges for removing small\ndebris to reduce the threat for a critical operational spacecraft. The ISS is constructed with the best micrometeoroid\nand orbital debris impact protection in history. The U.S. modules of the ISS are equipped with bumper shields that\ncould withstand hypervelocity impacts by orbital debris 1.4 cm or smaller [8]. The U.S. Joint Space Operations\nCenter (JSpOC) conducts conjunction assessments for all operational spacecraft, with respect to objects in the SSN\ncatalog, and provides the information to the operators/owners of the vehicles involved. The decision for any collision\navoidance maneuvers is left to the operators/owners of the vehicles. For ISS, it has conducted 12 collision avoidance\nmaneuvers against the catalog objects since 1999. Therefore, the main threat to the ISS comes from objects between\n1.5 and 10 cm. In 2010, the number of objects in this size range, and with orbits crossing the altitude of the ISS (330\nto 360 km), was approximately 1200. Since these objects follow a power-law size distribution (see also Figure 5),\nabout 800 of them are between 1.5 and 3 cm. If the ADR objective is to reduce the threat to the ISS by removing, for\nexample, 50% of the debris in this size range, then trade studies must be conducted to investigate various options for\nremoval.\nLarge-area debris collectors made of different materials and designed with different configurations have been\nproposed for small debris removal. The technology readiness levels (TRLs) for the commonly-mentioned capture\nmechanisms (e.g., using low density materials) are relatively mature. The key difficulty for the collector, however, is\nin the large area-time product that will be needed to remove any meaningful amount of small debris. Based on the\nestimated 1.5-to-3-cm debris flux at the ISS altitude in 2010, it will require a collector with an area-time product on\nthe order of 1000 km2\xc2\xb7yr to remove 400 debris in this size range. For a one-year operation at the ISS altitude, the\nconcept of a 1000 km2 cross-sectional area collector is simply not practical. In addition, as illustrated in Figure 6, the\nnear ISS environment will continue to be replenished by debris decaying from higher altitudes. Any ADR operations\nof small debris, even if they are technically feasible and economically viable, will have to be carried out continuously\nfor as long as the ISS remains active. To remove 5-mm-to-1-cm debris at higher altitudes to better protect the\nmajority of the operational S/Cs will be even more challenging because the demand for the area-time product will be\nsignificantly higher.\nA ground- or space-based laser system is another concept being proposed for the removal of mm-to-cm-sized debris.\nThe unique technical challenges for this approach are the power required for the system, tracking capability for small\ndebris, and the pointing accuracy of the laser system. Because of the concern for space weapons, this concept faces\nmore non-technical issues than others.\n\n2.2 Targeting the root cause of the debris population growth\nThe future debris population growth will be driven by fragments generated from accidental collisions involving large\nand massive R/Bs or S/Cs [9]. Therefore, the most effective way to limit the population growth is to remove the\nmajor \xe2\x80\x9cdebris generators\xe2\x80\x9d for such events. Major \xe2\x80\x9cdebris generators\xe2\x80\x9d are those that have the highest collision\nprobabilities with other objects in the environment, and when they do collide with other objects, they have the\npotential of generating the greatest amount of fragments. The latter is a function of mass. Hence, the mass, M, and\ncollision probability, Pc, of each object can be used as a selection criterion for removal [9,10]. Numerical simulations\nhave shown that, indeed, [M \xc3\x97 Pc] is an effective target selection criterion for environment remediation in LEO [4,\n10-12]. Figure 7 shows what will be needed to stabilize the LEO population with ADR based on the mass and\ncollision probability criterion [13]. The historical environment, shown as the gray curve, included fragments from\nthe ASAT test and the collision between Iridium 33 and Cosmos 2251. Each projection curve is the average of 100\nLEGEND MC simulations. The scenario for the top curve assumed nominal launches and a 90% compliance of PMD\nfor all R/Bs and S/Cs. The middle curve shows that if an ADR of two objects per year was implemented after the\nyear 2020 (denoted as ADR2020/02 in the figure), the population growth could be reduced approximately by half. If\nthe ADR was increased to five objects per year (bottom curve), the population could be maintained at a level similar\nto the current environment. It will require an even higher annual ADR rate if the objective is to reduce the future\nLEO population to a lower level.\nThe simulation results shown in Figure 7 are intended to serve as a guide to illustrate the effectiveness of using [M \xc3\x97\nPc] as a target selection criterion, to quantify how many objects need to be removed, and to show the benefits to the\nenvironment by targeting the root cause of the population growth. The conclusion that \xe2\x80\x9cremoving five objects per\nyear can stabilize the LEO environment\xe2\x80\x9d is somewhat notional. A key assumption in the simulations is the nominal\nlaunches during the projection period. It is a common practice to repeat launches from the last 8 years for future\nenvironment simulations. If future launches are very different from the repeated cycle, including launch frequency,\nmission orbits, and vehicle masses, then the required ADR rate will be somewhat different. Another assumption in\nthe simulations is the immediate removal of objects from the environment. If that is not the case, then the required\n\n5\n\nSESSION NUMBER & NAME\n\nADR rate will be higher. Other factors, such as the compliance of the mitigation measures, the long-term solar\nactivity projection, and practical operational constraints, will also affect the number of ADR objects needed to\nstabilize the environment.\nLEO\xc2\xa0Environment\xc2\xa0Projection\xc2\xa0(averages\xc2\xa0of\xc2\xa0100\xc2\xa0LEGEND\xc2\xa0MC\xc2\xa0runs)\n24000\n\nReg\xc2\xa0Launches\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa090%\xc2\xa0PMD\n\n20000\n\nEffective\xc2\xa0Number\xc2\xa0of\xc2\xa0Objects\xc2\xa0(>10\xc2\xa0cm)\n\n22000\n\nReg\xc2\xa0Launches\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa090%\xc2\xa0PMD\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa0ADR2020/02\nReg\xc2\xa0Launches\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa090%\xc2\xa0PMD\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa0ADR2020/05\n\n18000\n16000\n14000\n12000\n10000\n8000\n6000\n4000\n2000\n0\n1950\n\n1970\n\n1990\n\n2010\n\n2030\n\n2050\n\n2070\n\n2090\n\n2110\n\n2130\n\n2150\n\n2170\n\n2190\n\n2210\n\nYear\n\nFigure 7: Projected increases of the future LEO populations (objects \xe2\x89\xa510 cm) based on three different scenarios.\nEach projection is the average of 100 LEGEND MC simulations.\nIf the same [M \xc3\x97 Pc] criterion is applied to objects in the current LEO environment, potential targets for future ADR\noperations can be identified. Figure 8 shows their apogee/perigee altitudes and inclinations. It can be seen that many\nof the potential targets fall into several well-defined classes of vehicles between 600 and 1050 km altitudes, and in\nseven narrow inclination bands. These R/Bs and S/Cs have masses between 1 and 9 metric tons, and sizes up to more\nthan 10 meters. The challenges for removing five such objects in a cost-effective manner, on a yearly basis, are\nmonumental.\nTop\xc2\xa0500\xc2\xa0Current\xc2\xa0R/Bs\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0S/Cs\n\n1600\n1500\n\nApogee\n\n1400\n\nPerigee\n\n1300\nSL\xe2\x80\x9016\xc2\xa0R/B\xc2\xa0(8900\xc2\xa0kg)\nCosmos\xc2\xa0(3300\xc2\xa0kg)\n\nAltitude\xc2\xa0(km)\n\n1200\n\nSL\xe2\x80\x908\xc2\xa0R/B\xc2\xa0(1400\xc2\xa0kg)\n\n1100\n1000\n\nSL\xe2\x80\x908\xc2\xa0R/B\xc2\xa0(1400\xc2\xa0kg)\nMETEOR\xc2\xa0 (2000\xc2\xa0kg)\n\n900\nCosmos\xc2\xa0(1300\xc2\xa0kg)\nSL\xe2\x80\x903\xc2\xa0R/B\xc2\xa0(1440\xc2\xa0kg)\nMETEOR\xc2\xa0 (2200\xe2\x80\x902800\xc2\xa0kg)\n\n800\n\nVarious\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0R/Bs\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0S/Cs\n(SL\xe2\x80\x9016\xc2\xa0R/B,\xc2\xa0Envisat,\xc2\xa0 etc.,\n1000\xe2\x80\x908900\xc2\xa0kg)\n\n700\nSL\xe2\x80\x908\xc2\xa0R/B\xc2\xa0(1400\xc2\xa0kg)\nCosmos\xc2\xa0(2000\xc2\xa0kg)\n\n600\n\nCosmos\xc2\xa0(2500\xc2\xa0kg)\n\n500\n60\n\n65\n\n70\n\n75\n\n80\n\n85\n\n90\n\n95\n\n100\n\n105\n\nInclination\xc2\xa0(deg)\n\nFigure 8: Altitude versus inclination distribution of potential ADR targets. Major classes are also labelled.\nAn end-to-end ADR operation includes many components \xe2\x80\x93 launch, propulsion, proximity operations, rendezvous,\ncontact (capture or attachment), and finally, deorbit or graveyard maneuvers. From the cost perspective, multiple\nADR systems per launch or secondary payload design are preferred. Options for propulsion, both for the ADR\nsystem vehicle and for the debris targets, are more diverse. The space tug concept based on solid or liquid propellants\nis a mature technology, but the propellant mass and the operational cost may be too high for a routine operation.\nPlasma propulsion has low TRL, but may turn into a good alternative. The concept of using electrodynamic tethers as\na means of removing large orbital debris was first suggested in the early 1990s [14]. Once the technology is mature\nand demonstrated, it could provide a promising propellant-less option to deorbit ADR targets and to maneuver the\nADR system from target to target. However, the collision risks of a long tether to other vehicles in the environment\nremain an open issue.\n\n6\n\nFirst Author, Second Author. INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE PREPARATION OF PAPERS\n\nAttaching a drag enhancement device, such as an inflatable balloon or a thin-film sail, to a massive debris object is\nanother potential low-cost option to deorbit massive ADR targets. The effectiveness of this concept is illustrated in\nFigure 9. The orbital lifetime of an SL-8 second stage, with a dry mass of 1400 kg and a 950 km altitude, is more\nthan 200 years. The addition of a lightweight and large-area device will increase the total A/M of the system and\ncause it to decay more rapidly over time. For example, a balloon with a diameter of about 30 m can deorbit the\nsecond stage in 25 years. If the size of the balloon is increased to 100 m, then the orbital lifetime of the target can be\nreduced to just 2 years. The dimensions of the balloons, or equivalent thin-film sails, are not that unreasonable.\nHowever, as the system decays toward lower altitudes, its collision risks to other satellites in the environment will\nneed to be evaluated as well.\n\nFigure 9: Effectiveness of deorbiting a typical 1400 kg SL-8 R/B from a 950 km with a drag enhancement device. A\nlightweight balloon (or an equivalent sail) with a diameter of 100 m can force the R/B to decay in just 2 years.\nProximity operations (including guidance, navigation, and control), rendezvous, and contact (capture or attachment)\nof the ADR targets require new technologies as well because the targets are non-cooperative. The major challenge,\nhowever, is in the handling of the potential rapid spin/tumble motion of the targets. Limited data seem to suggest that\nmany of the potential ADR targets have tumble rates above 1 rpm. Ground-based radar or optical observations will\nbe needed to survey the potential ADR targets to better characterize their tumble states and determine how these\nstates might change over time. This is another area where new technologies will be needed to stabilize a target if\nphysical contact with the target is required during the removal operations.\nOnce a target is captured by the ADR system or is attached to a device, there are only two possible outcomes. For\nsome ADR concepts, it is possible to maneuver the target to the graveyard orbit above 2000 km altitude. This option\nreally is not a solution. The cumulative debris mass eventually will create a new environment problem in the\ngraveyard orbit. The best end result for an ADR operation is to bring the target down. However, the reentry risks of\nlarge and massive R/Bs or S/Cs must be evaluated. If it is necessary to include a controlled reentry at the end, it will\nseverely limit the ADR operational options and will increase the overall cost significantly.\n\n3. Conclusions\nThe orbital debris problem is facing a critical point. The commonly-adopted mitigation measures will not be\nsufficient to fully control the debris population growth in LEO. As the international community gradually reaches a\nconsensus on the need for ADR, the focus will shift from environment modeling to completely different challenges \xe2\x80\x93\ntechnology development, systems engineering, and operations. As the community takes on these new challenges, a\nlong-term strategic plan must be established first. Mission objectives must be clearly defined to drive the forward\npath. If the goal is to remediate the environment, then four critical \xe2\x80\x9cCs\xe2\x80\x9d will be needed at the international level. The\nfirst \xe2\x80\x9cC\xe2\x80\x9d stands for the consensus on ADR. The second \xe2\x80\x9cC\xe2\x80\x9d is for cooperation \xe2\x80\x93 the removal target may belong to a\ndifferent country. The third \xe2\x80\x9cC\xe2\x80\x9d is for collaboration \xe2\x80\x93 it is highly unlikely that any single organization or country can\naccomplish the goal by itself. The last \xe2\x80\x9cC\xe2\x80\x9d stands for contributions \xe2\x80\x93 cost-sharing will be the key for using ADR to\npreserve the environment for future generations.\n\n7\n\nSESSION NUMBER & NAME\n\nReferences\n[1] Kessler, D. and B.
