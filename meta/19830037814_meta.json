The facility of an augumented Lagrangian (ALAG) multiplier-based nonlinear programming technique is demonstrated for minimum weight design optimizations of boost and buck-boost power converters. ALAG-based computer simulation results for those two minimum weight designs are discussed. Certain important features of ALAG are presented in the framework of a comprehensive design example for boost and buck-boost power converter design optimization. The study provides refreshing design insight of power converters and presents such information as weight annd loss profiles of various semiconductor components and magnetics as a function of the switching frequency.", "title": "Computer simulations of optimum boost and buck-boost converters", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-11T15:29:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19830037814, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Rahman, S."}, "organization": {"name": "Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University", "location": "Blacksburg, VA, United States"}}, "id": "d911d32283864134b566d8f5910cb0ff"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19830037814, "publications": [{"volume": "AES-18", "submissionId": 19830037814, "id": "723fe915e96f4a7f915498e38d0bc23f", "publicationName": "IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems", "publicationDate": "1982-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
