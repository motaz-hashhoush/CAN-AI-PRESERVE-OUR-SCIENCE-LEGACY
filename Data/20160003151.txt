Such partnerships enable scientists and educators to include members of the audience in program\nplanning and execution. Ultimately, partnerships\nstrengthen programs by providing diverse resources,\nexpertise, and expanding the potential audience.\nBest Practices for Partnerships: Research and\nexperience yield a variety of best practices [1].\nPartnerships take time to build. Each partner\nneeds to learn about the other institution\xe2\x80\x99s experiences,\nresources, and needs. Trust and respect need to be\nearned and demonstrated [2]. This requires an investment of time by members of each organization to build\na solid working relationship. For instance, LPI educators and the science engagement staff at NASA Johnson Space Center Astromaterials Research and Exploration Science (ARES) Division have dedicated significant time to work together over many years.\nPartnerships require ongoing respectful communication. This is not only true for collaborations with\norganizations providing resources and expertise, but\nalso when partnerships are formed to engage new\ncommunities (e.g. with an organization reaching underserved audiences). These partners have insights into\ntheir community\xe2\x80\x99s needs, interests, and experiences.\nThese partnerships, like all true collaborations, require two-way communications; both partners can\nprovide valuable input as programs are planned [3,4].\nFor example, the American Camp Association is instrumental in sharing the needs and experiences of\ncamp professionals for engaging this community.\n\nPartnerships require recognition of strengths, resources, and mission. A successful partnership leverages each organization\xe2\x80\x99s strengths and resources.\nWhile the missions of each organization may vary,\nthey need to be compatible for the partnership to function. For instance, a partnership may flourish between\nan organization focused on serving a particular community (such as libraries), and another primarily\nproviding a particular service (such as space science\neducation) as long as the proposed collaboration meets\nboth organization\xe2\x80\x99s missions.\nPartnering for Workshops: LPI conducts a variety of trainings to provide NASA content and resources to informal and K-12 educators. LPI has partnered with the ARES Science Engagement Staff, multiple state library associations, the Harris County Department of Education, the American Camp Association, and Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics\nLaboratory, among others, to deliver workshops. Partners have helped connect LPI to new audiences, such\nas librarians and camp professionals around the United\nStates and teachers throughout the Houston area.\nWorking with other NASA programs and missions has\nallowed workshop participants to access subject matter\nexperts, laboratories, and resources beyond what LPI\nalone can provide.\n\nImage 2. ARES has arranged for tours of the Lunar Lab or Visiting\nViewing Area for some teacher workshops.\n\nImage 1. Partnerships with libraries enable LPI to engage a more\ndiverse audience.\n\nPartnering for Engagement Events: Bringing in\noutside organizations to public events provides a deeper, more diverse experience for the audience. To serve\nthe public, LPI holds several public events per year\ncalled Sky Fest, featuring activities for children, tele-\n\nscopes for night sky viewing, and a short scientist lecture. LPI partners with the NASA Johnson Space Center Astronomical Society (which provides telescopes\nand interacts with members of the public as they are\nviewing celestial objects) and ARES Science Engagement Staff, who conduct activities and share valuable\nresources such as lunar samples. LPI also conducts\noutreach at local libraries and with other partners;\nthese partnerships serve to expand our audience to\ncommunities that do not have access to LPI facilities.\n\nImage 3. Volunteers with the Pasadena Fire Department have helped\nwith LPI family events conducting the Egg Drop experiment.\n\nPartnering to Improve our Performance: Partners can provide valuable insight into how we conduct\nour programs and ways to improve or make changes\nfor different audiences and changing objectives. LPI\nhas received valuable input from the different communities we serve, as well as from colleagues who also\nconduct NASA science education and public engagement programs. This input has been through collaborating together on workshops and events, through our\nown professional development sessions, and through\nevaluation of our efforts. LPI has benefitted from\nevaluation of our programs by colleagues at the Planetary Science Institute, at Harris County Department of\nEducation, and at McREL, among others.\nConclusion: While partnerships take time and resources, they are a key element to successfully engaging audiences, to improving programs, and to leveraging the variety of resources and expertise that the science education communities offer.\n\nReferences: [1] Mattessich P., Murray-Close M.,\nand Monsey B.
