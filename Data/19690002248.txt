b"39. HOUSE VIBRATIONS SIGNIFICANT FOR\n\nINDOOR SUaJECTrVE RESPONSE\nBy William H. Mayes, Donald S. Findley,\nand Huey D. Carden\nNASA Langley Research Center\nSUMMARY\n\nAn aircraft flyover is observed by a person inside a house in three ways: the\nacoustic transmission through the structure, the vibrations of the structure, and the noise\nradiated by decorative objects in contact with the structure. The average house stxycture provides from about 10 to 25 dB of noise reduction in the frequency range of 30 to\n3000 Hz. The house vibration responses at the lower frequencies are associated with the\nframing members, whereas the vibration responses at the higher frequencies are associated with the window and wall panels. The indoor noise and vibration levels due to aircraft flyovers a r e of the same order of magnitude as those associated with rail and road\ntraffic and normal household activities.\nINTRODUCTION\nOne aspect of the aircraft noise problem involves people inside houses. The\ndynamic response of the house structure is important because it affects both the noise\nand vibration stimuli of the observers inside the house. The nature of the noise-induced\nhouse-structure response problem is illustrated schematically in figure 1. The aircraft\nnoise excitation is evident to a person inside the house by means of three different phenomena. He hears the noise transmitted through the building walls; he can sense directly\nthe vibrations of the various components of the house such as walls and ceilings; and he\ncan hear the radiated noise from objects such as shelves, dishes, and ornaments, set in\nmotion by the vibration of the walls with which they are in contact.\nA programed overflight was conducted to study these phenomena at the NASA\nWallops Station. Vibration response and noise transmission characteristics of two\nhouses were investigated. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the results from this\nstudy for each of the three phenomena for aircraft noise excitation and to compare the\nassociated responses with those from other noise sources.\n\n637\n\nEXPERIMENTAL STUDIES\n\nTwo of the houses used in aircraft noise reduction studies are shown in figure 2.\nOne house was of brick-veneer construction with a concrete-slab foundation and steel\ncasement windows; the other was of aluminum-siding construction with a cinder-block\nfoundation and double-hung windows. Both houses were one-story six-room structures\nand had asphalt-shingle roofs with interior construction of sheet rock with plaster.\nThe houses were fully furnished and during test operations all windows and external\ndoors were closed. Data were obtained for 10 different aircraft during flyovers at simulated landing approach and climbout thrust conditions at various altitudes.\nNoise Reduction\nAn example of the manner in which the inside noise is related to the outside noise\n\nfor the aluminum-siding house is shown in figure 3. One-third octave band spectra are\nplotted for measurement locations both inside and outside the house. These particular\nspectra are for a turbofan aircraft in the landing approach condition, It is obvious that\nthe two spectra differ in several respects and that these differences result from the influences of the structure. A dominant feature of each spectrum, however, is a strong peak\nat about 2000 Hz. These peaks a r e associated with discrete-frequency noise from the\nfan sections of the engines. The differences between these two spectra indicated by the\nhatched region represent the noise reductions supplied by the structure at various frequencies. Noise reduction is plotted as a function of frequency in figure 4.\nNoise reductions due to the house are seen to vary considerably with frequency.\nThese variations with frequency a r e believed to be associated with the vibrational characteristics of the structure which a r e discussed subsequently in more detail. The\naverage noise reduction increases generally as a function of frequency and varies from\nabout 5 dB at the lower frequencies to about 20 dB at the higher frequencies, for this\nparticular house.\n\nA summary of the noise reduction data from this and other studies is included in\nfigure 5 The range of noise reductions obtained in the present study is represented by\n.\nthe data between the solid curves. Similar data recorded in houses on the East Coast, the\nWest Coast, and the Gulf Coast by other investigators (refs. 1 and 2) are included for comparison and a r e represented by the a r e a between the dashed curves. The data of the present study overlap those of the previous studies; this suggests that the noise reduction\ncharacteristics of the test houses of figure 2 were roughly similar to those of houses in\nother regions of the country. The average noise reduction for all houses considered\nvaries from about 10 dB to 25 dB in the frequency range of 30 to 3000 Hz.\n\n638\n\nThe noise reduction of a house is believed to be a function of several variables such\nas type of construction, size and style, furnishings, windows and doors, workmanship, condition of materials, and age. Each of these may under certain circumstances be significant. In spite of the existence of many differences between houses, there also exist many\nsimilarities in dynamic behavior because of the common usage of standard size components such as beams, rafters, wall panels, and windows,\nVibration Responses\nA series of experiments has been conducted to define the dynamic response characteristics of house components and to evaluate their responses to aircraft noise. One of\nthe experiments involved the use of a mechanical shaker, as illustrated in the sketch of\nfigure 6, to excite the structure with a sinusoidally varying load at a point on the wall for\nthe purpose of defining its dynamic response characteristics. During these experiments\nthe input force w a s varied both in frequency and in magnitude to study various response\nmodes of the structure. The associated acceleration responses as functions of the input\nforce are shown in figure 6 for one of these response modes at a frequency of 100 Hz.\nAcceleration response increases in a linear manner as the input force increases. Similar results were obtained for a range of response modes and for several different measurement locations.\nDuring forced vibration tests, about a 2-pound force from the shaker resulted in\nvibrations over a large portion of the house which were of the same order of magnitude\nas those observed during aircraft flyovers. These results suggest that over the range\nof interest for aircraft-induced vibrations, the house structures behave essentially in a\nlinear manner.\nAn example of the types of data obtained for a constant force input of a shaker as a\nfunction of frequency for the aluminum-siding house is shown in figure 7. Several\n\nresponse peaks can be seen in the acceleration spectrum of figure 7. Probe transducer\nsurveys have made possible the definition of the mode shapes associated with many of\nthese frequencies. Mode shapes for four vibration modes associated with the peaks\nlabeled A, B, C, and D in figure 7 are shown in figure 8. The vibration modes of the\nbuilding below approximately 100 Hz were associated mainly with the framing members\nsuch as wall studs and floor joists. Similar low-frequency response spectra have been\nobtained for many different houses. This similar response may be expected since houses\nare customarily built with standard size framing members.\n\nNo attempt was made to define in detail the mode shapes for the high-frequency\nportion of the spectrum of figure 7; such high-frequency modes involved mainly the\nwindow and wall panels. This general result for many houses is probably associated\nalso with the use of standard size window and wall panels in house construction.\n639\n\nFrom a subjective reaction standpoint, high-frequency noise transmitted through\nthe structure can be important; therefore, modifications to a house structure to attenuate\nhigh-frequency noise would involve considerations of the window and wall panels. Another\nsource of high-frequency noise is the vibration and rattle of ornaments and f k t u r e s\nattached to or in contact with a wall; this is a result of low-frequency wall motions. When\nthe wall motions reach a given amplitude, such objects will vibrate at frequencies higher\nthan the wall frequencies and in a range readily observable as rattles.\nNoise-Induced Rattle\nA specific example of a rattle situation involving wall mounted plaques is illustrated\nin figure 9. Wall acceleration level as a function of frequency is given for two types of\nexcitation. The solid curve with hatching represents a rattle boundary established by\ntests with the use of a mechanical shaker, illustrated in the sketch. For wall accelerations exceeding those of the boundary at the frequencies indicated, the plaques will rattle\nin an annoying manner. Shown for comparison is an acceleration spectrum measured at\nthe same instrument location for an aircraft flyover. The aircraft-noise-induced accelerations exceeded those of the rattle boundary and the plaques rattled. Such a rattle situation is a classical example of nonlinear dynamic responses where the excitation of a\nstructure by one frequency results in responses at a different frequency.\nCOMPARISON OF VIBRATION AND NOISE LEVELS FROM AIRCRAFT\nAND OTHER SOURCES\nA comparison of the wall vibration levels of houses due to aircraft noise with\nvibrations as a result of other common events is given in figure 10. The b a r s indicate\nthe ranges of wall acceleration level for each of the events listed. Also indicated, as a\nmatter of interest, are the vibration levels associated with perception and onset of\nannoyance from experience with continuously operating rotating machinery (ref. 3). Comparable perception and annoyance levels \xe2\x82\xacor flyover noise-induced transients have not yet\nbeen defined. The aircraft-noise-induced vibrations are of the same order of magnitude\nas those associated with rail and road traffic and normal household activities; acceleration levels associated with loud hi-fi operations are the most severe to which house\nstructures are exposed.\nSimilar results are presented in figure 11 for the indoor noise levels associated\nwith the same events of figure 10. The sound pressure levels from all these events\nexceed normal speech levels; hence, occasional speech interference would be encountered.\nThe highest sound pressure levels were associated with loud hi- fi operations.\n\n640\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nthe\nacoustic transmission through the structure, the vibrations of the structure, and the noise\nradiated by decorative objects in contact with the structure.
