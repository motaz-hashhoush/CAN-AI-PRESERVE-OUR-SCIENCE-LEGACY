The Russian experiments were designed to determine the effects\nof space flight on immunological parameters. The Russian experiment included the first in-flight\ndissection of rodents that allowed the determination of kinetics of when space flight affected immune\nresponses.\nThe support given the Russians by this laboratory was to a carry out assays for immunologically\nimportant cytokines that could not readily be carried out in their home laboratories. These included assays\nof interleukin-1, interleukin-6, interferon-gamma and possibly other cytokines. All data will be made\navailable-to the Russian investigator, Dr. Andre Lesnyak of the Institute of Biomedical Problems.\n\nMETHODS, RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nIn the first six months of this study, we have received supernatant fluids from cells from rats flown\naboard the Space Shuttle mission SLS-2. Samples received include supernatants from controls, rats\nflown in space and dissected in space and rats flown in space and dissected upon return to earth.\nProduction of interleukin-1, interleukin-2, interleukin-4, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha,\ntumor necrosis factor-beta, interferon-alpha, interferon-gamma was examined. Also, the activity of natural\nkiller cells was examined. The data are included in detailed in the appended tables and manuscript. In\nsummary, changes in immunological parameters were shown to be occurring in cells obtained from in-flight\ndissections of rats. This is the first time this has been demonstrated. For some immunological parameters,\nthese alterations persisted after flight, but for others there was a return to normal values after flight.\nFor the first time, it has now been demonstrate that changes in immune response occur during\nflight, and not just immediately after flight. This could indicate that microgravity could play a role in the\nalterations in immune responses induced by space flight.\n\nPUBLICATIONS\n\n1.

Immunological studies\naddressed the kinetics of T-lymphocyte proliferative responses, cytotoxic activity of\nnatural killer cells, and cytokine production. Experiments were performed using spleen\nand bone marrow of rats dissected before flight, during flight, immediately after\nrecovery (R) or 14 days after recovery (R + 14), as well as respective control\nanimals. Each group consisted of 5 Sprague-Dawley male rats. It was demonstrated that\nT-lymphocyte activity of rats dissected in flight was significantly decreased when\ncompared to the controls. This was observed during 48-, 72- and 96-hour cultivation\nand stimulation with the following mitogenic stimuli: concavalin A (Con A) 0.1, 1.0, and\n10.0 mg/ml, phytohemagglutinin (PHA) 2.5 mg/ml, and interleukin-2 (IL-2) 1 U/ml.\nThe proliferative response returned to normal only in PHA stimulated cultures after an\nextended 96-hour cultivation. The cell proliferation rate in rats dissected immediately\nafter recovery did not decrease, while that in rats dissected at R+14 increased. The\nactivity of spleen natural killer cells was reduced in response to 51cr-labeled target\ncells during flight (YAC-1 and K-562) and after flight (YAC-1). At R+14, their\nactivity returned to normal. Another technique employed to measure natural\ncytotoxicity, using ^H-uridine labeled target cells and RNase, did not reveal any\ndifferences between control and experimental groups. In bone marrow, the activity of\nnatural killer cells did not vary significantly. The production of interleukin-1 (IL-1),\nIL-2, tumor necrosis factor - alpha (TNF-alpha) and tumor necrosis factor - beta\n(TNF-beta) in spleen cell cultures of the flight rats was reduced. At R+0, IL-1 and\nTNF-beta remained lowered, while TNF-alpha was increased. At R+0, interferon-alpha\n(IFN-alpha) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) were diminished. In summary, cellmediated immunity in rats was drastically suppressed during flight. The time course\n\nvariation of immune parameters after flight suggests that the changes may truly indicate\na response of the immune system to space flight conditions that could increase over time.\n\nSpace flight, T-lymphocytes, natural killers, immunity parameters, cytokines\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIt has been demonstrated that exposure of animals and humans to microgravity\ncaused, as a rule, immune alterations detected immediately after flight [3-7, 9, 10, 12,\n14, 1 5]. Immune changes mainly consisted of decreases in the proliferative activity of\nT-lymphocytes [4-6, 8-10], cytotoxic activity of natural killer cells [6, 9-11 ], and\nproduction of cytokines [2, 6, 9-11 ]. Spaceflight was also found to have an impact on\nthe distribution of immunocompetent cells [6, 8, 12, 14, 15] and bone marrow cell\nsensitivity to the colony forming factors [12, 13].\nSLS-2 was the first flight in which rats were dissected in orbit and biosamples\nreturned to the Earth for analysis. This made it possible to obtain unique data about\ncell-mediated immunity of rats during space flight without having to consider landing\nstresses.\nThe purpose of this experiment was to assess spaceflight effects on\ncell-mediated immunity in orbit and the pattern of its recovery after flight.\nThe objectives of the experiment were:\n1.\n\nTo study spaceflight effects on the kinetics of lymphocyte proliferation,\n\n2.\n\nto assess the activity of natural killer cells,\n\n3.\n\nto investigate the production of cytokines, i.e., interleukin-1\n\n(IL-1), interleukin-2 (IL-2), interferons- (IFN) alpha and gamma, and tumor\nnecrosis factors- (TNF) alpha and beta.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nBiosamples were obtained from 15 Sprague-Dawley male rats, which weighed\napproximately 300 g on the dissection day and were flown for 14 days on SLS-2.\nTwenty ground-based control animals were kept in an environment mocking that in orbit\nwith respect to the diet and water consumption, air temperature and humidity, and\nlight-dark cycle.\nThe experimental animals formed the following groups:\nBasal control group (BC)\n\n5 rats\n\nGroup dissected in flight (F)\n\n5 rats\n\nGround-based control group to F rats (FC)\n\n5 rats\n\nFlight rats dissected immediately after recovery (R+0)\n\n5 rats\n\nGround-based control group to R+0 rats (RC+0)\n\n5 rats\n\nFlight rats dissected 14 days after recovery (R+14)\n\n5 rats\n\nGround-based control group to R+14 rats (RC+14)\n\n5 rats\n\nSpleen and bone marrow cells from the rats were used for our experiments. Cell\nsuspensions were prepared at the dissection site and shipped at +4 \xc2\xb0C to NASA Ames\nResearch Center. Arrival time at the Ames Research cCenter was about 12 hr after\ntermination of the dissections. Immediately upon receipt, cells were cultured. Cell\nviability measured by trypan blue dye exclusion was not less than 80 - 90%.\nCell suspensions were stored and shipped in McCoy\'s 5A (Sigma) culture media\nsupplemented with L-glutamine, HEPES-buffer, fetal bovine serum, and antibiotics.\nLymphocyte proliferation activity and natural killer cytotoxicity were measured using\nRPMI-1640 media (Sigma) that also contained L-glutamine, fetal bovine serum, and\nantibiotics. Cytokine production was assessed on Iskove media (Sigma) containing Lglutamine and antibiotics.\nParameters measured in the experiment.\n\nProliferative activity _ of Concavalin A (Sigma) (Con A 0.1, 1.0, and 10.0\nmg/ml), phytohemagglutinin (Sigma) (PHA 2.5 mg/ml), and interleukin-2 (Sigma)\n(IL-2, 1.0 U/ml) stimulated spleen T-cells was measured in terms of DMA synthesis\n(^H-thymidine incorporation during 18 hours) after 48, 72 and 96 hours of\ncultivation at 37 \xc2\xb0C in humidified 5% C02 air. The cell concentration was\n0.2 X 10^ cells/well of a round-bottom culture plate in each of two arrays. After\nincubation, cell residues were placed onto filters using a cell harvester, and their\nradioactivity was measured by means of a liquid scintillation counter. Results were\nexpressed as distintegrations per minute (dpm).\nActivity of natural killer cells _ found in spleen and bone marrow was assayed on\nYAC-1 and K-562 cultured target cells labeled with\n\n51\n\nCr and 3H-uridine.The effector:\n\ntarget ratios used were: 100: 1, 50: 1, 25: 1, 12: 1, 6: 1, 3:1, and 1.5: 1 (10,000\ntarget cells per well). In ^H-uridine tests, effector cells were treated with actinomycin\nD (Sigma) (5 mg/ml) for 1 hour at 37 \xc2\xb0C and the reaction conducted in the presence of\nribonuclease A (Sigma) containing culture media to prevent label re-utilization. Cell\ncultures were incubated for 4 hours in 51Cr tests and for 16 hours in ^H-uridine tests\nin humidified 5% C02 air at 37 \xc2\xb0C. After incubation in cultures containing ^H-uridine\nlabeled target cells, residues were transferred onto filters using a cell harvester, and\ntheir radioactivity was measured by means of a liquid scintillation counter. Results\nwere expressed as a cytotoxicity index equal to (1 - dpm in experiment / dpm in\ncontrol) X 100. In cultures containing 51 Cr labeled target cells, the supernatant fluid\nwas collected, and its radioactivity was measured by means of a gamma-counter. Results\nwere expressed as a cytotoxicity index equal to ((dpm in experiment - dpm in control) /\n(maximum dpm in supernatant - dpm in control)) X 100.\nCvtokines were assessed in supernatant fluids of spleen and bone marrow cells\ncultivated in 24-well flat-bottom plates in humidified 5% C02 air at 37 \xc2\xb0C at a\n\n7\nconcentration of 5 X 106 cells / 1.5 ml/ well. After incubation, supernatant fluids\nwere frozen and stored at -20 \xc2\xb0C until testing.\nInterleukin -1 (IL-T).\n\n_ Spleen and bone marrow cells were incubated for\n\n24 hours in the presence of E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Sigma) (1 mg/ml) in\nhumidified 5% C02 air at 37 \xc2\xb0C.Supernatant activity was measured in 72-hour cell\ncultures of C3H/HeJ murine thymus (2 month old males). Serial supernatant dilutions\n(two per dilution) were added to the wells of a 96-well plate containing 1.5 X 106\nthymus cells. The reaction was measured in terms of ^H-uridine incorporation during\nthe last 18 hours of incubation. Cell residues were transferred onto filters using a cell\nharvester, and their radioactivity was measured by means of a liquid scintillation\ncounter. Results were compared with standard IL-1 (lnterleukin-1 alpha, Cytokine\nScience Inc.) and expressed as U/ml.\nInterleukin -2 (IL-2).\n\n_ Spleen cells were incubated for 48 hours in the presence\n\nof Con A (1 mg/ml). lnterleukin-2 activity was measured in CTLL-2 cell culture for\n48 hours in humidified 5% COz air at 37 \xc2\xb0C. Supernatant fluids were serially diluted\n(two per dilution). The reaction was measured in terms of\n3|H-uridine incorporation during the last 18 hours of incubation. Cell residues were\ntransferred onto filters using a cell harvester, and their radioactivity was measured by\nmeans of a liquid scintillation counter. Results were compared\nwith standard IL-2 (T-cell growth factor, Sigma) and expressed as U/ml.\nInterferon-alpha (IFN-alpha). _ Spleen cells were incubated for 24 hours in the\npresence of poly-l:C (polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, Sigma) (25 mg/ml) and DEAEdextrane (Sigma) (50 mg/ml).\nInterferon-gamma (IFM-gamma). _ Spleen cells were incubated for 48 hours in\nthe presence of Con A (1 mg/ml).\nInterferon activity was measured in cultured murine L-cells with respect\n\n8\nto the suppression of the cytopathic effect of murine encephalomyocarditis virus.\nSupernatant fluids diluted with the test cell culture were incubated for 24 hours\nin humidified 5% C02 air at 37 \xc2\xb0C. Results were expressed as In titer (units/ml).\nTumor necrosis factor - alpha (TNF-alpha^ _. Spleen cells were cultivated\nfor 24 hours in the presence of LPS (10 ng/ml) and muramyl dipeptide (MDP,\n10 mg/ml) (Adjuvant peptide, Sigma).\nTumor necrotic factor - beta (TNF-beta). From a spleen cell suspension,\na nonadherent fraction was isolated by incubating the suspension in Petri dishes (60\nmin) in humidified 5% C02 air at 37 \xc2\xb0C. Nonadherent cells were cultivated for 48 hours\nin the presence of Con A (1 mg/ml).\nTNF-alpha and TNF-beta activities were measured with respect to their\ncytopathic effect on L929 cells. Cells were incubated for 14 hours with serially diluted\nsupernatant fluids containing TNF-alpha and TNF-beta; then dead cells were identified,\nand viable cells were stained with crystal violet. The titer of TNF was the reciprocal\nlast dilution of test sample that decreased viability by 50%. Results were compared\nwith standard TNF-alpha and TNF-beta (Sigma).\nThe resultant data were treated statistically to determine mean arithmetic (M)\nand standard error (m). The difference between flight and control groups\nof rats was evaluated using the Student\'s t-test (t) and nonparametric Wilcoxon-MannWhitney test (U).\n\nRESULTS\n\nProliferative activity .\nBasal controls showed a high level of T-lymphocyte proliferation during\ndifferent cultivation times and with different mitogen concentrations used.\nThe proliferative activity of spleen T-lymphocytes sacrificed in flight\n(Figure 1) was reduced in both unstimulated cultures and in cultures stimulated with\nvarious concentrations of Con A, PHA and IL-2 during 48-, 72- and 96-hour\nincubation. The response returned to the control level only in PHA stimulated cultures\ncultivated for 96 hours.\nIn R+0 animals, spontaneous proliferative activity decreased slightly in\n48- and 72-hour cultures.\nAt R+14, 48-hour cultures showed increases in spontaneous proliferative\nactivity and in responses to stimulation with Con A (0.1 and 1.0 mg/ml) and IL-2, when\ncompared to the controls; 72-hour cultures showed a higher response to PHA\nstimulation; 96-hour cultures had the same level of proliferative activity as controls.\nFunctional activity of natural killers.\nSpleen cells\nTest with 51 Cr-labeled target cells.\nIn cell cultures with YAC-1 (Figure 2) of F and R+0 rats, the functional activity\nof natural killer cells was decreased in the case of most effector: target ratios used. At\nR+14, cytotoxic activity was fully recovered. In cell cultures with K-562 (Figure 3)\nof F rats, cytotoxicity index was significantly decreased at ratios of 1: 100, 1: 50, 1: 12\nand 1: 6. No marked differences were seen in R+0 and R+14 groups.\nTest with 3H-uridine labeled target cells.\n\n10\nIn the test with 3H-uridine labeled target cells changes were smaller. In cell\ncultures with YAC-1, the cytotoxicity index was lowered in F rats at a ratio\nof 1: 3 and in R+0 rats at ratios of 1: 3 and 1: 1.5. The cytotoxicity index was,\non the contrary, increased in R+14 rats at a ratio of 1: 1.5. In cell cultures with\nK-562, functional activity was decreased in F rats at a ratio of 1: 50 and in R+0 rats at\nratios of 1: 100 and 1: 50. The cytotoxicity index in R+0 rats was increased at a ratio of\n1: 1.5. At R+14, no changes were detected.\n\nBone marrow cells.\nTest with 51 Cr labeled target cells.\nIn YAC-1 and K-562 cell cultures no significant differences were found between\nflight and control animals. The only exception was a decreased cytotoxicity index in R+0\nrats identified in K-562 cultures at ratios of 1: 25 and\n1:6.\n\nTest with ^H-uridine labeled target cells.\nNo significant differences were observed with respect to YAC-1 and\nK-562.\nCvtokines (Table 1)\nlnterleukin-1\nThe ability of spleen cells to produce IL-1 was diminished in F and R+0 rats. No\ndifferences were seen in R+14 rats. IL-1 activity in supernatant fluids\nof bone marrow cells was low , being very similar in flight animals and their respective\ncontrols.\nlnterleukin-2\nThe ability of spleen cells to produce IL-2 remained high in basal controls. This\nparameter was not determined in F rats and was not detectable in their controls. In R+0\nand R+14 rats, the parameter did not differ from the controls.\n\n11\nInterferon-alpha.\nIFN-alpha activity in supernatant fluids of spleen cell cultures of F and\nR+0 rats remained very close to that in the controls, and in R+14 rats it was decreased.\nInterferon-gamma.\nIFN-gamma production by spleen cells was high in basal controls. The parameter\nwas not determined in supernatant fluids of F rats or their controls. The parameter in\nR+0 rats was the same as in the controls, and in R+14 rats\nit was lowered.\n\nTumor necrotic factor - alpha.\nTNF-alpha production by spleen cells was decreased in F rats and increased in\nR+0 rats, when compared to their controls. At R+14, no significant changes were\nobserved.\nTumor necrotic factor - beta.\nTNF-beta production by spleen cells was decreased in F and in R+0 rats, when\ncompared to their controls. At R+14, no significant changes were found.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nOur investigations demonstrated significant changes in immune responses of rats,\nwhen tissues were harvested during flight. The rats dissected in orbit showed a marked\ndecline of the spleen lymphocyte capability to proliferate in response to mitogenic\nstimulation during all cultivation times. The data obtained for the first time ever by in\nvitro cell cultivation techniques that indicated a significant decrease of the functional\nactivity of T-lymphocytes in space flight could yield difficulties in the formation of a\nspecific immune response. The fact that flight rat cells recovered their capability of\nresponding to one of the mitogens used, i.e. PHA, when the incubation time was increased\n\n12\nto 96 hours, gave evidence that the changes could be transient. This was supported by\nthe observation that the proliferative activity of spleen stimulated cells of flight rats\ndissected at R+0 was very similar to that of controls. Additionally, IL-2 activity was\nreduced only in flight rats, which was consistent with a proliferation rate decrease\nobserved at that time. Changes detected in R+0 and R+14 rats were\nin agreement with immunological observations on SLS-1 rats (A. Lesnyak,\nG. Sonnenfeld, unpublished data).\nMeasurement of cytotoxic activity also yielded interesting data. The function of\nspleen natural killers was significantly inhibited. The test with 51 Cr- labeled target\ncells demonstrated a significant decrease of the cytotoxicity index of F rats in relation to\nboth YAC-1 and K-562 cells, and that of R+0 rats in relation to YAC-1 cells. The\nparameter returned to normal at R+14. The test with 3H-uridine labeled target cells\nshowed less substantial changes in spleen natural killers. Bone marrow natural killers\nvaried insignificantly. Cosmos rat experiments revealed a decreased activity of spleen\nnatural killers in the test with 51Cr- labeled target cells [11 ].\nThe production of cytokines also varied significantly in space. IL-1 activity in\ncultured spleen cells was diminished in F and R+0 rats. TNF-alpha and TNF-beta in\ncultured spleen cells was also lowered in F rats. At R+0, TNF-beta remained decreased\nwhile TNF-alpha increased. In F rats, IFN-alpha remained unaltered. At R+0, IFNalpha and IFN-gamma production was identical to that in the controls and at R+14 it was\nreduced. It should be noted that similar changes in the cytokine production were found in\nthe SLS-1 rat experiment (A. Lesnyak, G. Sonnenfeld, unpublished data). However,\nCosmos experiments yielded different results [8]. At R+0, IL-1 production was\nincreased and IL-2 decreased. IFN-gamma activity was also reduced in both Cosmos [8]\nand SL-3 [2] experiments.\nIn summary, SLS-2 experiments provided new data about spaceflight effects on\nimmune responses. Proliferative activity and natural cytotoxicity of spleen cells, as\n\n13\nwell as IL-1, IL-2, TNF-alpha and TNF-beta production were decreased in orbit. IFNalpha remained unaltered. After flight most immune parameters returned to normal. At\nR+0, spontaneous lymphocyte proliferation, natural cytotoxicity in the 51Q--YAC-1\ntest, and IL-1 and TNF-beta production remained at a lower level; however, TNF-alpha\nwas increased. At R+14, proliferative activity tended to increase and interferon\nproduction to decrease.\nNo significant changes were found in cultured bone marrow cells. In our opinion, the\ndiscrepancy between Cosmos and SLS results can be attributed to differences in flight\nconditions. Those would include a less stressful SLS landing profile, earlier animal\ndissection after SLS flight, and differences between Wistar and Sprague-Dawley rat\nstrains. These assumptions require experimental verification.\nOf crucial importance is the fact that immunological studies were performed on\nanimals dissected in orbit for the first time ever. Changes seen can be qualified as\nsignificant immune alterations. However, immune data can be properly interpreted only\nin relation to biochemical, morphological and hormonal observations. In spaceflight, the\nsuppression of immunocompetent cell populations was selective rather than total. At\nR+14, readaptation of the immune system was not yet complete, indicating that 14 days\nwas an insufficient time period for all the immune parameters to return to normal. In\nany case, it is now clear that immune alterations observed in space can be attributed\ndirectly to spaceflight conditions.\n\n14\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\n\nThe authors extend their sincere gratitude to all those involved in the NASA Space\nLife Sciences - 2 project, particularly the SLS-2 crew, support personnel, and NASA\nAmes Research Center specialists who assisted in the preparation and conduct of the\nimmunology experiment.
