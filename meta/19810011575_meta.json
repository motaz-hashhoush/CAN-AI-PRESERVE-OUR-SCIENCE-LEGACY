Geostationary and polar orbits are compared. A low cost SARSAT rescue system utilizing four satellites in a quasi solar, sun synchronized orbit at 1000 kilometers is proposed. Three multiple start satellites in a 57 degree orbit, with a fourth satellite in reserve at a lower orbit are described. Alternative transport systems are discussed and a recommended time table from project approval to launch is given.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19810011575, "id": "c2239ea335874fbd855df1e388d524fe", "publicationDate": "1980-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19810011575.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19810011575/downloads/19810011575.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19810011575/downloads/19810011575.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19810011575/downloads/19810011575.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
