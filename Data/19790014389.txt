b"SPACE SHUTTLE ORBITER PAYLOAD BAY DOOR MECHANISMS\n\nBill M. McAnally\xe2\x80\x9d\nABSTRACT\n\nThe opening, closing, and latching of the first large clamshell door to operate in space presents\nsome unusual challenges for the mechanism designer of the Space Shuttle Program. This paper\ndescribes the requirements, hardware configuration, design trade-offs, and qualification testing in\nprocess to meet the challenge and to make the system operational for the Shuttle orbiter\xe2\x80\x99s\napproaching first orbital flight. This work was conducted under NASA Contract NAS9-14000.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe unique, reusable, cargo-carrying \xe2\x80\x9cspace airplane,\xe2\x80\x9d called the Space Shuttle orbiter, can also\nbe described as a contemporary delta-wing aircraft launched into orbit as a spacecraft, then returned\nfrom orbit to a conventional landing. The orbiter\xe2\x80\x99s cavernous cargo or payload bay will enable it to\ntransport various sizes, shapes, and weights of payloads to and from earth orbit.\nThe payload bay doors are designed around the payload requirements that call for an envelope\n4.6 meters (1 5 feet) in diameter and 18.3 meters (60 feet) long. The doors provide the aerodynamic\nfairing required for the mid fuselage and the complete environmental envelope for the payload bay.\nThey react fuselage torsional loads in addition to supporting their own flight and purge pressure\nloadings. They also provide structural support for the fixed and deployable environmental control\nsystem radiators that are attached to the inner surface of the doors. The payload bay doors are\nhinged along the side and split at the top centerline-i.e., one door per side 18.3 meters (60 feet)\nlong. Each side consists of four 4.6-meter (15-foot) segments that are interconnected through\nexpansion joints that allow the door to act as one 18.3-meter (60-foot) door. The doors have the\nstructural integrity and capability of being opened and closed in zero gravity; but in 1 g, they\nrequire ground support equipment assistance in both the vertical (launch) position and the\nhorizontal position.\nThe payload bay door mechanisms include the elements associated with remote operation and\nlatching of the payload bay doors and deployable radiators. The functions of these mechanisms\ninclude (1) closing and opening the doors and retaining the doors in an open position;\n(2) unlatching and structurally securing (latching) the closed doors to the orbiter structure;\n(3) stowing, deploying, and retaining the radiators in the deployed position; (4) unlatching and\nstructurally securing (latching) the deployable radiators .to the payload bay doors; and (5) providing\ncontrols and measurements to indicate door, radiator, and latch mechanism status. Table I\nsummarizes the number of components to perform these functions.\n~\n\n~~\n\n*B. M. McAnally is Engineering Manager of Mechanical/Actuation Systems for the Space Shuttle Program at the Rockwell\nInternational Space Systems Group at Downey, California.\n\n261\n\nDESIGN REQUIREMENTS\nThe mechanisms have been designed to satisfy a wide variety of structural, mechanical, and\nmission-unique requirements.

The two 18.3-meter (60-foot) doors require structural latching of approximately\n33.5 lineal meters (1 10 lineal feet) of door edge-18.3 meters (60 feet) at the upper centerline and\n7.6 meters (25 feet) each at both the forward and aft end-as depicted in Figure 2. The doors are\nopened/closed and latched sequentially, either manually from the on-board control panel or\nautomatically from the on-board computer, by electromechanical actuators. Figure 3 depicts the\ndoor opening/closing and latching sequence, revealing the use of ganged latches (four latches in each\ngang). The door mechanisms are broken into four basic subelements: door drive actuation, forward\nbulkhead latches, aft bulkhead latches, and centerline latches.\n\nDoor Drive Actuation\nThe actuation system drives the door to the required positions, as illustrated in Figure 4. There\nare two actuation systems, one on each side of the orbiter, driving an 18.3-meter (60-foot) \xe2\x80\x9chalf\ndoor\xe2\x80\x9d at six points along the hinge line. The six gear boxes are connected by torque tubes to each\nother and to an electromechanical power drive unit. The output of the six gear boxes is transmitted\nthrough the drive linkage to the door, as noted in Section A-A of Figure 4. The door actuation\nsystem is sized for operating the doors in 1-g conditions with ground support equipment assist when\nthe orbiter is either horizontal or vertical.\n\nForward Bulkhead Latches\nThe forward bulkhead latches connect the doors to the forward structural bulkhead, as depicted\nin Figure 5 . The forward latches consist of a right-hand gang (four latches) and a left-hand gang\n2 62\n\n(four latches), each latch operating in a sequential manner controlled by the kinematics of the\nganged mechanism. The latch mechanism is mountcd on the door, and the mating hook rollers are\nmounted on the bulkhead. The latches also help to maintain door sealing to the fuselage structure,\nas shown in Figure 6. Note that the sliding seal, which requires the engaged latch hooks to slide fore\nand aft on the rollers, allows for relative movement between the door and forward bulkhead. Each\nganged mechanism is driven by a single electromechanical rotary actuator (two motors).\n\nAft Bulkhead Latches\nThe aft bulkhead latches connect the doors to the aft structural bulkhead in much the same\nmanner as the forward bulkhead latches (Figure 7), the only difference being the added fore/aft\nshear tie at each latch on the aft bulkhead (identified as a \xe2\x80\x9cpassive roller\xe2\x80\x9d in Figure 7). The tie is\nrequired to effect an adequate door-to-structure seal with the given aft bulkhead seal configuration\nof Figure 6.\n\nUpper Centerline Latches\nThe upper centerline latches connect the right-hand and left-hand doors along. the upper\ncenterline, as shown in Figure 8. There are four gangs of latches (four latches each), the active\nlatches on the right-hand door and the mating rollers on the left-hand door. Within each gang, the\nfour latches are connected by torque tubes to each other and to a single electromechanical rotary\n. actuator. Each latch gang also contains one passive shear fitting to carry fore and aft shear loads.\nAgain, the latches also help to maintain door-to-door sealing, as shown in Figure 6. Alignment\nrollers are used at each latch to ensure proper engagement of the opposite door under any warpage\ncondition (Figure 9).\n\nRadiator Mechanisms Overview\nThe environmental control deployable radiators are hinge-mounted to the forward 9.1-meter\n(30-foot) sections of the payload bay door, as shown in Figure 10. Each 9.1-meter (30-foot)\nradiator consists of two 4.6-meter (15-foot) panels interconnected to operate as one. After the\npayload bay doors are opened, the radiators are deployed to a predetermined position t o provide\ndual-sided radiative surfaces to dissipate heat accumulated from orbiter systems. The radiators are\nopened/closed and latched manually from the on-board control panel by electromechanical\nactuators. The radiator mechanisms are broken into two basic subelements: radiator drive actuation\nand radiator latches.\n\nRadiator Drive Actuation\nThe actuation system drives the radiator to a position 0.62 radians (35.5 degrees) away from the\npayload bay door, as shown in Figure 10. The drive system is very similar to the payload bay door\ndrive system, one on each door driving a 9.1-meter (30-foot) deployable radiator at four points along\nthe hinge line. The four gear boxes are connected by torque tubes to each other and to the\nelectromechanical power drive unit. The output of the four gear boxes is transmitted through the\ndrive linkage t o the radiator.\n263\n\nRadiator Latches\nThe radiator latches provide the mechanisms to attach the deployable radiators structurally to\nthe doors during boost to orbit and reentry. Each 9.1-meter @-foot) radiator has 12 latches, in\ntwo groups of six each, each group being driven by one electromechanical power drive unit and\nthree rotary gear boxes, as depicted in Figure 10.\nDESIGN DETAILS\n\nThe structural integrity required to ensure a safe deorbit of the orbiter vehicle reflects the\ncriticality of the payload bay door mechanisms. Remotely unlatching, opening, then closing and\nlatching 18.3 meters (60 feet) of the orbiter mid body on orbit and prior to reentry are the pTimary\nchallenges. In addition, the deployable radiators must first be remotely opened, closed, and latched\nin order to close the payload bay doors for reentry. The on-orbit conditions, along with the boost\nand reentry to earth landing conditions, are presented in a design load matrix in Table 11.\nLatched conditions during boost to orbit and reentry to landing are generally basic\nrequirements. However, the latching conditions on orbit present the challenge, primarily because of\nthe size of the doors and the thermal distortions resulting from long-duration orientations of the\norbiter to the sun and deep space. Figure 11 presents fore and aft design deflections at the door\ncenterhe. Only the door mechanisms are discussed here, since the radiator mechanisms are so\nsimilar in design and operation.\nThe electrical commands to open and close the doors are initiated as a function of mission\nelapsed time, mission event, or manual switch operation. Only the door closing sequence is\ndiscussed here, since the opening sequence is basically the reverse of closing. Before the payload\nbay door can be closed, the right- and left-hand deployable radiators must be stowed and latched\nstrictly by manual switch operations.\nReceipt of the door CLOSE command initiates the following steps:\n1. Initiate CLOSE command for left door.\na. When door reaches READY TO LATCH position, a signal is generated to initiate the next\nstep.\nb. If after 126 seconds READY TO LATCH signals are not received, a malfunction signal is\ngenerated in the cockpit CRT display, requiring the crew to take corrective action.\n2. Initiate CLOSE command for forward and aft left bulkhead four-latch gangs.\na. When latches are closed, a signal is generated to initiate the next step and turn off applicable\ndrive motors.\nb. If after 60 seconds latches are not closed, a malfunction signal is generated in the cockpit\nCRT display, requiring the crew to take corrective action. '\n3. Initiate CLOSE command for right-hand door.\na. Same as Step l a\nb. Same as Step l b\n4 Initiate CLOSE command for forward and aft right bulkhead four-latch gangs.\n.\na. Same as Step 2a\nb. Same as Step 2b\n264\n\n5. Initiate CLOSE command for forward and aft centerline four-latch gangs.\na. When latches are closed, a signal is generated to initiate the next step.\nb. If after 40 seconds latches are not closed, a malfunction signal is generated in the cockpit\nCRT display, requiring the crew to take corrective action. \xe2\x80\x99\n6. Initiate CLOSE command for the mid centerline four-latch gangs.\na. Same as Step 5a\nb. Same as Step 5b\n7. Generate signals for crew display: PAYLOAD BAY DOORS CLOSED.\nThe above sequence can be stopped and/or reversed at any point.\nAs noted earlier, the door mechanisms consist of 32 latches: 8 at the forward door edge, 8 at\nthe aft door edge, and 16 along the door centerline. The latches are all approximately 0.9 1 meters\n(3 feet) apart. Once the doors are unlatched on orbit and each door is opened 3.1 1 radians\n(1 78 degrees), the huge doors and the \xe2\x80\x9copened\xe2\x80\x9d fuselage structure are exposed to varying thermal\nconditions: the open payload bay (and inner surface of the doors) may be exposed to deep space,\nwhile the lower side of the orbiter (and outer surface of the doors) may be exposed to the sun; or\nsun may be on one side of the orbiter with deep space exposure on the other. These are just two\nexamples of many orientations that create a wide excursion of thermal deformations to be\novercome during closing and latching of the doors. In addition, the door structure is graphite-epoxy\nconstruction while the fuselage structure is aluminum. Again, the on-orbit thermal deflections are\nmore significant in the design because of the large size of the doors.\nBecause of these deflections, the actuation system required to drive the door to the fully closed\nposition and to ensure that the forward and aft edge of the door is in total contact with the\nbulkhead structure for \xe2\x80\x9csimple latching\xe2\x80\x9d would be prohibitive from a power, space, and weight\nstandpoint. Therefore, of all the means considered, the mechanically sequenced ganged latching\nconcept was chosen.\nTo close the door, the actuation system drives the left-hand door to an approximate 0.03-radian\n(1.7 5-degree) open position, overcoming a 1.8-kilogram-per-running-centimeter ( 1O-p,ound-perrunning-inch) seal and thermal barrier load along the hinge line and bulkheads near the hinge line.\nThe door drive must also overcome sliding friction ( p = 0.3) on the bulkhead seals and thermal\nbarriers, hinge line warpage, \xe2\x80\x9coil canning\xe2\x80\x9d of the doors, mechanical linkage friction ( p = 0.3), and\nvarious fluid and electrical lines crossing over the hinge line from the fusela e to the door and\nradiator. Therefore, the power drive unit has an output of 7.32 x loi dyne-centimeters\n(648 inch-pounds) of torque transmitted through the aluminum torque shafts to the six geared\nrotary actuators, each with an output of approximately 90.38 x 1 O8 dyne-centimeters (8000 inchpounds) of torque. The output of the six actuators is transmitted to the door structure through the\ninterconnecting door drive linkage, placing the door, not fully closed, within the reach of the first\nbulkhead latch. Then the latches must pull the door completely closed.\nAs the door moves through the 0.07-radian (&degree) open position, READY TO LATCH\nswitches on the forward and aft bulkheads are \xe2\x80\x9cpicked up,\xe2\x80\x9d initiating the bulkhead latch actuators.\nThe door is then within the 5.1-centimeter (2-inch) reach capability of the No. 1 bulkhead latch\nclosest to the door hinge line (Figure 12). Continued door movement to the 0.03-radian\n(1.75-degree) open position \xe2\x80\x9cpicks up\xe2\x80\x9d the forward and aft bulkhead DOOR CLOSED switch,\nshutting off power to the door drive system.\nThe forward and aft bulkhead latch rotary actuators, with output torques of 16.04 x lo8\ndyne-centimeters (1 4,200 inch-pounds) each, transmit power to each of the four latches in the gang\n265\n\nthrough the mechanical linkage. The kinematics of the ganged linkage is such that the No. 1 latch\nfirst engages the door, pulling it to a position within reach of the No. 2 latch. As the No. 2 latch\ncontinues to pull the door further closed, the door comes within reach of the No. 3 latch, and so on\nuntil the No. 4 latch finally pulls the door into total contact with the bulkhead structure.\nThe ganged latches, mechanically sequenced, thus provide a unique \xe2\x80\x9czippering effect\xe2\x80\x9d to close\nthe door. The bulkhead latch actuator must overcome a 1.8-kilogram-per-running-centimeter\n(10-pound-per-running-inch) seal and thermal barrier load along the bulkhead, sliding friction\n(p = 0.3) on the seals and barriers, mechanism friction (p = 0.18), door stiffness, and the previously\ndiscussed thermal distortions. The latch mechanisms are structurally designed to take full actuator\nstall output (jamming) to within 0.1 7 radian (10 degrees) of the mechanism on-center position. As\nthe bulkhead latch actuators drive the four-latch gang to the on-center or door-closed position, a\nswitch within the actuator shuts off the actuator and triggers the right-hand door closing sequence.\nSome on-orbit thermal distortion conditions result in the tendency of the doors to overlap at\nthe upper centerline-as much as 5.1 centimeters (2 inches) under the worst conditions. Thus,\nalignment rollers are used along the centerline to force the doors into position (Figure 9) and\nprovide a safe centerline latch engagement envelope.\nThe right door is closed and latched in the same manner and to the same design requirements as\nthe left-hand door, leaving the upper 18.3-meter (60-foot) centerline of the two door halves to be\nlatched. The full travel of the forward and aft bulkhead latch actuators latching the right-hand door\ntrips a switch inside the actuator, thus initiating the upper centerline door-to-door latches. But the\n18.3 meters (60 feet) of centerline latches consist of 16 latches in 4 groups, each group ganging four\nlatches together (as noted in Figure 8). This design results from the varying distorted relationship\nbetween the two door halves at the centerline. Only the most forward and most aft four-latch gangs\nare actuated first. The doors are relatively close together at these points because the door ends are\nlatched to the forward and aft bulkheads. Once the most forward and most aft centerline four-latch\ngangs are latched, they pull the central 9.1 meters (30 feet) of the centerline door halves closer\ntogether, thus making it easier and more positive for the remaining two latch gangs to complete the\ncenterline latching.\nEach four-latch gang is identical-a rotary actuator transmitting 45.19 x 108 dyne-centimeters\n(4000 inch-pounds) of output torque through connecting aluminum torque tubes to the four-latch\nhooks. The actuator is designed to overcome seal and thermal barrier loads and friction, mechanical\nfriction, door stiffness, and thermal distortions of similar values found in the bulkhead and door\ndrive actuation systems. In addition, each four-latch gang has a passive shear fitting engagement\nrequirement, as shown in Figure 8. The fore and aft shear load capability of 7491 kilograms\n(1 6,500 pounds) per fitting provides the load path for the torsional door requirement.\nSomewhat different from the bulkhead latch gang, the centerline four-latch hooks within a gang\nmove together to latch simultaneously. However, a similar \xe2\x80\x9czippering\xe2\x80\x9d effect occurs in that the full\ntravel of the latch actuators in the forward and aft four-latch gangs trips a switch in each actuator,\nshutting off its own power and causing power to be applied to the two centermost four-latch gangs.\nFull travel of these centermost two actuators, and thus completion of the payload bay door closure,\ntrips a switch in each actuator to stop the actuator and provide a DOOR CLOSED display in the\ncockpit. Thus, the orbiter structure returns to the appropriate, smooth, aerodynamic contour\nrequired for a safe reentry into the earth\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere; and structural continuity enables the orbiter\nvehicle to maneuver to a safe landing at the designated landing site. \xe2\x80\x99\n266\n\nTEST PROGRAM\nAt this writing, a significant amount of testing and analysis remains to be done before the\npayload bay door mechanisms are certified for the first manned orbital flight of the orbiter vehicle,\nnow scheduled for 1979. The two basic segments of the test program are component testing and\nmajor payload bay door test article (PBDTA) tests. Components will be qualified by the individual\ncomponent suppliers through analysis and testing. These tests are presently in process.\nThe PBDTA will integrate the payload bay door subsystems and must functionally verify, under\nsimulated on-orbit environmental conditions (zero gravity and thermal deformation), the latching\nand door drive actuation systems. Other significant tests will involve 1-g operation in both the\nhorizontal and vertical positions.\nThe test article will consist of a partial set of door assemblies, a simulated mid fuselage,\nenvironmental seals and thermal barriers, radiator panels, and latching/actuation mechanisms. The\ntest article is presently being fabricated, the test start date scheduled in early 1979.\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\n\xe2\x80\x99\n\nWhile the payload bay door mechanisms generally reflect conventional aircraft design, the\nunusual Shuttle applications and critical functions require remote \xe2\x80\x9czipper latching\xe2\x80\x9d of a large\nclamshell door on a \xe2\x80\x9cspace airplane\xe2\x80\x9d that operates in both 1-g and 0-g conditions. The challenge is\nto ensure that all critical conditions are thoroughly considered in design, development, testing, and\nimplementation.\n\nTABLE I - ELECTROMECHANICAL\nCOMPONENT COUNT\n~\n\nTABLE II\n\n- DESIGN\n\n-~\n\nComponent\n\nLOADS\n\nI\n\nMechanism\n\nDoors\n\nRadiator\n\nTotal\n\nPower drive units\n\n10\n\n6\n\n16\n\nRotary actuators\n\n12\n\n20\n\n32\n\nLatches\n\n32\n\n24\n\n56\n\nHinges\n\n26\n\n12\n\n38\n\nPassive fittings\n\n40\n\n4\n\n4\n4\n\nShafts\n\n52\n\n20\n\n72\n\nCouplings\n\n12\n\n52\n\n124\n\nSwitches\n\n68\n\n24\n\n92\n\nPush-pull rods\n\n36\n\n24\n\n60\n\nShaft support bearings\n\n84\n\n22\n\n106\n\nloading Considered\n\nFwd, Aft, &\nCenterline\nDoor Latch\n\nDoor\nDrive\n\n-\n\nRadiator\nlatch\n\nRadiator\nDrive\n\nFlight Phase\nAscent\nBoost\nOn orbit\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nOpeninglClosing on Orbit\nStall/jarn*\nSeal stiffnesdfriction\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9d\nThermal deflection\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCritical condition with regard t o strength\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9cCritical condition with regard io closure\n\n267\n\nX\n\nX\n\nDOOR MECHANISMS\no LONGITUDINAL\nCENTERLINE LATCHES\nI 6 REQUIRED)\n1\nFIXED\nCIRCUMFERENTIAL\nLATCHES I8 REQUIRED)\n8 SLIP\nCIRCUMFERENTIAL\nLATCHES I8 REQUIRED1\nDOOR ACTUATION\nLINKAGE 112 LOCATIONS)\n\n33.5 M I l l 0 FT) OF DOOR\nEDGE LATCHING\n\nRADIATOR\n\nS\n/ w r i i\n\ne LATCHES124 REQUIRED1\n\nI ,\n\nY\n\nR~DIATOR\nDEPLOY a LATCH\n\nACTUATION LINKAGE\nI8 LOCATIONS)\n\nFigure 2 - Configuration of Payload Bay\nDoor Mechanisms\n\nFigure 1 -Payload Bay DoorIRadiator\nSystem\n\nLEFT PAYLOAD BAY\nDOOR DRIVE\nLEFT RADIATOR\n\nPAYLOAD BAY\nDOOR HINGE\n\nSECTION A-A\n\nDOOR-CLOSED\nSWITCH\nMODULE ON\nBULKHEAD\n\nDRIVE LINKAGE\n\nCENTERLINE\nLATCHES\n\n/i.\n\n*RIGHT BULKHEAD\n\nA\n\nRIGHT PAYLOAD\nBAY DOOR DRIVE\nLEFT BULKHEAD\n\nPAYLOAD BAY\nDOOR H!NGE\n\nEN\n(6 PLACES1\n\nFigure 4\n\nFigure 3 - On-Orbit Payload Bay Door and\nRadiator OpenlClose Sequence\n\n136 PLACES1\n\n- Payload\n\nI PLACES1\n2\n\nBay Door Drive System\n\nTHERMAL BARRIER\\\n\n,PRESSURE SEAL\n\nGANGED LATCHES\nMOUNTED TO DOOR FRAME\nI\n\ni\nPRESSURE SEAL\nAFT BULKHEAD FRAME\n,THERMAL\nBARRIER\n/PRESSURE SEAL\nACTIVE LATC\nMECHANISM\n\n-\n\nLATCH NO. 1\nPASSIVE ROLLE\n\nFORWARD BULKHEAD FRAME\n\nFigure 5\n\nHINGE LINE CLOSEOUT\nHINGE LI~CLOSEOUT\n\nFigure 6 - Payload Bay Door\nEnvironmental Seals\n\n- Forward\n\nBulkhead Circular\nLatch System\n268\n\n*GANGED LATCHES (TYPICAL)\n\nPASSIVE ROLLER\nACTIVE LATCH MECHANISM\nACTUATOR I MOTOR\n2\nREADY-TO-LATC\nMODULE ON BU\nH I N Gb \\ #\nE 7\n\nGANGED LATCHES MOUNTED\nTO DOOR FRAME\n\nMANUAL\nDRIVE DETENT\n\nACTUATOR (2 MOTORS~\n\nFigure 8 - Payload Bay Door Centerline\nLatch System\n\nFigure 7 - A f t Bulkhead Circular Latch System\n\n4 LATCH PDU's 116 SWITCHES, 8 MOTORS)\n8 DEPLOYMENT GEAR BOXES\n12LATCH GEAR BOXES\n\nCLOSING ARC AT\nWORST KNOWN\nTHERMAL CONDITION\n\nRIGHT DOOR CATCH\nFllTlNG AT MAXIMUM\nVERTICAL DISPLACEMENT\nFOR SAFE CAPTURE-\n\nER DRIVE UNI\n\nNOMINAL DOOR\nCLOSING ARC\n\nSAFE LATCH ROLLER\nENGAGEMENT ENVELOPE\n(SHADE0 AREA) \\\n\nRY GEAR BOX\n\n,\n/\n\nLEFTDOOR\nLATCH HANGER\n\nTCH ROLLERS\n\nRIGHT DOOR LATCH\nFllTlNG AT MAXIMUM\nHORIZONTAL DISPLACEMENT\nFOR SAFE CAPTURE\n\nRADIATOR LATCHES (6 LATCHES PER PANEL)\n\nFigure 9 - Payload Bay Door Centerline\nEngagement and Latching\n\nIt-A\n\nI\n\n:\n\nI\n\nPAYLOADBAYDOORS\n\nI\n\nFigure 10 - Deployable Radiator Mechanisms\n\nFORWARD\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nFORWARD\n\nI\nAFT\n\nBULKHEAD\n\nBULKHEAD\n\nRELATIVE\nGAP\nCENTIMETERS\n(INCHES)\n\nASCENT\nIMECHANICAL)\n\nDESCENT\n(MECHANICAL\nAND THERMAL)\nOPEN\nCLOSE\n\nON ORBIT\n(THERMAL)\n\nOPEN\n\nCLOSE\n\nOPEN\n\n1.04\n10.41)\n\n0.74\n10.29)\n\n1.30\n(0.511\n\n1.63\n10.641\n\n0.23\n(0.09)\n\n0.91\n(0.36)\n\n1.70\n10.671\n\n22\n.3\n10.901\n\n1.12\n10.44)\n\n1.04\n10.411\n\nNO. 2\n\n1.09\n(0.431\n\nB\n\nI\n\nCLOSE\n\nA\n\nAFT MAXIMUM REACH\n3.63 CM (1.428 IN.)\nMAXIMUM REACH\n\\\n,\n3.39 CM (1.333 IN.)\n\nA n\n\n0.97\n10.38)\n\n5.1 CM (2.000 IN.)\n\nMAXIMUM REACH\n5.1 CM (2.000 IN.)\nI\n\nHINGE LINE\n\nFigure 12 - Bulkhead Latch Reach Capability\n\nFigure 11 - Centerline Maximum Deflections\n\n269\n\n"
