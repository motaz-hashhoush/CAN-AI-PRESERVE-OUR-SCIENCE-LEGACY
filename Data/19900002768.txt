The\nSESAC noted that although small-mission science strategies had\nbeen prepared by the Space Science Board\'s (SSB) Committee on\nSolar and Space Physics and Committee on Space Astronomy and\nAstrophysics, and by NASA\'s Solar System Exploration Committee\nfor their resper+;ve disciplines, a comparably detailed scientific strategy had not bet developed for NASA\'s earth science program. Following the SESAC recommendation, NASA\'s Office of Space Science\nand Applications asked the NRC\'s Space Science Board to conduct\na study that would evaluate the small missions concept for earth\nscience research.\nThe SSB\'s Committee on Earth qciences (CES) discussed the\nneed for writing such a report at its 1987 spring meeting. The committee proposed that the report determine the scientific rationale\nfor establishing a line of "Explorer-class" missions in the earth sciences, and address institutional and programmatic issues in devising\na comprehensive strategy.\nThe Space Science Board authorized the writing of this report\non May 1, 1987. In approving the study, the board noted it had\npreviously recommended that NASA not dilute the existing Explorer\n\n!\n\nvii\n\nPreceding\npageblank\n\n.,\n\na\n\nprogram with the addition of more disciplines, unless funding for\nthat program were substantially increased. As a result, the SSB\ndirected the committee to frame its arguments to support either\na separate small mission line for the earth sciences or a greatly\nexpanded Explorer line. With this caveat, the CES was charged with\nthe following tasks:\n1. Assess the need for establishing a line of small missions in\nthe earth sciences to achieve the goals and objectives outlined in the\nprevious CES report, A Strategy for Earth Science from Space, Parts\nI and II, and review other relevant reports as appropriate.\n2. Provide examples of potential missions.\n3. Define the role and scope of such a mission line, including\nthe levels of funding, launch rate, mission capabilities, and relation\nto other earth science missions and programs.\n4. Address related issues such as the impact on the earth science community and university programs, and federal interagency\nand international cooperatiop..\nThe CES began gathering information in October 1987 and developed the report during the winter/spring of 1988. The committee\nconsulted numerous scientific and technical colleagues in addition to\na variety of reports and journals. Appendix A lists those references.\nBefore the committee completed this study, the Office of Space\nScience and Applications (OSSA) published its first 5-year program\nstrategy. The OSSA strategy for the Earth Science and Applications\nDivision included plans to establish a program for a series of small\nmissions in the earth sciences, beginning in fiscal year 1990, ,:imilar\nto the one proposed in our report. Although the committee is encouraged by thiz important first step, we are well aware of the many\nhurdles that remain in bringing such a concept to fruition. The committee consequently forwards this report with the express intent of\nendorsing this preliminary action by NASA and to assist the agency\nin the successful realization of an effective--and permanent--Earth\nExplorer mission line.\nByron D.

To achieve this goal, the ccmpoilents\nsystem must be identified, their functions defined, and\nover all time scales understood.\nThe v.eed to predict\n\nchanges resulting from both natural and anthropogenic\ncauses, during periods as short as a decade and as long as a century, provides a\nformidable\nchallenge. A successful program for identifying,\nanalyzing, and predicting\nglobal change will require measuring\na number\nof ha,sic physical, chemical, and biological components\nof the Earth\'s\nsystem on a global scale with adequate temporal and geographical\nsampling.\nThe centerpiece of the Earth System Science initiative will be\na set of instruments\ncarried on polar-orbiting\nplatforms\nunder the\nEarth Observing System (Eos) program. The program involves collaboration\nby NASA with other national and international\nagencies.\nThe Eos instruments\nwill address many of the recommendations\nfor\nglobal measurements\nof important\nenvironmental\nlined in a previous Committee\non Ear;,h Sciences\n1\n\nvariables as out(CES) repert,\nA\n\n2\nStrategy for Earth Science from Space, Parts I and II.* The measurements\nare expected\nto contribute\nsignificantly\nto the International Geosphere-Biosphere\nProgram (IGBP) and NASA\'s Mission\nto Planet Earth initiative,\nand they will stimulate earth system science research during the next decade.\nThe coml,ittee\nendorses the Earth System Science initiative.\nHowever, in examining the current needs of the earth sciences in light\nof the former CES recommendations\nand in attempting\nto project\ncurrent trends into the next decade, the committee\nfinds several issues that require prompt attention.\nThese concerns focus on the\nadequacy of the proposed observations\nand on the overall vitality-in terms of innovation,\ntraining,\nand programmatic\nflexibility--in\nthe earth sciences community.\nAlthough a wide range of measurements can be taken by the planned Eos platforms, a number of other\nobservations\nidentified in the previous CES strategy and in other National Research Council and federal agency reports cannot be made\nfrom the platforms\nbecause of special orbit or sensor requirelaents.\nThese include high-resolution\nmeasurements\nof the g%bal gravity\nfield and its time variation; active microwave measurements\nof global\nprecipitation\nthroughout\nthe diurnal cycle, which requires a nonsynchronous orbit; and repeated observations\nof the Earth\'s magnetic\nfield with sufficient accuracy to allow the characterization\nof decadal\nvariations,\nwhich requires a magnetically\n"clean" satellite.\nThe altitude and inclination of the polar-orbiting\nEos platforms, together\nwith their sun-synchronous\norbits, will preclude such measurements,\nas well as a number of others discussed in the body of this report.\nPlans tc obtain some. of these data sets are included in proposed,\nbut unscheduled,\nmissions such as the Geopntential\nResear-h Mission, the Tropical Rainfall Measurement\nMission, and the Magnetic\nField Explorer.\nIn contrast to the Explorer program for astronomy\nand astrophysics\nand solar and space physics, however, NASA does\nnot currently\nhave the appropriate\nprogrammatic\nstructure\nfor impleraenting\nthese and other small and moderate-size\nearth science\nmissions.\nRecent evei:t., have under3eored our inability to maintain critical\ntime series measurements.\nA gap in ocean color observations,\nimportant to the area of biological oceanography\nfor the study of global biogeochemical cycles and the prediction of long-term climatic changes,\n*A complete llst cf references used in the preparation of this report is\nincluded in Appendix A.\n\nhasalready\noccurrediththetermination\nw\noftheCoastal\nZoneColor\nScannermeasurements Nimbus 7 in !986.Globalstratospheric\n"m\ntotal\nozonemeasurements\nwithhighspatial\nresolution,\ninstrumental\ninmonitoringherecurring\nt\nphenomenon ofstratospheric\nozonedepletion\nabovetheAntarctic, soonbecomeunavailable\nwill\nbecause\nno\nfirm plans have been made f_r a follow-on mission to the Nimbus 7\nTotal Ozone M ,)ping Spectrometer. A similar gap in the collection\nof data on the Earth\'s radiative exchanges of energy, indispensable\nto a better understanding of climatic processes and the "greenhouse\neffect, \xc2\xb0 is expected to occur at the end of the current Earth Radiation\nBudget Experiment.\nAlthough all of these instruments are planned for the Eos platforms, the potential lapse of such measurements during the first\nhalf of the 1996s will be extremely disruptive to global change research programs. Those programs rely on uninterrupted data flows\nto improve quantitative models of the earth system for identifying\nand simulating environmental trends. In addition, NASA\'s ability to\nmake specialized measurements of new or rapidly changing phenomena, such as ocean pollution and greenhouse gases, cont_.nues to be\nseverely limited.\nWith the growing capabilities of other nations to perform earth\nobservations from satellites, it is also important for NASA to maintain the flexibility for responding in a timely manner to opportunities\nfor international cooperation. Such a capability will be needed for a\ncomprehensive program in earth system science and, in particular,\nto fulfill the requirements of the IGBP and Mission to Planet Earth\ninitiatives.\nThe vitality of the space component of the earth sciences w_as\nestablished in part through a series of inexpensive Explorer missions\nfrom the late 1950s into t\'.le 1970s. Indeed, the Explorer program assured progress in many earth science disciplines throughout the early\nhistory of space exploration. It promoted frequent access to space,\nsupported missions of a specific or unique nature, provided a quick\nand flexible reaction capability, bridged the programmat,c gap between sounding rockets and major missions, presented more effective\nand diverse opportunities for international cooperation, and greatly\nenhanced the educational and training programs at our universities.\nUnfortunately, with the exception of research in solar-terrestrial processes, access to the Explorer program enjoyed by the earth science\ncommunity during the first two decades of the space age was lost\nby the early 1980s. Moreover, the ability to conduct small and\n\ni\n\n4\nmoderate-size\nmissions\noutsidehatprogramhasbeenseverely\nt\ncircumscribed\nasa greaterroportion\np\nofNAS&\'s earthscience\nbudget\nhasbeenallocated\ntolarger more complexmissions.\nat_d\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\nAn Earth Explorer program can open new vistas in the earth\nsciences, encourage innovation, and solve critical scientific problems.\nSpecific\nmissions\nmust be rigorously\nshapedby thedemandsaad opportunities\nofhigh-quality\nscience must complementtheEarth\nand\nObserving\nSystem and theMissionto PlanetEarth. Itistherefore\nessential\nthattheprogramfollow comprehensive\na\nstrategy\nfor\naccomphshing\nthese\ngoals.\nThe Committee on Earth Sciences recommends that a new Earth\nE_plorer mission series be funded at a level ti,at would allow the construction of two small missions per year, or one moderate mission evcry 8 years. Announcements of opportunity for such missions should\nbe divided according to two separate solicitations, one for missions\nand instruments costing less than $30 million and one for missions\nin the $30 million to $150 million range. The Eart\'a Explorer series\nshould be established e.s a level-of-effort program similar to the existing Explorer line, but managed -ntirely by NASA\'s Earth Science\nand Applications Division. Maintaining independent control over the\nprogramwill\nhelpensurethatitremains\nresponsive\ntotheneedsof\ntheearth\nsciences\ncommunityand will\nprevent\nthefurther\ndilution\nof\nan already\noversubscribed\nExplorer\np:ogramforastronomyand astrophysics, solar\nand\nand spacephysics. level\nThe\noffunding\nshould\nbe adequate\ntofly continuous\na\nseries\nofmissions\natan average\nrate\nofapproximately\noneperyear.\nThe traditional\nstrength\noftheexisting\nNASA Explorerine\nl has\nbeen easy,\nfrequent, inexpensive\nand\naccess\ntospace.The r_commendations\nthatfollow\naredesigned\ntoreturn\nsimilar\nopportunities\ntotheearthsciences.\n1. Each Earth Ezplorer mission should be sharply focused on\nsignificant scientific issues. A mission should explore import._nt\nscientific issues or fill in gaps that may arise in the collection of longterm data sets. The program could also provide the collateral benefit\nof advancing technology development in achieving its objectives. In\nany case, the missions should be justified by their own scientific\nmerit. The Earth Explorers should not be used for the engineering\n\nt\n\n[\n\nr\n\ndevelopment and flight testing cr instruments for large missions or\nplatfcrms.\n2. Prog*ammatic continuity and flexibility must be maintained.\nIn order for the recommended program to have a significant impact\non the earth sciences, it must be started with a clear e_pectation of\nmaintaining uninterrupted continuity. The program should also be\ndesigned for flexibility, both in choosing the most important scientific\nquestions to address and in allowing for reasonably wide variations\nin the scale of the missions. Rapid response times are necessary to\nreact in a timely manner to _udden changes in our environment, or\nto take advantage of opportunities to collaborate with other agencies\nor nations.\n3. Costs must be rigorously controlled in all phases of the program. The key to the success of the Earth Explorer program will\nbe to obtain the maximum scientific value per dollar expended The\nspiraling coots of instruments for observations from space can be\ncontrolled by sharply focusing the scientific objectives, by assigning\nprincipal investigators the prime resvonsibility for nuality and cost\ncontro\', and by carefully a_.ssi, g the tradeoff between reliability\nand multiple copies of instruments.\nStandard satellite buses and\nlaunch _ehicles should be used w_enever this is both scientifically\nand economically advantageous.\n4. Given the emphasis on strongly focused missions, the data\ntransmSasiol_ and processing activities are likely to be \'slat:rely roodest. Nevertheless, strict schedules and reliability requirements must\nbe met, and the data should be made available as ouickly as fossib!e to\nsci, ntific archives or to ope,_ network_ in scientific formats. Careful\nplanning and ezperiment_tion with the integration over networks of\ndata from diverse so=rces will be essential.\n5. A sig_tificant fiaction of the total costs for each mission should\nbe allocated to data analysis, interpretation, and reiated theoretical\nmodeling work. Because the scietific objectives fol any mission are\nachieved only after the da_a have be._n distributed and thoroughly\nanalyzed, adequate funding for this purpose is fundamental to the\nmi_iun\'s success. The committee strongly recomm_,_ds that the\nappropriate resource levels be ailocatc _, to the mission operations\nand data analysis budget to support such activities.\n6. A basic goal of the Earth Ez,,_o.\'erprogram must be to speed up\nthe conversion of cot, ccpts into satellite mission., and of raw data into\nscientific results. The time scales of the program must be designed\nto attract leading scientists and taleuted students, and to avoid the\n\n6\nmountingcosts\nofprotracted\nspaceprojects.\nTherefore\nitisessential\nthatthemissions laun,:hed\nbe\nwithin2 to3 yearsofacceptancef\no\nengineering\ndesign\nforthesmallest\nmissions, 3 to4 years\nand\nforthe\nmoderate-size\nones.\n7. The Earth Ezplor_r program must develop a selection process that encourages the beat ideas and does not require inordinate\ninvestments in engineering, de#ign during the initial proposal phase.\nTo achievehis\nt\nobjective selection\nt_.e\nprocess\nshould\nproceed\nintwo\nphases.Inthefirst\nphase,\nproposals\nshouldbe requested\nthatemphasizehescientific andtheinstrument\nt\nissues\nconcepts,\nwithonlya\nlimited\ndiscussion\nofengineering\nissues.\nInthesecond\nphase,\nonlythe\nmost promising\nconcepts\nshouldbe chosenforfurtherevelopment\nd\nand preliminary\ninstrumentesign\nd\ninordertocompeteina further\nselection\nprocess.\nThisapproach\nwill\nminimize\nthetotal\ncommunity\ninvestment in pre_axing proposals, and will make it attractive for\nscientists with good ideas but limited resources to compete in the\npreliminary phase of Earth Explorer selection. The overselection of\nmissions or instruments should be assiduously avoided.\n8. ]nteragency and international collaboration must be optimized. Collaboration with other agencieq and nations fosters the\ndevelopment of a stronger space science program at reduced cost to\nNASA. Every opportunity for cooperat!on in utilizing and financing\nEarth Explorer missions should be conside:ed.\nThe committee believes that the proposed Earth Explorer program provides a substantial opportunity for progress in the earth\nsciences, both through independent missions and through missions\ndesigned to complement the large-scale platforms and international\nresearch programs that represent important national commitments.\nThe strategy presented in this report is intended to help ensure the\ns,Tccess of the Earth Explorer program as a vital stimulant to the\nstudy of our planet.\n\nj\n\nr\n\n2\nEarth Science from Space\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe U.S. space program began with the launch of an earth science mission in February 1958. Explorer 1 carried a Geiger counter\ninto space and discovered the Van Allen radiation belts. Two months\nlater the 4-kg Vanguard 1 provided new information about the shape\nof the Earth. This improved geodesy suggested convection currents\nin the Earth\'s mantle and was later incorporated in the theory of\nplate tectonics. The following year, Explorer 6 transmitted the first\npictures of clouds taken from space. By 1963, nineteen Explorers, as\nwell as many satellites bearing other names, had been launched.\nMore than half of the early Explorer missions wzre devoted to\nEarth observation, the others to measuring the solar wind and other\nextraterrestrial\nstudies. Only five of the first nineteen Explorers\nexceeded 50 kg in total weight.\nFrom these beginnings, a powerful spaceborne capability has\ngrown for observing the Earth\'s gravity and magnetic fields, its\natmosphere, land surface, and oceans. A wide variety of imaging systems has been developed, ranging from the visible to the microwave\nportions of the spectrum. Microwave altimeters have significantly improved our knowledge of the Earth\'s gravity field over the oceans and\nprovided new insights into the structure and dynamic mechanisms\nt\n\n7\n\nI\nI\n\n8\nof the ocean floor. Visible and near-infared imagery is essential for\nweather forecasting, and the same data have opened up new methods for the study of ocean processes and the estimation of living\nmarine resources. Images of the land surface obtained from space\nhave revealed detailed aspects of surface composition and geological features. Precise measurements of the distances between points\nthousands of kilometers apart are now possible using satellite laser\nranging and radio interferometry. The opportunity is thus at band\nto map the exposed surface of the continents at a resolution sufficient\nto define their nature and monitor their evolution, and to measure\ndirectly the relative motions of the Earth\'s tectonic plates on time\nscales of a few years.\nInfrared and microwave satellite sensor3 are now used routinely\nto deduce vertical temperature profiles throughout the global atmosphere. Techniques have also been developed for measuring from\nspace the concentrations of many important trace gases in the atmosFhere and their variations with altitude. It is now possible to make\nprecise measurements of surface elevation of the oceans, land, and\nice masses from Earth orbit. The Earth\'s gravitational and magnetic\nfields can be determined for scales that range from global down to\nwavelengths comparable to the spacecraft altitude. Wind velocity at\nthe surface of the ocean can be inferred from measurements of scattered radiation. The ability to measure sea surface elevation, wind\nstress over the ocean, and marine gravity will produce data that\nare essential to drive and to test computer models of the circulation\nof the world\'s ocean. Improvements in ocean models are needed to\nunderstand the poleward transport of heat, the distribution of sediments, and the exchange of gases between the ocean and atmosphere.\nIn conjunction with space-based observations of the temperature and\ncolor, these measurements will also lead to better understanding of\nbiological productivity, which in many cases is limited by the upwelling of nutrients from the deep ocean to the surface.\nSCIENTIFIC STRATEGY FOR THE EARTH SCIENCES\nThe classical disciplines of geology, geophysics, meteorology,\noceanography, biology, and chemistry are becoming increasingly integrated within the earth sciences. For example, the processes that\nmaintain stratospheric ozone levels involve radiative transfer, aerosol\nphysics, photochemistry, and atmospheric dynamics, and are affected\nby human production of certain synthetic substanc\xc2\xa2s. Significantly\n\n|\n\nreduced ozone levels would affect biological communities both on\nland and in the ocean by allowing more ultraviolet radiation to reach\nEarth\'s surface.\nObservations of the global climate changes that are taking place\nas a result of fossil fuel burning and other industrial activities provide\nanother\nexampleofthis\nintegraLion. climatic\nThe\nchangesresulting\nfromhuman activities\noverthenext100yearsmay be largerhan\nt\nany naturally\noccurring\nchanges\ntheEarthhasexperienced\noverthe\nlastmillion\nyearsor more, dependingon therateof increasef\no\ngreenhouseases.hisrate\ng\nT\nofincrease be controlled complex\nwill\nby\ninteractions\nbetweensocioeconomic\nforces,\ngeological\nproductionf\no\ncarbondioxide, uptakeofcarbondioxide\nand\nand otherindustrial\ngases geochemical\nby\nandbiological\nprocesses.\nInan agewhen human\nactivities\narechangingthe global\nenvironment an increasingly\nat\nrapid\npace, strong\na\ninteraction\nbetweenscientific\ndiscoveries\nabout\ntheEarthandtheevolution\nofpublic\npolicysveryimportant.\ni\nIn addition contributing an increasing\nto\nto\nawarene3s the\nof\nclose\nties\nbetweenthe subdisciplines\nwithinearthsciences,\nspace\nobservations\nhaveprovided\nhumanity\nwitha globalerspective\np\nofthe\nEarthasa self-contained\nphysical,\nchemical, biological\nand\nsystem.\nPhenomena oncebelievedobe local,\nt\nsuchasthecyclical Nifio\nEl\nwarmwatercurrent\nintheeastern\nPacific\nOcean,arenow known to\nbe parts\nofpatterns\ndeveloping a globalcale.\non\ns\nOne response\ntothese\nchangeshasbeentheevolution new\nofa\ninterdisciplinary\napproach\ncalled\nearth\nsystemscience,\nwhichinvestigates\ntheconnections\namong components\ninthesystem.\nThe classical\nmethod ofisolating\nindividual\ncomponents\nfordetailed\nanalysis\nwill\nremainvital,\nbutcannotaddress\nthecomplexinteractions\namong the\nmany componentsthatmake up theEarth.As this\nrevolution\nhas\nspread\nthroughtheearth\nsciences\ncommunity,\nplans\nhaveevolved\nto\nstudyour planetfrom a global\nperspective. First\nThe\nGlobalAtmospheric\nResearch\nProgram Experiment 1979was a successful\nin\ninitial\nattempt\ntocharacterize\ntheatmosphere\nwithgreatly\nenhanced\nmeasurementcapabilities\nfromships,\nbuoys,\nand satellites.\nToday,theglobal\nemphasis\nisapparent\nina number ofstudies,\nsuchastheInternational\nLithosphere\nProgram,theGlobalTropospheric\nChemistryProgram,the JointGlobalOcean Flux Study,\nand theWorld ClimateResearch\nProgram.The latter\nincludes\nunder its\nauspicesheTropicalceansGlobalAtmosl;here\nt\nO\nProgram,\nthe World Ocean Circulation\nExperiment,heInternational\nt\nSatelliteloudClimatologyroject,\nC\nP\nandtheInternational\nSatellite\nLand\n\n10\nSurface Climatology Project. All of these research programs rely\nextensively on spacecraft measurements.\nPreparations are now being made by a special committee of the\nInternational Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU) to initiate the most\nambitious global study of all, the International Geosphere-Biosphere\nProgram (IGBP). The objective of this program, as set forth by\nthe ICSU General Assembly, is _to describe and understand the\nphysical, chemical and biological processes that regulate the total\nEarth system, the unique environment that it provides for life, the\nchanges that are occurring in this system and the manner in which\nthey are influenced by human actions." The IGBP will take at least\na decade to begin answering these questions and will require the\ncooperation of practically all countries to achieve success. Again, the\nprincipal tools needed to carry out this massive study will be a broad\narray of research and operational spacecraft in a variety of orbits and\naltitudes, as well as sophisticated data management capabilities to\nhandle the vast quantities of scientific information.\nOver the past few years a number of National Research Council\nand federal agency reports have examined the scientific and programmatic issues of earth system science. The Committee on Earth\nSciences (CES) published A Strategy for Earth Scie,ce from Space in\ntwo parts, the first dealing with the solid earth and oceans (1982) and\nthe second regarding the atmosphere and interactions with the solid\nearth, oceans, and biota (1985). The stated goals were as follows:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 to determine the composition, structure, and dynamics of\nthe solid planet, its oceans and atmosphere, and the surrounding\nenvelope of charged particles and fields;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 to characterize the systems o_ living organisms and their interactions with their environment;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 to understand the processes by which the Earth formed as a\nplanet and evolved to its present state;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 tc determine the atmospheric distribut;.ons and cycles of\nmass, energy, momentum, water vapor, and chemical constituents\nimportant to the climate and to the ma..intenance of life;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 to understand the physical and chemical dynamics of the\natmosphere and its intera_:tions with the land, ice caps, oceans, and\nbiota; and\n\xe2\x80\xa2 to understand the evolution of the atmosphere to its present\nstate and to predict its future evolution on time scales of less than\n100 years, including the effects of anthropogenic and natural perturbations.\n\n11\nThe CES strategy\'s andrelated\ngoals\nscientific\nobjectives\nfigured\nprominently\ninthewriting\nofsubsequent\nreports,\nincluding\ntwoofthe\nmostrecent\nonesintheglob_,arth\ne\nsciences,\nMission\ntoPlanet\nEarth\nand Earth System Science: A Frogram for Global Change, both published in 1988. Mission to Planet Earth is part of the Space Science\nBoard study, Space Science in the Twenty-first Century. It takes the\nbroadest perspective by considering the scientific objectives for the\nsystematic study of the planet from its center to the outer reaches\nof the atmosphere. In order to address this comprehensive scope of\nscientific research, Mission to Planet Earth calls for a satellite-based\nobserving system composed of five geostationary satellites, a set of\ntwo to six polar-orbiting platforms, and a series of special missions\nthat require other orbits.\nThe other report, Earth System Science: A Program for Global\nChange, by NASA\'s Earth System Science Committee (ESSC), lays\nout a global strategy that U.S. agencies should follow to advance\nearth science research during the coming decades. The report\'s\nobjective "to obtain a scientific understanding of the entire Earth\nsystem on a global scale by describing how its component parts and\ntheir interactions have evolved, how they function, and how they\nmay be expected to evolve on all time scales," closely parallels the\ngoals of the M_.ssion to Planet Earth and the IGBP. The report also\nemphasizes the importance of maintaining a diverse space program\nand developing new instruments and techniques. Toward this end\nthe ESSC recommends the establishment of two new initiatives by\nNASA: the Earth Observing System (Eos) polar-orbiting platforms\nand a complementary Earth System Explorer series of research missions.\n\nTHE NEED I_OR EARTH EXPLORER MISSIONS\nIN CLOBAL EARTH SCIENCES\nThe centerpiece of the earth science program that NASA has\nproposed for the mid-1990s on is the Earth Observing System. Eos\nwill consist of several major satellite observatories in polar orbits. By\ncarrying many sensors, each observatory will combine the functions\nnow performed by a number of separate satellites. This integrated\napproach is expected to strengthen interdisciplinary research and\ninternational cooperation in the earth sciences.\nNot all earth science objectives, however, can be achieved with\ninstruments on the Eos observatories. Some mis3ions require unique\n\nt\n\nl\n\ni\ni\nl\n\n12\norbits or for other reasons do not fit into the Eos configurat{on.\nExamples that are discussed later in this report are the mea_.,\'ements that could be made by the proposed Geopotential Research\nMission,\ntheTropical\nRainfall\nMission,\ntheMagnetic\nField\nExplorer,\nand a number ofotherverysmallmissions instruments.\nor\nThey\nnecessitate additional flexibility in the space program to provide a\nwider variety of access to space. Although these types of missions\nhave been endorsed scientifically and programmatically in previous\nreports, they have not been implemented.\nThe past successes of NASA\'s earth science program were\nfounded on a broad spectrum of opportunities for research. Aircraft,\nballoons, shuttle flights, and small, modest satellite missions have all\nplayed important roles in complementing the data acquired by larger\nobservatories.\nIn recent years, the small and moderate-size earth\nscience missions have nearly disappeared from the space program-a dramatic reversal from the 1960s, when the Explorer series was\nlaunching about four satellites a year, many devoted to earth science\nmissions. The current NASA policy is to restrict proposals submitted to the existing Explorer program to the "traditional" Explorer\nfieilds of space physics and astronomy. Without the availability of a\nprogrammatic ._,tructure in which to initiate small and r_oderate-size\nmi,_sions the opportunities for earth science payloads have become\nseverely restricted.\nThis situation will continue into the Eos era\nunless corrective action is taken.\nThere are several advantaEes to small missions. They present a\ngre_ter variety of access to space. They provide vehicles for incremental testing of technology and scientific ideas. And they typically\ninvolve less concept-to-launch time, less system integration, and less\nengineering\noverhead\nthanlarge\nmissions.\nThe rapidappearance\noftheAntarcticzoneholeinthelate\no\n1970shas demonstrated\ntheneedforrapidresponseso emerging\nt\nconcerns\nabout the global\nenvironmental\nchangesthataretaking\nplace.In the caseof theAntarcticzonedepletion\no\nitwas fortunatethatan appropriate\ninstrumentas available observe\nw\nto\nthe\nphenomenon.Thisw_s trueonlybecause\noftheunexpectedly\nlong\nuseful oftheTotalOzone Mapping Spectrometer\nlife\n(TOMS} instrumenton theNimbus 7 satellite. a gap intheseessential\nYet\nozone measurements will occur unless immediate steps are taken to\nfly another TOMS.\nFurthermore, with the growing capabilities of other nations in\n\ni\n\n13\nEarth observations, it is important that NASA maintain the flexibility to respond in a timely way to opportunities for international cooperation. The capacity to react to such opportunities is mandatory\nfor a comprehensive program in the earth sciences and, in particular,\nto satisfy the requirements of the Mission to Planet Earth and the\nIGBP.\nIt is not clear that economies of scale necessarily favor large\nmissions. For several instruments to share the same power, communications, and other utilities on a common platform appears sensible,\nbut one adverse effect is to _makethe investment in these platforms\nvery large. With large investments comes a need for designs that\nminimize the risk of failure, which further increases the costs. But\nwith smaller missions, the risks associated with a failure are more\nmodest, and the cost/risk spiral can be avoided.\nThe 1985 CES strategy stated that "the present frequency and\nmix of space flights are not adequate to maintain a vigorous, productive program in earth sciences." The Space Science Board\'s Committee on Space Astronomy and Astrophysics expressed a similar\nconcern the following year in it_,_eport, The Ezplorer Program for Asr\ntronomy and Astrophysics: "Small (initially) high-risk experiments\nmay have been crowded from the market of ali space opportunities.\nConsiderable improvement would follow naturally from a greater\nfrequency of flight opportunities."\nThe U.S. space science program has benefited from the combined\nefforts of scientists in government agencies, in industry, and in university laboratories. The Explorer program has been of particular\nimportance to space research conducted at universities. It has provided frequent opportunities for fundamental work at the forefront of\nearth and space science. Because of the comparatively short development and flight cycles of Explorer missions, students have been able\nto participate in all phases, from conceptual design to development,\nimplementation, and scientific interpretation of data from individual\nspace missions. Involvement with several phases of the full mission\ncontributes to the student\'s development, leading, in the long run, to\na pool of trained scientists and engineers for the space program. The\nlead time for most space missions has grown to at least 10 years from\nconcept to launch. Yet graduation, promotion, and tenure within a\nuniversity require productivity early in a career, making such long\ndelays professionally unacceptable.\nIn the earth sciences, lack of access to space is now acutely and\nwidely felt. It may lead to the discouragement of young scientists,\n\nl\n\n8\n\n14\ntheinability attract\nto\nthemost creative\nstudentsothediscipline,\nt\nand theeventual\nfailure\nofthenation\ntoproducefuture\ngenerations\nofskilled\nspacescientists _igineers.\nand\nA related\neffect the long-lead,\nof\nbig-science\nstructure\nisthe\nboom-and-bust\ncycle\nitpromotesinindividual\ndisciplines. exThe\ncitement\nofdiscovery\nthataccompanies successful\na\nmajormission\nmay be followed years\nby\nofwaiting the13gical\nfor\nfollow-on\nmission.\nA strategy\nthatprovidesorfrequent\nf\naccess\ntospace,\nand thatdoes\nnotrely bigmissionsothetotal\non\nt\nexclusion\nofsmall\nones,\nwill\nbe\nmuch more effective productive.\nsad\nThe needfor\nfrequent,\nlow-andmoderate-cost\nspace\nexperiments\nin the earth sciences is undeniable. The committee th,_refore recommends that NASA create a separate Earth Ezplorer line within the\nEarth Science and Applications Division _udget, beginning in fiscal\nyear 1990. In the chapters that follow, the committee looks at past\nand prospective Explorer-class missions in the earth sciences and\nproposes a strategy for an effective program.\n\n[\n\nl\n\n3\nThe Earth Explorer Program\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe Earth Observing System (Eos) will be the centerpiece of the\nglobal program for observing the Earth, as discussed in the previous\nchapter. The system, comprising three to six large polar-orbiting\nplatforms, will carry an elaborate suite of coordinated instruments,\nfeeding data to an extensive network of sophisticated data processing\nand distribution systems. There is, however, a critical need for many\nglobal measurements of the atmosphere, solid earth, and oceans\nthat cannot be made either effectively or at all by Eos, but that\ncould be accomplished by an Earth Explorer series of missions. The\nEarth Explorer program would provide access to space for low-cost\nspacecraft that require different orbital altitudes or inclinations from\nthose provided by the proposed polar and geosynchronous platforms.\nIn addition, the program would (1) provide the capability to respond\nrapidly and flexibly to evolving environmentai problems, or to new\nscientific or technological developments; (2) preserve continuity in\nthe monitoring of important phenomena with variations Gn rapid or\nunknown timescales; and (3) foster opportul, ities for sharing costs\nwith other space agencies.\n15\n\n....\n\n-\n\n16\nPAST MISSIONS\n\nThe earliest Explorer missions opened up entirely new, exciting\nfields in the earth sciences while bringing th_ nation to the forefront\nof space science. Of the Explorer spacecraft built and launched in the\npast 30 years, 44 out of 78 were devoted primarily to earth science\nobjectives (see T_ble 3.1). Significant _ccomplishments from these\nmissions have :n:luded the following:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 taking of the first pictures cf _he Earth and its atmosphere, a\ncapability that has subsequently vastly expanded our understanding\nof weather systems, the biology and geography of the Earth\'s surface,\nand geological processes;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 determination of the inhomogeneovs distribution of mass m\nthe Earth;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 measurement of the density and composition of the upper\natmosphere and ionosphere;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 measurement of incoming solar radiation at the top of the\nal;mosphere; and\n\xe2\x80\xa2 discovery of the Van Allen radiation belts.\n\nThe current\nlack\nofExplorer\nsatellites\ndevotedtoearth\nscience\nmeasurements\ninno way reflects absence\nan\nofoutstanding\nca:ndidatesforsuch a class missions.\nof\nThere aremany examplesof\ninexpensive,\nspecialized,\nandextremelyuccessful\ns\nsatellites\nfromthe\npastfewdecades\nthatdemonstratehekindofscience\nt\nthatmay be\njeopardized\ninthefuture\nunlessn EarthExplorer isestablished.\na\nline\nFormany oftheses,_tellites,\ntherequirements\nforaltitude,\ninclination, groundtracks\nor\nwere so specific to preclude\nas\nflight\non\nmultiuse\nplatform.c, others,\nF r\nthemission\ncouldhavebeenaccomplished a spaceplatform;\non\nhowever,ithout\nw\nthefrequent,\nlow-cost\naccess to space afforded by a sm_.ll i:._ssions program, it is questionable whether the instrumentation or its associated scientific discipline\nwould have ever matured to the point of being a contender for space\non Eos. These points ca.l be demonstrated best by re:iewing some\nof the past earth science satellites that were not launched under the\nExplorer program, but that nevertheless represent the kinds of missions that could be flown in the future under a new Ealth Explorer\nline.\n\nf\n\n17\nTABLE\n\nExplorer\n\n3.1 PAST\n\nNo.\n\nEXPLORER\n\nMISSIONS\n\nDate\n\nMission\n\nObjective\n\n1\n\n1958\n\n2\n3\n4\n5\nS1\n6\n\n1958\n1958\n1958\n1958\nJ.959\n1959\n\n7\nS-46\n8\n\n1959\n1960\n1960\n\nS-56\n9\n\n1960\n1961\n\nS-45\n10\n11\nS-45a\n\n1961\n1961\n1961\n1961\n\nS-55\n\n1961\n\n12\n\n1961\n\n13\n14\n15\n\n1961\n1962\n1962\n\nl6\n17\n\n1962\n1963\n\n18\n\n1963\n\n19\nS-66\n\n1963\n1964\n\n20\n21\n22\n23\n\n1964\n1964\n1964\n1964\n\n*Designed to obtain data on cosmic rays,\nmeteoroids,and\norbital temperatures;\ndiscovered Van\nAllen Belts\n*Follow-on to Explorer 1 - failed to orbit\nCosmic ray/flight\ntest\n*Measurement\nof radiation belts\n*Foilow-_n to _xplorer 4 - failed to orbit\n*Study of energetic particles - failed to orbit\n*First TV picture of Earth, cloud cover;

It was launched in 1976 at a cost of approximately\n$6 million*\ninto an orbit with a height of about 6000 km and an inclination of\n109.8 \xc2\xb0. Its operational\nlifetime is estimated at several million years.\nThe satellite is a sphere, 60 cm in diameter, having a mass of about\n407 kg, and is covered with 422 corner reflectors of fused silica and 4\nof germanium.\nThe reflectors allow ground-based\n\'asers to track the\nvosition of the satellite with centimeter accuracy.\nData from laser ranging to this satellite have contributed\nmore\ninformation\non solid earth geodynamics\nthan have the data obtained\nfrom all of the previous satellites.\nThey have provided the most\naccurate model of the long-wavelength\ncomponents\nof the Earth\'s\ngravitational\nfield, which in turn has significantly enhanced our ability to determine\nthe positions of all other artificial Earth orbiters.\nThe orbit of LAGEOS is known so precisely that laser ranging to the\nsatellite can be used to refine the positions of the tracking stations\nin geocentric coordinates\nwith accuracies approaching\n1 cm, and to\ncalculate motion of the tracking stations due to tectonic deformation, changes in the length of day, and changes in the position of\nthe pole. Knowledge of those changes has been improved by factors of 10 to 100, making possible studies of the global geophysical\nprocesses influencing these variables, such as postglacial\nrebound,\nelectromagnetic\ncoupling between the core and mantle, and angular\nmomentum exchange between the atmosphere\nand solid earth. Some\nof the exciting results from LAGEOS measurements\nare contained\nin the 1985 special issue of the Journal of Geophysical Research on\nLAGEOS.\nThe immense success of LAGEOS has led to the development\nof at least one additional,\nidentical satellite.\nLAGEOS-II\nis being\nbuilt in cooperation\nwith the Italian space agency at a cost of $3\nmillion to NASA and is expected\nto be launched\nin 1991 into a\nsimilar high-altitude\norbit, but with lower inclination\n(51\xc2\xb0).

Although some geodynamic\npositioning\nmay be accomplishedinthefuturefrom a space platform,\n\n!\n:\n\ni\n\n21\ntwo facts relevant to the merits of an Earth Explorer program must\nbe kept in mind. First, the feasibility of laser positioning from space\nmight never have been demonstrated without the opportunity for\nlow-cost access to space available for LAGEOS. Second, LAGEOS\nwas successful only because it was launched into such a high, stable\norbit that the lack of an adequate gravity field model for the Earth\natshorter\nwave!_ngths\ndidnotinterfere\nwiththeability\ntoprovide\nabsolute positioning.\n\nMagsat\nThe Magsat mission produced the first high-resolution global\nmaps of the Earth\'s magnetic field. The $39 million satellite measured the vector components of the planet\'s magnetic field at the\nheight of the satellite with an accuracy of 6 nanoTesla (about 0.01\npercent of the total field). It was placed in a sun-synchronous orbit at\nan inclination of 96.76 \xc2\xb0 and an altitude that varied from 350 to 550\nkm. The satellite\'s projection onto the surface of the Earth passed\nwithin 300 km of every location (except for two polar caps with radius of 450 km or 4\xc2\xb0) more often than once a week. The magnetic\nfield vector components were each sampled at a maximum rate of 16\ntimes per second, and the satellite was operational during the period October 1979 through July 1980. The accuracy and distribution\nof the samples allowed calculation of the spatial variability of the\nmagnetic field with wavelengths as short as 800 km on the Earth\'s\nsurface. The global maps of the Earth\'s magnetic field provided by\nMagsat exceeded prelaunch expectations, with the main field defined\nto better than 20 nanoTesla.\nOne other database for satellite measurements of the Earth\'s\nmagnetic field was provided by the Orbiting Geophysical Observatory\n(OGO) during a period of several years in the late 1960s. These data\nwere total intensities only, without vector components, and were\nmathematically insufficient to determine the magnetic field in the\nregion where they were obtained. Except for these satellite data the\nmaps of the magnetic field before Magsat were based on information\nfrom a worldwide network of about 200 magnetic observatories at\nthe Earth\'s surface, but the observatories were not well distributed.\nFor example, no data were available from within a 10,000-km-wide\ngap in the South Pacific. As a result, data from the observatories\nwere of limited use for global studies.\n\n10\'e\n\ni\n\ni\n\nn\n\ni\n\n_\n\n,\nn\n\n:\n\n_\n\n1\n\nR. = I. + lJ_:ollg m)\' + Ihnm)z]\n\n\xc2\xae\n1O_\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n10\'\n\n_\nO\n\n10\'\n\n.jSURFACE\n\nOF\n\n10"\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\\"\n\n10"\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n,o\'\nt\n,,.\n\n10u\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n_\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\\\n\n,0,,\na\n\nEARTH\n\n\\\n\nO\n\niS"\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n:)\n\n_\n\n/\n\n_\n\nCORE-MANTLE\nBOUNDARY\n\na-\n\nO\n\n_\n_\n\n.\n\n_,L_\n\ni\nO\n\n_ \\\n\nU\n\nlo\'\n\n10_\nE\n\nlo\'\n\nRn = 1.349 x 10 t (0.270)n(nT)\n\n_\n\n10\'\n\n10a\n\n-\\lo\n\n._\n" CRUST:\n\n_.__\n__\nRn = 37,1\n\n10.174) n (nT) j\n\nrt\n\nFIGURE 3.1 The mean-square value of the geomagnetic field the nth\nof\nharmonicdegreeat the surface the Earth and at the core-mantleoundary,\nof\nb\nobtainedfrom Magsat data.

A sample of these results is provided in Figure\n3 1. The observations of the core\'s field enabled studies of the motion\nof the fluids in the core and the electrical conductivity of the lower\nmantle, while the observations of the crust showed strong fields near\nYellowstone, the Rio Grande rift, and some previously unnoticed\nanomalies interpreted as undiscovered rifts in other continents. The\nMagsat data also made possible the measurement of the small-scale\nmagnetic fields near magnetic observatories. Corrections for these\nlocal biases made old observatory data more useful for studies of the\ncore field as it existed one or two centuries ago.\nMagsat is an excellent example of the type of scientific mission\nthat could not have been performed from a space platform and that\nmay never be followed up without an Earth Explorer line. Resolving\nthe high-frequency components of the crustal field requires an orbital\naltitude below 450 km, a level that does not allow sufficient mission\nduration for a major space platform. In addition, the magnetometer\nsensor must be far removed from the local field induced by space\nhardware in order to measure variations in the Earth\'s field. Frequent\nmagnetic missions or those of long duration will be required in the\nfuture for monitoring temporal variations of the core field, which\nis efficiently measured from space. Therefore, without provision\nfor launching such magnetometers, prospects are dim for significant\nadvancement in our understanding of the Earth\'s magnetic field.\nNirnbus Sertes\nThe series oe seven Nimbus satellites, launched between 1964 and\n1978, demonstrated the great scientific and technologir,\' progress\nthat follows from the flight of a series of similar sate,. _\nThe\nprogram provided the first global observations of many important\nprocesses. Examples include observations of the time variation of\ntemperature, (._one, and water vapor in the atmosphere and stratosphere; the extent of ice in the Arctic and Antarctic as well as a\nbasic description of ice types; the variability of ultraviolet light from\nthe Sun; the distribution of chlorophyll in the oceans and the relationship of marine phytoplankton to oceanic conditions; and the\ndistribution of sea surface temperature.

Each operatedin a\nf\n\n25\nsun-synchronous orbit at an altitude near 1100 kin, except for the\nfirst. The use, however, of similar satellite structures, control systems,\nand data systems led to reductions of cost compared with other\nsatellite systems of similar complexity. In addition, the inheritance\nof designs and hardware led to remarkably long-lived satellites, many\nof which substantially outperformed their design life.\nThere are several characteristics of the Nimbus satellites that\nare relevant in the Earth Explorer context. They demonstrated the\nvalue of small satellites, performing high-quality science, to the development of instruments for o_erational status. They also offered\nuniversity scientists and graduate students unique research opportunities, bringing the United States to the forefront of those disciplinary\nareas. Finally, they provided useful experience in the production of\nstandardized spacecraft and technological inheritance. The committee would like to emphasize, however, that the Earth Explorer\nprogram should not become a vehicle for establishing a long-term\nseries of missions whose sole purpose would be to continue one set of\nrepetitive measurements. Such a function must be performed by the\noperational agencies in the United States and abroad.\nRadar Altimet,ers: GEOS-3, Seasat, and Geosat\nThe goal of the radar altimeter missions in the 1970s was to improve our knowledge of Earth\'s gravitational fieJd: *_hemarine geoicl,\nsea state, ocean currents, crustal structure, solid earth dynamics, and\nremote sensing technology. The $96 million GEOS-3 was launched\ninto an orbit with an inclination of 115\xc2\xb0 and a height of 844 km. It\ncarried a new advanced radar altimeter, radio tracking systems, and\ncorner reflectors to allow tracking of the satellite b:,, ground-based\nlasers. Data from the radar altimeter and tracking systems were\nused to map the marine geoid with an accuracy of a few meters and\na precision of a few tens of centimeters in areas where the satellite\nwas within sight of fixed or mobile telemetry stations. No d,_ta were\nstored onboard the satellite. In addition, data from the altimeter\nwere used for mapping ocean wave height and ocean surface wind\nspeeds.\nThe information provided by GEOS-3 made important contributions to our knowledge of the marine geoid, I_articularly in the\nnorthwest Atlantic and parts of the Pacific Ocean where the grid of\naltimeter observations is most dense. The most notable contributions were determinations of the strength of the oceanic lithosphere\n\nt\n\n26\nat a number of locations, the first direct observations of the slope of\nsea level due to strong ocean currents, and global maps of monthly\naveraged wave height. A special issue of the Journal of Geophysical\nResearch (GEOS-3, 1979) contains numerocs research papers based\non GEOS-3 data.\nThe immense success "ffGEOS-3 led immediately to a subsequent\nmission, Seasat, which incorporated a more precise altimeter. At a\ncost of $174 million, the satellite returned a wealth of new data on\nthe geoid, wave height, wind speed, and water vapor content over\nthe oceans despite the mission\'s premature termination following\na mechanical failure. Differences of sea surface height measured\nover repeat tracks provided the first view of the time-dependent\nseasurfaceomponentsdue to dynamicoceanographic\nc\neffects.\nAs\na result\noftheSeasat\nand GEOS-3 altimeters,\nearthscientists\nwere\nable to know the marine geoid better than the bathymetry in many\nregions, particularly in the South Atlantic, South Pacific, and Indian\noceans.\nTectonophysicists capitalized on this information to study the\nmechanical properties of the lithosphere, the thermal structure of\nplates, the dynamics of midocean ridges, and the scales and patterns\nof mantle convection. The geoid was used to predict the location of\nuncharted seamounts, revise the coordinates of mislocated bathymettic features, and trace the position of fracture zones for plate reconstructions. Some of the scientific payoff from Seasat is contained in\nseveral special issues of the Journal of Geophysical Research (Seasat\nI, 1982; Seasat II, 1983; Origin and Evolution of Seamounts, !984),\nand this data set continues to be used ir, many studies.\nRadar altimeter missions are an outstanding example of how the\nscientific benefits of a mission can be maximized by having complete\ncontrol over the orbit for an individual sensor package. In the case\nof Seasat, part of the mission was designed to provide repeat ground\ntracks for viewing the time-dependent sea surface elevation, whereas\nduring the rest of the mission the altimeter covered new ground to\nprovide finer resolution in the determination of the time-independent\ngeoid.\nThe committee notes, however, that Seasat was much larger,\nmore complex, and more expensive than any Explorer-class mission.\nThe Geosat radar altimeter program, which builds upon the Seasat\nmission, is a simple $45 million spacecraft that operates in the special\nSeasat orbit. See Figure 3.3 for an example of comparative data\nfrom the Seasat and Geosat missions. This satellite, like GEOS-3,\n\nj\ni\ni\n\ni\n\n27\n\nP\n\nFIGURE\n3.3\nThis figure shows the g;_ hal mesoscale\n(50 to I000 km) sea level\nvariability\nfrom the Geosat\nr.nd Seasat altimeter\nmeasurements.\nThe lower\nfigure provides\nan estimate\nof the root-mean-square\n(rms) variability\nderived\nfrom Seasat from September\n!5 to October\n10_ 1978.

Although\nan altimeter\nis scheduled for Eos, the flexibility in orbit design afforded in the\nprevious missions will be sacrificed for the sake of mounting\nthe\ninstrument\non a multipurpose,\nsun-synchronous\nplatform with a fixed\n5-day repeat. Thus the Eos altimeter wiI1 do little to fill in the 100-kin\ngaps in the marine geoid remaining after Seasat\'s untimely demise,\nor that remain even with Geosat data.\n\nEarth RadiationBudget Experiment\nThe Earth Rad\'ation\nBudget Experiment\n(ERBE) was designed\nto measure the energy exchange of the Earth with the Sun and\nspace as precisely as \'_ossible.\nAccurate\nknowledge of the radiative exchange of energy between the Earth and its environment\nand\nunderstanding\nof the processes that control that exchange are necessary prerequisites\nto reliable predictions\nof the effect of increased\ngreenhouse\ngases on the energy balance of the Earth.\nThe radiation exchange is particularly\nimportant\nfor understanding\nthe role of\nclouds in the maintenance\nof the Earth\'s climate. Because of diurnal\n\nt\n\nvariations\nin solar zenith angle, clouds, temperature,\nand humidity,\nobservations\nof radiation must be made over the full 24-hour diurnal\ncycle. To achieve an adequate sampling of that cycle, a multisatellite\nobserving system was designed for the ERBE with the construction\nof\nthree identical flight instruments.\nTwo of these were flown on NOAA\n_un-synchronous\nmorning and afternoon operational\nsatellites,\nand\nthe thicd set of instruments\non the Earth Radiation\nBudget Sateliii.e (Et.J,__S).

Some carry sensitive instrum.-nts that cannot operate on a multiuse spacecraft. Others r_quire different orbital altitudes\nor inclinations from \',hose of _he Eos platformz and other cperational\nsatellite zystems, or they ihclude instruments that could be developed for flight on satellites _,perated by other space agencies. They\nall pr\'_vide measurements critical for Earth System Science studies\nand have been strongly recommec.dcd by the scientific community.\nThe committee e:nphasl.zes, however, that these prospective missio_ls\nare r,.ot discussed in any order of priority or in any comprehensive\nmanner and are merely represen:_ative of the k;ads of missions that\ncould be accomplished under an Earth Explorer line. What !s certain is that without th_ e._tablishment of such a line they stand li_ttle\nchanct of ever being launched.\nThese missions are discussed under t_o categories: (1) low-cost,\nlightweight missions, either single-irtstrument spacecraft or insi,r,_ments f,own as missions of opportunity, that can be constructed in\nunder 3 years for $30 million or less; and (2) moderate-cost missions that either would be accomplisk_.d by NASA alone wi\'_hin the\ncomraittee\'s proposed budgetary ceiling of $150 milli_m, or could\nbe accommodated within the Explorer program by virtue of costreducing collaborations with other space agencies. (See the next\nchapter for a discdssion of the committee\'s related recommendations\nand their justification.)\nLow-Cost, Lightweight Missions\nTotal Ozone Mapping Spectrcmeter\nThe Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) is an instrament designed to provide high-spatial-resolution\nmaps of total\nozone--the amount of ozone integrated over the depth of the atmosphere at a given location. Day-to-day variations in total ozone\nare closely related to dynamical processes near the tropopause. Since\nmost of the ozone is in the lower stratosphere, where chemical sources\nand sinks are slow in compacison with changes produced by motions,\nhigh-resolution maps o,"total ozone provide considereble information\nabout advective processes in those areas. On longer time _cales,\nTOMS can be used to measure temporal trends in total ozone. Such\n\ni\n\nI\n\nr\n\nr\n\n31\n\nFIGURE 3.5 This Southern Hemisphere plot of total osone distribution for\nOctober 5, 1987, shows a value of appro\'.timately 125 Dobson Units (DU)\n(black), the lowest osone value of 1987 to date and the lowest total osone\nvalue ever observed. Thk plot also shows that the osone hole is nearly half\nthe area of the Antarctic continent, an area covering approximately 7 million\nsquare kilometers (2.5 million square miles). The data were taken with the\nTotal Osone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) instrument on NASA\'s Nimbus 7\nsatellite, wh:.ch is managed by the Goddard Sp_ce Flight Center. The values\nof the colors in DU of total units are shown in the color bar. SOURCE: A.J.\nKrueger, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.\n\ntrends are expected to occur in association with changes in the chemistry of the stratosphere\ninduced by the release of industrial gases.\na TOMS instrument has been in orbit on the Nimbus 7 satellite\nsince November 1978, providing daily maps of total ozone with 50-km\nspatial resolution. Data from this instrument have been invaluable in\ndocumenting the rapid decline in total ozone over Antarctica during\nthe spring season. For example, Figure 3.5 shows the total ozone\ndistribution for October 5, 1987--the loNest total ozone value ever\nobserved. The TOMS instrument has already operated well beyond\nits expected lifetime sad could fail at any time. Because of the serious\nramifications\nof the ozone reduction phenomenon, the usefulness of\n\nI\n\n8\n\n32\nthe TOMS data in monitoring\nthe problem on a global scale, and\nthe lack of any firm plans to fly a similar instrument\nin the near\nfuture, an ozone-measuring\ninstrument is a high-priority\npayload for\nthe proposed Earth Explorer line of satellites. This is consistent with\nthe 1985 CES strategy\'s\nhighest priority scientific objective for the\nstudy of the middle atmosphere,\nwhich was to measure continuously\ntotal ozone and its vertical profile over the globe with sufficient\naccuracy to test theoretical predictions.\nAn engineering\nmodel of the TOMS instrument\nis currently\navailable and could be flown on short notice with only minor modifications.\nThe spectrometer\ncould be launched either as a singleinstrument\nmission on a Scout-class rocket or with other instruments\non another U.S. or foreign spacecraft.\nThe cost of modifying the\nexisting instrument\nfor launch readiness is about $7 million.\nThe\ncommittee\nemphasizes\nthat global ozone measurements\nare too important\nto allow the lengthy data gap that is projected\nto occur\nbetween the failure of the Nimbus 7 system and the time when an\nEos-mounted\nsensor is operational.\n\nSea Wide Field Sensor\nThe first instrument\nto measure chlorophyll from space was the\nCoastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS) flown on Nimbus 7. It measured\nthe radiance reflected from the ocean surface in the visible and nearinfrared and thermal infrared regions.\nChlorophyll\nconcentrations\nwere derived by using data from the visible wavelengths,\nand sea surface temperatures\nwere calculated\nfrom the infrared measurements.\nData from the near-infrared\nband were used for atmospheric\ncorrection of the data acquired in the visible bands. Although the CZCS\nwas designed as a "proof of concept"\ninstrument\nwith a one-year\ndesign lifetime, the instrument\nprovided valuable information\nfor\nalmost 8 years, revolutionizing\nthe field of global biological oceanography in the process. See Figure 3.6 for an example of CZCS results\nshowing the relationship\nbetween satellite pigment concentrations\nand daily primary production.\nA successor to the Coastal Zone Color Scanner on Nimbus 7 has\nbeen proposed for flight on the 1991 Landsat 6 mission. Called the\nSea Wide Field Sensor (Sea WiFS), the instrument\nwould map the\ndistribution\nof chlorophyll in the upper layers of the ocean and collect\nsea surface temperature\ndata crucial to understanding\nglobal-scale\nbiological and physical processes.\nIt would fly at an altitude of 705\nt\n\n33\nZONALPRODUCTIVITY1979\ng\n>"\nC_\nf4\')\nZ\nO\nI--\n\n8\n\n7\n6\n\n(3\nIJJ\n\n5\n\nZ\n\n4\n\n_\n\n3\n\n\xc2\xa3\nI.--\n\na.\nZ\nO\nN\n\n0\n\n,,\n\n.1\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nI I\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n90\n\nI\n\n\'"\n\n....\n\n!\n\n-60\n\n.....\n\ni\n\n-30\nS\n\nFIGURE\ndaily\n\n3.6\n\nprimary\n\nThe\n\nrelationship\n\nproduction\n\n(Eppley\n\n.....\n\nt\n\n0\nLATITUDE\n\nbetween\net al.,\n\nI\n\n.....\n\n60\n\n90\n\nN\n\nsatellite\n1984)\n\n.....\n\n30\n\nwas\n\npigment\napplied\n\nconcentrations\nto\n\nand\n\nall monthly\n\nCZCS\n\npigment\nvalues for 1979 at 20-km resolution, averaged zonally and normalized\nfor total oceanic area within 5 degree zones.

More detailed information on the Sea WiFS is available\nfrom the NASA/NOAA/EOSAT\nreport, System Concept for WideField-of- View Observations of Ocean Phenomena from Space (August\n1987).\nAt a cost of approximately $25 million to NASA, the Sea WiFS\ncould fly piggyback on Landsat 6 and cut in half the 10-year gap in\nobservations of these variables that would otherwise exist between\nthe termination of CZCS measurements in 1986 and the launch\nof new oc_an color/sea surface temperature instruments on Eos.\nA flight in 1991 is particularly important because the Sea WiFS\ninstrument would complement the measurements made by other\noceanographic spacecraft scheduled in that time frame, including\nthe European Space Agency\'s ERS-1 (i991) and the NASA/French\nTOPEX/Poseidon mission (1992) It would also provide fundamental data for major oceanographic experiments now being planned for\nthe early 1990s as part of the World Ciimate Research Program,\nwhich includes the World Ocean Circulation Experiment and the\nTropical Oceans and Global Atmospheric program.\nMeasurement of Air Pollution from Satellites\nCarbon monoxide (CO) constitutes over one-half of the total\nemissions that pollute the air in the United States. Approximately\n50 percent of the total CO flux is estimated to come from industrial\nactivity. Studies based on numerical models have shown that the\ncurrent level of emissions is sufficient to perturb global CO-CH4OH chemistry and to produce significant changes in tropospheric\nchemistry and planetary heat balance within several decades.\nThe first global determination of CO distribution in the middle and upper troposphere was made by the Measurement of Air\nPollution from Satellites (MAPS) experiment on a November 1981\nSpace Shuttle flight, and again in October 1984 (see Figure 3.7 for\nthe results from 1984). The instrument used a gas filter correlation\ntechnique to maintain high radiation throughput and high effective\nspectral resolution in the 4.67-_m fundamental band of CO.\nThe successful Shuttle experiment indicated that the MAPS instrument could be modified for a free-flying spacecraft to determine\nthe global distribution of CO in the middle troposphere over a period\nof at least 1year. The resulting data could be used to verify models of\n\n35\nCO Mixing Ratio. ppbv\n\n<45\n\n60\n\n65\n\n85<\n\n":\n\n4O\n70N\n\nEO\n-\n\n20\n\n5O\n705\n180W 150\n\n120\n\n90\n\n60\n\n30\n\nGM\n\n30\n\n60\n\n90\n\n120\n\n150\n\n150E\n\nLONGITUDE, degrees\nFIGURE\n\n3.7\n\nThe\n\ndistribution\n\nof carbon\n\nmonoxide\n\nin the\n\nprovided\nby the Measurement\nof Air Pollution\nfrom Satellite\nduring October\n5-13, 1984.

The MAPS instrument could\nbe modified for an Earth Explorer spacecraft or fly as a piggyback\nmission for approximately $7 million.\nLAGEOS III\nA third LAGEOS satellite, LAGEOS III, has been proposed at\nthe same orbital altitude and eccentricity as LAGEOS II, but with\nan inclination of 76\xc2\xb0, This satellite, when used with LAGEOS I,\nwould provide a stable reference frame for determining with high\naccuracy the variability of Earth\'s rotation to enable studies of the\nsolid earth, atmospheric angular momentum, and energy exchanges\nwith the atmosphere and core. It would also provide more accurate\ndeterminations of the positions of points on the Earth in support of\n\nr\n\n36\nglobal plate tectonic and crustal deformation studies. These were all\nhigh-priority objectives for the study of solid earth dynamics from\nspace in the 1982 CES strategy.\nModerate-Cost Missions\n\n1\n\nMagnetic Field Explorer\nThe primary goal of the Magnetic Field Explorer (MFE) would\nbe to monitor the changes in the field produced by the core that have\ntaken place since the Magsat mission in order to study the secular\nvariation of the Earth\'s magnetic field. The measurements should\nbe made from an approximately polar orbit. The mission would\nsample the Earth\'s magnetic field at all local times to eliminate\nerrors produced by the ionospheric field. The orbit should be higher\nthan Magsat\'s to give the satellite a lifetime _f at least 18 months,\nand preferably 3 years.\nThe magnetic field has interesting variability on all time scales,\nfrom minutes to a billion years. Variability induced by the motion\nof the Earth\'s core extends from 1 year to 10,000 years. A time\nseries over several ll-year sunspot cycles is required for observing\nthe electrical conductivity of the lower mantle by magnetic sounding.\nThis duration is also necessary to see the temporal changes in the field\nwith sufficient accuracy for inferring fluid velocities in the core and\nfor attempting to observe a magnetic impulse like the one detected in\n1970. Seeing such an impulse with good geographical coverage would\nprovide important information about the dynamics of the Earth\'s\ncore.\nThe $70 million estimated cost, the specialized orbital requirements, the need for shielding from local spacecraft fields, and the\ndesirability of frequent and repeated field monitoring all make the\nMFE an ideal candidate for an Earth Explorer mission. Discussions\nwith representatives of the French space agency have indicated the\npossibility of doing MFE in conjunction with a French mission. This\ncould demonstrate the feasibility and value of a permanent international satellite program for monitoring the magnetic field, observing\nevents in the motion of the core, and compiling the statistics of the\nfluid motion in the upper core. Such a program would be the geomagnetic analog of the worldwide seismic network now in place for\nmonitoring earthquakes and the structure of the upper layers of the\nEarth\'s mantle and crust.\nt\n\ni\n\n37\nGeopotential\n\nResearch Mission (GRM)\n\nThe 1982 CES strategy set forth the primary scientific objectives\nfor the study of solid earth dynamics from space, which included\nmeasurement of the Earth\'s gravitational field from global scales to\nwavelengths of 200 km or less. The strategy also recognized the need\nto measure with increased accuracy the time-dependent deformation\nin a number of the major worldwide seismic zones and variations in\nthe Earth\'s rotation rate and polar motion.\nThe proposed Geopotential Research Mission would contribute\nto the fulfillment of these objectives by making precise measurements\nof the Earth\'s gravitational field. At present, gravity data accurate\nto 4 mgal with 100-kin resolution are publicly available for only\n22 percent of the Earth\'s land area, with geographic and political\nbarriers preventing further acquisition by means of standard ground\nsurveys. Global measurements of the field with an accuracy of 2 to\n3 mgal at the Earth\'s surface, and with spatial resolution of a few\nhundred kilometers, would contribute significantly to the study of\nmantle dynamics and tectonics on the continents and the continental\nmargins. Examples include studies of the deep-density structure\nof the upper mantle, particularly at subduction zones, the thermal\nstructure of the continental lithosphere, the density structure of\ncontinental margins, the driving force for continental tectonics, and\nmantle composition, theology, and scales of convection. In addition,\nthe measurements would be used for determining the marine geoid\nwith an accuracy necessary for calculating the permanent oceanic\ncirculation from altimeter measurements of sea level made by the\nTOPEX/Poseidon\nmission and by other satellites.\nOne possible mission for measuring the Earth\'s gravitational field\nwould use a French gravity gradiometer inside a drag-compensated\nsatellite with receivers for tracking the signals from the Global Positioning System satellites. The signals would be used for accurately\ncomputing the orbit of the satellite. With launch on a Delta-class\nvehicle, the total cost of the NASA contribution to the mission would\nbe approximately $150 million, which falls within the committee\'s\nsuggested budgetary limit for Earth Explorers.\n\nTropical\nRainfall\nMeasuring\nMission\n(TRMM)\nInits1985strategyhis\nt\ncommitteestated\nthattheoverriding\nimportance,\nbothscientific societal,\nand\nofmeasurements\nofcertain\nJ\n\n/\n\n38\nelements\noftheglobal\nhydrological and ofthecauses\ncycle\nand signals\nofclimate\nchangemakesitessential suchmeasurements\nfor\ntobe\ninclvdedsa partoftheoverall\na\nprogramforthestudyoftheEarth\nfrom space.The committeespecifically\nconcludedthataccurate\nmeasurements\noftherates\nofprecipitation,\nevapolation, evapoand\ntranspiration\novertheglobalandandoceansurfaces\nl\nareobjectives\nof\nthehighest\npriority\nforthestudy\noftheatmosphere-land-ocean-biota\nsystemfromspaceoverthenext10to 15years.\nThe Tropical\nRainfall\nMeasuring\nMission\nhasbeen",roposed\nfor\nmeasuring\ntherainfall\ninthetropical\nregions\novera period\nof3 years\ntostudyhydrological\nprocesses\ninthetropics,\nespecially relatheir\ntionship\ntotheglobal\ncirculation\noftheatmosphere\nand theocean,\nand climate\nvariability. studyoftror\'cal\nThe\nrainfall\nisofparticular\nimportance several\nfor\nreasons.\nFrom an econcmic\nstandpoint,\ntropicalstorms\ndriven intense\nby\nrainfall extensive\ncause\ndestruction\neach\nyear.Tropical\nrainfall\nisalso\ntheheatengine\nthatdrivesheglobal\nt\nweather,\nand tropical\nprocesses\nhavebeenlinked\ntoglobal\nclimate\nchange.\nThe extensive\nsurface\nobservatio,s\ncollected theTropical\nby\nOceansandGlobal\nAtmosphereprogramwill able\nbe\ntocomplement,\nbutnotreplace,\nthesatellite\nmeasurements,\nsince\nstudies\noftherain\nrequireccuracies\na\nof0.5to1.0ram/daymade often\nthroughout\nthe\nfullaily\nd\ncycle.\nThe proposed\nsatellite\nmission\nwouldfly\ninan orbital\ninclination\nof 30\xc2\xb0 to 40\xc2\xb0 at an altitude around300 kin.Itwould carrya\nof\nmultifrequency,\nscanning\nmicrowaveradiometer, scanning\na\nvisible\nandinfrared\nradiometer,\nanda precipitation The requisite\nradar.\nlow\ninclination orbital\nand\nelevation\nprecludecquiring\na\nthese\ndatafrom\ntheEos polarplatforms. joint\nA\nprogrambetweenNASA and the\nNationalpaceDevelopment\nS\nAgencyofJapanisbeingconsidered\nat\na cost\nofapproximately\n$130million\ntoNASA. As inthecaseofthe\nGeopotential\nResearch\nMission,n EarthExplorer\na\nprogrammay be\ntheonlyway forNASA toimplement\nsucha cost-saving,\ncooperative\nventure.\n\n4\nStrateg::" for an Effective Program\n\nAn Earth Explorer program can open new vistas in the earth\nsciences, encourage innovation, and solve critical scientific problems.\nSpecific missions must be rigorously shaped by the demands and opportunities of high-quality science and must corr flement the Earth\nObsetving System and the Mission to Planet Earth. It is therefore essential that the program follow a comprehensive strategy for\naccomplishing these goals.\nThe Committee on Earth Sciences recommends that the new Earth\nExplorer mission series be funded at a level that would allow the construction of two small missions per year, or one moderate mission every 8 years. Announcements of Opportunity for such missions should\nbe divided according to two separate solicitations, one for missions\nand instruments costing less than $30 million and one for missions\nin the $80 million to $150 million range. The Earth Explorer series\nshould be established as a level-of-effort program similar to the existing Explorer line, but managed entirely by NASA\'s Earth Science\nand Applications Division. Maintaining independ, nt control over the\nprogram will help ensure that it remains respom ,re to the needs of\nthe earth sciences community and will prevent the further dilution of\nan already oversubscribed Explorer program for astronomy and astrophysics, and solar and space physics. The level of funding should\nbe adequate to fly a continuous series of missions at an average rate\nof approximately one per year.\nt\n\n39\n\n4O\n\ni\n\nIn May 1988, NASA issued its first announcement of opportunity (AO) for "small-class Explorer missions" under the existing\nExplorer program. The AO is intended for the development of spacecraft and instrument payloads that will average approximately $30\nmillion or less. This is in contrast to the "Delta-class" missions in\nthe Explorer program that typically cost between $50 million and\n$150 million. The committee endorses this approach and proposes a\nsimilar classification of missions for the Earth Explorer program.\nPr_;ects that cost under $30 million will provide a continuing\nor\'"\n_mty for quickly implementing flights of small free-flyers to\n..,_ct\nfocused\nscientific\ninvestigations,\naswellasforinstruments\nflown on "missions of opportunity." Such projects are especi,dly important for providing training at universities to new" generatiors of\nscientists and engineers, since universities cannot typically handle\nlarger programs on a comprehensive, end-to-end basis. Finally, the\ndivision of the AOs into two separate solicitations will increase programmatic flexibility and decrease response times, while ensuring\n_hat _he smallest missions are not crowded out by the moderate-size\nini.tiatives. (See Appendix B for a table that shows a hypothetical,\nbut rcl=resentative, distributior_ of funds end program elements over\nthe first 10 years of the program.)\nThe traditional strength of the existing NASA Explorer line has\nbeen easy, frequent, and inexpensive access to space. The recommendations that follow are designed to return similar opportunities\nto the earth sciences.\n1. The scientific value of Earth Explorer missions must be maximized. The Earth Explorer program will make the maximum possible\ncontribution to the earth sciences if the missions are of two varieties:\nthose sharply focused on important, but essentially independent,\nscientific questions and those designed to complement larger-scale\nmissions or international programs. The independent missions may\nbe aimed at discovery of new phenomena or relationships, or may\nprovide important increments in understanding known phenomena\nor processes. Consequently, the most important criterion for selecting an Earth Explorer should be that a proposed mission offers the\npotential for substantial improvement in our understanding of one or\nmore components of the Earth system.\nEach Earth Explorer mission therefore must be sharply focused\non significant scientific questions and must be justified in its own\nrioht. A mission should explore important scientific issues or fill in\ngapsthatmay arise\ninthecollection\noflong-term\ndatasets.The\n\ni\ni\n\n41\nprogramcouldalso\nprovide\nthecollateral\nbenefit\nofadvancing\ntechnologydevelopment\ninachieving objectives.

Programmatic continuity and flexibility m_st be maintained.\nPastexperience thereview\nand\nofpotential\nEarthExplorer\nmissions\ninChapter3 indicate\nthattheearthsciences\ncommunitycan easily\nidentify\nseveralutstanding\no\ncandidates\nforflight\neachyearforthe\nindefinite\nfuture.\nInorder\nfortherecommendedprogramtohavea\nsignificant\nimpactand tostimulate\nprogress\nintheearthsciences,\nit\nmust be initiated with a clear expectation of maintaining uninterrupted continuity.\nAt the same time, the program must be designed for flexibility,\nboth in choosing the most important scientific questions to address\nand in allowingorreasonablyide variations thescale\nf\nw\nin\nofthe\nmissions.apid response\nR\ntimesarenecessary react\nto\nina timely\nmannertosuddenchanges\ninourenvironment,\nortotakeadvantage\nofopportunities\ntocollaborate\nwithother\nagencies\nornations.\nWhile\nsome missions cost\nwill\nmore thantheannual\nallocation,\nthenumber\nof suchlargeefforts\nmust be sharply\nlimited\nand balancedby a\nnumber ofsmallmissionsr EarthExplorer\no\npayloads\nattached\nto\nother\nspacecraft\nasmissions\nofopportunity.\n3. Costs must be rigorously controlled in all phases of the program. The key to the success of the Earth Explorer program will\nbe to obtain the maximum scientific value per dollar expended. Toward this end the committee offers the following observations and\nrecommendations:\n* Instrumentation:\nThe spiraling costs of instruments for observation from space can be controlled by sharply focusing the scientific\nobjectives, by giving principal investigators the prime responsibility\nfor quality and cost control, and by carefully assessing the tradeoff\nbct,,_een reliability and multiple copies of instruments.\nIt is essential that the Earth Explorer missions be aimed at only one or tw,J\nscientific questions at a time. The temptation to combine as many\ninstruments as possible on a single mission, thereby escalating costs\ndramatically, can be avoided if frequent opportunities for access to\nspace are available. The earth sciences community needs to fly missions in near-Earth orbit that do not require the compromises in\n\n42\norbital\nparameters,\nweight,ower,\np\nanddatarates\nandformats\ninherenttomissionsithmultiple\nw\nobjectives.\nWhen new instruments\nmust be developed,\ncustomdesign\nand\nengineering provide\ncan\nenhancedflexibility reducedmission\nand\ncosts.In contrast, compromisesrequired achieve wellthe\nto\na\ndesigned\ninstrument\nwithstandard\nparts\noften\ndemand engineering\nand developmentosts\nc\nthatexceed\nthose\nofcustomdesign\nand entail\nundesirable\nconstraints power,\non\nweight,\nand capability.\nFormost missions,\ntheprincipal\ninvestigators\nshouldbe given\nspecific\n_\'esponsibility\nforquality\ncontrol,\neveniftheinstrument\nis\nmanufacturedy a contractor. quality\nb\nThe\noftheinstrument\nshould\nbe created\ni_thedesign,\nrather\nthanbe a result highly\nofa\nbureaucra_ic,\nexp_nsive\nquality\ncontrol\nprocess.\nFinally,\ntheissue\nofreliability multiple\nversus\ncopies\nshould\nbe\nthoroughly r ,examined to determine the basic policies of an Earth\nExplorer program. The committee believes that smaller missions\nwill lead to considerably cheaper instruments because achieving an\nacceptable probability of success with two or more missions should\nbe easier than attaining a vanishingly small probability of failure in\na single attempt.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Spacecraft and Launch Vehicles: In contrast to the case for\ninstruments, the committee recommends the use of standard satellite\nbuses and launch vehicles whenever this is both scientifically and\neconomically advantageous. These elements can integrate easily with\nsimple instrument systems, and a multiple production run allows a\ncontractor to achieve important economies of scale in production.\nSmall spacecraft concepts are currently being studied by the Defense\nAdvanced Research Programs Agency, and a number of small (Scoutclass) and medium size (Delta-class) expendable launch vehicles are\nbeing developed by the private sector. With the increasing emphasis\non commercial participation in the space program, both spacecraft\nand launch vehicles are likely to become more flexible, more capable,\nand more competitive in price, thus enhancing the accomplishments\npossible with the Earth Explorer program.\n4. The data transmission and proces.aing requirements for many\nEarth Explorers are likely to be relatively modest, given the emphasis\non strongly focused missions. Reductions in cost often will be realized\nby using standard telemetry equipment and relatively simple data\nacquisition systems, perhaps those operated by other federal agencies\nor by the principal investigator. Complicated arrangements within\nI\n\nI\n\n/\n\n43\nthe government or with commercial sate!]ite manufacturers would\nincrease hardware and project management costs.\nThe committee expects that most of the basic processing of\ndata from the majority of Earth Explorer missions can be performed\nby the principal investigator on dedicated computational equipment.\nStrict schedules and reliability requirements must be met, and the data\nshould be made available as quickly as possible to scientific archives\nor to open networks in scientific formats.\nFurthermore, the Earth Explorer series offers the opportunity\nfor the NASA Earth Sciences and Applications Division to gain\nvaluable experience with distributed data _ystems. Earth Explorer\ndata released by the principal investigator should flow to active data\nbases, perhaps to one of the pilot data systems, and then to the\ncommunity over networks operated by NASA, other federal agencies,\nand internatione, l organizations. Optimum use of the Earth Explorer\nobservations will surely require comparison with data from other\nmissions and from operational data sources. As a result, careful\nplanning and experimentation with the integration over networks of\ndata ]from diverse sources will be essential. These efforts should be\napproached with the idea that they are important in preparing for\nthe data management challenges of earth system science in the Eos\nera, and thus resources should be apportioned accordingly.\n5. A significant]fraction of the total costs of each mission should\nbe allocated to data analysis, interpretation, and related theoretical or\nmodeling work. Because the scientific objectives for any mission are\nachieved only after the data have been distributed and thoroughly\nanalyzed, adequate funding for this purpose is fundamental to the\nmission\'s success. NASA will need to augment its annual mission operations and data analysis budget by an amount sufficient to conduct\nall such activities associated with each Earth Explorer mission.\n6. A basic goal of the Eart.h Explorer program must be to speed\nup the conversion of concepts into satellite missions and offraw data\ninto scientific results. The time scales of the program must be\ndesigned to attract leading scientists and talented students, and to\navoid the mounting costs of protracted space projects. Therefore it\nis important that the smallest missions be launched within 2 to 3\nyears of acceptance for engineering design, and moderate missions be\nlaunched within 3 to 4 years. Meeting such a schedule requires that\nthe instrument systems and spacecraft be kept relatively simple and\nwithin the adopted cost limits.\n7. The Explorer program must develop a selection process that\n\nd\nl\n\n/\n\n4\ni\n\n44\nencourages the best ideas and does not require inordinate investments\nin engineering design during the initial proposal phase. Thus _ms\ncommittee argues, as did the Committee on Solar and Space Physics\nin its 1.984 strategy, that the selection process should proceed in\ntwo phases. In the first phase, proposals would be requested that\nemphasize the sciontific issues and the instrument concepts, with\nonly a limited discussion of engineering issues. In the second phase,\nonly the most promising covcepts would be chosen for further development and preliminary instrument design in order to continue\nin the selection process. This approach would minimize the total\ncommunity investment in preparing proposals, and it would attract\nscientists with good ideas but limited resources to compete in the\npreliminary phase of Earth Explorer selection. Because scientific\nadvances and emerging problems cannot be foreseen a decade in advance, the sel_.ction process for new missions and instruments should\nbe designed to permit flexibility on the scale of 2 to 3 years. The\nsame process would apply to both the small (less than $30 million)\nand the moderate ($30 million to $150 million) mission proposals.\nIn any event, overselection of missions and ins*,uments should be\nassiduously avoided.\n8. Interagency and international collaboration mus_ be optimized. Collaboration with other agencies and nations foster3 the\ndevelopment of a stronger space science program at reduced cost to\nNASA. It is a\xc3\x97iomatic therefore that every opportunity for cooperation in utilizing and financing Earth Explorer missions should be\nconsidered.\nThe individual missions supported by the Earth Explorer ,\'rogram will involve different degrees of technology development and\nfinancial commitment.\nThe National Science Foundation (NSFi,\nthe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the\ndnited States Geological Survey (USGS), and the Department of Defense (DOD) have various interests in the earth sciences and in space\nobservations that are compatible with those of NASA. The norm\nshould be close cooperation in all areas in which agency interests\nconverge.\nMany missions will also stimulate and benefit from internatio_ _1\ncooperation. Through direct collaboration in joint missions, projects\notherwise too ambitious for the Earth Explorer line can be accommodated. Examples of cooperative projects under active negotiation\ninclude plans to fly a scatterometer and the tropical rainfall measuring system on Japanese spacecraft and the proposal between N _SA\n\n45\nand the French Centre Nationale des Etudes Spatiales (CNES) to fly\na magnetic observer.\nThe Earth observation missions of other nations will complement\nand supplement the data obtained from NASA and NOAA satellite,,.\n.All nations involved in the exploration of the Earth from space will\nbenefit by combining their data and learning to develop interactive\ndata systems of international scope. Surface data from other nations\nalso will be required. For inst. nee, data from the international network of surface magnetic observatorie.- _,c necessary for separating\nspatial magnetic variations observed by a satellite from magnetic\nstorms.\nIn addition, there are opportunities to share the use of ground\nfacilities. For example, the operation of equatorial three-component\nmagnetic observatories by the USGS is an essential complement to\nsatellite observations of magnetic field intensity. Air Force ground\nstations might be used to collect data from satellites, thus decree.sing costs of onboard data hardware. Surface weather observations\nor profile data from NOAA satellites will often be needed in analyzing atmospheric or s\'_lrface observations or in compensating for\natmospheric effects on electromagnetic transmission.\nFinally, as discussed in the previous chapters, _he Earth Explorer\nprogram is essential for completing key measurements that will be\nmade through international research programs in the earth sciences,\nsuch as the International Geosphere Biosphere Program--A Study of\nGlobal Change (IGBP) and the World Climate Research Program.\nThe Earth Explorer missions will benefit from the broad expertise\navailable in the international scientific community, and the missions\nwill make greater contributions if they answer scientific questions of\nvital international interest. Many of the mechanisms for facilitating\ninteragency and international cooperation are in place and are being\nusedwithinc_-easing\neffectiveness.\nInconclusion,\nthecommitteebelieves\nthattheproposed\nEarth\nExplorerrogramprovides substantial\np\na\nopportunity\nforprogress\nin\ntheearth\nsciences,\nboththrough\nindependent\nmissionsnd through\na\nmissions\ndesignedocomplementthelarge-scale\nt\nplatforms\nandinternational\nprogramsthatrepresent\nimportant\nnational\ncommitments.\nThe strategy\npresentednthis\ni\nreport\nisintended\ntohelpensure\nthe\nsuccess\noftheEarthExplorer\nprogramas a vital\nstimulanto the\nt\nstudyofourplanet.\n\n|\n\nAppendixes\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPreceding blank \'_\npage\n\nAppendix A\nReferences\n\nSPACE SCIENCE BOARD REPORTS\nA Strategy for Earth Science from Space in the 1980\'s--Part\nEarth and Oceans, CES (1982)\n\nI: Solid\n\nA Strategy for Earth Science from Space in the 1980\'s and 1990\'s-Part II: Atmosphere and Interactions with the Solid Earth, Oceans,\nand Biota, CES (1985)\nRemote Sensing of the Biosphere, Committee on Planetary\n(1986)\n\nBiology\n\nA Strategy for the Ezplorer Program for Solar and Space Physics,\nCommittee on Solar and Spnce Physics (1984)\nThe Explorer Program for Astronomy and Astrophysics, Committee\non Space Astronomy and Astrophysics (1986)\nData Me.nagement and Computation--Volume\nI: lssues and Recommendations, Committee on Data Management and Computation\n(1982)\nIssues and Recommendations Associated with Distributed Computation and Data Management Systems for the Space Sciences, Committee on Data Management and Computation (1986)\n,\n\n49\n\nPreceding\npageblank\n8\n\n[]\n\n50\nSpace Science in the Twenty-first Century: Mission to Planet Earth,\nTaskGroup on EarthSciences\n(1988)\nOTHER NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL REPORTS\nToward an International Geosphere-Biosphere Program: A Study of\nGlobal Change, N_\'ional Research Council workshop (1983)\nRemote Sensing of the Earth from Space: A Program in Crisis, Space\nApplications Board (1985)\nGlobal Change in the Geosphere-Biosphere: lnitial Priorities for an\niGBP, U.S. Committee for an International Geosphere-Biosphere\nProgram (1986)\nCurrent Issues in Atmospheric\nences and Climate (1987)\n\nChange, Board on Atmospheric Sci-\n\nNASA REPORTS\nEarth Observing System, Volume 1, Science and Mission Requirements Working Group (1984)\nThe Crisis in the Space and Earth Sciences, Space and Earth Sciences\nAdvisory Committee (1986)\nNASA Earth Science and Applications Division:\nPlans for FY 1987-1988-1989, NASA (1987)\n\nThe Program and\n\nLinking Remote-Sensing Technology and Global Needs: A Strategic\nVision, Applications Working Group (1987)\nLeadership and America\'s Future in Space, NASA (1987)\nSystem Concept for Wide-Field-of- View Observations of Ocean Phenomena from Space, NASA/NOAA/EOSAT\n(1987)\nEarth System Science: A Program for Global Change, Earth System\nScience Committee (1988)\nAnnouncement\nof Opportunity:\nNASA (1988)\n\nSmall-Class\n\nEzplorer\n\nMission,\n\nOTHER REPORTS\nThe OSS Ezplorer Program: A Status Review, Volumes 1 and 11, by\nR.
