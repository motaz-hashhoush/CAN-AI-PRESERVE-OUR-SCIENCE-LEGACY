b"SLS Booster Development\nJeremy J. Redden1\nOrbital ATK, Corinne, UT, 84307\n\nThe SLS booster combines proven technology from the past with cutting edge technology\ndemonstrated by Qualification Motor #1 to support NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Space Launch System.\n\nI. Introduction\n\nQ\n\nM-1 is the first of two qualification tests of the redesigned solid rocket motor V (RSRMV) motor component in\nthe two-booster system that will propel NASA\xe2\x80\x99s mammoth Space Launch System (SLS) off the launch pad and\nto destinations far beyond low earth orbit. With assistance of the RSRMV motors, SLS enables deep space missions\nto destinations such as asteroids, Lagrange points and the moon, all culminating with manned missions to Mars in\nthe 2030s. In addition to crewed missions, SLS may allow larger science payloads to reach their targeted\ndestinations faster than ever before. Most importantly, SLS provides inspiration for young students from this nation\nand around the world to pursue education and careers in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) by\ncaptivating the mind and unifying the world community in this grand journey of pioneering Mars.\nThe SLS RSRMV is closely related to the four-segment booster (RSRM) that successfully flew as part NASA's\nShuttle program incorporating key design and process changes to:\n1) Accommodate SLS mission-specific performance requirements\n2) Enhance safety, reliability, and producability\n3) Reduce overall costs\nAs the largest solid rocket booster ever built for flight, the SLS booster produces a peak 3.6 million pounds of\nvacuum thrust and burns for approximately 126 seconds. Key motor performance parameters are shown below at a\n60\xc2\xb0F propellant mean bulk temperature (PMBT) reference:\n\xef\x82\xb7 Action time 126.2 sec\n\xef\x82\xb7 Action time vacuum total impulse 368.1 Mlbf-sec\n\xef\x82\xb7 Maximum sea level thrust 3.28 Mlbf\n\xef\x82\xb7 Web time average vacuum thrust 3.13 Mlbf\n\xef\x82\xb7 Propellant mass 1.385 Mlbm\nThree full-scale RSRMV development tests and many component-level tests led to QM-1 (Figure 1). The QM-1\nmotor was tested on March 11, 2015, by Orbital ATK in Promontory, Utah. QM-1 had 75 qualification test\nobjectives, 9 demonstration test objectives and 18 development test objectives and was tested in a hot-condition test\nenvironment (PMBT 93\xc2\xb0 F). More than 530 instrumentation channels and rigorous post-test evaluations were used\nto assess the performance against these objectives to support qualification of the motor system.\nQualification objectives focused on SLS program requirements of overall motor performance, thrust vector\ncontrol (TVC) system performance, internal insulation performance, ballistic performance, joint sealing, structural\nperformance, and erosion of the ablative nozzle. Due to asbestos-based material obsolescence and the desire for a\nmore environmentally friendly material, the RSRMV internal insulation system has been redesigned since the\nShuttle program. The last two years have been spent in an intense effort to optimize this new insulation system,\nwhich resulted in QM-1 testing the most defect-free aft segment ever produced.\n\n1\n\nIntegrated Test Chief Engineer, SE&I Engineering Support, PO Box 707, Brigham City, UT 84302-0707, UT40B1.\n1\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nFigure 1. SLS booster development / qualification program summary (colors consistent with test\ntemperature).\nDemonstration objectives for QM-1 included performance of the nozzle plug, which has been redesigned due to\nincreased loading from the core stage RS-25 additional engine and proximity relative to the Space Shuttle\nconfiguration. High-speed video captured plug debris break-up patterns for debris mass and velocity calculations.\nDemonstration objectives included the upgraded RSRMV test stand. The test stand command and control system for\nmotor firing and TVC control has been upgraded with a test-like-you fly approach, using many components of the\nflight system. The test stand main pivot flexure was redesigned to carry the tremendous RSRMV thrust while\naccurately measuring motor-produced loads, and an additional mid-span support (Figure 2) was added in order to\nreduce mid-span sag to the maximum expected bowing during flight.\nDevelopment objectives focused on data gathering activities for analytical models for the TVC system\nperformance and loads and environments development. The correlated TVC models feed directly into vehicle-level\nflight control and trajectory predictions.\n\nFigure 2. QM-1 post-test side view\n\nII. Design Description\nThe SLS boosters leverage hardware that has a long and successful heritage on NASA's Space Shuttle program.\nSome hardware is used directly from Shuttle inventory, some hardware has been slightly modified, and other\nhardware has been significantly modified or replaced. This report does not contain an exhaustive list of all hardware\nchanges, but does identify the primary differences.\n\n2\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nA. Shuttle Inventory Hardware\nMany unmodified heritage components have been taken directly from Shuttle inventory. The motor safe and arm\n(S&A) is one such component. The motor segment cases are also being used directly without modifications except\nfor stiffener stubs being machined off of the aft segment. The primary structure of the booster forward assembly\nremains essentially unchanged, which includes the nose cone, frustum and forward skirt. The motor igniter metal\nstructure and propellant have remained the same as was used on the Shuttle program. The booster aft skirt structure\nand TVC system also remain true to their Shuttle design.\nB. Modified Shuttle Hardware\nSome components from the Shuttle program have been modified for the SLS program. While the motor igniter\nhas not changed fundamentally, insulation structural improvements have been made by adding a silica-filled\nacrylonitrile butadiene rubber (SF-NBR) shear ply at the case wall in critical regions.\nQM-1 was cast with RSRMV propellant, which is a\ncomposite solid propellant formulation consisting of\npolybutadiene acrylonitrile acrylic acid terpolymer binder\n(PBAN), epoxy curing agent, ammonium perchlorate (AP)\noxidizer, aluminum powder fuel, and a small amount of\niron oxide burn rate catalyst, which is used to target a\nspecific burn rate. Motor burn rate has been reduced to\noptimize the five-segment configuration.\nThe aft segment cylinder configuration was modified\nfor SLS where the cylinder that supported the Shuttle\nexternal tank attach ring was moved aft to support\nattachment of the SLS core stage attach ring. This was\nFigure 3. Aft segment configuration\nachieved by changing positions with the stiffener cylinder\nas is shown in Figure 3.\nThe SLS RSRMV forward motor segment utilizes a 12-fin star design, whereas an 11-fin design was used on the\nShuttle program. The forward segment grain geometry shown in Figure 4 has the 12-fin star region at the forward\nportion with a tapered transition to a center perforated (CP) region at the aft portion of the segment. Additionally,\nthe 12 fins are dimensionally lengthened from the RSRM baseline.\n\nFigure 4. Forward segment grain geometry\nThe inhibitor design has also been modified from the RSRM baseline. The castable inhibitors on the aft-end of\nthe center segments have been significantly increased in height such that the aft faces are nearly fully inhibited. The\npolybenzimidazole nitrile butadiene rubber (PBI-NBR) inhibitors on the forward faces of the center segments are\ndecreased in height compared to RSRM due to the propellant chamfers. Both RSRM and RSRMV are nearly fully\ninhibited on the forward faces of the center segments.\nThe RSRMV field joint protection system (FJPS) is a simplified version of the RSRM design. RSRMV does not\nuse the RSRM joint heaters at the field joints, nozzle-to-case (N/C) joint and igniter joints as low-temperature Orings have been utilized for the RSRMV design. These low-temperature O-rings were demonstrated on boosters late\nin the Shuttle program. The primary and secondary O-rings in the field joints also incorporate a larger nominal\ncross-section diameter compared to the RSRM baseline for improved performance at low temperatures.\n\n3\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nC. New or Redesigned Hardware\nSome components of the SLS booster are new or dramatically redesigned from the Shuttle booster design. The\nRSRMV nozzle and case insulation were both dramatically redesigned for SLS. These components are discussed in\nmore detail in Sections IV and V.\nQM-1 head-end pressure data will be used to down select a flight pressure transducer from two candidate designs\ntested on QM-1 to replace the Shuttle operational pressure transducer (OPT). The results from the candidate designs\nwill be compared to the control data set.\nThe SLS systems tunnel is based on the heritage Shuttle design with significant modifications. The avionics\nsystem has been completely redesigned for the SLS booster. Both of these items are discussed in more detail in\nSection III.\n\nIII. New Technology / Design Improvements\nThe SLS booster design has incorporated new technology and design improvements that were tested as part of\nthe QM-1 motor firing. One of the key SLS objectives is vehicle safety. The flight termination system (FTS) is part\nof this safety net and multiple design improvements were implemented on SLS. A pyrotechnic delay was\nimplemented that allows the crew capsule to be jettisoned a safe distance prior to terminating the booster thrust\nshould an anomaly occur. The linear shape charge (LSC) used to terminate thrust was extended further aft onto the\naft motor segment to more completely disable the motor pressure vessel. In addition, the systems tunnel in which the\nLSC is housed was modified by providing floor plate cutouts, allowing greater case penetration of the LSC plasma\njet.\nThe QM-1 test included a section of the systems tunnel (Figure\n5) populated with a pyrotechnic delay, LSC, harness bundles, and\ntunnel covers. All pyrotechnic hardware was inert with the intent to\nverify dynamic similarity between the SLS and Shuttle designs due\nto differences in the ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM)\nformulation, component mass changes, slotted floor plates, and\nremoval of the thermal protection system (TPS) closeout along the\ntunnel-to-case interface.\nThe new SLS avionics hardware provides state-of-the-art\ncommand and control of the heritage TVC system. The test-like-youfly approach was taken on the QM-1 static test by implementation of\nthe flight-like avionics system. As a forward skirt is not included in a\nstatic test, the avionics boxes were housed in off motor bunkers. The\nignition separation control (ISC) units provide the ignition pulse to\nthe motor igniter. The booster control and power distribution units\nFigure 5. QM-1 systems tunnel\n(BCPDU), actuator control unit (ACU), and hydraulic power unit\nsimulator (black pad is process aid)\ncontrollers (HPUC) provide actuator servo commands for nozzle\nposition and auxiliary power unit (APU) valve drive commands to\nturbomachinery that supply hydraulic pressure to move the actuators. An additional layer of hardware protection is\nprovided by nonflight emergency systems at the test stand. By routing the servo commands through a TVC null box,\nthe nozzle can be nulled in the event of loss of control. APU valve drive commands pass through the next generation\nground test controller (GTX), which independently monitors turbine speeds and can shut down a system that is\nexceeding limits. The GTX will also react to commands from the red line monitor (RLM), which provides capability\nfor additional system parameter monitoring and test abort, if required. QM-1 was the first static test to implement\nthis avionics system, so a significant pre-test effort was performed that included checkouts of all related avionics\nscripts on various hardware configurations including TVC hot hydrazine tests.\nMotor case insulation and nozzle are both newly designed components for the SLS booster. Significant effort has\nbeen devoted to each of these two subsystems, which are addressed in Section IV and V.\n\nIV. Insulation Development\nDuring the Shuttle program, booster motor case insulation used asbestos silica-filled nitrile butadiene rubber\n(AS-NBR). Due to material obsolescence and a desire for a more environmentally friendly material, the SLS\nprogram has chosen to use a PBI-NBR insulator. This PBI-NBR insulation was used successfully on Demonstration\nMotor (DM)-1, -2, and -3 static tests; however, unacceptable conditions were discovered via X-ray of the original\n\n4\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nQM-1 aft segment. Two propellant voids and two propellant-liner-insulation (PLI) separations were detected. An\ninvestigation was initiated due to these findings. During the QM-1 investigation, it was determined that the motor\nPBI-NBR insulation enables off-gassing of sufficient magnitude to create thin-film propellant separations near the\npropellant-liner interface during the propellant cure process. Rubber materials such as AS-NBR and SF-NBR also\ntrap and retain large amounts of air; however, how the air and volatiles are released during the cure process is unique\nto PBI-NBR relative to previous experience.\nIn order to resolve the PBI-NBR related concerns, a set of improvements were implemented on the QM-1 aft\nsegment that included:\n\xef\x82\xb7 Extended devolatization and dry-cycles to drive air and volatiles out of the insulation\n\xef\x82\xb7 Improved vacuum system during insulation cure\n\xef\x82\xb7 Insulation lay-up changes to minimize entrapped air\n\xef\x82\xb7 Improved insulation blister repairs\n\xef\x82\xb7 Enhanced environmental controls in the work center\n\xef\x82\xb7 Addition of a barrier to stop gas transfer during propellant cast / cure process\nThe insulation lay-up changes are critical to minimize the volume of air available for transfer during propellant\ncast and cure. The barrier addition is key to stopping gas transfer of any remaining air or volatiles into the\npropellant during the cast / cure process. These process improvements were implemented for the QM-1 aft segment,\nwhich resulted in the most defect-free aft segment ever produced. These improved processing techniques and barrier\nimplementation will be part of the entire motor build for the second qualification motor of the redesigned RSRMV\n(QM-2) and following SLS flight motors.\nDue to the insulation investigation activities, the motor was partially assembled (up to the center aft segment)\nand then demated. This resulted in the longest cumulative assembly time for the forward field joint (over 18\nmonths). The primary concern with long assembly time is reduced joint resiliency leading to a decrease in joint\nengagement.\n\nV. Nozzle Development\nThe larger RSRMV motor required a modified nozzle design. The RSRM nozzle utilized a 7.72 expansion ratio,\nwhile a 7.2 expansion ratio is used for RSRMV. The throat diameter, exit diameter, and length all increased in order\nto control the volume and velocity of the gases that are generated in the RSRMV design.\nThe RSRMV nozzle has evolved during the SLS booster path to qualification as was partially addressed in\nFigure 1. The flex boot is now fabricated with PBI-NBR versus AS-NBR on RSRM. Significant changes were made\nto the nozzle joints. Room temperature vulcanized silicon-based sealant (RTV) filled joints have been replaced with\ncarbon fiber rope and thermal barrier O-rings in two joints. In one joint, the RTV was removed and a barrier O-ring\nadded. A new forward end ring (FER) has been incorporated. The flex bearing attachment was moved to the nose\ninlet housing. The aft exit cone (AEC) ply angle was changed in order to minimize potential for ply lifting. The\nforward nose ring (FNR) ply angle was also changed to address abnormal erosion. A triple wrap cowl (glass-clothphenolic / carbon-cloth-phenolic / carbon-cloth-phenolic) replaced the heritage silica-cloth-phenolic / carbon-clothphenolic cowl to avoid structural design challenges of widely variable silica-cloth-phenolic material properties.\nMany material changes in the nozzle were also implemented.\nAfter the DM-2 static test, abnormal erosion on the FNR was observed. Although the design requirements were\nmet, an investigation team was formed to work the issue. The DM-3 nozzle was built exactly the same as DM-2, but\nwas instrumented with ultrasonic gages to monitor erosion during burn in order to capture timing and magnitude of\nthe abnormal erosion.\nOn DM-3, abnormal FNR erosion was once again observed, very similar to the observed DM-2 erosion. The\ninvestigation team determined, from the ultrasonic gage data, that the erosion was due to a series of events and\nenvironments that individually would not or could not explain the post-test observations but together provided the\npost-test erosion signature. These events include localized delamination of the forward end of the forward nose ring\nand / or nose cap in the short ply regions (wedgeout) exposing the ply faces, ply lifts, or ply separations that were\nthen removed by the particle impingement environment. The sloughing of the plies would arrest due to improved\nventing or development of a char cap. With this condition occurring early in burn, the particle impingement erosion\nduring the remainder of the motor burn would erode the phenolics to the final observed profile having washed out\nthe initial trigger indications.\nDue to this abnormal erosion, design changes were implemented for QM-1. In addition, it was felt that nonflight\nlike motor sag exacerbated the erosion due to higher particle impingement early in burn on the inlet regions at the\n\n5\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nbottom of the nozzle. QM-1 implemented an additional mid-span support in order to produce flight-like motor\ndeflection during static test (Figure 2).\n\nVI. Test Data\nOver 530 channels of instrumentation were gathered on the QM-1 static test. Post-test analysis of these data in\ncombination with post-test hardware evaluation is used to determine the successful completion of test objectives.\nThe instrumentation data processing is currently in work, and the motor is in the early stages of disassembly. All\nindications to date point towards having had a very successful QM-1 test. Figure 2 shows QM-1 post-test while\nFigure 6 shows QM-1 during the test.\nDiving board visual assessments saw no indications of abnormal erosion on the nozzle FNR as was seen on DM2 and DM-3. All phenolic components inspected have been in excellent shape with no signs of abnormal erosion,\npocketing or ply lifting. After nozzle removal, laser tracker and structured light will be used to quantitatively map\nthe nozzle contours. There are no indications of motor insulation issues; however, more information will be known\nafter the aft segment has been demated.\nBallistics performance parameters were within allowable requirements based on preliminary data and quick look\nanalysis methodology. The measured maximum pressure was greater than predicted early in motor burn. This result\nis very similar to DM-3 performance, which was also tested at an elevated temperature. The ballistics team is\nassessing approaches to improve the ballistics predictions for this condition.\nThe TVC actuator servovalve delta pressure data showed anomalous results; however, no anomalous results\nwere seen in the TVC duty cycle results. The avionics and TVC teams are investigating the cause of this anomalous\ncondition and / or measurements.\n\nVII. Conclusion\nQM-1 is a critical milestone in the NASA SLS program, which will enable bold human missions to Mars and\ninvigorate the hopes and ambitions of\nhumanity. This SLS booster qualification\ntest demonstrated both the successes of\nthe past Shuttle program and exciting\nadvances developed for the next\ngeneration SLS program, including\nupdated insulation, nozzle, and avionics\ndesigns. QM-1 will be followed by QM-2\nand then vehicle flights (EM-1, EM-2\nand beyond). Post-test analysis and\nhardware assessments are currently inwork; however, preliminary observations\nindicate a successful test of QM-1.\n\nFigure 6.
