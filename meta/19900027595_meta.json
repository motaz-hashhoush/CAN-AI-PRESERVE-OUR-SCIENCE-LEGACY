It is found that the theoretical upper limit of tropical circulation predictability is far less than for midlatitudes. The error growth for a complete general circulation model is compared to a dry version of the same model in which there is no prognostic equation for moisture, and diabatic heat sources are prescribed. It is found that the growth rate of synoptic-scale errors for the dry model is significantly smaller than for the moist model, suggesting that the interactions between dynamics and moist processes are among the important causes of atmospheric flow predictability degradation. Results are then presented of numerical experiments showing that correct specification of the slowly varying boundary condition of SST produces significant improvement in the prediction of time-averaged circulation and rainfall over the tropics.", "title": "Tropical forecasting - Predictability perspective", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-14T09:46:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19900027595, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Shukla, J."}, "organization": {"name": "Maryland, University", "location": "Baltimore, United States"}}, "id": "fa8fe7af5d684a05b31b11572a066181"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19900027595, "publications": [{"volume": "37", "submissionId": 19900027595, "issn": "0004-9743", "id": "2f0db6ce816a4d3982b908c6271f9a50", "publicationName": "Australian Meteorological Magazine", "publicationDate": "1989-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
