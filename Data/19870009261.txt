It is shown t a the perfonnance of optical links i very sensitive to the pointing\nht\ns\nand tracking e m at the transmitter and receiver. In the presence of random pointing and tracking errors,\noptimal antenna gains exist that wiU minimize the required transmitter power. In addition to limiting the\nantenna gains, random pointing and tracking emrs also impose a power penalty in the link budget. This\npower penalty is between 1.6 to 3 dB for a direct detection QPPM link, and 3 to 5 dB for a heterodyne\n\nQFSK system. For heterodyne systems, the canier phase noise presents another major factor of\nperformance degradation that must be considered. In contrast, the loss due to synchronization error is\nsmall.\nThe Link budgets for direct and heterodyne detection systems ye evaluated. It is shown that, for\nsystems with large pointing and tracking errors, the link budget is dominated by the spatial tracking error,\n\nand the direct detection system shows a superior performance because it is less sensitive to the spatial\ntracking error. On the other hand, for systems with small pointing and tracking jitters, the antenna gains\nare in general limited by the launch cost. and suboptimal antenna gains are often used in practice. In which\n\ncase, the heterodyne system has a slightly higher power margin because of the higher receiver sensitivity.\n\nii\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n.\n2.\n\nPage\n1\n\n........................................................\nTHE OPTICAL LINK ....................................................\n2.1 Optical Detectors and Noise .....................................\n2.2 Optical Sources .................................................\n2.3 Transmitter Design ..............................................\n2.4 Receiver Design .................................................\n2.5 Background Radiation ............................................\n2.6 Summary .........................................................\n3 .

INTRODUCTION\n\nIntersatellite links (ISLs) between satellites in low earth orbits (LEOS) and the geosynchronous orbit\n\n(GEO) are essential for future space missions [1],[2]. An effective I L can reduce the dependence on ground\nS\ntracking and data relay stations, increase the flexibility in choosing satellite orbits, and improve the data rate.\nRecently, with the advances in semiconductor laser and detector technologies, there has been considerable\ninterest in developing an optical ISL as an alternative to microwave systems. Compared to the state-of-the-art\nmicrowave link, the optical system offers higher bandwidth and lower power requirements. In addition, the\n\nshorter optical wavelength implies smaller antenna diameters and hence a smaller size and weight of the\ncommunication system. The combination of these advantages makes the optical system highly attractive for\nISL implementations.\nOptical links can be implemented using either direct or heterodyne detection receivers [1]-[SI. In a\ndirect detection receiver [3], the received optical intensity is detected without extensive front-end optical\nprocessing. The direct detection system is structurally simple and easy to implement. The technology needed\nto implement the direct detection receiver has been studied for land-based optical fiber links [9],[10] and, more\n\nrecently. for free space communication channels [4],[51,[11]-[191. For the free space optical link, pulseposition modulation (PPM) is known to be the optimal modulation scheme [ll]. [12]. The performance of the\nPPM channel has been analyzed extensively [3],[4], [11]-1141, and progresses have been toward implementing\na PPM channel capable of communicating at 2.5 bits per detected photon [17]-[20]. In order to achieve h e\n\ndetection sensitivity needed for the ISL.avalanche photodiodes (APDs) [21], [223 with sufficiently high gain\nand low noise are required. The performance of APD-based direct detection channels has been studied for\nboth fiber and free-spacecommunication links [41, [51, [231-[251.\nUnlike the direct detection receiver which detects only the intensity fluctuation, the heterodyne receiver\ndetects both amplitude and phase of the signal by first mixing the the received optical signal with a strong local\noscillator (LO) output, then detecting the combined optical signal. This heterodyne process effectively shifts\nthe spectrum of the incoming signal from the optical frequency down to an intermediate frequency (IF) where\nit c3n be easily processed. Because of the large IF signal strength, detector thermal noise can often be ignored\nin the heterodyne receiver. Furthermore, because the frequency filtering is c\'arried out at the IF frequency\n\nwhere a much narrower bandwidth can be used, noncoherent background radiation can be better rejected by\nthe heterodyne receiver. As a result, the heterodyne detection receiver offers a near quantum limited detection\nsensitivity [3], [%I, [27]. Receiver sensitivity can be further improved by using frequency and phase\nmoduhtions. In the limit of Iarge LO strength, the LO shot noise at the output of the heterodyne receiver can\n\nbe approximatedby a white Gaussian noise. Therefore, the analysis of the optical heterodyne system is similar\nto that of an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel [281-[31]. The application of heterodyne\ntechnology in fiber-optic links has been studied [321-[371, and the use of heterodyne receivers in ISL\napplications has also been proposed [61-[8]. These studies suggest that the heterodyne system offers a 5-10 dB\nadvantage in the detection sensitivity over the comparabledirect detection PPM channel [6]-[8]. However, the\nheterodyne receiver is more complicated than the direct detection receiver. Furthermore. the performance of\nthe heterodyne receiver is very sensitive to the carrier phase noise which is prominent in semiconductor lasers\n[38]-[43]. The impact of the laser phase noise on the performance of the heterodyne system has been studied\nby various authors [44]-[53]. Because of the difficultiesin analyzing the statistics of the phase noise, however,\nmost of these studies offer only an approximation to the system error rate.\nBoth direct and heterodyne detection systems have been proposed for ISL implementations. The\npurposes of this study are to compare the performance of these systems under a realistic operating environment\nand to analyze the various design trade-offs.\nBefore a comparison can be carried out between the direct and heterodyne detection ISLs, performance\nof individual systems must be carefully studied. In Chapter 2, components of an optical channel are discussed\nindividually and the signal and background powers detected by the receiver are derived as functions of link\nparameters. Given the receiver S N R and the modulation format, the performance of both direct detection and\nheterodyne receivers will be studied in Chapters 3 and 4, respectively. For direct detection systems, it is\nshown that the PPM system offers a significant performance advantage over the on-off-keying (OOK)\nsystem [3], [111, [121. For heterodyne systems, the sensitivity towards carrier phase noise suggests that the\nnoncoherent frequency-shiftkeying (NCFSK) scheme should be used for the heterodyne ISL [61-[81.\n\nIn addition to the receiver S N R and the modulation scheme, the performance of the ISL is very sensitive\nto the spatial and temporal tracking errors between the two satellites. Both direct dctcction and heterodyne\nsystems are susceptible to tracking errors in the mutual line-of-sight &OS). The implementation of the spatial\n2\n\ntracking and acquisition system has been studied by various groups [54]-[59]. The impact of spatial tracking\nerror on the performance of direct detection ISLs has been analyzed in terms of the probability of burst errors\n[57], [a]-[63]. The use of burst error probability to analyze the design of optical ISLs is simple, straight-\n\nforward, and in most cases provides adequate design rules. However, it is of interest to derive an optimal\nsystem design which maximizes the overall system performance. Such an analysis is carried out in Chapter 5.\nIt is shown that, in the absence of spatial tracking error, the performance of the ISL improves with increasing\ntransmitter and receiver antenna gains. When a random pointing error is present in the ISL, however, an\noptimal transmitter antenna gain exists which minimizes the required signal power. When pointing errors in\neach of the two gimbal axes can be modeled as identically distributed, zero-mean, Gaussian random variables,\nthe product of the optimal transmitter antenna gain and the mean square pointing jitters is shown to be a\nconstant which is independent of the RMS pointing error. Similarly, for heterodyne systems, the presence of\nrandom tracking error implies that an optimal receiver antenna gain exists which optimizes the receiver SNR.\nThe product of this optimal receiver antenna gain and the mean square tracking error is again a constant which\nis independent of the RMS tracking error. In addition to limiting the antenna gains, random pointing and\ntracking errors also impose an additional power penalty in the system link budget. This power penalty is\nshown to be between 1.5 to 3 dB for a direct detection QPPM system, and between 3.8 to 5 dB for a\nheterodyne QFSK system.\nReceiver timing synchronization is another major factor of performance degradation. For direct\ndetection PPM systems, early-late gate [3], [281, [31] and phase-locked loop (PLL) [28]-[31], [HI-[68] timing\nsynchronizers can be used to synchronize the receiver timing. It can be shown that, with nonlinear\npreprocessing, PLLs can be used to achieve effective symbol synchronization of the direct detection PPM\nreceiver [66]. For heterodyne systems, techniques for synchronizing the RF channel can be applied without\nextensive modification. The impact of symbol synchronization on the performance of direct and heterodyne\ndetection ISLs is studied in Chapter 6. It is seen that, with a narrow tracking loop bandwidth, receiver\nsynchronization can be implemented with only a small power penalty.\nFinally, Chapter 7 summarizes the findings of previous chapters and analyzes thz various design\ntradeoffs. It is shown that, for systems with large (>OS wad) RMS pointing and tracking jitters, spatial\ntracking errors are the dominating loss factor in the link budget. As a result, the direct detection PPM system\n\n3\n\nhas a higher power margin because it is less sensitive to the spatid tracking error. On the other hand, for\nsystems with small ( ~ 0 . 2\npad) pointing and tracking jitters, losses due t spatial tracking errors are small and\no\nthe heterodyne system actually shows a superior performance because of the higher receiver sensitivity.\n\nff\n\nI\n4\n\n2.THEOpTICALLINK\n\nLike most communication links, the performance of optical links depends critically on achieving high\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver. The higher the receiver SNR, the lower the error rate. Unlike the\nRF receiver, however, the output of the optical detector is contaminated by the shot noise in addition t the\no\n\nthermal noise. Given the received signal power, the presence of the shot noise imposes a limit on the\nmaximum S N R that can be achieved by the detector. This shot noise limited S N R dictates a lower bound on\nthe performance of the optical link. In this chapter, we are interested in evaluating the detector S N R as a\nfunction of link parameters. In addition, expressions for the signal and background power received by the\nreceiver will be derived and evaluated.\n2.1 Optical Detectors and Noise\nDetection of optical radiation differs from conventionalRF field detection in that the signal intensity, not\nthe amplitude, is detected. Detectors commonly used in optical communication include photomultiplier tubes\n(PMT). pin photodiodes, and avalanche photodiodes (APD). Pin diodes and APDs are solid state devices,\n\nwhile PMTs are vacuum photoemissive devices.\nA typical PMT consists of a photocathode, followed by a series of dynodes and an anode. An incoming\n\nphoton event is detected by the generation of a photoelectron at the photocathode. This photoelectron is\naccelerated toward the first dynode in the tube by the applied field. The impact of this accelerated electron on\nthe dynode creates secondary electrons that are then accelerated by the external field toward the next dynode.\nThis process is repeated until photoelectrons hit the anode. However, by this time the original photoelectron\nhas been amplified considerably so that a very high current gain is associated with a single photon event.\n\nGains of 105 to 106 are typical for PMTs. When operating at such high gains, the detector thermal noise and\ngain noise usually can be ignored. Consequently,PMTs are essentially quantum limited devices. However,\nbecause of the time it takes the electrons to traverse the dynode chain, PMTs have an inherent bandwidth\nlimitation. Typical bandwidths for PMTs are around 20-2OOMHz. Such bandwidths are considerably lower\nthan the desired information bandwidth. Furthermore, the lack of suitable materials for photocathodes at the\nhigh visible and near J wavelengths is a significant disadvantage. The detector quantum efficiency, which is\nR\nthe ratio between the number of detected and incoming photons, is typically on the order of 10-20%at visible\n5\n\nwavelengths, and drops off rapidly in the near i n k e d region 1691, [70]. In addition to being slow and\ninefficient, PMTs are bulky, and require a high power supply voltage (=1-3KV) and extensive thermal\ncooling.\nIn contrast, solid state detecton have an inherently higher bandwidth because of their smaller size. In\naddition, solid state devices are more reliable and exhibit higher quantum efficiency. Typical quantum\nefficiencies for solid state detectors range from 20 to 90% throughout the visible and near IR ranges [69]-[72].\nSolid state detectors commonly used include the pin diode and the APD. Pin diodes are simpler to operate\nand easier to fabricate than APDs [21]. Under a normal operating condition, the p-n junction is reverse biased\n\nso that in the absence of light only a small leakage current will flow through the diode. When a photon enters\nthe depletion region, it is absorbed and the excess energy generates an electron-hole pair. Both electron and\nhole are rapidly drawn toward the opposite electrodes where a current pulse is generated. The generation of\nelectron-hole pairs depends on the detailed interaction between the radiation field and the detector material.\nFor detection of multimode radiation, photoelectron generation can be modeled as a Poisson arrival process\nwith arrival rate Vt). which can be related to the total incident optical power PR by [31,[741\n\nwhere q is the detector quantum efficiency. and h v is the energy of the photon. The output of the\nphotodetector. which can be modeled as the superposition of detector response to the primary photocurrent,\ncan therefore be written as 131, [741\ni ( t ) = &eh(t-,)\n\n+ id+ia ,\n\nwhere the summation is extended over the photon arrival times (7,1, e is the electron charge, h (f) is the\ndetector impulse response, id is the detector dark current, and\n\nilk\n\nis the detector thermal noise current.\n\nBecause there is no internal gain mechanism, the bandwidth of the pin diode is limited only by the time it\ntakes the electron and hole to travel through the depletion layer. Bandwidths of IOGHz can be easily achieved\nfor InGaAs pin diodes [21] and bandwidths as high as 20 GHz have been reported [731.\nThe main disadvantage of pin diodes in optical ISLs is their low gain. When operating at extremely low\nsignal levels, thermal noise current generated by the detector frontend can be more significant than the signal\n\n6\n\ncurrent. This thermal noise limited situation can severely degrade the signal-to-noise ratio of the detector and\nincrease the system error rate. Consequently, pin diodes are typically used in heterodyne systems where the\nlarge local oscillator (LO) strength ensures that the S N R is not limited by the detector thermal noise. For\napplications where the incident optical power on the detector is weak , such as in a direct detection ISL\nreceiver, the APDs with their internal gain are generally preferred.\nAvalanche photodiodes are similar to pin diodes in that they operate under reverse bias\n[21], [22], [71], [72]. Unlike pin diodes, however, APDs operate with high internal electric fields so that when\ncarriers are generated, they are accelerated t high velocities. These high velocity carriers can subsequently\no\nionize other electron-hole pairs which in Run generate additional carriers. T i impact ionization mechanism\nhs\ngives the APD an internal gain so that the device can operate above the detector thermal noise limit. Typical\ngains of APDs range from 100 to 300 and, because the ionization process is random, gains associated with\ndifferent photon events are independent. By assuming that each primary electron-hole pair is associated with a\nrandom gain C ,the output of the APD can be modeled as [31, [751\n\ni ( f ) = &eCj h (t -s, ) + id + it,, ,\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere G, is the gain associated with the j h photoevent.\nBecause of the large gain (100-300) associated with each photon event, detector thermal noise can often\n\nbe ignared at the APD output. The principal noises at the APD output are, therefore, the detector shot noise\nand noise associated with the avalanche gain mechanism. The avalanche noise is lowest in devices where the\navalanche process is generated primarily by the carriers of higher mobility, because although a large number\nof secondary carriers can be generated by the primary electron-hole pair, the higher canier mobility implies\nthat carriers will spend a shorter time within the avalanche region and, consequently, a smaller number of\nsecondary carriers will induce further ionization. The ratio between the hole and electron ionization\ncoefficients is known as the effective ionization coefficient ratio, k d . For a well-designed APD, keff should be\nmuch smaller than 1. The value of kcffas low as 0.007 has been reported for selected commercial devices.\nThe exact gain distributionof the APD is difficult to characterize [75]-[77]. However, for most practical\napplications,it is sufficient to characterize the APD by its excess noise factor F, defined as\n\n7\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhere the angle brackets <Gj > denote the ensemble average. Experimentally, the excess noise factor is found\nto be closely approximatedby [721\n\nF=Gx,\n\n(2.5)\n\nwhere G is the average gain of the detector, and x is some exponent which for Si APD is between 0.2 and\n0.5*. The excess noise factor F can also be theoreticallyrelated to k a by [72]\n\nThe response time of the APD also depends on ka. After the initial avalanche, the signal persists until\nno further avalanche is detected. In the best case where k e O , the detector response time is limited only by\nthe time it takes for a single electron to travel through the avalanche region. Typical bandwidths of APD range\nfrom 100 MHz to 4 GHz for visible wavelengths. At wavelengths longer than 1 p,the difficulties of\nobtaining a low bandgap material with small tunnel leakage have limited the use of APDs. However. recent\nprogresses in manufacturing the separate-absorption-and-multiplication-region\nAPD (SAM-APD) have\ndemonstrated a bandwidth of 5-7GHz with a gain-bandwidth product exceeding 50-GHz [79]. At even longer\nwavelengths ( = l o p ) , multiplequantum well (MQW) APDs [80] can be used to detect the signal effectively.\nGiven the incident optical power, the mean and variance of the photodetector output can be given by\nCampbell\'s theorem [73]:\n\nIn writing Eqs.(2.7) and (2.8), it has been assumed that the detector dark current consists of a gain dependent\npart\n\nib\n\nand a gain independent portion is. From Eq.(2.8), it is\n\nSeen\n\nthat the variance of APD output current\n\nconsists of three terms. The first term on the right-handed side of Eq.(2.8) is due to the signal shot and the\navalanche noise, the second term is due to the detector dark current, and the third term is the contribution of\nthe thermal noise. The thermal noise term in Eq.(2.8) can be written as\n\'For 1OSGS100,x=0.3 is a g o d approximation.\n\n8\n\nwhere kB is the Boltzmann\'s constant, RL is the detector resistance, Ter is the equivalent noise temperature of\nthe detector, and B is the (two sided) detector bandwidth (Hertz) which can be related to the detector impulse\nresponse h (t ) by\nB =Eh2(t)dt\n\n.\n\n(2.10)\n\nBecause the detector bandwidth i usually much higher than that of the signal bandwidth, the convolutions in\ns\nEqs. (2.7) and (2.8) can be approximated by\n(2.1 1)\n\nThe detector SNR,which can be defined as the ratio between signal and noise power, is therefore I31\n\nSNR\n\n(eG ~ P / hv ) ~\nR\n\n=\n\n[G2F(%+ib)PR\ne\n\n2kgT\n\n+ i, + FIBL\n\n(2.12)\n\n\'\n\nwhere we have substitutedthe mean square of G by the product of the excess noise factor F and G2.\n2.2 Optical Sources\nOrdinary incoherent sources, because of the large beam divergence, are not suitable for long-range\noptical links. The output of lasers, on the other hand, is both spatially and temporally coherent. At large\ndistances, the use of lasers permits higher signal power to be focused on the detector surface.\nAmong the possible contenders for ISL laser transmitters are the CO, lasers [81], [82], solid state\nNdYAG lasers [83]-[85]. and semiconductor lasers based on GaAs-AIGaAs [5], [131,[201. The He-Ne laser,\nalthough well developed, is not suitable for the ISL application because of its low efficiency (0.01%) and small\navailable power output.\nEarly efforts in developing optical ISL lasers concenmted on the CO, laser operating at 10.6 pm\n[81] [82]. Researchers have demonstrated CO, lasers capable of delivering several watts at 10%efficiency and\na lifetime expectancy exceeding 50,000 hours [821. Because of the lack of proper detectors at 10.6 pm\nwavelength, heterodyne receivers must be used in CO, systems. Electro-optic modulation techniques have\n\n9\n\nbeen developed to modulate the laser at high data rates. Recent results have shown that CdTe modulators\ncapable of PSK modulation at bandwidths as high as 5 GHz can be manufactured [82]. The modulator\nproduces 1 3 W of averaged modulated sideband power with 6.2 W of input power [82]. However, CO,\n.\nsystems are no longer being seriously considered because of the large diffraction loss associated with the long\nwavelength and the complexity of heterodyne receiver needed to detect the long-wavelength radiation. In\naddition, the use of a gas laser operating in space poses additional problems for both reliability and system\ndesign.\nAn alternative to the CO, laser is the solid state Nd:YAG laser operating at 1064 nm and frequency\n\ndoubled, 532 nm, wavelengths [2], [831-[85]. Direct detection laser communication links based on NdYAG\nlasers can be easily constructed because of high detector sensitivities at these wavelengths. In addition,\nmode-locked Nd:YAG lasers can be constructed with high modulation rates. One serious disadvantage of the\nNd:YAG laser is the required external pump source. This results in considerably lower efficiencies than that\nfor the CO, laser and lower overall power output. In addition, to compensate for the lower output power, a\nnarrower transmitter beamwidth must be used which in turn demands a more stringent requirement in tracking\nand pointing of the telescopes. Pumping sources for Nd:YAG lasers include lamp pumping with low pressure\npotassium rubidium (KRb) arc lamps, solar pumping, and diode pumping with GaAs lasers [2], [83], [85].\nFlash lamp pumping has been demonstrated to have a 0.1% efficiency which produces a laser power output of\n270 mW with 250 W of electrical input power [2], [83]. Solar pumping has also been demonstrated and the\nresults indicate that over 400 mW of average power can be produced with a 60 cm solar collector [2], [83]. For\nsatellite applications, diode pumping is by far the most attractive technique for pumping Nd:YAG lasers. By\ndoping the GaAs injection laser diode, the device can be made to lase at 810 nm which results in an excellent\nmatch to the 810 nm NdYAG absorption band [2],[83],[85]. A power efficiency of 0.6% has been\ndemonstrated with only 40 W of supply power needed to generate 270 mW of output power[2],[83].\nRecently, by using a tightly focused end-pump geometry, pumping efficiency as high as 8% had been achieved\nwhich resulted in 80 mW CW power output with only 1 W of electrical power into a single semiconductor\nlaser array pump [85]. In addition to the required external pump source, Nd:YAG lasers also suffer from the\nrequirement of an external modulator which can severely attenuate the signal power and consume more prime\nelectric power.\n\n10\n\nWith the improvements in device efficiencyand reliability in recent years, there has been considerable\ninterest in developing a semiconductor laser based optical ISL as an alternative to Nd:YAG or CO, systems.\nSemiconductor devices have high power efficiency and offer room temperature operation without extensive\ncooling requirements. However, smaller output power is available from semiconductor devices. The\nsensitivity of lasing frequency with respect t junction temperature and injection current density implies that\no\nprecise control over temperature and current must be maintained. Furthermore, the variation of index of\nrefraction in the lasing cavity with varying injection current density can result in a large carrier phase\nfluctuation which can seriously deteriorate the performance of the heterodyne channel. Direct detection\nsystems employing GaAs laser diodes are insensitive to the phase fluctuations, and have been thoroughly\ninvestigated for land-based fiber optics links [10],[86].\n\nFor a spacebome, direct detection optical\n\ncommunication system, laser power on the order of a hundred milliwatts is necessary. Commercial laser\ndiodes are currently available with output power up to 30 mW and product lifetime of approximately 20,000\nhours. These devices generally emit in a single spatial mode but provide very little control over the lasing\nfrequency, which depends on the the drive current and temperature 1861. Consequently. such devices are\nsuitable only for direct detection system implementations. Higher laser power (several hundred milliwatts in\nCW operation) have been reported in laboratory works [87]-[90]. The modulation bandwidth of the laser diode\n\ni another important factor in choosing a laser diode. High speed (>lo GHz) [91] operation of the diode laser\ns\nhas been reported. However, it should be noted that laser diodes designed for high speed operation generally\n\nhave a small output power. In the near future, it is expected that, with improved fabrication technologies such\n\nas molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD),\nbetter uniformity\nlasers [92].[93] grown with these\ncan be achieved for large structures. Multiple quantum-well (MQW)\ntechniques should be more efficient than the currently available devices. A uniform fabrication process will\nalso improve device yield and reduce the production cost in addition to offering improved performance. With\nthe inclusion of these technologies, it is expected that single laser diodes with 60-100 mW CW output power\nlevel can be reliably manufactured within the next few years.\nWith the output power of a single laser diode limited, further improvement in the transmitter laser power\ncan be achieved using a phase-locked diode array, or by noncoherently combining the power from several\ndifferent wavelength sources. The phase-locked laser diode array is currently at its infancy. Lasing power as\n\nhigh as several watts has been achieved for laboratory devices [941,[951. However, devices that are presently\navailable suffer f o poor spatial b a quality as the lasing mode in the diode array is dominated by the\nrm\nem\nhigher order supermodes that are characterized by the double-lobed intensity pattern at the far-field. Several\ntechniques can be used to suppress the higher order supermodes and obtain a single-lobed far-field pattern.\nOne such technique is to injection lock the laser diode array with a coherent injection source. This method has\n\nbeen successfully demonstrated to generate 315 mW of output power using a 20-element GaAlAs gain-guided\ncoupled-strip array with 3.9 mW of incident power [96]. Another technique is to tailor the gain or stripe\nspacing of the array structure in order to suppress the higher order supermodes [97]. Diffraction coupling [98]\nand holographic grating E991 can also be used to channel the output of individual lasers into one central farfield pattern. In addition t the linear snipe array, the Y-junction array [lOO], [I011 has also been proposed in\no\nwhich the lowest order mode is selected by the interference between lasing stripes.\nHigher laser power can also be obtained by noncoherently combining the output power from a number\nof laser diodes. Several techniques can be used to combine the laser power. Figure 2.1 illustrates the dichroicpolarizer combiner with 8 laser diodes [102].[103],[104]. These diodes are organized at 4 different\nwavelengths and different polarizations. A narrow band dielectric polarizer can be designed such that it is\nhighly reflective to one polarization state but appears highly transmissive to the other. Optical signals with\ndifferent polarizations can be combined using such a polarizer. Dichroic elements that act as optical edge\nfilters can then be used to combine output signals from different wavelengths. Note that the efficiency of the\npower combining technique depends critically on the property of the optical surfaces. When combining output\nfrom a large number of laser diodes, the losses at the surfaces may offset the gain in the power, making the\ncombining system highly inefficient.\n\nIn addition to the dichroic combiner, optical power combining at different wavelengths can also be\nachieved using gratings [102], [103], [I051 or waveguide multiplexing techniques [IOZ],[103]. A grating\nrhomb combiners[105] has been developed with which power combination of more than 100 laser diodes\nappears feasible. However, precision alignment and frequency control are required for the grating combining\ntechnique. For the waveguide multiplexed system, the large insertion and coupling losses of the waveguides\ncan severely reduce the power that can be effectively combined.\n\n12\n\nA\n-\n\nA?\n\nA\nAi\n\n;\ne\n\nhi BY DEVICE SELECTION\n\n0\n\nPOL\n\nDIELECTRIC POLARIZER\n\n0\n\nDICHROIC\n\nSHORT WAVE PASS\nDICHROIC MIRROR\n\nFig.2.1. The structures of a noncoherent power corn: h e r for laser diodes.\n\nI\n\nI\nI\n\n13\n\nNoncoherent combining of several laser diode outputs can be used to generate sufficient power output\nfor the direct detection ISL. When a heterodyne receiver, is used to detect the optical signal, however,\nadditional constraints must be placed on the frequency stability of the transmitter laser. Laser diodes designed\nfor high power output and diode arrays generally have spectral linewidths on the order of 0.01-1 nm or,\nequivalently, 109-1011Hz, and provide little control over the lasing mode. These devices are not suitable for\nthe heterodyne system because the lack of mode stabilization implies a large frequency fluctuation at the\noptical output. Furthermore, the large linewidth implies a large Canier phase fluctuation which can seriously\naffect the performance of the decoder. Instead, mode stabilized laser diodes with narrow spectral linewidths\nmust be used. These laser diodes generally employ feedback to improve the frequency stability and reduce the\nlinewidth. Several approaches can be used to achieve stable single mode operations; they are (a) short cavity\nlasers [106].[107], (b) coupled-cavity lasers [108], [109], (c) external light injection [106],[110], and (d) lasers\nwith grating feedback [106], [111]-[116]. However, these frequency control techniques generally have very\nlow gains such that small signal power is available from the laser diode. Fortunately, over the past few years,\nsteady improvements have been made in the power output and the spectral linewidth of laser diodes. Output\npower on the order of 10 mW and linewidth on the order of several megahertz have been achieved on\nlaboratory devices [106], [111]-[116]. When coupled with an external cavity, linewidths as narrow as tens of\n\nI\nI\n\n1\n1\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nkilohertz have been reported [117]-[119]. Again, it should be noted that lasers designed for narrow spectral\nlinewidth operations generally have small output power. In the future, it is expected that, with an improved\nfabrication technology, frequency stabilized lasers with averaged power output on the order of 20-30 mW can\nbe manufactured [6]-[8].\n\nThe comparison of various candidates for spaceborne laser transmitters is shown in Table 2.1. Note that\nsemiconductor lasers offer smaller device size, lower cooling requirement, and higher reliability.\nConsequently, for the rest of the discussion we shall assume that semiconductor lasers are used. The output\npowers of lasers are assumed to be 200 mW for lasers used in direct detection systems, and 25 mW for signal\nmode, frequency stabilized lasers used in heterodyne systems.\n\n1\n\nI\n\n1\n1\n14\n\nI\nI\n\nTable 2.1 Comparison of ISL laser transmitters.\n\nSystem\n\nDisadvantages\n\nAdvantages\n~\n\nco2\n\nHigh power output\n\nLarge diffraction loss\nLow detection sensitivity\n\na 10.6 pwavelength\nt\nLow reliability\nHigh power output\n\nLow pumping efficiency\n\nHigh detection sensitivity\n\nNd:YAG\n\nStringent pointing and\n\nat 1.06 and 0.53 p\n\ntracking requirements\n\nSmall diffraction loss\nGaAs-AIGaAs\n\nHigh efficiency\n\nLarge frequency and\n\nHigh reliability\n\nphase fluctuations\n\nHigh detection sensitivity\n\nLow power output\n\nSmall diffraction loss\n\nStringent pointing and\ntracking requirements\n\nEasy to modulate\n\nLarge spurious AM and FN\n\nSmall size\n\n15\n\n2.3 Transmitter Design\n\nThe purpose of the optical transmitter is to focus the optical signal onto the receiver aperture. When a\nlaser is used as the primary optical source, a beam expander is often employed to reduce the diffraction loss.\nDepending on the cost, size, and weight constraints, a beam expander can be of either refractive or reflective\ndesign. Figure 2.2 shows the alternative beam expander configurations. Because of the high cost of low-loss\nlens materials, reflective beam expanders are used almost exclusively for large telescope designs.\nThe propagation of the optical signal through a dispersion free media has been studied extensively. The\nintensity of the far-field signal at an angular distance & from the transmitter line-of-sight &OS) can be written\n\nas\n\nwhere GT is the transmitter antenna gain, PL is the transmitter power, q~ is the transmitter optical efficiency,\nand LT(&) is the pointing loss factor associated with the angular pointing error 6 ~For the case where the\n.\nsignal at the output of the beam expander can be approximated by a uniformly illuminated, circular disk of\nradius dT, the transmitter antenna gain and the pointing loss term can be written as [O].\n[120]\nc\n\n(2.15)\n\nThe far-field intensity distribution of a uniformly illuminated circular aperture is known as the Airy pattern.\nFigure 2.3 is a plot of the Airy pattern versus the radial angular distance 6~ from the transmitter LOS. It is\nseen that the far-field intensity drops off rapidly when the angular deviation approaches kldT. In fact, the\nmagnitude of the Airy function is zero when r l z Z1.22hld~.\nThe transmitter antenna gain and the pointing loss factor in Eqs. (2.14) and (2.15) are calculated \xe2\x82\xacor a\nuniformly illuminated aperture. In reality, the spatial intensity distribution at the output of the beam expander\nis better approximated by a truncated Gaussian distribution. Furthermore, because of the center obstruction of\nthe Cassegrainian reflector, the gain of an actual transmitter antenna is usually smaller than hat given by\n(2.14). The effect of field distribution and Center obstruction on the transmitted signal has been C d U l l y\n16\n\nREFAACT I NG BEAM\n\nEXP:iNDER\n\nPrimary\nMirror\n\nF\n?\n\nCASSEGRAI NI AN\n\nFig.2.2.\n\nTELESCOPE\n\nTypical beam expander config xations.\n\n17\n\nI\n\n1\n1\n\nI .o\n\n0.9\n\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n\n0.5\n0.4\n\n0.3\n0.2\n\n0.1\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\nPOINTING ERROR Q 1 - d T / X\n\nFig.2.3.

It is seen that for a given center obstruction and the transmitter diameter, an optimal RMS\nwidth of the Gaussian beam can be found which maximizes the on-axis gain at the far-field. The power\npenalty associated with the center obstruction is then plotted in Fig. 2.4. It is seen that a 1 dB power penalty is\nincurred on the system by using a truncated Gaussian beam rather than a uniformly illuminated aperture. The\npower penalty then increases with the obscuration ratio, which is the ratio between the primary and secondary\nmirror diameters. When the obscuration ratio increases from 0 to 0.5, over 3.5 dB of power penalty can be\nexpected. In some cases, the spider support for the center reflector can also have a measurable effect on the far\nfield intensity [121]. However, such effects are usually insignificant except when the obscuration ratio is small\n\n(c0.2) [1211.\nIn addition to reducing the diffraction loss of the transmitted signal, the transmitter must also maintain\nthe line-of-sight (LOS) tracking of the receiver. Because of the small beam divergence of the optical signal (=\n10 pad), care must be taken at the optical transmitter to maintain the receiver within its footprint. Because\n\nboth transmitter and receiver terminals are in motion for an ISL link, their relative angular position is\nconstantly changing. In order to maintain the receiver within the primary diffraction pattern of the transmitted\nsignal, receiver motion must be acquired and tracked at the transmitter. In practice, this tracking control is\naccomplished using a separate spatial tracking subsystem. Because of noises in the system, however, some\nresidual errors will remain in the LOS tracking. Such tracking errors can inflict an additional constraint in\ndesigning the optical transmitter. This design constraint will be discussed in detail in Chapter 5.\n2.4 Receiver Design\nAt the receiver, the transmitted optical signal is collected and focused onto the photodetector. In\ngeneral, a large collecting disk, usually of similar design to that of the transmitter telescope, is used to collect\nthe optical radiation. Receiver and transmitter can share the same telescope to reduce the system size, cost, and\nweight. However, for systems employing the single telescope design, cross talk between the transmitter and\nreceiver resulting from optical leakage must be carefully minimized. Alternatively, optical links may be\ndesigned using separate transmitter and receiver telescopes. Such systems offer better transmitter-receiver\nisolation and allow modular design for the optical component. However, the size and weight of the optical\nsystem must be significantly increased to accommodate the additional optical components.\n\n19\n\nOBSCURATION RATIO. >\n\n1\n\nI\nFig.2.4. Optimal transmitter telescope efficiency relative t an unobscured uniformly illuminated aperture\no\nas a function of the obscuration ratio. (From B. J. Klein and J. J. Degnan, "Optical Antenna Gain,\n1. Transmitting Antennas,"Appl. Opt., 13, Scpt. 1974; p.2139. )\n\nI\n\nD\n\nI\n1\n1\n\nGiven the transmitted intensity pattern of (2.13). the total signal power collected by the receiver can be\nrelated to the transmitter power by [601\n\nwhere GT, are the uansmitter and receiver antenna gains, q ~T\\R are the transmitter and receiver optics\nGR\n,\nefficiencies, and LT(\xe2\x82\xac)T) the loss associated with a angular pointing error of \xe2\x82\xacIT. The gain of the receiver\nis\nantenna can be related to the diameter of the receiver aperture and the wavelength by [122]\n2\n\nc\n\n.\n\n(2.17)\n\ni\n\nEquation (2.16) was derived assuming that the area of the receiver aperture is small compared to the primary\ndiffraction pattern such that the total power can be approximated by the product of the aperture area and the\nsignal intensity. Furthermore, it was assumed that the receiver aperture is uniformly illuminated without\ncenter obstruction. A smaller receiver gain can be expected when using a Cassegrainian telescope [122].\nOptical receivers can be divided into two classes: those that detect only the intensity fluctuation, and\nthose that detect both amplitude and phase of the optical radiation [3]. The former type, usually known as the\ndirect detection receiver, employs little optical processing and detects the signal by directly focusing the\ncollected optical signal onto a photodetector. The latter, known as the heterodyne receiver, requires a precise\nalignment between the received optical signal and the local oscillator (LO) laser, but offers a more optimal\ndetection sensitivity.\nFigure 2.5 shows the basic block diagram of a direct detection receiver. The optical signal is collected\nby the receiver telescope and, after passing through optical and spatial filters, is focused directly onto a\nphotodetector. The optical filter in the receiver allows only radiations near the signal wavelength to pass\nthrough. Optical filtering can be accomplished using an interference filter, the passband of which is typically\non the order of tens of angstroms. The spatial filtering in the receiver is achieved using a field stop iris, and is\nnecessary to reduce the receiver field-of-view (FOV). Because no use is made of the spatial and temporal\ncoherence of the transmitted signal, direct detection receivers are also known as noncoherent receivers.\nIn the absence of the background radiation, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the direct detection\nreceiver is simply the ShT of the detector given by Eq. (2.12). When the background radiation is detected in\n21\n\ne\n\nDetector\n\nInterference\nFi I t e r\n\nField\nIris\n\nOb j e c tiv e\nLens\n\nFig.2.5. Block diagram of 3 direct detcction receiver.\n\n22\n\naddition to the signal, the receiver S N R is given by\n\n(2.18)\n\nThe numerator in (2.16) is the signal power due to a constant (dc) signal power PS,and the denominator is the\nsum of shot noise and thermal noise power admitted by the receiver of bandwidth B . When the signal power\nis much higher than the thermal and background noise powers, and when the detector dark current can be\nignored compared to the signal current, the signal shot noise is the dominant noise source. In this case the\ndetector is said to be shot noise limited and the receiver S N R is given by\n(2.19)\n\nThe principal advantage of the direct detection receiver is its simplicity. When operating undcr a\nrestricted environment, the simplicity in design usually leads to an improved reliability and a longer meantime-to-failure (\n.\n\nHowever, when operating under low signal power and high background levels, the\n\nS N R of the direct detection receiver can degrade appreciably because of the large thermal and background\nnoise. Performance can be improved by increasing signal power or by using high gain photomultipliers.\nHowever, both methods are impractical for a spaceborne system because of limitations on the available output\npower and the lack of suitable photomultipliers at the optical wavelengths of interest The effect of thermal\nnoise on the detector sensitivity can be reduced by using the avalanche photodetector. Alternatively, the\ndetection sensitivity can be improved by using the heterodyne receiver.\nFigure 2.6 depicts the structure of a typical heterodyne receiver. The incoming signal is spatially mixed\nwith a strong local oscillator (LO) beam. The combined optical signal is then focused onto a photodetcctor.\nOptical field mixing at the detector surface can be described in terms of the diffraction patterns at the focal\nplane or, equivalently, in terms of the back-projected signal and LO field distributions over the receiver\naperture plane. If we let 3 and 3\n:\n\n, denote the elecmc field vector of the signal and LO field at the receiver\n\na p e m e plane, respectively, then the total power incident on the detector surface is\n(2.20)\n\nwhere\n\nLO\n\nis the impedance of the media surrounding the photodetector, and the integral is extcndcd over the\n\n23\n\n-\n\n1\n\nBe am\nSplitter\n\nDemodulator\n\nSignal\n\nBeam\nE\n\nFocus i ng\nLens\n\n-8\n\n-\n\n1\n\nI I\nE LO\nL o c a l Oscillator\nBeam\n\nFig.2.6.

The\nmagnitude o PIF(~) largest when the signal and LO fields are spatially matched over the entire receiver\nf\nis\naperture. For intersatellite links, the distance between the receiver and the transmitter is usually so large that\nthe received signal can be approximated by a plane wave on the receiver aperture. Then for a uniform LO\nfield, the integral in Eq.(2.23) will depend only on the relative polarization and propagation directions of signal\nand LO. By substituting the expressions for plane waves into (2.23) and integrating over the aperture area, the\nIF signal power can be written as\n\n(2.24)\nwhere\n\n(2.25)\n\n25\n\nare the signal and LO powers, and qha is the heterodyne efficiency which is defined as\n\n.\n\n<\n\n(2.26)\n\n1\n\n1\n\nWhen both the signal and LO are plane waves that cover the entire receiver aperture, the heterodyne efficiency\ncan be evaluated to be:\n\nwhere y p and\n\nOR\n\nare the angular differences between the polarization direction and the propagation axes of\n\nthe signal and LO, respectively. The factor LR( 9 ~ is the loss factor due to the spatial tracking error between\n)\nthe signal and LO. When both signal and LO are plane waves extending over the receiver aperture of diameter\n\n(2.28)\nWhen the incident wavefronts at the receiver aperture can not be approximated by plane waves, Eq.(2.26)\nshould be used to evaluate qhu. In order to obtain a maximum detection sensitivity, both polarization\ndirections and propagation axes of the signal and LO must be carefully matched. Because polarization\nalignment is relatively easy to accomplish, the principal loss in the heterodyne receiver is due to the tracking\nerror between the propagation axes. By assuming that the polarization directions of the signal and LO are\nperfectly aligned, the IF power at the output of the receiver can be written as\n\nBecause the signal power is usually much smaller than the LO power, the output of the photodetector\ncan be modeled as the sum of a large dc current due to PLOan IF current due to PIF,and the associated shot\n,\nnoise. The dc current can be effectively removed by passing the photodetector output through an IF amplifierfilter or, alternatively, it can be removed by using a dual detector configuration shown in Figure 2.7 [123]. By\nusing one detector at each port of the beam splitter and coherently subtracting the two detector outputs, it is\npossible to eliminate the large dc contribution from the LO and greatly reduce the noise due to the fluctuation\nin LO strength. After removing the large dc current due to the LO, the IF signal is given by\n\n26\n\nI\nI\nI\n1\nI\nI\nI\n1\nI\nI\n\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\n,\n&\n\nDETECTOR\'I\n\nPREAMP\n\nOUTPUT\nDETECTOR \' 2\n\nPREAYP\n\nELECTRONICS\n\nREFLECTIVITY-1\n\nI\n\n1\n\nt\nLOCAL\nOSCILLATOR\n\nI\n\nI\n\nFREOUENCY CONTROL\n\nFig.2.7.

In the limit of large LO power,\n\na\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\n1\n\nthermal noise and shot noise due to signal and background radiations will be negligible compared to the LO\nshot noise. In this case the S N R reduces to that of an ideal, quantum limited photodetector [ 3 ] ,[26],[27]:\n(2.33)\n\nNote that because of the large LO strength, pin diode can be used to detect heterodyned signal. The excess\nnoise factor for the pin diode is equal to 1 . Compared to the SNR of a direct detection receiver given in (2.16)\nit is seen that, when spatial tracking between the signal and LO is perfectly established, the heterodyne\nreceiver offers a significant improvement in S N R over the direct detection receiver. Background radiation and\nthermal noise that affect the direct detection receiver can be easily overcome by increasing the LO signal\nstrength.\n2.5 Background Radiation\nIn addition to the transmitted signal power, optical receivers also collcct background radiation. The\n\namount of background power collected by the receiver depends on the receiver\'s ficld of view (FOV) and the\noptical bandwidth [124] [125]. In order to reduce the amount of background power admitted by the receiver, it\nis desirable to have as small a receiver FOV and optical bandwidth as possible. Receiver FOV can be limited\n\nusing a field stop in the optical path. However, the pointing and tracking problems are more severe with small\n\nD\n1\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n1\n1\n\nFOV. Typical values of the receiver FOV are on the order of 0.1 mrad. Similarly, the receiver optical\nbandwidth can be limited using an interference filter. For a white background radiation, the amount of power\nadmitted by an interference filter is proportional to its bandwidth. However, the transmittances of typical\ninterference filters decrease with decreasing bandwidth. Consequently,at small optical bandwidths the signal\nitself may be severely attenuated. For most applications, interference filters with bandwidths of 10-20 A and\ntransmittancesof 50-70% are used.\nThe amount of background power incident on the receiver can in general be measured in terms of the\n\nspectral radiant emittance " 1 which is the radiant power at wavelength h emitted into a hemisphere per unit\n()\narea of source in the hemisphere. Assuming a Lambertian source of diameter d, at a distance z from the\nreceiver, the amount of background power incident on the detector surface can be written as [124]. [125]\n(2.34)\nwhere\n\nq~ is the receiver optical efficiency,\nds is the source aperture diameter,\ndR is the receiver aperture size, and\n\nA1 is the bandwidth of the interference filter.\n\nEquation (2.34) was derived for a background source that is contained within the receiver FOV. For an\nextended source where the size of the object is larger than the FOV, the background power is given to a good\napproximation by [1241, [1251\n\n(2.35)\nwhere QR is the solid angle receiver FOV which can be related to the planar angle FOV by\n\nno$\n\nR =7 .\nR\n\n(2.36)\n\nFor smaller sources such as stars, the background radiation is usually measured in terms of the spectral\nirradiance H ( I ) which is the power per unit wavelength incident on a unit area of the receiver. For a given\n\n29\n\nspectral irradianceH (A), the background power collected by the receiver is given by [1241\n(2.37)\nThe total background power collected by the receiver is the sum of powers due to earth reflection, the\nmoon, the planets, and the stars. The radiation due to the sun is usually so intense that direct communication\nwith the sun in the background is not achievable using direct detection receivers. Figure 2.8 shows the spectral\nradiant emittance of the earrh versus wavelength. Note that for the wavelength of interest (850 nm for GaAs\ndiode lasers), W(h)is on the order of 10-*W/cm2-w. As indicated in the figure, this measurement is carried\nout when there is no cloud cover in the earth\'s atmosphere. Radiance from cloud-covered earth is\napproximately one order of magnitude higher than that given by the figure and represents the strongest\nbackground source to be considered. By evaluating the amount of received power using the assumed receiver\ncharacteristics shown in Table 2.2, the background power due to earth reflection can be seen to be\n\nPE\n\n;{\n\nlO-\'OW with cloud cover,\n\n(Earth reflection)\n10-11W no cloud.\n\nNext to the earth reflection, lunar spectral irradiance is the strongest background emission source. Figure\n2.9 is a plot of the lunar and planetary spectral irradiance versus wavelength which shows, typically, a spectral\nirradiance of the moon is approximately lo-\' W/cm2-pm. Because of the close proximity of the moon, the\namount of background power gathered due to the moon cannot be evaluated using Eq.(2.37) since it assumes\nthe receiver FOV is greater than the angular span of the moon while actually only a portion of the moon is\nvisible within the receiver FOV.

It i seen that semiconductor lasers with\ns\nsufficiently high power and reliability can be used as the primary transmitter for an intersatellite link. The\nsignal and background power collected by the ISL receiver have been derived as functions of the transmitter\nand the receiver parameters. Both direct and heterodyne receivers can be used to implement the optical link.\nThe direct detection receiver offers simplicity in design and a potentially higher reliability, but is more\nsensitive to the thermal and background noises. The sensitivity with respect to the thermal noise can be\nimproved at the cost of increasing gain fluctuation by using an APD. On the other hand, the heterodyne\nreceiver promises a much improved detection sensitivity and a better background noise rejection. However,\nthe higher complexity of the receiver implies lower reliability and longer development time. For the design of\nthe practical ISL, it is the probability of bit error (PBE) that is of ultimate interest. Given the signal and\nbackground powers at the receiver, the PBE for systems employing the direct and heterodyne receivers will be\n\n8\n\nB\nI\nI\nI\nI\n1\n\nanalyzed in the next two chapters.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n34\n\n10-9\n\n-3\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.5\n\n10\n.\n\n20\n\n50\n.\n\n10.0\n\nWavelength, h. microns\n\nFig.2.10.

DIRECT DETECTION SYSTEMS\n\nIn the previous chapter the signal and background power collected by the receiver were evaluated as\nfunctions of the link design. Given the signal and background power at the receiver, it is of interest to evaluate\nthe performance of the link in data communication. In particular, we are interested in a digital link in which\nthe information is first digitally encoded before being modulated onto the optical carrier. In this chapter, the\nperformance of a direct detection optical communication link will be analyzed.\n3.1 Digital Encoding Schemes\nIn a typical M-ary digital communication link the information to be transmitted consists of a sequence of\ncodewords ( d l d ~ d ~ )where each dk can take on values between (O,l,...,M- 1). A modulator then maps the\n..., ,\ncodewords (Q ) into a set of transmitter waveforms [Sdk (t )) . During each of the transmission intervals, the\ncodeword dk is transmitted by sending a waveform\n\nSdk(t)\n\nover the channel. When M = 2 , the communication\n\nsystem is referred to as a binary channel. For M > 2 , the system is known as an M-ary (block encoded)\nchannel. For a binary channel, each transmitted waveform carries exactly one bit of informatior..\nConsequently, the bit data rate R of the binary channel is equal to the rate of transmission of waveforms R,.\nFor M -ary channels, on the other hand, several bits can be encoded into one transmitted waveform such that,\non the average, log2M bits are transmitted per waveform. The bit data rate associated with the M -ary channel\nis therefore\n\nThe actual symbols transmitted over the channel can be any of the amplitude, frequency, or phase\nmodulated signals. For optical communication systems employing direct detection receivers, only the signal\nintensity is detected so that the modulation schemes are limited to polarization and intensity modulations,\nPolarization modulated signals can be detected as an intensity modulated signal by polarization filtering prior\nto photodetection. Polarization modulation can be accomplished using an electro-optic material, and intensity\nmodulation of the transmitter laser can be achieved by varying the injection current of the laser diode [126], or\nby using an external electro-optic [127]-[129] or electro-absorption[ 130141321 modulator.\n\n36\n\nI\n8\nI\nI\n!\n1\n1\n8\n\nI\nI\n\n8\n1\n\nModulation schemes commonly used in direct detection systems include on-off-keying (OOK)and\npulse-position modulation (PPM). In OOK the binary data are transmitted as a sequence of optical pulses such\nthat a binary one is transmitted by the presence of the pulse while the absence of the pulse signals a binary\nzero. A typical OOK encoded signal is shown in Fig. 3.1. Alternatively, information can be encoded in the\n\nI\nI\n\nPPM scheme. In a M-ary PPM system, each word frame is divided into M time slots. Information is then\n\nI\n\nrequirement for a high order PPM system is significantly larger than that of an OOK system. Furthermore,\n\nI\nI\n1\n\nI\n1\n1\nI\n1\n\n8\nI\nI\nI\n\ntransmitted by sending an optical pulse in one of the M time slots. Fig. 3.2 shows a typical PPM encoded\nsignal. Because multiple bits of information can be transmitted using a single pulse, PPM is more power\nefficient than OOK. On the other hand, because each word is divided into many time slots, the bandwidth\n\nPPM systems are more complicated and more difficult to implement. However, as we shall see, PPM systems\noffer significant improvements in performance over OOK systems, and are therefore more suitable for\nspaceborne applications.\n3.2 Detector Statistics and MAP Decoding\nBecause photodetection is essentially a discrete process, output of the photodetector is corrupted by the\nsignal shot noise in addition to the detector thermal noise. The detector photocount rate, which is related to the\nreceived optical power by Eq. (2.1), can be written as\n\nwhere & ( t ) is the photocount rate associated with the signal s ( t ) , and 1 is the count rate due to the uniform\nq\n,\nbackground radiation. The purpose of the digital demodulator, therefore, is to determine which of the M\nwaveforms ( s k ( l ) ) was transmitted given the detector output r ( t ) .\nIn order to decode the transmitted information, the receiver performs the maximum a posteriori (MAP)\ndecision [133]. Under this criterion, the output of the photodetector is observed over a given symbol period\n(0, T,).The decoder then selects the codeword that has the highest probability of having being transmitted.\n\nMathematically, given the output of the photodetector r (t ), O [IT,, the decoder selects the codeword which\nS\nmaximizes\n\nP (sk (t ) Ir (t))= probability that Sk ( t ) was transmitted given the received signal r (t )\n\n37\n\n(3.3)\n\nY\ne\n..\n\n-\n\n-\n\nu)\n\nI\nI\n1\nI\nI\n\nI\n\nb\n\nP\nFig.3.1.

P(sl(t)Ir(r))=P(so(t)Ir(t)), then both s o ( t ) and s l ( t ) are equally\nIf\nlikely to be transmitted and a random decision i made to determine the decoder output. Similarly, for an M s\n\nary block encoded system, the decoder outputs the k* codeword if P(sk(t) Ir ( t ) ) is the largest among the M\nposterior probabilities. In the case where several highest posterior probabilities are equal, a random decision is\nmade among these codewords.\nFor systems where codewords have equal prior probabilities to be transmitted, the MAP decision rule\nreduces to the maximum likelihood (ML) test [133] where the receiver compares the likelihood function\n\nand makes the decision by choosing the codeword corresponding to the maximum likelihood function. The\nlikelihood function in Eq. (3.4) is easier to evaluate than the posterior probability function in Eq. (3.3) and,\nconsequently, for systems with equal priors, the ML test is often used.\nIn general, given the detector output in Eq. (2.3). the probabilities in Eqs. (3.3) and (3.4) are difficult to\ncalculate. Under two special conditions, however, the calculation of the likelihood function Ak can be\nsimplilied significantly. The first case is when both thermal noise and detector gain noise can be ignored. In\nthis quantum limited case the detector simply counts the number of photons detected during each interval.\nSection 3.3 describes the performance of this quantum limited detector. Another special case of interest is\nwhen the random avalanche gain is significant such as when APDs are used as the primary photodetectors. In\nthis case, the output of the detector can be approximated by Gaussian statistics and the calculation of prior\nprobabilities Ak can be greatly simplified. Section 3.4 discusses the performance of ML decoders when using\nAPDs.\n\n3.3 The MAP Decoder for Photon Counting Receivers\nThe optimal photodetector measures the arrival time of each photon. The PMTs, with their large internal\ngains, can best approximate the quantum limited detectors. For systems using a quantum limited detector, the\nprobability of observing k photons during the period (0, T,)at timeT=(T1;52, . . . ,OL) is given by [741\n\n.\n\n39\n\nwhere h(s) is the photocount rate at time 6.For systems where the photocount rate X ( Q is maintained constant\nthroughout the period (0, T,), Eq. (3.5) reduces to\n\nNote that Eq. (3.6) depends only on the number of photons received during the period (0, Ts), not on the\nand\narrival time of individual photons. Consequently, for the MAP decoding of OOK and PPM signals where\nrectangular pulses are transmitted, the optimal decoder measures only the number of photons received during\nthe period. For this reason, optimal, quantum limited detectors are often known as photon counting detectors.\nOOK Systems The maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoder for the OOK system compares the number of\nreceived photons with a threshold 8 and makes the decision based on the sign of the difference. If the number\nof received photons is greater than 8, a binary one is decoded. Otherwise, a binary zero is decoded. The\ndecision threshold 8 depends on the signal and background photocounts and the probability distribution of the\ntransmitted data. For systems with equal priors, 8 is given by [31\nr\n\n(3.7)\n\nwhere\n\nT, and K B = ~T, are the expected photocounts due to the signal and background radiations,\nB\n\nrespectively. In practice, the decoding can be achieved by integrating the photodetector output over a bit\nperiod, then comparing the integrator output with a threshold, as depicted in Fig. 3.3. If the detector impulse\nresponse time is short compared to the integration period and if thermal noise and detector gain noise can be\nneglected, the output of the integrator will be proportional to the number of photons received during the pulse\nperiod, and the MAP decision can be made accordingly.\nFor the MAP decision rule given above, a decision error occurs whenever y<8 and a binary 1 was\ntransmitted, or when y>8 and a binary 0 was transmitted. Using the fact that receiver photocounts are Poisson\ndistributed, the probability of bit error (PBE) for the OOK system is given by [3]\n(3.8)\n\nwhere r(8) and L(8) denote the smallest integer larger than 8 and the largest integer smaller than 8,\nrespectively.

The cusps in the curve are due to the fact that KS and KB are integer-\n\nvalued variables.\n\nOOK systems are simple and easy t construct However, the decision threshold in Eq. (3.7) depends on\no\nboth the signal and background photocounts. For systems where the signal and background intensities are not\nprecisely known, optimal performance cannot be achieved. Instead, when operating under conditions where\nthe signal and background strength are not known a priori, it is desirable to have a robust decoding algorithm\nthat does not depend on signal and background photocount rates. An obvious alternative is to use the pulseposition modulation scheme.\nPPM Systems\n\nThe optimal PPM decoder counts the number of photons in each of the M time slots and\n\nchooses the slot with largest photocount. Figure 3.5 shows a practical implementation of this decoding\nalgorithm. Because photocounts from the M time slots are compared, this decoding algorithm is insensitive to\nfluctuations in background and signal intensities. The probability of word error (PWE) for an M-ary PPM\nsystem using a quantum limited, photon counting detector is given by [3]\nP W E ( K ~ , K ~ . Mi )=\n(3.9)\nIl-kzpf-1\n\nMa\n\nwhere\n\nThe error rate given in Eq. (3.9) is difficult to evaluate. However, when the background count rate is much\nsmaller than the signal count rate, Eq.

Model of a PPM demodulator.\n\n44\n\nDecoded Data\n\n(3.12)\nThe error rate of a binary PPM channel can be further bounded by using the Chernoff bound [74], [133]\n\nWhen both signal and background counts are high, receiver photocounts in both signal and background slots\ncan be approximated by Gaussian random variables and the resulting error probability is given by\n\nPE(KsKB,2) = i e r f c\n,\n\nLl\nS\n~\nKS\n\n(3.14)\n\nThe validity of the union bound can be seen in Fig. 3.6 where the PWE of a 4-ary PPM system calculated\nusing Eqs. (3.9) and (3.10) is plotted against the signal photocount Ks. Note that the union bound gives an\nexcellent approximation of the error rate at high signal-to-noise ratios. A comparison of the binary PPM error\nrate calculated using the Chemoff bound, the Gaussian approximation, and the exact expression can be seen in\nFig. 3.7. It is seen that the Chemoff bound is tight for small background counts, and the Gaussian\napproximation is good when both signal and background counts are high. The error probabilities given in Eqs.\n(3.9) and (3.10) are the probabilities of word error (FWE). For communication system design, it is usually\ndesirable to specify the equivalent bit error probability for the system. The probability of bit error (PBE) for an\nM -ary PPM system can be related to the PWE by determining the probability that a given bit is incorrect after\nan erroneous decoding. In general, when an error occurs at the decoding, any bit will have a probability of\n\n(ID) be correctly decoded. However, out of the M possible codewords, one codeword will result in a correct\nto\ndecoding. Consequently,the PBE is related to the PWE by [31\n\nPBE =\n\n-W E .\nP\n2(M-1)\n\n(3.15)\n\nFigure 3.8 is a plot of the PBE vs the PPM order with the equivalent bit data rate and signal power fixed.\nNotice that the performance of the PPM improves with increasing PPM order, because at a fixed bit data rate\nR the word rate R, actually decreases with increasing PPM order. Consequently, at a fixed signal power the\n\nsignal photocount Ks increases with increasing PPM order. At the same time, since the equivalent slot period\ndecreases with increasing PPM order, the background count per time slot, KS ,decreases. Therefore, the PBE\n\nof the M - a r y PPM system decreases with increasing M.

In practice, both bandwidth and maximum peak power of lasers are limited by\nphysical constraints. Consequently,it is not possible to increase the PPM order indefinitely.\n\nlo\nIt should a s be noted that the improvement in system performance with increasing PPM order is\npossible only for systems where the transmitter laser has a perfect modulation extinction. In the presence of a\nfinite extinction ratio m ,receiver photocounts in the background slots are limited by the residual signal power.\nTherefore, even though the peak transmitter power increases with increasing PPM order, the background\nphotocount also increases proponionally. Consequently, there is a limit at which further increase in the PPM\norder will only result in an increasing error rate. Fig. 3.9 is a plot of the PBE versus the PPM order for a\nsystem with a constant data rate and fixed signal and background powers. Note that for a nonzero extinction\nratio, an optimum PPM order exists which minimizes the PBE.\n3.4 Avalanche Detectors\nPrevious considerations of direct detection receiver performance have assumed that quantum limited,\nphoton-counting detectors are used to detect the incoming optical radiation. In reality, when APDs are used in\nplace of the photodetectors for the receivers shown in Figs. 3.3 and 3.5, the output of the integrator is no\nlonger Poisson distributed because of the random avalanche gain. The derailed statisticsof the APD output are\ndifficult to characterize [75]-[77]. However, for communication receivers, the output of the integrator can be\neffectively approximated using Gaussian statistics [23]-[25]. The mean and variance of the integrator output\ncan be written as [23]\n(3.16)\n\n+e) e + K,:\nIb +\n\nvur (X ) = G *F (Ks\n+KB\n\n(3.17)\n\n,\n\nwhere\n(3.18)\n\nX = JoT\'i(t)dr\n\nis the integral of APD output over the period T, .

It is seen that a significantly higher signal power is\nneeded to compensate for the avalanche noise.\nFor an M -PPM system, each of the M integrator outputs in Fig. 3.5 is Gaussian distributed. Since only\none time slot contains the signal pulse, the integrator outputs for the remaining (M-1) time slots are\nidentically distributed.

(3.21) is calculated using the parameters shown in Table 2.2 and and plotted against the\nsignal photocount KS in Fig. 3.11. Again, it is seen that a much higher signal power is needed to overcome the\navalanche noise.\nGiven the receiver design, the gain of the APD is an important parameter which must be properly\nspecified. The higher the detector gain, the smaller the effect of thermal noise on the receiver SNR. However,\nhigher detector gain also implies larger excess noise factor which in turn can reduce the receiver SNR.\nConsequently, given the receiver parameter and the signal and background strength, there is an optimum\ndetector gain which maximizes the detector S M . This optimum detector gain can be calculated by\ndifferentiating Eq. (3.23) with respect to the detector gain G ,and solving the resulting equation. By using the\nfact that the excess noise factor F is related to the detector gain G by Eq. (2.6). and the assumption that the\ndetector dark current is small compared to the detector thermal noise, the optimum APD gain can be\napproximated by\n(3.25)\n\nGiven the receiver design and the signal strength, an optimum APD gain can be chosen to maximize the\nsystem performance.\nThe effect of a finite modulation extinction ratio on the PPM channel can also be analyzed using Eq.\n(3.23). In the presence of a finite extinction ratio m , the signal and background photocounts can be related to\n\nthe average signal and background power by\n\n53\n\nI\n\nI\n\n1\n\nI\n\n1\n\nlo-\'\n\n-\n\n7\n\n4-PPM\nF=5\n\n-\n\nlo-2\n10-3\n\nW\n\nIO-^\n\nm\n\na\n\nIO+\n\n-\n\n\\\n\nIO+\n\nIO-^\n10-8\n\nlo-\'o\n\n50\n\n100\n\nI50\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\nS I G N A L PHOTOCOUNT ( Ks)\n\nFig.3.11.

The word period Tw can be Written in\nk\nterms of the data rate R and the order of PPM as\nT, = logfl/R .\n\n(3.27)\n\nBy substituting Eqs. (3.26) and (3.27) into Eq. (3.23). the receiver SNR can be written as a function of the\nsignal and background power, as well as the data rate:\n\n(3.28)\n\nNote that the receiver S N R increases with increasing signal power and decreasing background power and data\nrate. When the modulation extinction ratio m is equal to 0, the receiver S N R increases asymptotically as\nlog2M. In the presence of a finite extinction ratio, however, the receiver S N R first increases with increasing\n\nM until an optimum S N R is reached, and further increase in M will only result in a smaller SNR. In general,\nthis optimum PPM order can be calculated by differentiating Eq. (3.28) with respect to M and solving the\nresulting equation. In the limit where the detector dark current, thermal noise, and background power are\nnegligible compared to the signal power, the optimum M is seen to satisfy\nM(lnM-l)=- m\n\n.\n\n(3.29)\n\nIt should be noted that in deriving Eq. (3.27), it has been assumed that the average signal power is maintained\nat a constant level regardless of the PPM order. This implies that the peak transmitter power increases linearly\nwith the PPM order M . In practice, because of device limitations, the peak power of lasers is often limited.\nFor such systems, the average transmitter power is a function of PPM order M ,and the optimal PPM order is\ndetermined not only by the extinction ratio m ,but also by the ratio between peak and avenge laser power.\n3.5 Summary\nThe performance of direct detection systems using OOK and PPM have been investigated. It is seen that\nPPM systems offer comparable PBE at a much lower signal power requirement. When the transmitter laser has\n55\n\na perfect modulation extinction, the PBE of the PPM systems is seen to improve with increasing PPM order at\nconstant signal power. Furthermore, the PPM signal can be decoded regardless of the signal and background\nstrength. The combination of these advantages makes PPM highly attractive for spaceborne implementations.\nFor these reason, it will be assumed in the following that PPM is used whenever direct detection systems are\nemployed. It should be noted that the performance analysis for PPM systems carried out in this chapter have\ntaken into account only the detector shot noise and thermal noise. Other noises that are present in a realistic\nPPM system, such as spatial and temporal tracking errors, have been ignored. In the presence of these errors,\nthe performance of the PPM system can be seriously deteriorated. The performance analysis of PPM systems\nunder spatial and temporal tracking errors will be carried out in Chapters 5 and 6, respectively.\n\nI\n8\n\n1\nI\nI\n\nI\n\n1\n\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\ni\n\nI\n56\n\nI\n1\n1\n\nI\nI\n1\nI\nI\nI\nI\n1\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\n4. HETERODYNE SYSTEMS\n\nThe direct detection PPM system described in the last chapter is structurally simple and easy to\nimplement. However, the large power requirement of a practical PPM link (5150-200 photons for 4-ary PPM\nat 10-9 error rate) presents a serious disadvantage in an ISL application where the available signal power is\nlimited. Alternatively, optical communication systems can be implemented using heterodyne receivers.\nCompared to direct detection PPM systems, heterodyne systems offer an improved receiver sensitivity and\nbetter background noise rejection. In addition, frequency and phase encodings can be used in heterodyne\nsystems to further improve the system performance. However, heterodyne systems are very sensitive to the\nphase fluctuation in the optical Carrier and their performances can be seriously deteriorated in the presence of\nlarge carrier phase noise. Consequently, for practical heterodyne systems, the spectral linewidths of lasers must\nbe carefully controlled. The purpose of this chapter is to analyze the performance of the heterodyne system\n\nboth in the absence and the presence of canier phase noise.\n\n4.1 Heterodyne Modulation Schemes\nInformation encoding in optical heterodyne systems is similar to its counterpart in RF carrier modulation\nsystems. Modulation schemes such as optical amplitude-shift keying (ASK), frequency-shift keying (FSK),\nand phase-shift keying (PSK)can be used to transmit messages over the heterodyne channel.\nAmplitude shift keying (ASK) is the simplest form of digital carrier modulation. The information is\nencoded onto the optical carrier by varying the amplitude of the transmitted signal. The ASK schemes\ncommonly used in digital optical transmissions include on-off keying (OOK) and pulse-position modulation\n(PPM). The transmitted signal corresponding to these signaling schemes can be modeled as:\nA sin(2xfc t ii)c) OIt ST, for a binary one, and\nS(t)\n\n=\n\n8\n1\nI\nI\nI\n\n{;\n\nOIt ST, for a binary zero,\n\nsin(2xfctii),) kT,St I(k+l)Ts\n\nsk(t) =\n\nOlt<XT, ,\n\nPPW\n\n(4.2)\n\nelsewhere\nwhere q ( t ) is transmitted when the message codeword is equal to k, and A, fc and & are the amplitude,\nfrequency and phase of the transmitted carrier, respectively.\n\n57\n\nIn practice, ASK signals can be encoded by either externally modulating a frequency stabilized laser, or\nby directly modulating the injection current density of a semiconductor laser. External intensity modulation\ncan be implemented using the electrooptic [1271-[129] or electro-absorption (Franz-Keldysh) effect [130][132]. External modulation of lasers provides a better frequency stability but, because the modulator severely\n\ns\nattenuates the signal, a smaller signal power i available at the output. In contrast, direct modulation of\nsemiconductor lasers provides a higher output power, a better modulation efficiency, and a larger modulation\nbandwidth. However, because of the spurious frequency modulation due to changes in the injection current\ndensity [134], direct modulation of semiconductor lasers suffers from the poor temporal coherence of the\ntransmitted signal. A frequency stabilized external post amplifier can be used to reduce the phase fluctuation\n[135], but at the cost of increased system complexity. Another disadvantage of direct modulation is that, in\norder to facilitate rapid switching, the device is usually biased just below the lasing threshold. This leads to a\nsmall leakage of the optical signal and a finite extinction ratio. The presence of this finite extinction ratio\n\nimposes a ceiling on the maximum S N R that can be achieved at the decoder.\nFrequency shift keying (FSK) is by far the preferred method for implementing the optical heterodyne\nsystem. Unlike the ASK system, the information is encoded by varying the signal frequency. The transmitted\nsignal for an FSK system can be modeled as\n\nwhere the signal frequency is chosen from a set Cfoft, . . . , f , ~ - l ) of frequencies such that f\n\nk\n\nis transmitted\n\nwhen the message codeword is equal to k. The correlation coefficients pi; between the i* and j* signal\nwaveforms can be defined as\n\n(4.4)\nwhere\n\nis the energy of the i* signal waveform. For an M-ary system, it is desirable that signal waveforms\ncorresponding to different codewords are orthogonal. The correlation coefficients between signals for an\northogonal system are equal to zero if i # j ,and equal to 1 if i =j . Orthogonality can be realized for an MFSK\n\n58\n\n1\n1\n1\nI\nI\n1\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n1\nI\ni\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\nsystem if the tone spacing between signaling frequencies is a multiple of the symbol frequency fs=lflJ [28][311.\nFrequency modulation of the optical carrier can be accomplished in practice by either internal or\nexternal modulation techniques. External frequency modulation of laser output can be realized using\nelectrooptic [136] or acoustooptic [1371 effects. As was the case with external amplitude modulation, these\ntechniques sufferfromlarge insertion losses and limited modulation bandwidths, Direct frequency modulation\nof semiconductor lasers can be achieved using electrooptic [138] or photoelastic [139] modulations o by\nr\ndirectly modulating the injection current density [140], [141]. These different frequency modulation techniques\n\no\nare compared in Table 4.1 [32]. Among them, the injection current modulated system is the easiest t\nimplement.\n\nIn addition to ASK and FSK, the optical canier can also be phase modulated. By changing the index of\nrefraction of the medium with an external voltage, the phase of the transmitted signal can be controlled using\nthe electro-optic effect [1421-[1441. The transmitted signal for a PSK system can be modeled as\n\nwhere @k is chosen from a set of phases\n\n(+0,@1,.\n\n. . , $ ~ - l ) . When M = 2 and $I-+,\n\nthe amplitude of the\n\nsignal when a binary one is transmitted is the negative of that when a binary zero is sent. This particular BPSK\nscheme is also known as the antipodal ASK, which has the property that the correlation coefficient between the\ntwo signals is equal t -1.\no\n4.2 Demodulation in the Absence of Phase Noise\nAt the receiver, the optical signal is mixed with a strong LO output and then photodetected. This\nheterodyne process shifts the spectrum of the input signal from the optical frequency down to an IF frequency,\nf,F,\n\nwhere it can be easily processed using conventional RF electronics. When both temporal and spatial\n\ntrackings can be perfectly realized, the output of the photodetector is often modeled as the sum of an IF signal,\ns (t ), and an additive shot noise, n, (t ),\n\nr ( t ) = s ( t ) + n , ( t ) , O<tIT,\n\n.\n\n(4.7)\n\nAt sufficiently high LO power, the additive noise, n, (t). which is is due primarily to the LO shot noise, can be\n\n59\n\n60\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n1\nI\n1\n\nmodeled as an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)with power spectral density\n\nConsequently, the heterodyne channel can be effectively modeled as an AWGN channel, and the demodulation\n\nof the IF signal is similar to that of an RF carrier modulation system. In the case where an M -ary signaling\nscheme is used to modulate the optical signal, ~ ( t can be any one of the M signal waveforms\n)\n\n(sk(t)}.\n\nThe\n\npurpose of the IF demodulator, therefore, is to determine which of the signals ( s k ( t ) )was transmitted given\nthe receiver output r (t ), OIt IT,.\nIn general, the carrier modulated signal can be demodulated using either phase coherent or incoherent\ntechniques. Coherent demodulation of the IF signal can be achieved by using a matched filter or, equivalently,\nthe correlation detector [28]-[31]. Both methods can be implemented directly at the carrier frequency, or at the\nbaseband frequency by 6rst demodulating the IF signal using a coherent reference carrier. Figure 4.1 shows the\nalternative implementations of phase coherent correlation detectors. For M -ary phase coherent systems, M\ncorrelators are used to demodulate the IF signal, and the decoder simply picks the channel corresponding to the\nlargest correlator output. Figure 4.2 shows the block diagram of a M -ary phase coherent receiver implemented\nusing correlation detectors. The probability of error for the coherent demodulator can be written as\n\nwhere P E ( ~ is the probability of decoding emr given that sc(t) was transmitted, and nc is the prior\n)\nprobability of transmitting q ( t ) . The conditional probability P E ( ~can be evaluated by realizing that the\n)\noutputs of the correlators are Gaussian distributedwith statistics\n\n(4.10)\n\nwhere xi is the output of the i* correlator. A decoding error occurs when the output of the J* correlator,\n\nxi,J#i,is greater than xc.

For binary orthogonal systems, (4.14) can be further\nreduced to\n(4.15)\nAnother important system employing the coherent demodulator is the binary antipodal system (BPSK). For\nthis system the correlation maaix has zero determinant and, consequently. the two correlator outputs are\ndegenerated. Decoding of the binary antipodal signaling scheme can therefore be accomplished using only\none correlator. Figure 4 3 depicts the block diagram of the BPSK decoder. Note that a decoding error occurs if\n.\nx<O when ~ ( t is transmitted, or if x > O when\n)\n\n-SO) is transmitted. Using the fact that x\n\nhas mean\n\nE [x I+r (t )] = h?3 and variance axLNsE, the probability of error for the BPSK decoder can be written as\n\n(4.16)\nComparison of Eqs. (4.15) and (4.16) shows that the antipodal system (BPSK) offers a 3 dB improvement in\n\nS N R over the orthogonal system (BFSK).\nTable 4.2 is a list of probability of errors for various coherently demodulated heterodyne systems in\nterms of the signal to noise ratio pC The detection threshold for the OOK system has been chosen to minimize\n.\n\n64\n\noutput\n\nms(2xf ,Ft + $ )\n\nFig.4.3.

For a heterodyne MPPM system, it is assumed that the correlation detection is carried out\nfor each of the M time slots. Since only one slot contains the signal pulse, the performance of the MPPM\nsystem is similar to that of an MFSK system. Note that by substitutingthe expressions for signal amplitude and\nnoise density from (2.30) and (4.8) into (4.14). the IF S N R can be written as\n(4.17)\n\nwhich is just the product of the heterodyne efficiency and the number of (expected) signal photons detected\nover the period T,.\nPhase coherent demodulation is optimal in the sense that both signal amplitude and phase are used to\ndecode the transmitted data. However, in order to perform the correlation detection, the receiver must have a\npnor knowledge of the carrier\xe2\x80\x99s frequency and phase so that the local reference signals ( S k ( t ) , k=o,l, ..&- 1)\n\ncan be generated. This carrier reference must be acquired through a separate synchronization circuit.\nAlternatively, carrier modulated signals can be demodulated using noncoherent techniques such as envelope or\ndifferentially coherent detections. These techniques do not require the presence of a reference carrier.\nTherefore, the receiver design can be considerably simplified. In addition, for systems where the carrier\nreference is difficult to generate, such as in the presence of a large, randomly fluctuating phase noise,\nnoncoherent systems have the distinct advantage since they require no phase information to perform the\ndecoding.\n\nFigure 4.4(a) shows the structure of an envelope detector centered at frequency f k . The output of the\ndetector is given by\n\nwhere\n\n(1.19)\n\nNote that uk2 can be written as\n\n67\n\nr(t)\n\nBand Pass\nFilter\n\nNonlinear\nDevice\n\nDemodulator output\n\nF g 4 4 Alternative implementations of the envelope detector.\ni...\n\n68\n\nb\n\n(4.20)\nwhich is simply the Fourier transform magnitude square of t ( r ) at f =fk. This spectral analyzer decoder has\n\nbeen shown to be optimal for decoding MFSK signals when the carrier phase is unavailable [28], [1451. In\npractice, envelope detectors are usually implemented using the structure shown in Figure 4.40). In the absence\nof a rapidly fluctuating carrier phase, these alternative configurationsare equivalent.\nThe probability distributionof & , given that s, (t )=A sin(2xf, l+$) was msmitted, can be written as:\n\nPk(uk)=\n\nxe\n"\n\nA\n?\n.\n;\n\nlo(UkAkj/No)\n\n,\n\n(4.21)\n\nwhere\n\nNo = uu, n;\n\n(4.22)\n\nThe parameter A$ in (4.21) is given by\n\n(4.23)\n\nwhere\n\nVkj=fk-fj\n\nis the tone spacing between j & and k* frequencies, and we have assumed that the sum\n\nfrequency terms have negligible contributions to ?he integral. When A@,\n\nthe above probability density\n\nfunction is known as the Rice-Nakagami distribution, or simply the R i c h distribution. When either the signal\namplitude is zero, or when the transmitted signal frequency is orthogonal to the detector center frequency, the\nparameter A$ is equal to zero. In this case P (&) reduces to a Rayleigh dismbution.\nGiven h e probability density function of the envelope detector output, the probability of error for an\n\nOOK system can be written as\n\n(4.24)\n\n69\n\nwhere 8 is the decision threshold, and Q (a#)is the Marcum\xe2\x80\x99s Q function [301. The first term on the righthanded side of Eq.(4.24) is the probability that U k > 8 when no signal is transmitted, and the second term is the\nprobability that uk<0 when a binary one is sent. The PBE i Eq. (4.24) can be minimized by choosing the\nn\nthreshold 8 to satisfy\n(4.25)\n\nFor M-ary FSK systems, M envelope detectors, each tuned to a particular signal frequency, are used to\ndemodulate the signal. The decoder then selects the channel with the largest detected envelope. The\nprobability of error for this system, given thatft was transmitted, can be written as\nc\n\n(4.26)\nWhen the frequencies transmitted are orthogonal, the outputs o the envelope detectors not matched to the\nf\n\nsignal frequency are identically dismbuted with Rayleigh densities. The probability of decoding emor can\ntherefore be evaluated as\n\n(4.27)\n\nwhere\n\npkk= A ~ T ~ N , .\n\n(4.28)\n\nFor systems with equal energy pulses, p~=p..12Ts/4Ns,0 . 1 , ...,M- 1, and the unconditioned probability of\nk\nerror is equal to the PE (k) given by Eq. (4.27). When M=2. the probability of error for the binary system can\nbe further reduced t\no\n\n70\n\nFor nonorthogonalFSK systems, the probability of error given by Eq. (4.26) is in general difficult to calculate.\nHowever, when M=2, the error probability can be written in a closed-form [30]:\n\nP E ( ~ )~ [ l - Q ( c . \' & + Q ( ~ , \' & ) l\n=\n\nj,k=O,l: j+k ,\n\nwhere pi,=AjTJ/4NJ.\nNote that for an orthogonalsystem,\n\n(4.30)\n\nwhen j & , and Eq. (4.30) reduces to the PBE\n\nof an orthogonal BFSK given by Eq. (4.29).\n\nIn addition t the envelope detection, noncoherent demodulation can also be realized using a\no\ndifferentially coherent technique. Figure 4.5 shows the block diagram of a differentially coherent\ndemodulator. The received signal is delayed by one bit period and used as the carrier reference to demodulate\nthe next waveform received. Because no absolute carrier reference is available, the infoxmation must be\nencoded in the differential changes of the carrier phase. This system is commoniy known as the differential\nphase-shift keying (DPSK) system. The analysis of binary DPSK receivers in AWGN can be found in standard\ncommunication theory texts [28]-[31], [146], and the probability of decoding error can be given by\npE==e+.\n1\n\n(4.31)\n\nBy comparing Eq. (4.31) and (4.29), it is seen that the binary DPSK system offers a 3dB improvement in SNR\n\nover the envelope detected BFSK system.\nTable 4.3 is a list of the probability of errors for various systems using noncoherent detectors. Note that\nby substituting expressions for the signal amplitude and the noise spectral density into Eq. (4.21), the\nnoncoherent SNR p can also be reduced to q &\n,.\nFigure 4.6 is a plot of error probabilities for various heterodyne systems versus the signal-to-noiseratios\n\np. Note that the PSK system requires 3dB less signal power to achieve comparable error rate than the FSK and\nPPM systems. Similarly, FSK and PPM systems have a 3dB power advantage over the OOK system.

It is Seen from the figure that, when operating\nunder ideal conditions, the performance of the direct detection BPPM system is comparable to that of the\nheterodyne DPSK system, and is superior to both heterodyne FSK and PPM systems.

Incoherent background interference, thermal noise, and\navalanche noise that can be ignored in heterodyne systems will have a significantimpact on the performance of\ndirect detection systems. It is shown in Figure 4.6 that noncoherent systems require a slightly higher signal\npower to achieve a given error rate than the comparablecoherent systems. However, it should be realized that\nthe analysis leading to the error rate expressions has assumed that the heterodyne channel can be modeled as\n\nan AWGN channel with ideal carrier synchronizationand local reference recovery. In practice, the output of\nthe heterodyne receiver is contaminated with LO intensity noise and laser phase noise in addition to the LO\nshot noise. The spurious amplitude modulation at the output of the transmitter laser can also have a\nmeasurable impact on the error performance of heterodyne receivers. Intensity noise at the output of a\nsemiconductor laser has been characterized as a Gaussian process [147], and may be considered as part of the\nadditive noise. The impact of intensity noise on the performance of heterodyne FSK systems has been studied.\nIt is shown that, at a data rate of 1 Gb/s, the power penalty due to the intensity noise is approximately 1.5 dB\n[148]. The phase noise, on the other hand, modulates the phase of the received IF signal and cannot be\n\nmodeled as an additive noise. In the presence of the carrier phase noise, carrier recovery that is required for the\ncoherent demodulator cannot be perfectly realized. Consequently, higher signal power is needed to maintain\nthe system performance. Noncoherent demodulators, on the other hand, do not require a carrier reference to\nperform the decoding, and are therefore less sensitive to the carrier phase noise.\n4.3 Statisticsof the Laser Phase Noise\n\nThe presence of carrier phase noise at the laser output results in the broadening of the observed laser\n\nr\nlinewidth. For systems using gas o solid state lasers, the observed linewidth broadening is very small\ncompared to the data rate. Consequently,the effect of carrier phase noise can be practically ignored for these\nlasers. Semiconductor lasers, on the other hand, suffer from large frequency and phase fluctuations that can\nseriously affect the performance of heterodyne systems. Even when mode stabilized lasers are used, the\nobserved linewidths for semiconductor lasers are typically on the order of 1-50 MHz. At these linewidths, the\neffect of carrier phase noise on the performance of the communication link cannot be neglected. The linewidth\nbroadening effect of the semiconductor laser has been attributed to the changes in the index of refraction of the\ncavity due to the fluctuation in carrier density [42].\n\n75\n\nExperimentally. the spectral lineshape of semiconductor lasers has been characterized as Lorentzian\n[149]. The frequency spectrum of the laser output has also been carefully measured [43]. It is shown that the\n\nspectrum of the laser phase noise consists of three major components: a l/f component at low frequencies,\none or several resonance peaks at high (1-1OGHz) frequencies and, in between, the laser exhibits a white\nfrequency noise spectrum which is dominant throughout the spectral range of interest. Figure 4.7 shows a\ntypical frequency spectrum of a semiconductor laser [43]. For a well designed system, the llf noise can be\ntracked out by the receiver and the resonant peaks are usually far above the system bandwidth. Consequently,\nonly the white frequency component remains in the detected IF phase noise.\nMotivated by these experimental results, the phase noise of the semiconductorlaser can be modeled as a\nWiener process +(I), and instantaneousfrequency & ( t ) satisfies\n\nwhere Af is the power spectral density of the instantaneous frequency. The phase of the laser output is\nrandomly modulated by the carrier phase noise $ ( t ) such that the carrier signal s (t) can be modeled as\n\nwhere 40 is the initial phase angle of the laser output. The power spectra of + ( t ) and s ( t ) can be deduced from\n(4.32) and (4.33) to be\n\n(4.35)\nNote that the spectral lineshape of the IF signal derived from the white frequency noise assumption is indeed\nLorentzian with linewidth Af. For a symmetric heterodyne system where both signal and LO lasers have\nnonzero linewidths, the observed IF phase fluctuation will be the difference of the two laser phases and,\nconsequently, the linewidth of the IF signal will be the sum of individual laser linewidths.\nBecause the carrier phase noise is nonstationary, the ideal maximum likelihood demodulator for the\nheterodyne signal must consider the past history of the phase [150], [151]. However, such receivers are very\ndifficult to implement in practice.

In practice, phase coherent demodulationrequires the presence\nof a local reference carrier that is synchronized to the transmitter carrier. Before the coherent demodulation\ncan take place, this carrier reference must be properly established\nAt sufficientlyhigh signal levels, carrier synchronization can be accomplished by injection locking [152]\n\na local oscillator laser with the incoming signal. However, injection locking typically requires a high signal\npower (-20-30 dBm) [153] that is not achievable in ISL links. Alternatively. phase-locked loops (PLL)\n[28], [29] can be used to recover the transmitted carrier. Shown in Figure 4.8, a PLL consists of a local\noscillator (LO) that can be frequency tuned by an externally supplied signal, a phase comparator with an\noutput that is proportional to the phase difference between the signal and LO, and a loop filter. The\napplications of PLLs to RF carrier synchronizations have been well documented [28]-[31]. When the input\nsignal to the PLL contains a spectral component at the desired lock-in frequency, the PLL can be used to\nrecover the frequency and phase of the signal. For signals that do no contain a spectral component at the\ndesired lock-in frequency, such as in a suppressed carrier transmission system, the simple PLL shown in\nFigure 4.8 cannot be used. Instead, one of several suppressed carrier tracking loops must be employed to\nestablish the carrier synchronization. Figure 4.9 shows the different configurations of suppressed carrier\ntracking loops. These loops in general employ nonlinearities to generate the desired spectral component at the\nlock-in frequency.\nCarrier synchronization in optical heterodyne systems is similar to that of RF systems [154]-[156!. The\n\nVCO is implemented using a local oscillator laser which can be frequency tuned by changing the supplied\ncurrent or voltage. The phase comparator can be implemented using a heterodyne receiver. For suppressed\ncarrier systems, an optical hybrid can be used to replace both in-phase and quadrature arms of an 1-Q loop\n11561. Optical PLLs have been successfully used to track the incoming signal frequencies at a signal level of\n\n-50-65 dBm [ 1531.\n\n78\n\nI\nI\nI\n8\n1\n\nE\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\n1\nI\nt\nI\nI\n8\nI\nI\n\nL\n\nu\nQ,\n\nc\n\nQ\n\nQ,\n\nb\ni\n\na\n\n0\n\n79\n\n\xe2\x80\x98 Fllter --bs\n(\n0\n\nquare Law\nDevice\n\n-\n\nBand pass\nFilter\n\n-0-\n\nFilter\n\n-\n\nLow Pass\nFilter\n\nModu I at ion\nEstimator\n\nFig.4.9. Suppressed carrier tracking loops: (a) the squaring loop, (b) the Costas I-Q loop, and (c) h e decision feed-back loop.\n\n80\n\nThe performance of the carrier tracking PLL depends on the properties of the input signal and that of the\nloop design. In general, when tracking is established, the phase difference w between the signal and LO output\ncan be modeled as a G u s a random process. The variane of\nasin\n\nw can be written as the sum of contributions\n\nfrom the shot noise and phase noise:\n2\n2\no$=am+opN.\n\n(4.36)\n\nThe shot noise contribution to the phase noise variance can be deduced from the linearized PLL theory [156]\n\nas\n\nwhere A is the amplitude of the IF signal, Ns is the noise spectral density, and B , is the (two-sided) closedloop bandwidth of the PLL. B, can be related to the closed-loop transfer function H, (f ) by\nB, = c I H c ( f ) 1 2 d f\n\n.\n\n(4.38)\n\nw\n\nThe contribution of carrier phase noise to the synchronization error can be written as [31]\n\nwhere S + ( f ) is the power spectrum of the phase noise. Note that the phase noise contribution to the\nsynchronization error in (4.39) can be interpreted as the amount of the phase noise power not filtered by the\ntracking loop of transfer function H, (f ). By approximatingH, (f ) as an ideal low-pass filter with bandwidth\nB, ,the phase noise contribution t the synchronizationerror can be simplified to\no\nt&=2AflxBc\n\n.\n\n(4.40)\n\nFor a more realistic loop design, (4.40) should be multiplied by a constant\n\n< which, for a second-order PLL\n\nwith a damping factor 0.7, is equal to 3.7 [31], [1561.\nBy combining Eqs. (4.37) and (4.40), it is seen that the variance of phase noise contains a term that is\n\nproportiond to the loop bandwidth and a term that is inversely proportional to B , . Consequently, for a given\nlinewidth Af and the signal-to-noise ratio, an optimal PLL bandwidth exists which minimizes the phase error\nvariance. This optimal PLL bandwidth can be evaluated to be [1561\nBop = 44Ws Af T Jxf ,\ns\n\n(4.41)\n\n81\n\nwhere fs=l/Ts is the symbol rate of the channel.\nWhen the bandwidth of the PLL is small compared to fs ,the synchronization error\nwith respect to the symbol period. In this case the synchronization error\n\nw is slowly varying\n\nw may be approximatedby a constant\n\nduring each symbol period. The conditional error probability for a coherent heterodyne receiver, given the\nsignal to noise ratio\n\nPc and the synchronizationphase error w,can be written as\n\nPc is the S N R defined in Eq. (4.10). The unconditioned PBE for the system is therefore the expectation\nof Eq. (4.42) with respect to the distribution of w:\nwhere\n\nPE(P,,a$) E [ P E ( ~ ~ , = ) ]\n=\nV~\n\nE\n\nJzxa,\n\nP (p, cos2~)e-v2n%y/\nE\n\n.\n\n(4.43)\n\nIn writing (4.43). it is assumed that the Carrier synchronization has been properly established and that the\ninstantaneouscarrier tracking e m r yfis Gaussian distributed.\n\nThe effects of phase noise and synchronization error on a coherent demodulator can be seen in Figures\n4.10-4.12. In Figure 4.10, the probability of error for a BPSK system is plotted against the S N R for several\nvalues of the IF linewidth. The loop bandwidth B, is equal to 10-\'fs. Note that for AfT..2Oo.0O5 an error rate\n\n"floor" is visible which is independent of the SNR. This is because at a high signal power and a constant B, ,\nthe probability of synchronization error is dominated by the phase noise contribution which cannot be reduced\nby increasing the signal power. However, if the loop bandwidth is adjusted to minimize the synchronization\nerror, the performance of the demodulator becomes much less sensitive to the laser phase noise. Figure 4.1 1 is\na plot of the PBE versus the S N R for a BPSK system where the loop bandwidth is chosen to minimize c$.It is\nseen that, at PBE=10-9, an IF linewidth as large as 2% of the symbol rate can be tolerated with a 3dB increase\nin the required SNR. The power penalties associated with the synchronization error are shown in Figures\n4.12(a) and 4.12(b) for a binary PSK system at PBE=le9. Figure 4.12(a) is plotted assuming that the\n\nsynchronization bandwidth is constant, and Figure 4.12(b) is plotted assuming that B, has been optimized\nusing Eq. (4.41). It is seen from these figures that the power penalty associated with the laser phase noise\nincreases rapidly when the laser linewidth becomes a significant fraction of the loop bandwidth. For systems\nwhere the loop bandwidth is optimally adjusted, the power penalty is less sensitive to the IF phase noise.\nHowever, it should be noted that the assumption leading to the expression of error rate is valid only when the\n82\n\nI\n\nt\n1\n1\n1\n\nI\n\n1\n1\n1\n\nIO0\n\nI\nO\n\nI\n\n-\xe2\x80\x99\n\nI\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n10-2\n10-3\nW\n\na\na\n\n10-4\n10-5\n10-6\n\n10-7\nI o-8\n\nIO-^\nSNR\n\nFig.4.10.

At large IF linewidths, the loop bandwidth required to\nachieve the optimal performance can be a significant fraction of the data rate. Such a large synchronization\nbandwidth can lead to a significant phase fluctuation within a given codeword period. For such systems, a\nmuch higher signal power is needed to maintain the system performance [157].\n4.5 Noncoherent Demodulation in the Presence of Phase Noise\n\nBecause optical phase synchronization requires a much higher signal power than can be achieved\nthrough an ISL, coherent heterodyne systems are difficult to implement in practice. Instead, noncoherent\nsystems that do not require the carrier phase synchronizationare more suited for the application.\nM-ary orthogonal FSK is one of the most efficient noncoherent schemes. Unfortunately, because of the\n\nnonstationary nature of the carrier phase noise, performance analysis of the noncoherent MFSK system is very\ndifficult to accomplish, and some assumptions are needed to simplify the analysis. A simple, yet effective\napproximation of the phase error is to assume that the phase diffusion is introduced by a random frequency\nnoise v [52] such that the phase diffusion occurred during the observation interval (O,T,) are approximated by\n\nBecause the carrier phase noise can be modeled as a Wiener process, the frequency v can be modeled as a\nGaussian random variable. The variance of v can be calculated from Eqs. (4.33) and (4.44) to be:\n\n.\n\nVar(v)==Af\n\n(4.45)\n\ns\n\nRecall from Section 4.2 that the performance of noncoherent FSK systems is determined by the parameters pij\nwhere pij=AifTs/4N,. By substitutingEq. (4.44) into Eq. (4.23), it is seen that\n(4.46)\nwhere Vkjifk-f,\n\nis the tone spacing between the j & and the k* signals, and v is the random frequency noise.\n\nNote that because of the frequency noise v,\n\npk,\n\nis in general not equal to zero even when vkj is an integer\n\nmultiple of the symbol frequency. Consequently, in the presence of the carrier phase noise the M signaling\nfrequencies of the MFSK system are no longer orthogonal. This channel cross talk is the major source of error\nfor the MFSK systems.\n\n86\n\n1\n\nI\n\nI\nI\n1\n1\n1\n\nI\n\nGiven the random frequency noise v, the PBE of the binary FSK system can be calculated using Eq.\n(4.30). Consequently, by averaging over the distribution of v, an approximation of the error rate can be\nobtained for a binary FSK system operating with finitelaser phase noise. Figure 4.13 is a plot of the PBE for a\nbinary FSK system versus the receiver SNR. The tone spacing between the frequencies v01 is equal to the\nsymbol rate fs . Note that the presence of carrier phase noise introduces an error rate "floor" at the decoder\nwhich is clearly visible for Af T,>0.05. This e m rate floor has been estimated [36] to be\n(4.47)\nBy comparing the performance shown in Figure 4.13 with the performance of the coherent BPSK system\n\nshown in Figure 4.10, it is seen that the noncoherent system is far less sensitive to carrier phase noise than the\nphase coherent system. It is intuitive that the channel cross tl due to phase noise can be minimized by\nak\nincreasing the tone spacing. Figure 4.14 is a plot of the PBE versus the tone spacing for several values of the\n\nIF linewidth. Note that when the phase noise can be ignored, the performance of the FSK system is optimized\nwhen the tone spacing is equal to an integer multiple of f,.However, at nonzero linewidth. the orthogonalityis\ndestroyed and the performance becomes a function of the tone spacing in addition to the S N R and the IF\nlinewidth. The power penalties associated with the phase noise are plotted in Figure 4.15 versus the IF\nlinewidth for a binary FSK system at different values of the tone spacing and PBE. Note that the power\npenalty decreases with increasing tone spacing and decreasing IF linewidth. Furthermore, because of the error\nrate "floor," the power penalty is seen t increase sharply when the error rate floor due to the carrier phase\no\nnoise becomes greater than the desired PBE. It should be noted that the power penalty curves shown in Figure\n4.15 are derived using the assumption that the carrier phase noise can be approximated by a random frequency\nnoise. The actual power penalty incurred by the phase noise is higher than those shown in Figure 4.15. In\npractice, care must be taken to allocate sufficient power margins to account for this error in approximation.\nTable 4.4 shows the power penalty due to carrier phase noise for a binary FSK system at different values of the\nPBE and IF linewidths. Note that the power penalty increases rapidly with increasing IF linewidth.\nAnother noncoherent system commonly used in RF systems is the differentially coherent PSK system\n(DPSK). Unlike the NCFSK system, which uses the envelope detector, the DPSK receiver performs the\ndecoding by correlating the signal with the waveform received over the previous bit period.

When the laser linewidth is sufficiently small, however, the probability of error for a DPSK\nsystem with carrier phase noise can be approximated by (Appendix A):\n(4.48)\nFigure 4.16 is a plot of the PBE evaluated using Eq. (4.48) versus the SNR. Also plotted in the figure is the\nPBE of an ideal DPSK receiver evaluated using Eq. (4.31). Note that at small laser linewidths, the\napproximation in Eq. (4.48) gives a higher error probability than the actual PBE. However, at PBE = 10-9. the\ndifference in the required signal power calculated using Eq. (4.48) instead of Eq. (4.31) is small. Note that as\nAfT,=O.Ol the required signal power needed to achieve lW9 error rate begins to increase rapidly. The power\npenalty associated with the carrier phase noise is plotted in Figure 4.17 versus the IF linewidth. It is seen that\na sharp increase in the power penalty in Figure 4.17 occurs when the error rate "floor" exceeds the desired\nPBE. The error rate "floor" can be calculated from Eq.

Under this ideal condition, the coherently demodulated heterodyne channel offers a\nsuperior performance compared to the noncoherent channel. However, when carrier phase noise is present,\nsuch as when semiconductor lasers are used, the coherent heterodyne channel becomes very sensitive to h e\ncarrier synchronization error. When operating under extremely low signal power such as in an ISL, the signal\npower needed to achieve coherent carrier synchronization may be difficult to achieve. Noncoherent\nheterodyne systems, on the other hand, do not require the presence of a synchronized local reference and,\ntherefore, can be more easily implemented. In particular, the noncoherent FSK (NCFSK) system is less\nsensitive to the phase noise compared to the DPSK system. For these reasons, the analysis of the heterodyne\n\nISL will be concentrated on the NCFSK system.\n\n92\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n1\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n1\nI\nI\nI\n8\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\nIO0\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n-\n\nDPSK\n\nApproximate PBE\n\n10-3 -\n\n-\n\nW\n\nm\n\na\n\n10-6 -\n\n1 0 - 7-\n\nlo-*\n\n-\n\nIO-^\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI l l 1\n\nIO\'\n\nIO0\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nIO2\n\nSNR\n\nFig.4.16.

SPATIAL TRACKING\n\nBecause of the small beam divergence and the low available signal power, the spatial tracking requirement\nfor an optical ISL is more stringent than that of a conventional microwave link. An optical ISL operating at 850\nnm wavelength using a 10 cm diameter transmitter telescope will have an effective angular beamwidth of only\n\n10 pad compared t a typical microwave beamwidth of several milliradians. When operating at such a narrow\no\nbeamwidth. line-of-sight (LOS) tracking between the receiver and transmitter must be properly established so\nthat the main lobe of the transmitted signal will fall on the receiver aperture. The purpose of the tracking\n\nsubsystem, therefore, is to acquire the mutual positions of the transmitter and receiver and maintain the LOS\ntracking for the duration of the communication.\n5.1 Spatial Acquisition\nBefore high speed data uansfer can take place over the ISL, the transmitter and receiver optics must\nachieve mutual LOS tracking of each other. Initially, by using the known satellite trajectory and the telemetry\n\ndata, relative angular positions of the satellites can be stabilized to within 1 mrad. The angular width of a typical\ntransmitted signal, however, is only a few microradians wide. Consequently,spatial acquisition must be carried\nout to reduce the angular uncertainty.\nIn order for the receiver to acquire the angular position of the transmitter, a beacon signal from the remote\ntransmitter must illuminate the receiver. In general, illumination of the initial angular uncertainty zone can be\naccomplished using either a parallel or a serial illuminationscheme. In a parallel illumination scheme, the entire\nuncertainty zone is illuminated simultaneously. Because of the larger beam divergence needed to cover the\nsearch zone, smaller signal power is available at the receiver, and longer observation time is needed to collect\nsufficient signal photons for an acceptable acquisition accuracy. In contrast, in a serial illuminated system, the\nangular uncertainty.zone is divided into smaller cells, and the transmitter illuminates each cell sequentially.\nAcquisition is possible only when the spatial cell containing the receiver is illuminated. Since each cell is now\nilluminated with a higher signal intensity, however, a shorter observation period is needed to achieve the desired\nacquisition accuracy.\nAt the receiver, the angular position of the incident optical signal is extracted and the resulted angular\n\nposition estimate is used to control the servo system which aligns the optical LOS. Estimation of the incident\n95\n\nangle for an optical signal is equivalent t determining the position of the signal image at the receiver focal\no\nplane. Fig. 5.1 illustrates t e relationship between the incident angle of the signal and the image position.\nh\nPosition acquisition at the receiver focal plane is usually accomplished by dividing the focal plane area into\nsmaller acquisition cells where each cell can be individually photodetected [55], [159]. For a typical uncertainty\nzone of 1 mrad, and a desired angular resolution of several microradians, the required acquisition array is very\nlarge (several hundred squared). Charge-coupled devices (CCD) with high pixel density can be used to detect\nthis focal plane intensity pattern and estimate the centroid of the diffraction pattern [ l a ] . Smaller detector\narrays can also be used to achieve comparable acquisition accuracy by either mechanically scanning the detector\nover the entire focal plane area or using a zooming algorithm. In a zooming algorithm. the acquisition is divided\ninto several stages. At each stage, the remaining uncertainty zone is divided into a number of acquisition cells,\nand the acquisition is carried out among these cells. This process is then repeated until the desired acquisition\naccuracy is achieved.\nBoth direct and heterodyne detection schemes can be used to detect the image position at the receiver\nfocal plane. The direct detection acquisition sensor is simpler to operate, but is more sensitive to the background\nand thermal noise. Consequently, systems employing direct detection acquisition sensors generally require a\nlonger acquisition time to achieve a comparable acquisition accuracy [54]. [55]. On the other hand, heterodyne\nacquisition systems are relative immune to the background and thermal noise, but require a much more\ncomplicated optical structure.\nThe performances of spatial acquisition systems using different illumination strategies and detection\nschemes have been studied for the ISL application [55]. It is\n\nSeen\n\nin the study that acceptable acquisition\n\naccuracy can be achieved within a reasonable amount of time (1-10 sec) using a relatively small laser power\n(=lo mW). In the following, it will be assumed that spatial acquisition procedure is completed and that both the\n\ntransmitter and receiver have achieved mutual LOS tracking of each other.\n5.2 The LOS Tracking\n\nAfter the angular position of the remote satellite has been properly acquired, the optical assembly can then\nbe rotated to point along the LOS. Because of the relative motion and the on-board mechanical noise of the\n\nsatellites, pointing of the transmitter optics is subjected to some continuous, time-v\'arying fluctuationseven after\n\n96\n\nm\n0\n\nE\na\n\n97\n\nthe initial spatial acquisition has been achieved. For a heterodyne system, these mechanical perturbations can\nalso affect the optical alignment between the incoming signal and the LO and result in a degraded receiver\nperformance. In a practical ISL. the initial alignment of the optical LOS and the subsequent fine tracking of the\n\nLOS perturbationsare usually achieved using a servo-drivenopto-mechanicalspatial tracking loop.\nFigure 5.2 shows the block diagram of a spatial tracking loop. The beacon signal from the remote\ntransmitter is detected using an appropriate tracking sensor. The beacon signal can be a separate, low data rate\nsignal or, for the case of an optical ISL, the information-canying signal itself. The tracking sensor generates a\nsignal output that is proportional to the angular deviation between the current receiver LOS and the angular\nposition of the remote transmitter. This angular estimate is then used to control the tracking servo and align the\nreceiver LOS. For an optical ISL between LEO and GEO satellites, transmitter point-ahead must be added to\nthe receiver LOS to compensate for the long path delay and the large relative velocity. In order to achieve a high\ndegree of accuracy in spatial rracking, the servo system usually employs a nested loop design [56]-[59], which\nconsists of a low bandwidth coarse-gimbal loop that tracks the lower frequency perturbations of the LOS, and a\nhigh bandwidth inner loop, which compensates for the higher frequency motion disturbances. The use of nested\n\nservo loops essentially decouples the tracking of high freqJency, mechanical perturbations from te tracking of\n!\nlow frequency LOS motions. For the spatial tracking system just described, tracking error arises primarily from\nthe noise associated with the tracking sensor, and the disturbances associated with base motion and mechanical\nvibration of the satellite. The point-ahead calculation can be achieved to a high degree of accuracy using the\nknown ephemeridesdata, and other systematicerrors can be minimized by a proper design.\nThe effect of the sensor noise on the tracking system performance can be characterized by its noise\nequivalent angle (NEA), which is defined as the standard deviation in estimating the current angular position.\nThe problem of estimating the angular deviation of the received signal is equivalent to acquiring the incident\nangle of the received signal, and can be accomplished using a focal plane detector array. Because of h e small\nangular deviation expected after the spatial acquisition procedure is completed, only a small number of spatial\ncells are needed to detect the focal plane intensity variation. A quadrant photodetector is commonly used to\nderive an angular position estimate of a closely tracked signal [56], [57], [158], [161]. Shown in Fig. 5.3, the\nquadrant detector contains four separate photodetector cells that are carefully matched in detection sensitivities.\nThe use of quadrant detectors allows the azimuthal and elevation angular position estimates to be separated, and\n\n98\n\n99\n\n>\nwg\n>lo\'\n>\nI\'\n0\n\np\n\nI\n\nSUM\nDIFFERENCE &\nDIVIDE\nCIRCUIT\n\n11\n\nAZIMUTHAL\nAZlMuTHA:\nERROR\n\nI\'\n0\n\nFig. 5 3 Quadrant photodetector a m y and the angular position estimator.\n..\n\n100\n\n.\n.\n.\n\nELEVATION\nERROR\n\ntherefore considerably simplifies the tracking loop design. For spatial tracking systems using direct detection\ndetectors, the angular position deviations can be estimated using [561, (571\n\n6pz\n\n[\n\n= 1.224\n\nK~-KTK~+K~\nKT\n\nwhere 6pz and & are the azimuthal and elevation angular deviation estimate, d~ is the diameter of the receiver\naperture, K1&2&3&4\n\nare photocounts from the four quadrants, respectively, and K T = K ~ + K ~ + K ~is the t t l\n+ K ~ oa\n\nphotocount from the tracking detector. When the angular deviation is small and when the background noise can\nbe neglected, the estimator shown in Eq. (5.1) can be shown to be unbiased. The variance of the estimator error\n\n(e&)\n\ncan be calculated directly from Eq. (5.1) to be 1561, [57]:\n\n[\n\n\xe2\x82\xac& Vur(6)= 1.22$]\nI =\n,\n\n\'-& [\n\n= 1.224\n\n\'FS\n\nwhere BT is the bandwidth of the tracking loop, KS is the number of signal photons collected, 1s is the signal\nphotocount rate, and F is the excess noise factor of the APD. Equation (5.2) was derived using the assumption\nthat the intensity pattern on the detector surface can be approximated by a uniformly illuminated circular disk\nwith radius 1.22hf /dR. Similar results for 0 L can be derived for an Airy intensity pattern with only a small\nchange in the coefficient. Given the bandwidth of the tracking loop, the NEA due to sensor noise can be\nevaluated from Eq. (5.2). Because of the small tracking bandwidth, the amount of signal photons received\nduring the observation period is generally very large. Consequently, for a practical spatial tracking system,\nsensor noise contribution to the tracking error is practically negligible.\nIn addition to the direct detection tracking sensor, angular position discrimination can also be\naccomplished using heterodyne sensors [54]. Ideally the heterodyne detector offers a quantum limited detection\nsensitivity and a higher S N R compared to the direct detection tracking sensor. In practice, the performance of\nthe heterodyne spatial tracker is very sensitive to the LO alignment and the carrier phase noise. The sensitivity\nto the LO alignment e m r can be minimized by using a smaller receiver aperture, and the susceptibility to carrier\n\nphase noise can be reduced by using a noncoherent envelope detector. However, these measures can reduce the\n\nS N R and affect the detector NEA. In addition, heterodyne detectors are much more complicated and offer only\n\n101\n\na marginal improvement in performance. Consequently, for most practical purposes, only direct detection\ntracking sensors are used.\nBase motion and mechanical noise are the dominant sources of spatial tracking error. Because of the\n\noin\nnoises due to satellite m t o and gimbal friction, some small motions in the optical LOS can be expected even\nwhen the sensor noise can be neglected. The effect of these noises on the tracking servo system can be more\neffectively analyzed using the simplified block diagram shown in Fig. 5.4. Note that the mechanical\nperturbation appears as an additive noise in this block diagram. Using the linearized PLL theory, the residual\nreceiver LOS tracking error can be written as [56], [162]\n\nis\nwhere Se(W) is the power spectral density of the residual mechanical noise, and HT(o) the closed-loop\ntransfer function of the spatial tracking loop. The residual mechanical noise given by Eq. (5.3) can be interpreted\n\nas the amount of motion disturbance that falls outside the tracking loop bandwidth. The effect of motion and\nmechanical noise on the spatial tracking accuracy has been analyzed using the base motion disturbance record of\nthe LANDSAT [%I,[59]. It is seen that, for a well-designed servo loop, an RMS tracking error of 0.5-1\n[57,\np a d can be expected.\nIn addition t the sensor noise and the base motion disturbances, the accuracy of the LOS tracking is also\no\naffected by the friction of the gimbal, the error in point-ahead calculation, and other systematic errors. However,\ndetailed studies of these noises [56], [57], [59] have shown that, with a careful implementation, the effects of\nthese noises are small compared to that of the base motion disturbances. Consequently, for the analysis of the\nspatial tracking system, it is assumed that an RMS tracking accuracy of q.5-1 p a d can be achieved. In\nparticular, for the analysis of the system performance and link budget allocation, an RMS pointing error of\nl p a d will be assumed. Note that since the rms tracking error is dominated by the residual mechanical vibration\nof the satellite, it cannot be minimized by simply increasing the signal power. Furthermore, since the azimuth\nand elevation trackings are decoupled by the tracking sensor, it will be assumed that the tracking errors in the\nazimuth and elevation directions are independent and identically Gaussian distributed. The resulting radial\ntracking error is therefore Rayleigh distributed with probability distribution:\n\n102\n\nMechanical\nNoise\nReceiver\nLinelof-Sight\n\nI\n&\n\nTransmitter\n\n4 1 1-1\ni\n\nh\n\nTracking\nSensor\n\nT\nTransmitter\nPoint-Ahead\n\nFig.5.4.

For direct detection systems, this implies tailoring the angular width\nof the transmitted signal in order to minimize the power requirement for a given error rate. For heterodyne\nsystems, the finite tracking error for the LO also implies that the receiver aperture diameter must be carefully\nselected in order to optimize the signal-to-noiseratio.\n\n5.3.1 Direct Detection PPM Systems\nGiven the receiver design, the number of signal photons collected at the receiver is a function of the\nand\ntransmitter power PL , the transmitter antenna gain GT, the instantaneous pointing error \xe2\x82\xac)T [60]. For an Mary PPM system operating at wavelength h over a link distance z ,the signal photocount KS can be written as\n\nwhere q ~ T, are efficiencies of the transmitter and receiver optics, GT, are the transmitter and receiver\nR\nGR\nantenna gains, LT(GT,\xe2\x82\xac)T) the pointing loss factor associated with the pointing error \xe2\x82\xacIT, q is the quantum\nis\nefficiency of the detector, h v is the photon energy, PL is the average transmitter power, Ts is the time slot\nperiod, and it has been assumed that the peak transmitter power is M times the average power. The receiver\nantenna gain GR can be related to the receiver aperture diameter dR and the wavelength h by\n\nFor a transmitter with a uniformly illuminated, unobscured circular aperture of diameter\n\nantenna gain and the pointing loss factor can be written as\n\n104\n\ndT,\n\nthe transmitter\n\nIn practice, the intensity cross-section of a single mode laser output can be better approximated by a Gaussian\n\nb a . When the intensity cross section of the signal at the transmitter aperture is Gaussian with RMS width W,\nem\nGT andLT are given by\n\n(5.10)\nBecause the instantaneouspointing error fluctuates in time, the signal photocount KS and the probability\nof bit error (PBE) through the ISL will be functions of time. For a given RMS pointing error. 0%.the average\nPBE at the receiver can be Written as:\n(5.11)\nwhere PE(Ks,KB) the PBE of the direct detection PPM system given the signal photocount KS and the\nis\nbackground photocount KB,and it has been assumed that the pointing error & is Rayleigh distributed. Equation\n(5.11) shows that the PBE is a function of P L , GT,and 0%.By normalizing the instantaneous pointing error 0~\nwith respect to its RMS value, however, the signal photocountKS in Eq. (5.5) can be written as\n\nr\n\n1\n\n(5.12)\n\nwhere a0 = q ~ (-&)(&)qF)2MTs\nq ~\n\nis a constant that is independent of the transmitter antenna gain and\n\nthe signal power. Note that the parameter a O p ~represents the signal photocount per unit transmitter antenna\ngain at the detector in the absence of spatial tracking error. By substituting Eq. (5.12) into Eq. (5.11) and\ncarrying out the substitution of variable u = ~ T / c % , it is seen that, instead of three independent parameters, the\nPBE for a direct detection PPM systems depends only on the parameters .,P,/o& and GTO&.Consequent!y, a\nconstant PBE can be maintained at different values of the RMS pointing error provided that the transmitter\n105\n\npower PL and the transmitter antenna gain GT are scaled such that the parameters a&h&\n\nand G T ~ &\nremain\n\nconstant.\nFor a given a+, there is a finite probability that a large instantaneous pointing error can occur which\nresults in a small received signal photocount and a high probability of error regardless of the transmitter power.\nThus, for a given transmitter power, the PBE increases rapidly when the RMS pointing jitter becomes a\nsignificantfraction of the transmitted beamwidth. This fact is demonstrated in Fig. 5.5 where the PBE of a 4-ary\nPPM system is plotted against the signal power for several values of the RMS pointing error a , Note that\ns.\nwhen the RMS pointing jitter exceeds ~ 1 5 % U&. a much higher signal power is needed to maintain the PBE\nof\nat 10-9. This is because at large a+, the probability that the main lobe of the transmitted signal does not cover\n\nthe receiver aperture can exceed the desired PBE and, therefore, result in a large power penalty. The power loss\ndue to pointing error can be minimized by increasing the angular width of the transmitted signal or, equivalently,\nreducing the size of the transmitter aperture. However, even though a wider transmitted signal reduces the loss\ndue to pointing error, a larger angular width of the transmitted signal implies a smaller signal intensity at the\nreceiver and, consequently, a smaller detector S N R and a higher error rate. Given the receiver design, therefore,\nthere is a trade-off between the size of the transmitter aperture and the power of the transmitter laser. Figure 5.6\nis a plot of the transmitter power needed to achieve 10-9 error rate versus the lransmitter antenna GT for a 4-ary\n\nPPM system operating at 200 Mbps. Note that, when the spatial tracking can be perfectly realized ( e = 0), the\no,\n\no\nrequired transmitter power is inversely proportional t GT.When a+&, however, the required signal power\nfirst decreases with increasing GT until an optimum antenna gain is reached, and any further increase in the\ntransmitter antenna gain will only result in a higher power requirement. This is because at large transmitter\nantenna gains the probability of error due to the transmitter pointing error becomes more significant as the\nbeamwidth decreases with an increasing aperture size. Consequently, for a given RMS pointing jitter and PBE,\n\nan optimal antenna gain exists which minimizes the laser power requirement.\nIt is of interest to investigate the optimum transmitter antenna gain and the required signal power as\nfunctionsof the RMS pointing jitter. By differentiating both sides of Eq. (5.1 1) with respect to the antenna gain\n\nGT while maintaining a constant PBE, it is seen that\n\n106\n\nIO0\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nI"\nO\n10\'2\n\nI 0-3\n10-4\nI0 - 5\n\nw\n\na\n\n10-6\n\nI 0-7\n10-8\n\nI 0-9\n10-10\nIO\'"\nIO"*\n\n100\n\nSIGNAL\n\n200\n\n300\n\nPHOTOCOUNT\n\n400\n\n500\n\nK,)\n\nFig.5.5.

Plotted in Fig. 5.7 is the\n\nvalue of p versus the PBE for a 4-ary PPM system calculated using the ISL parameters shown in Table 2.1. It\nis seen that, for systems with a uniformly illuminated circular aperture, the value of yr ranges from\napproximately 0.15 rad2 a PEE=1W9 to about 0.5 rad2 at PBE=le3. For systems operating at k850 nm and\nt\n\nRMS pointing error of 1 pad. this is equivalent to an optimum transmitter aperture diameter of 310 cm at\nP B E = I P and 517 cm at PBE=lW3.

The presence of this power penalty can be seen from Fig.\n5.6. Note that, even when the optimal transmitter aperture is used. the signal power required to achieve a given\nerror rate is about 1.6 dB higher t a when the RMS pointing error can be ignored. By combining Eqs. (5.15)\nhn\nand (5.16). the required transmitter power can be related to the optimal transmitter antenna gain by\nr\n\n(5.17)\nFor systems with perfect spatial tracking, the signal power needed to maintain a constant PBE can also be\ninversely related to the transmitter antenna gain GT by inverting Eq. (5.5). Since the required transmitter power\nis inversely proportional to the transmitter antenna gain in both cases, it follows that for a given antenna gain,\nthe ratio between the required signal power in the presence of random pointing error and that when the spatial\ntracking can be perfectly realized is a constant which is independent of GT.Furthermore, because both y~ and\nyp m independent of\n\n0%.the\n\npower penalty due to spatial tracking error is independent of the RMS pointing\n\nerror. Figure 5.9 is the plot of this power penalty as a function of the PBE for a 4-aryPPM system. Note that the\npower penalty ranges from 1.6 dB at PBE=lW to about 2.3 d 3 at PBE=1P3. For systems with Gaussian\nE\ntransmitted beams, the power penalty is slightly higher. This is because the optimal transmitter antenna gain is\nsmaller for an uniformly illuminated aperture than for a Gaussian beam. Therefore, a larger transmitter power is\nneeded to achieve a given PBE when 0%= 0,and hence a smaller power penalty.\nTable 5.1 shows a typical link budget for a 4-ary direct detection PPM system calculated using the ISL\nparameters shown in Table 2.1. Note that for direct detection systems, there is no constraint on the size of the\nreceiver aperture. The receiver aperture diameter of 30 cm was chosen because of the size and weight\nconstraints. In contrast, the presence of a random transmitter pointing error results in an optimal transmitter\naperture diameter which minimizes the required signal power. Compared to the system using a 30 cm diameter,\nuniformly illuminated, transmitter telescope, the ISL design that is optimized for an RMS pointing error of 1\np a d has a much smaller transmitter antenna gain (27.5 dB at as,=\' p a d and PBE=lV).

Given an instantaneous LO tracking error of\n\nOR\n\nand a transmitter pointing error of &, the signal-to-noise ratio (SM) at the heterodyne receiver can be written\n\nas\n\n(5.18)\n\nwhere a l = q T q R ( X ) ( - ) \'h S\nT\n\nhv\n\n4x2\n\nis a constant which i independent of the transmitter power and the pointing and\ns\n\ntracking errors. Note that alPL is simply the receiver S N R per unit transmitter and receiver antenna gains. In\nderiving Eq. (5.18), it has been assumed that the transmitter aperture is uniformly illuminated and that both\nsignal and LO can be approximated by plane waves that cover the receiver aperture of diameter d R . In addition\nto the pointing loss facmr, L T ( G T b & , O T l b ~ ) , the presence of the LO tracking error results in a tracking loss\n\nfactor LR(GRbeR /beR ) which, when both signal and LO are plane waves, is given by\n,OR\n\n(5.19)\n\nBy normalizing the pointing and tracking emors by their respective RMS values, the receiver S N R depends on\n\npointing and tracking errors only through ( a l p = /ci,$cr& 1 GTcT&., GRc&,OT /o+, OR / b e R .\n,\nand\nThe probability of error for a binary heterodyne NCFSK system, conditioned on the IF SNR, can be\nwritten as E281\n1\n2\n\nPE = -e+2\n\n.\n\n(5.20)\n\nEquation (5.20) was derived assuming that the carrier phase noise. has a negligible impact cn the performance of\n115\n\nthe NCFSK system. In the presence of carrier phase noise, the PBE depends not only on the receiver S N R , but\nalso on the linewidthsof the transmitter and LO lasers. The unconditionalprobability of error for the heterodyne\nNCFSK channel can be written as\n\nr\n\n1\n\n(5.21)\n\nwhere u=8T/oe and v=eR/oeR the normalized pointing and tracking errors, respectively. Note that the\nare\nunconditional PBE depends only on three parameters (alPL/o&o&).GTG&, and GRO&. Because of the\ntrade-off between the pointing loss factor and the beam divergence, it can be argued that, for a given RMS\npointing error and the desired PBE, an optimal transmitter antenna gain exists which minimizes the required\nsignal power. For a heterodyne system, the presence of an LO tracking loss factor suggests a similar trade-off\nbetween the receiver aperture diameter and the signal-to-noise ratio. By inspecting Eq. (5.18) it is seen that,\nwhen the LO tracking can be perfectly realized, the receiver S N R is proportional to the receiver antenna gain\nG R . In the presence of the LO tracking error, however, the S N R decreases rapidly when the argument of the\n\nBessel function,\n\nG&,\napproaches 3.84.\n\nConsequently, the receiver aperture diameter cannot be increased\n\nindefinitely,and an optimal receiver antenna gain exists which maximizes the system performance.\nBy differentiating both sides of Eq.

The resulting value of yr is plotted in\nFig. 5.10 versus the PBE for a binary NCFSK system. By comparing Fig. 5.10 and Fig. 5.7, it is seen that, for a\nsimilar R M S transmitter pointing error, the performance of the heterodyne system is optimized at a slightly\nhigher transmitter antenna gain than the direct detection PPM system. However, it should be noted that for\nheterodyne systems, the receiver antenna gain is constrained by the RMS LO tracking error while no such\nconstraint exists for the direct detection PPM system. As a result, the product of the transmitter and receiver\nantenna gains is usually smaller for the heterodyne system than for a comparable direct detection system.\nFigure 5.11 is a plot of\n\nyp\n\nversus PBE for a heterodyne 4-ary NCFSK system. The value of\n\nyp\n\nranges\n\nfrom =160/rad4 at PBE = le3 approximately 2,600/rad4 at PBE = 10-9. Note that the required transmitter\nto\npower for a heterodyne NCFSK system is proportional to both o and o&. In contrast, the required signal\n&\npower for a direct detection PPM system is proportional to o&. Consequently, the heterodyne channel is more\nsensitive to spatial tracking errors. For systems with large RMS pointing and tracking jitters, the amount of\ntransmitter power needed to achieve a given PBE can be significantly larger for the heterodyne system despite\nthe higher receiver sensitivity. For example, given the link parameters shown in Table 2.1 and the parameter y p\nplotted in Fig. 5.1 1, the required transmitter power needed t achieve l@ error rate is approximately 0.1 mW\no\nat\n\n0\n%\n\n= COR = 0.2 pad). However, a large pointing and tracking jitters, the required transmitter power is\nt\n\nunacceptably high (a1 W for 0%= GeR = 2 pad).\nIn addition to imposing constraints on the antenna gains, random pointing and tracking errors also incur a\npower penalty in the link budget. By combining Eqs. (5.24) and (5.25), the required transmitter power in the\npresence of pointing and tracking errors can be related to the optimal transmitter and receiver antenna gains by\n117\n\n0.60\n\n0.50\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI I IIll\n\nI\n\nI I IIIll\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI I I I I I\n\n1\n\nI\n\nI I I1111\n\nI\n\nI I I1111\n\nHeterodyne 4 - a r y\nX = 850nm\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI Ill\n\nNCFSK\n\nFig.5.10.

(5.18) that, in order to maintain a constant\nPBE, the required transmitter power is a s inversely related to the product of GT and GR. Consequently when\nlo\nboth transmitter and receiver antenna gains are optimized, the power penalty, which is defined as the ratio\nbetween the required signal power in the presence of pointing and tracking errors and that when spatial tracking\ncan be perfectly realized, is independent of the antenna gains. It follows from Eq. (5.23) that the power penalty\n\nis independent of the RMS pointing and tracking emrs. The power penalty for a binary FSK system is plotted in\n\noe\nFig. 5.12 versus the PBE. N t that the power penalty associated with the spatial tracking error is approximately\n4 dB for PBE=lW, and increases to about 5 dB for PBE=W3. The power penalty shown in Fig. 5.12 is\n\ncalculated assuming that both transmitter and receiver antenna gains are optimized. Therefore, despite the\nrelatively small increase in the power penalty (2-3 dB) over the direct detection system, the actual power margin\nin a heterodyne system is much smaller since a smaller receiver antenna must be used.\nTable 5.2 shows the typical link budget for a 4-ary NCFSK system designed with 1 p a d RMS transmitter\npointing and LO tracking errors. The link budget is calculated using the ISL parameters shown in Table 2.1.\nCompared to an ideal system using 30 cm transmitter and receiver telescopes, the design optimized for RMS\npointing and tracking errors of 1 p a d has much smaller transmitter and receiver antenna gains. In addition, a\npower penalty ( dB) must be allocated in the link budget because of the random pointing and tracking errors.\n4\nBy comparing Tables 5.1 and 5.2, it is seen that the spatial tracking error affects the heterodyne channel much\nmore severely than the direct detection channel. In fact, the advantage of using a heterodyne system because of\nthe higher detection sensitivity (-5-10 dB) i quickly offset by the smaller receiver antenna gain and the larger\ns\npower penalty due to spatial tracking error. The link budget shown in Table 5.2 was calculated assuming that a\nsignal power of 100 mW is available at the transmitter. In practice, because heterodyne systems are very\nsensitive to carrier phase noise, mode-stabilized semiconductor lasers with dynamic linewidths on the order of\nseveral megahertz are required to maintain a reasonable detection sensitivity. Such lasers are not readily\navailable at power output exceeding 50 mW. It should be emphasized, however, that even though the power\nbudget given in Table 5.2 shows a smaller power margin than the direct detection PPM system, heterodyne\nsystems offer better background noise immunity and narrower field-of-view.

For instance, the optimal antenna diameter is greater than 50 cm for an optical ISL operating with 0 2\n.\np a d RMS pointing errors. For such systems, the sizes of the transmitter and receiver antennas are limited by the\n\nI\n\nweight and budget constraints rather than performance considerations.

Because the\n\nsince the transmitted beamwidth increases with decreasing transmitter antenna gain, such systems are less\nsensitive to the random pointing errors. Similarly,a smaller receiver antenna gain implies that the receiver S N R\nis much less sensitive t the LO tracking error. In fact, an inspection of Fig. 5.6 shows that, when the antenna\no\n\ngains are chosen to be smaller than their optimal value, a smaller power penalty due to spatial tracking error is\nexpected. Figures 5 1 and 5 1 are plots of power penalty versus antenna gain for a 4-aryPPM system and a\n.3\n.4\n\nI\n\nbinary NCFSK system, respectively.

The impact of Rayleigh distributed pointing and tracking errors on the\ndesign of ISLs is seen by the existence of optimal antenna gains and the additional power penalty. In some\nsystems, however, because of systematic noises, there may be a static bias at the output of the spatial tracking\ncircuit The presence of this bias results in a static pointing error at the transmitter and receiver in addition to the\nrandom, zero-mean Gaussian pointing jitters. When both static and random pointing errors are present at the\ntransmitter, the probability distribution of the instantaneous pointing error OT is no longer Rayleigh distributed.\nInstead, for ISLs with a static pointing error of 80, the instantaneouspointing error e T is Rician distributed with\ndensity function\n(5.27)\n\nwhere 0% is the variance of the random pointing jitter, and f o ( x ) is the modified Bessel function of the first\nkind. In the presence of static and random pointing errors, the PBE can be calculated by substituting Eq. (5.27)\nfor the density of \xe2\x82\xacIT in Eq. (5.11) and carrying out the integration. Note that by normalizing the random\npointing jitter by its RMS value, the PBE can be written as a function of\n\ne&+,\n\nP"/a,$ and GTO&.\n\nConsequently, in the presence of static pointing errors, both the optimal antenna gain and the minimal signal\npower are functions of the static pointing error. Both Cropand PL- can be calculated numerically. Figure 5.15\nis a plot of the optimal transmitter antenna gain versus the RMS pointing jitter for a 4-ary PPM system operating\nat PBE=10-6. N t that in the presence of a static pointing error, the optimal transmitter antenna gain is smaller\noe\nthan that when O d . At small RMS pointing errors, the optimal antenna gain is much smaller for systems with\nlarge static pointing errors. However, at large RMS pointing jitters, the effect of static pointing error is\npractically negligible. Similarly, given \xe2\x82\xaclo, and oar, the required transmitter power, PL-, can be calculated.\nFigure 5.16 is a plot of P, versus the RMS pointing jitter for a 4-ary PPM system, Note that at small RMS\nL,\npointing jitters, static pointing jitter can result in a large increase in the required signal power. As the RMS\npointing jitter increases, however, the impact of static pointing enor becomes less significant and the required\ntransmitter power converges to that of a system with &O.\n127\n\n1\n\nI\nI30\n\nI\n\nm\n\n120\n\n\'0\n\nY\n\n,\n\nI\n\nI\n\nDirect Detection QPPM\nK8=10,X z 8 5 0 n m\nPBE =\ndR = 3 0 c m\n:= 40,000 krn\n\nI25\nA\n\n,\n\n-\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\nc\n\nb\n\n115\n\nI\n\nI10\n\n+\'"\nc3\n\n1\n\n1051\n0.

Under two special conditions, however, the performance analysis can be simplified\nconsiderably. The first case occurs when the R M S pointing error is much greater than the static pointing error,\n\na+>>Bo. In this c s the probability dislribution of 01 given in Eq.(5.27) can be approximated by the Rayleigh\nae\ndensity shown in Eq. (5.4). and the analysis for the spatial tracking error can be carried out by considering only\nthe random pointing error. The second case occurs when the RMS pointing error 0 0 , is much smaller than the\nstatic pointing error 00. In this case the probability distribution of\n\nBT\n\nis concentrated around BT=6O. and the\n\nanalysis can be carried out assuming that only the static pointing error is present.\nIn the presence of static pointing emr, the transmitter power is related to the received photocount and the\ntransmitter parameters by\n\nwhere LP(S~,6o) the pointing loss factor given by Eq. (5.1 1). For given KS and 60, the required transmitter\nis\npower can be minimized by maximizing the product\n(5.29)\nSince the function J l ( x ) is maximized at x=1.84, the required transmitter power can be minimized if the\ntransmitter antenna gain is chosen such that\nG~*6$=(1.84)~=3.38 .\n\n(5.30)\n\nNotice that, in the presence of a static pointing error, the optimal antenna gain depends only on the static\npointing error. The pointing loss factor Lp(GT ,eo) at the optimal antenna gain is given by\n\nLp(C~wpt,6~) 1-4dB , GT- = 3.38/6$ .\n0.4\n\n(5.31)\n\nIn other words, in the presence of a static pointing error, a design which optimizes the transmitter antenna gain\nwill require 4 dB higher transmitter power to maintain the system performance. Compared to the value of GrW\ncalculated from Fig. 5.7, it is seen that the optimal antenna gain in the presence of a fixed pointing error is much\nhigher than that when the pointing error is randomly distributed.\n\n130\n\nSimilarly. for heterodyne systems, the presence ofstatic pointing and tracking errors implies that optimal\ntransmitter and receiver antenna gains can be found to optimize the system performance. These optimal antenna\ngains can be found by maximizing the product of the hacking loss factor and the antenna gain. For systems\nwhere the pointing and tracking loss factors can be approximated by the Airy patterns given in Eqs. (5.8) and\n\n( . 9 ,the signal power can be minimized by choosing the antenna gains to satisfy\n51)\n\nGT- = 3.38/8$ ,GR-= 3.38/0$R ,\nwhere 8% and\n\n8,\n0\n\n(5.32)\n\nare static pointing and tracking errors at the transmitter and receiver, respectively. When\n\nboth transmitter and receiver antenna gains are optimized for static pointing errors, the power penalty, which is\n\nthe product of pointing and tracking loss factors at optimal antenna gains, is approximately 0 1 or, equivalently,\n.6\n-8 dB.\n5.5 Summary and Discussion\n\nThe performance of the spatial tracking system is dominated by the residual mechanical noise which\ncannot be reduced by increasing the SLUR. The presence of these residual spatial pointing and tracking errors\nimposes additional constraints in the link design. In contrast to the perfectly tracked system where the link\nperformance improves with increasing transmitter and receiver aperture diameters, the presence of random\npointing and tracking errors affects the ISL design in two respects. First, in the presence of random pointing and\ntracking errors, system performance is optimized at particular values of the transmitter and receiver antenna\ngains. When hacking errors can be modeled as Rayleigh distributed random variables, these optimal antenna\ngains are inversely proportional to the mean square pointing and tracking emrs. Second, the presence of\npointing and tracking errors imposes an additional power penalty in the ISL link budget. The power penalty\n\nwas shown to be approximately 1.5 to 3 dB for a direct detection PPM system, and between 3 and 5 dB for a\nheterodyne NCFSK system.\nThe impact of random pointing and tracking errors on the design of ISLs can be summarized by the ISL\nlink budgets shown in Tables 5.1-5.3. In the absence of spatial tracking error, the heterodyne channel offers a\n\n5-10dB advantage in detection sensitivity over the comparable direct detection PPM system. However, the\nheterodyne system is much more sensitive to spatial tracking errors at the transmitter and receiver and the\nadvantage gained in detection sensitivity can be qiiickly offset by the smaller receiver antenna gain (16 dB at\n\n131\n\nGe,=lPd) and a higher power penalty (\xe2\x80\x9c2 dB) due to randomly distributed tracking and pointing errors. As a\nresult, for systems with large pointing and tracking errors, the direct detection channel is preferred over the\nheterodyne channel despite the smaller receiver sensitivity. For systems with small pointing and tracking jitters,\n\non the other hand, the antenna gains are limited by the size and weight of the optical system rather than\nperformance considerations. Because the antenna gains are smaller than the optimal values, these systems are\nless sensitive to the pointing and tracking jitters. Consequently, in the limit of small pointing and tracking jitters,\nthe heterodyne channel demonstratesa superior performancebecause of the higher receiver sensitivity.\nThus far the analysis of the system performance was carried out for an un-encoded system. In practice. the\nperformance of the link can be improved considerably by using error control techniques such as source encoding\nand forced retransmission. Because the tracking and pointing errors are due primarily to the residual mechanical\n\nnoise that has a typical frequency of several kilohertz, it is evident that errors introduced by the tracking errors\ngenerally occur in bursts with a typical burst period of several hundred microseconds. The error control\ntechniques, therefore, must effectively reduce this burst error probability [601-[63]. Several methods are\neffective for controlling the burst error. For systems demonstrating short error bursts, source encoding can be\nused to facilitate error detection and error recovery [163], [164]. However, because of the high data rate of the\nchannel, error bursts due to spatial tracking errors typically span a period of several hundreds or even thousands\nof bits. Burst error correction for such a long bit stream is impractical because of the complexity of the decoder.\nAlternatively. burst errors can be effectively controlled by requiring the receiver to acknowledge (ACK) the\ntransmitter upon receiving an error free transmission. In the case where errors occur during the transmission, a\nno-acknowledgement (NAK) is sent and the transmitter will then re-transmit the previous data packet. When\ncoupled with an effective error detection code, this acknowledge-noacknowledge (ACK-NAK) scheme can be\nused to ensurcd that only valid data are received at the receiver. However, because of the long round trip delay\nfor an ISL, a large buffer memory is needed to store the data before an acknowledgement is received.\nConsequently, for channels demonstrating large burst error probabilities, such a scheme can severely reduce the\neffectiverate of transmission through the channel.\n\n132\n\n6. TIMING SYNCHRONIZATION\n\nIn order t implement an efficient decoding scheme, the receiver requires the presence of a clock signal\no\nthat is synchronized to the transmitted data stream. Receiver synchronization is also required for spaceborne\nsystems where the actual data rate is affected by the Doppler shift due to the relative motion. Furthermore,\nreceiver synchronization is needed to control the timing jitter and frequency drift corresponding to the\noscillator mise.\n\nIn some systems, the receiver synchronization is maintained by transmitting a separate timing signal on\ntop of the message waveform. The receiver then extracts the necessary sync infomation to perform the\n\ns\ndecoding. For such systems, the receiver synchronization i relatively easy to implement. However,\nadditional signal energy and bandwidth are required by the sync channel. Alternatively, the receiver timing can\nbe recovered directly from the received data bearing signal such that no additional timing signal is necessary.\nThis method has the advantage of power and bandwidth conservation and, consequently, is preferred for\napplications where the signal power and available bandwidth are limited.\n6.1 Synchronizationof Direct Detection PPM Systems\n\nThe problem of symbol synchronization from a data bearing signal deals with the estimation of the time\nat which the modulation changes its state. In the case of a direct detection PPM system, this implies estimating\nand tracking the slot timing from the output of the photodetector t( 1 ) . where [3], [741\n\nIn Eq. (6.1), T and C are the anival time and gain associated with the j* photon event, h ( t ) is the impulse\n,\n,\nresponse of the detector, and the thermal noise has been assumed to be negligible compared to the signal shot\nnoise. The photocount rate of the detector is proportional to the total power received at the photodetector and,\nfor an Wary PPM system, can be modeled as\n\nwhere X B , ~ S are the photocount rates due to the background and signal, T,=MT, is the word period,\nNT=T/T, is the number of codewords in the observation period, dk is the k* data word. and p ( r ) is the\n\n133\n\ntransmitted pulse shape. The purpose of the synchronization system, therefore, is to recover the slot timing\ngiven the photodetector output in Eq. (6.1). After the slot timing has been recovered, frame and word\nsynchronizationscan then be achieved using a coding technique [16q, [166].\n\nI\n\n6.1.1 The MAP Estimator\nGiven the received signal r ( t ) , the optimal symbol timing estimator is the one which maximizes the\nu posteriori probability p (z I r (t)), where\n\n\'5\n\nis the timing offset between the receiver and the transmitter.\n\nMathematically, the output of the optimal estimator can be written as 131. [74]\n\nThe estimator which implements Eq. (6.3) is known as the MAP estimator. When the u priori probability\ndistribution of the pulse delay is unknown, the probability can be assumed to be equally distributed over the\nobservation interval. In this case the MAP decision reduces to an ML estimator which maximizes\np ( r ( t ) .W I T I)\nT.\n\nFor a general receiver output given in Eq. (6.1). the probability p ( r ( t ) ,O l t l T IT) is very difficult to\ncalculate. The calculation can be simplified considerably, however, if it is assumed that the detector impulse\nresponse can be modeled as a delta function, and that the detector gain Cj is constant. Under these\nassumptions,the ML estimator is given by [3]\n<ML = urg\n\n-j,,Th(t\n\n(t )logh(t+z)dt\n\nm,ax\n\nI\nI\n1\n1\nI\n\nR\nI\n\n(6.4)\n\nwhere the expectation is taken with respect to the random code sequence h(t). The term involving the integral\nof h(t+.r)i the total expected photocount during the period (0,\ns\nT). For a long observation interval, the\nfluctuation in this term will be small compared to the total received photocount.

Judging from the\ncomplexity of the estimator, it is apparent that the M timing estimator, although it maximizes the probability\nL\nof choosing the correct estimate, is far from practical. A large number of cornlators are needed to provide an\nacceptable timing estimate. Consequently, in order to implement pulse tracking, some simplification to the ML\ndecision rule must be devised.\n6.1.2 Early-Late Gate Tracking Loop\nA direct and straightforward simplification of the MAP estimator is to reduce the number of correlators\n\nrequired by using a tracking loop. Recall that the ML estimator maximizes the likelihood function f ( r ( t ) , ~ )\ngiven by (6.6). If it is assumed that f ( r ( f ) , T )is differentiable with respect to the delay time 2, then the\nderivative off (r ( t ) , T ) can be used as an indication for the timing offset. Note that af (r (t),z)/& is given by\n\nr\n\nu,\n+(j+l)T, +\'F\n\na\nr(t)xlog[hB\n\n+ Asp ( t - k T w - / T , ~ ) ] d t\n\n(6.7)\n\n.\n\n-\n\n1\n\nJ\n\nFor a given initial estimate of the timing delay i,Eq. (6.7) can be used to provide an indication of the search\ndirection. At &T,\n\naf (r(t).T)/&I; is negative, while at ier, the value of Eq. (6.7) is positive. Consequently,it\n\nis possible to design a closed-loop tracking circuit which makes use of this property. Figure 6.2 shows an\nexample of such an implementation. The phase of the timing estimator is updated every word period by the\namount that is proportional to the derivative of the likelihood function.\nThe timing loop implemented using Eq. (6.7). however, is still very complicated and further\nsimplifications are needed to simplify the design. One such simplification is to approximate the second term\n\n135\n\nI\nCI\n\n0\n\nC\n\nC\n\nm\n\nc\n\n0\n\n2\n\n2\nC\n\nr\nI\n\n136\n\nI\nI\n\nI\n\ne\n1\n\nI\n1\nI\n\n1\n\nPulse\nGenerator\n\nTiming\nOsci 11a t or\n\nky\n\n~\n\nI1\n1\n\n]Differentiator1\n\nT\n\nI s\n\np\n\nI\nU\n\nFig.6.2.

(6.7) by a convolution of the received signal pulse r ( t ) with an early-late gate\npulse g (t) where\n\nAnother simplification can be made by noting the value computed by the upper branch in Figure 6.2 strongly\nemphasizes the early-late gate output during the slot which contains the actual signal pulse. Consequently,it is\npossible to replace the upper branch in Figure 6.2 by the decision value of the decoder. That is, only the\nearly-late gate output during the signal slot will be used to update the timing oscillator. Figure 6.3 shows a\nblock diagram of this simplified decision-drivenearly-late gate tracking loop.\nThe application of the decision-driven early-late-gate loop in symbol synchronization has been studied\npreviously [3]. It has been shown that, at high S N R ,the variance of the timing error for a binary PPM system\ncan be given by\n(6.9)\n\nwhere &=r/TSis the normalized timing error, BL is the bandwidth of the tracking loop, Ts is the slot width, and\n\nKS is the signal photocountreceived over the slot period.\n6.1.3 Phase-locked loops\nThe early-late gate described in the previous section is an approximation to the optimal MAP timing\nestimator. Consequently, it represents a lower bound on the performance of a synchronization system.\nHowever, when used in a direct detection PPM system, the early-late gate synchronizerrequires a complicated\ndecision feedback structure which may be difficult to implement. Alternatively, when the input signal to the\nsynchronization subsystem contains a spectral component at the desired lock-in frequency, a simple phaselocked loop (PLL) shown in Figure 4.10 can be used to recover the pulse timing.\nThe applications of PLLs in radio and optical communication systems have been studied extensively\n[28]-[31]. [631-[681, [167]-[169]. Gagliardi and Haney [167] and Snyder and Forrester [168] analyzed the\nprobability density of tracking error for a PLL under shot noise input. Mengali and Pezzani [671 studied the\nphase error variance of a PLL driven by photodetector current in an optical pulse amplitude modulation\n\n138\n\n9\nh\nDecoder\n\nDecoded\nData\n\nFig. 6.3 Decision driven early-late gate tracking loop for the PPM system\n\n139\n\nsystem. Marshall 1651 studied the performance of PLL tracked PPM systems with pulses occupying a fraction\n\nof the time slot. These studies have shown that PLLs can be used to track the transmitter timing provided that\nthe transmitted signal contains a frequency component a the desired lock-in frequency.\nt\nGiven the photodetector output r(r), the time-averaged power spectrum of r ( r ) can be defined as [3]\nT\n\n&(a) = Jim &E[ I LTr(r)eiwdf Iz]\n-9-\n\n(6.10)\n\nThe expectation in Eq. (6.10) can be evaluated by first taking the expectation with respect to the shot noise\nprocess, conditioned on h(r), then taking the expectation of the resulting expression with respect to h(r).The\n\nfirst expectation can be evaluated by differentiating the joint characteristics function of the filtered Poisson\n\n(6.11)\n\nwhere @ ~ ( a ) = E [ eis the] characteristics function of the detector gain G . The resulting joint expectation\n~~\nof the photodztector output can be written as\n\nwhere the brackets <Gn>denote the ensemble average of G". By substituting (6.12) into (6.10) and taking\nthe expectation with respect t the codewords ( d k ) , assuming that\no\n\n(dk)\n\nare independent and uniformly\n\ndistributed over (O,l,...,M- 1), the resulting power spectrum of the photodetector output can be written as\n(Appendix C)\n\n+g\n\nI P ( 0 ) I2(1- IR (0)12)\n\n(6.13)\n\nwhere F denotes the excess noise factor of the detector,\n140\n\n(6.14)\n\nand P ( ) H ( o ) are the Fourier transforms of the pulse shape and the impulse response of the detector-filter,\na.\nrespectively. If p ( t ) is a rectangular pulse with width T,, its Fourier transform P (a) be zem at all integer\nwill\nmultiples of the slot frequency, 2 f l , . In this case, the detector output spectrum in Eq. (6.13) contains no\ndiscrete frequency components a the slot frequency or its harmonics. Consequently, the PLL cannot track the\nt\noutput of the photodetector directly. Preprocessing of the detector output is necessary to generate a frequency\ncomponent a the slot frequency.\nt\nOnly nonlinear processing needs t be considered, because any linear filtering will simply amount t\no\no\nmultiplying the power spectrum in Eq. (6.13) by the magnitude square of the filter transfer function, and will\nnot affect the absence of the spectral component at the slot frequency. One approach is to filter the signal and\nthen square the filter output, as depicted in Figure 6.4. The output of this preprocessing circuit can be written\n\nas\n(6.15)\n\nwhere h ( t ) now denotes the combined impulse response of the detector and the preprocessing filter. The\nexpectation value of the preprocessor output can be evaluated by first differentiating its conditional\ncharacteristics function in Eq. (6.11). then taking the expectation with respect to the codewords (dk). The\nresulting expression for the expected preprocessor output is given by\n\nL\n\n1\n\n(6.16)\n\nwhere we have used the fact that\n\n11\n4\n\n142\n\nBy examining Eq. (6.16). it is seen that the last term at the right-handed side is periodic with period T,.\nTherefore, in contrast to the photodetector output, the squared current does have a strong spectral component\nat the slot frequency. The output of the preprocessing circuit can therefore be regarded as the sum of a\nperiodic signal s(t) and an additive noise term n (t )\n\nwhere from ( . 6\n61)\n(6.19)\nand the noise is simply the part of the preprocessor output that is not periodic,\nn ( t ) = i 2 ( t )s ( t )\n-\n\n.\n\n(6.20)\n\nFigure 6.5 shows the power spectra of a computer simulated photodetector output before and after\npreprocessing. The simulation was carried out assuming that a photon counting detector (F=l) was used to\ndetect the optical radiation. Note that the frequency component at slot frequency is strongly enhanced by the\npreprocessor. The analytic expression for the power spectrum of the preprocessed signal is quite complicated.\nHowever, the expression can be simplified considerably if it is assumed that H (a)\nblocks the dc component of\n\nthe signal, and that both P (a) H ( ) the Fourier transforms of p (t ) and h (t), are slowly varying functions\nand a ,\n\na,\nof frequency compared to R ( ) defined in Eq. (6.14). The first assumption is made because the dc component\nof the detector output contains no timing information and will only contribute noise to the squared signal. The\nsecond assumptions holds for higher-order PPMs (Le., for M large). Because, in general, h (t ) and p (1) are\npulses of width comparable to T, , their Fourier transforms will have supports on the order of a,=2x/T,. The\nsupport for R ( ) on the other hand, is on the order of a lM , where M is the PPM order. Consequently, for\na.\n,\nhigher-order PPMs,the assumption that P (a)and H ( o ) are slowly varying compared to R (a)usually holds.\nFor high signal counts, the power spectrum of the preprocessed signal i2(r) near the slot frequency can be\napproximated under these assumptions by (Appendix B) [1691\n\n143\n\nI\n\n0.00\n\nI .oo\n\n1\n\nI\n\n2.00\n\n3.00\n\n4.0 0\n\nFREQUENCY ( w / w , )\n(a) Before\n\nI\n\nI\n\n2\n\nPhoton Counting Receiving\n\na\nI\no\n\nK = 30\n,\n\n3\n\nKb= O\n\nW\n\nQ,\nv)\n\na\nW\n3\n\n0\nQ\n\n0.00\n\n2.00\n\nI. 30\n\n3.00\n\n4.00\n\nFREQUENCY ( h . / w\n( b ) After\nFig.6.5.

The presence of a spectral peak at w=os\nimplies that the output of the preprocessor contains a sinusoidal component with frequency\n\nO=O,.\n\nThe\n\namplitude of this sinusoidal component can be given by\n(6.24)\nwhere ws=2xlTs is the slot frequency.\nThe variance of the timing error for a PLL driven by a sinusoidal signal embedded in an additive white\nnoise can be approximated by\n(6.25)\nwhere &=5/Tsis the normalized timing error, S,(w) is the power spectral density of the additive noise, A is the\namplitude of the input sinusoid, and BL is the closed-loop bandwidth of the tracking loop. The parameter p in\nEq. (6.25) can be interpreted as the ratio of signal power and the amount of noise power admitted by the loop\nwith bandwidth BL. Equation (6.25) was derived for a sinusoidal signal in an AWGN. The shot noise at the\noutput of the squarer, however, is non-stationary. For non-stationary noise, the phase error variance of the\nPLL is in general a function of time. Nevertheless, it can be shown [170] that for a sufficiently narrow loop\n\nbandwidth, phase error is stationary, and the phase error variance for the receiver in Figure 6.4 is indeed given\nby Eq. (6.25).\nBy substituting the expression for noise power spectrum from (6.23) and the expression for signal\n\namplitude from (6.24) into (6.25). the followingexpression for the variance of timing error is obtained:\n(6.26)\n\n145\n\nY=[\n\n2T,JP(o\xe2\x80\x99)P* (W\xe2\x80\x9d)P* (O\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99)H(d)H(O-O\xe2\x80\x99)H*\n(o\xe2\x80\x9d)H ( ~ \xe2\x80\x9d ) d d ~ \xe2\x80\x9d\nd\nIP(o)H(w)*P(w)H(o)l2\n\n(6.27)\n\nwhere K, is the signal count per word, M is the order of the PPM, BL is the equivalent closed-loop bandwidth,\nand y is a dimensionlessparameter which depends only on the pulse shape and the preprocessing filter transfer\nfunction. N t that because f,=l/T,, the parameter BL T, is actually a ratio of the loop bandwidth and the slot\noe\nfrequency. The values of y for some choices of preprocessing filter transfer functions are listed in Table 6.1.\nFor a given pulse shape, the transfer function of the preprocessing filter can be chosen to minimize the value of\ny. One choice is t model H ( w ) as an ideal low pass differentiator with bandwidth BO.Figure 6.6 is a plot of\no\n\nthe value of y versus the bandwidth of the differentiator for the case where p(t) is a square pulse of width T,. It\nis shown that the value of y is minimized (yminz3.2) for BoT,=1.3. Also shown in Figure 6.6 is the value of y\nevaluated using the preprocessing filter which consists of a low pass Gaussian filter with RMS bandwidth BO,\nfollowed by an ideal differentiator. The minimum values of y obtained using both preprocessing filters are\nsimilar. Equation (6.26) shows that the variance of the phase error is inversely proportional to the signal\npower (Le., signal photocount Ks)and is proportional to the number of time slots M and the loop bandwidth.\nCompared to an optimal, decision-driven, early-late gate timing estimator, the PLL requires y times more\nsignal power (Le., 5 dB for y = 3.2) to achieve comparable timing performance. However, the performance of\nthe PLL does not depend critically on the assumption of pulse shape or the decision process. Furthermore, the\nimportant system performance factor is bit error rate (BER), not the timing variance. The system BER, which\nis calculated in Section 6.3, shows that the actual power penalty for using a suboptimal PLL synchronizer is\nsmall (less than 0.1 dB) for a sufficiently narrow loop bandwidth (BLT, <lop3)even when a conservative value\nof 10 is assumed for y.\nIt should be noted that the loop bandwidth BL actually increases with increasing signal amplitude. In\norder to accommodate a wide dynamic range of input signals, it is the usual practice to precede the PLL by\neither an automatic gain control (AGC) circuit or a limiter. The effect of the AGC is to dynamically scale the\ninput signal so that the signal amplitude and, consequently the loop bandwidth, remain essentially constant. By\nusing an AGC or limiter, the performance of the PLL will improve inversely with the signal strength.\nEquation (6.26) was verified by a computer simulation [68], [169] for direct detection PPM systems using\nphoton counting detectors (F=l). The results, which are summarized in Figures 6.7 and 6.8, are in excellent\n\n146\n\nTable 6.1 Values of y for various choices of preprocessing filter.\n\ni\n\nI Y1\n\nFilter\n\ni\n\ni\n\ni\n\nelsewhere 3.58\nj a l01<2~/T,\n\n=0\n\nelsewhere\n\n147\n\n6.97\n\n1\nI\n\nI\n\n1\n\nI\n\nI\nI\n\n4.80\n\nx\n3.20\n\nI\n\nI\n\nGaussian LP Differentiator\n\n04\n.0\n\n12\n.0\n\n0.80\n\nI.60\n\n2.00\n\nDlFF ERENTIATOR BANDbllDTH (8,/cos)\n\nFig.6.6.\n\nThe value of y as a function of the differentiator bandwidth for PPM systems with rectangular\npulses of width Ts .

(6.26) required M t\no\nbe large.\n\n6.2 Synchronizationof Heterodyne Systems\nUnlike the direct detection systems where the shot noise follows the Poisson statistics, the noise in a\nheterodyne receiver is predominately Gaussian distributed. The problems of timing synchronization and\ncarrier recovery for a heterodyne system are therefore similar to that of an AWGN channel.\n6.2.1 Synchronizationof Coherent Heterodyne Channels\nSynchronization of a coherent heterodyne channel consists of several steps. First, the receiver must\nestablish the reference carrier synchronization by phase-locking onto the incoming carrier modulated signal.\nThe problems of carrier synchronization and its impact on the performance of the heterodyne system have\nbeen analyzed in Chapter 4, and will not be repeated here. After a coherent carrier reference is established.\nsymbol timing synchronizationcan then be achieved by phase-lockingonto the demodulated baseband signal.\nSeveral methods can be used to establish the symbol timing synchronization for a coherent heterodyne\nchannel [28]-[31]. Figures 6.9(a)-(d) show the structures of some commonly used symbol synchronizers for\nthe coherent BPSK system. The ML timing estimator shown in Figure6.9(a) offers the optimal timing\n\no\nperformance, but is impractical t use because of its complexity [28]. The early-late gate loop is an\napproximation of the ML tracking loop. The received signal is integrated over the early and late gate period,\nand nonlinearly (absolute value) conditioned to make the integrator outputs bit independent. The channels are\nthen subtracted and the difference is fed into a timing oscillator. The structure of an early-late gate tracking\nloop is shown in Figure6.9(b). Symbol timing synchronization can also be achieved using the data transition\ntracking loop (DTTL) shown in Figur&.9(c). The in-phase branch determines the polarity of the bit transition\nwhile the quadrature phase branch obtains a measure of the synchronization error. Finally, like the direct\ndetection PPM system, nonlinear phase-locked loops can be used to track the symbol timing of an AWGN\nchannel. Examples of the nonlinear PLL for synchronizingthe BPSK system are shown in Figure6.9(d).\nThe performances of the various symbol synchronizers have been investigated extensively [28], [31].It\ncan be shown that the variance of the synchronizationerror for these loops generally have the following form:\n151\n\nFig.6.9(a).\n\nMaximum likelihood (ML)\ntiming synchronizer for the BPSK system.\n\n152\n\n1\nI\nD\nI\nI\nD\nI\nI\ni\nI\nI\nD\nI\nI\n1\n1\nI\nI\nI\n\nA n early-late gate type of symbol synchronizer with absolute value\ntype of nonlinearity\n\nFg69b.\ni..()\n\nEarly-late gate tracking h p .\n\n153\n\nI I\n\n(k-\n\nTiming\nPulse\nGenerator\n\np+h\nDigital\n\n5 IT+ E I\n\nFig. 6.9(c) The data-transition tracking loop.\n\n154\n\nL\n\ns(t)\n\n-\n\nbaseband\ninput bit\nstream +\nnoise\n\nnonlinearity\n\nfc\n\n= 1/T\n\n.-.\n\n[a)\n\nReconstructed\noutput clock\nfrequency\n\nIb)\n\n----differentiate\n\nI\nI\nI\n\nsquare\n\nThree types of nonlinear-filter bit synchronizers; (a) nonlinear filter using a matched filter and\neven-law nonlinearity, (b) delay-and-multiply synchronizer, and (c) differentiate-and-square synchronizer.

This acquisition sequence is\nthen envelope detected using two envelop detectors, each centered at one of the signal frequencies, over a T,\ninterval in quadrature with the primary detection interval (Figure 6.10). A maximum likelihood estimate of the\nnormalized timing offset E can then be derived from the output of these envelope detectors as\n(6.29)\nwhere M 1 and Mz denote the outputs of the sync envelope detectors. The conditional probability density\nfunction of this timing estimator is difficult to derive [28]. However, at high S N R , the output of the envelope\ndetector can be approximated by a signal embedded in a Gaussian noise. In which case the estimator in Eq.\n(6.29) becomes unbiased and the variance of the estimator error can be easily calculated by\n(6.30)\nwhere ~ A 2 T , / 4 N , is the SNR. The timing error variance can be reduced by averaging the estimator output\nover a large number of code periods or, equivalently, by using a tracking loop with a narrow loop bandwidth.\nThe analysis of the tracking loop follows closely the derivation leading to Eq. (6.8) [3]. It can be shown that,\nfor a tracking loop with bandwidth BL ,the variance of the tracking error can be written as\n(6.3 1)\n\n156\n\n1\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\nSig nal+Noisf\n\nSync\nDetector\n\n-\n\nTiming\nEstimator\n\nM2\n\n*\n\n\xe2\x80\x99\n\nDigital\nFllter\n\nT\nTiming\nOscillator\n\nReceived Signal Timing\n\nI\nI\nI\n1\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\nI\n\nfl\n\n1\n\nf2\n\nI\n\nI\n\nfl\n\nI\n\nf2\n\nI\n\nfl\n\nTS+\n\nETS\n\np-Ts-q\n\n1\n\nTd2\n+ri++\n\nDetector Timing\n1\nI\n\nSync Detector Timing\nTs-q\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nFig.6.10 The structure and the t m n diagram of the symbol synchronization loop for a noncoherent\niig\nFSK system.\n\n157\n\n6.3 Error Performance in the Presence of Timing m o r\n6.3.1 Direct Detection PPM Systems\n\nIn the presence of a timing error, signal energy that was transmitt d during a symbol interval may be\ninterpreted as a strong background interference in the adjacent intervals. For a direct detection PPM system,\nsuch an intersymbol interference will result in a loss of S N R and, hence, the increase in the probability of\ndecoding error. For systems employing the quantum limited, photon counting detectors, the probability of\nerror in the presence of a normalized timing error E can be approximated by [3]\n(6.32)\n\nwhere K s , KB are the expected photocount due to the signal and background in one slot period, and E is the\nnormalized timing offset. In practice, APDs are commonly used to detect the PPM encoded signal. In the\npresence of a fixed timing error E, the probability of decoding error for systems using APDs can be written as\nr\n\nI\n\n1\n\n(6.33)\n\nwhere\n\nIn writing Eq. (6.33),\n\n&,Is\n\nare the gain dependent and gain independent dark currents, and Kfh is the\n\nequivalent photocount rate of the thermal noise. At sufficiently high S N R , Eq. (6.33) can be approximated by\nthe union bound:\n158\n\n(6.34)\nNote that for M =2, the union bound gives an exact evaluation of Eq. (6.33). In deriving Eqs. (6.32) and (6.33),\nwe have neglected the end-effect at the word boundaries as they may contain energy spillover from adjacent\nwords. For higher order PPMs ( M A )the assumption that the end-effect is negligible can be justified[3].\nFurthermore, since APDs are more commonly used in direct detection PPM systems, and because the union\n\nbound proves to be an effective approximation of the PBE, Eq. (6.34) will be used to evaluate the PBE in the\npresence of a timing error.\nFor receivers employing dynamic phase synchronizationcircuits such as a PLL, the receiver timing error\nis randomly distributed. However, when the loop bandwidth BL is much smaller than the word frequency, the\ntiming m o r will be slowly varying so that it is approximately constant during a given word period. The\nunconditional error probability for the PPM system is therefore the expectation of (6.33) with respect to the\ndistribution of\n\nE.\n\nFor a well-synchronized system, e can be assumed to be Gaussian distributed, and the\n\nunconditional PBE is given by\n(6.35)\nEquation (6.35) was evaluated numerically and the resulting PBE is plotted in Figure 6.1 1 versus the expected\nsignal count, Ks,for a 4-ary PPM system. The results show a severe degradation of receiver performance with\nincreasing timing error variance, particularly when o,=O. 1.\nNumerical evaluation of PBE has been carried out for various signaling conditions and receiver loop\nbandwidths. The results are shown in Figures 6.12 through 6.14. Figure 6.12 is a plot of the PBE versus signal\ncount for various loop bandwidths. Note that these results and the results plotted in Figures 6.13 and 6.14 were\ncalculated by assuming a conservative value of 10 for y. It was shown in Section 6.1.3 that ~3 for welldesigned systems. For small loop bandwidths (& T, <\n\nthe performance of the PLL synchronized system\n\nis almost identical to that of the perfectly synchronized system. However, for large loop bandwidths\n(BLT, >lo-*), higher signal levels are needed t compensate for the effects of synchronization errors. The\no\n\nincrease in signal power needed to compensate for the imperfect synchronization (Le., maintain a given BER)\ncan be described equivalently in terms of decibel loss in signal power due to synchronization error.

It is seen from Figure 6.13 that for small loop bandwidths (& T, < le3), imperfect synchronization\naccounts for less than 0.1 dB loss in signal power, while at higher loop bandwidths (BLT,=O.~), loss can be\nthe\nsignificant. The loss factor curves plotted in Figure 6.13 are for a fixed PBE of 10-9. However, it can be easily\ndeduced from the linearity of curves shown in Figure 6.13 that similar losses can be expected for PBE ranges\nfrom 10-3 to 10-9.\nBecause of the coding gain, the PBE of a perfectly synchronized PPM system decreases with increasing\nPPM order. For PLL synchronized PPM systems, however, the variation of PBE with PPM order is more\ncomplicated because the timing error is also a function of the PPM order. Figure 6.14 is a plot of the PBE\nversus PPM orders for various loop bandwidths and background count rates with the number of signal photons\nper bit and the equivalent bit period kept constant The data show that for small loop bandwidths (& T,<10-4)\nand for M <lo, the performance of the PU. synchronized system is almost indistinguishablefrom the perfectly\nsynchronized system. Because the phase error variance increases with PPM order, the degradation in\nperformance becomes more pronounced at larger values of M . At high enough values of M the\nsynchronization error will dominate the coding gain so that eventually the PBE will become an increasing\nfunction of M . Consequently, an optimal order of PPM exists where the coding gain balances the\nsynchronization error and the PBE is minimum. Figure 6.14 shows that for a PPM system using the photon\ncounting detector and operating with a received signal level of 2 photons per bit, a background count rate of 1\nphoton per bit interval and BtT,=lO-3, the PBE is minimum near M=100. It should be noted that Figure6.14\nwas generated assuming that the transmitter laser has a perfect modulation extinction. In the presence of a\nfinite extinction ratio, the detector S N R is limited by the residual signal in the background slots, and the c w e s\nshown in Figure6.14 must be modified. In fact, for a PPM system with perfect timing synchronization, the\nperformance of the receiver improves with increasing PPM order until the limiting S N R is achieved, and\nfurther increase in the PPM ordcr will only result in a deteriorated system performance. This optimum PPM\norder is typically on the order of M=10 for modulation extinction ratios between 1 and 10%. Consequently,\nthe optimum PPM order due to synchronization error in Figure6.14 has very little impact on the design of the\npractical PPM channel.\n\n164\n\n6.3.2 Impact of SynchronizationError on Heterodyne Systems\n\nJust as it was in the direct detection system, synchronization error affects the performance of the\nheterodyne channel by introducing inter-symbol interference at the decoder. For simplicity, the following\nanalysis wl assume that the carrier phase fluctuation can be ignored and that the heterodyne channel can be\nil\napproximated by an AWGN. Furthermore, the analysis will be confined t the binary coherent PSK (CPSK)\no\nand the noncoherent FSK (NCFSK)\nsystems. Detailed discussions on the impact of symbol synchronization\nerror can be found in many communication texts [281-[31].\nGiven a normalized timing error\n\nE,\n\nthe conditional PBE for a binary CPSK system with rectangular\n\nbaseband pulses can be written as [28], [3 11\n\nwhere\n\npc is the coherent signal-to-noiseratio of the receiver in the absence of timing error.\n\nThe conditional\n\nPBE can also be calculated for a noncoherent FSK (NCFSK) system as [28]\n(NCFSK) (6.37)\nwhere p is the signal-to-noiseratio of the noncoherent receiver, and Q (a$)is Marcum\xe2\x80\x99s Q function defined in\nEq. (3.11). Equation (6.37) is in general very difficult to calculate. When the signal-to-noise ratio is\nsufficientlyhigh, union bound can be used to approximate the error rate:\n\n(NCFSK) (6.38)\n\nThe unconditional PBE can be evaluated by taking the expectation of the conditional PBE given by Eqs.\n(6.36) and (6.37) with respect to the dismbution of the timing error. Again, for a well-synchronized system,\n\nthe timing error can be assumed to be Gaussian dismbuted so that the unconditional PBE is given by Eq. (6.35)\n\n[28]. The random synchronization error affects the performance of the heterodyne channel in two respects.\n\nFirst, the synchronization error introduces intersymbol interference which reduces the S N R and increases the\nPBE. Second, given an RMS sync emr. there is a finite probability that the normalized synchronizatione m r\nwill exceed 1/2. For this case, the output of the detector matched to the signal will be smaller than the output\n165\n\nof the detector matched to the adjacent symbol and, therefore, results in a large probability of error. At high\n\nS N R ,the PBE due to the sync error can dominate the system error rate and result in an error rate "floor" which\ncannot be improved by increasing the S M . Given an RMS sync error a,the error rate "floor" can be given by\n,\n(6.39)\nThe degradation of the performance of heterodyne CPSK and NCFSK channels due t the synchronization\no\nerror can be seen in Figures 6.15(a) and 6.15(6) where the PBE is plotted against the receiver SNR. Note the\nappearance of error rate "floors"when a,>O.l. The power penalties associated with the synchronization error\nfor the heterodyne CPSK and NCFSK systems can be calculated as a function of the variance of the\nsynchronization error. These power penalties are plotted in Figures 6.16(a) and 6.16(b) versus the RMS\nsynchronizationerror at PBE\n\n10-6, and 10-9, respectively. Note that, at small a, the power penalties are\n,\n\nindependent of the PBE. However, at large RMS sync errors, the error rate "floor" due to the synchronization\nerror can exceed the desired PBE, and result in a rapid increase in the power penalty.\n\nIn practice, symbol synchronization of the heterodyne system is usually accomplished using a tracking\nloop such that the resulting RMS receiver timing error is inversely proportional to the S N R (cf. $6.2). In this\ncase the unconditional PBE of the heterodyne channel can be represented as a function of the loop bandwidth\nand the signal power. Figures 6.17(a) and 6.17(b) are plots of the power penalty versus the synchronization\nloop bandwidth, assuming that the variance of the synchronization error can be related to the loop bandwidth\nand the S N R p by\n(6.40)\nNote that, by tightening the loop bandwidth, the power penalty associated with the symbol synchronizationcan\nbe minimized.\n6.4 Summary\nThe results in this chapter show that, given the detector output signal, the performance of the symbol\nsynchronizer can be improved by reducing the bandwidth of the tracking loop and increasing the SNR. Even\nwhen suboptimal symbol synchronizers are used, the power penalty associated with the synchronization error\ncan be minimized by reducing the bandwidth of the symbol tracking loop. It is seen from the analyses that,\n166\n\n\'\n4\n\nW\n\nm\n\na\n\n10-71\n\nlo-\'\n\n1\n\nW\n\na\na\n\nFig.6.15.

Thc variance of the synchronization crror is rclnrcrl\nto the S N R by Eq.(6.39).\n\nwith a loop bandwidth that is less than 0.1% of the slot frequency, the direct detection PPM system can be slot\nsynchronized with less than 0.ldB of power penalty. It should be noted that for PPM decoding, word and\nframe synchronizations must also be achieved. Such a synchronization can be achieved using a coding\ntechnique after the slot synchronization is accomplished [165], [166]. For heterodyne systems, the analysis also\nshows that the power penalty due to symbol synchronizationis small. In fact, it was seen in Chapter 4 that a\nmore dominating source of error in the heterodyne system is due to the carrier synchronization and the carrier\nphase noise.\n\n170\n\n7. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION\n\nOptical communication links can be implemented using either direct or heterodyne detection receivers\n[31. The direct detection system [3]-[5] offers simplicityin design and, therefore, potentially higher reliability.\nIn contrast, the heterodyne system [3], [6]-[8] provides higher detection sensitivity, better background noise\nrejection, and the potential of frequency and phase encodings. In principle, the heterodyne system has a 5-10\n\ndB advantage in the detection sensitivity over the comparable duect detection channel [6]-[8].In practice,\nhowever, the heterodyne channel i very sensitive to the LO tracking error [54] and the laser phase noise [MIs\n[53]. When both the LO tracking error and the carrier phase noise are considered, the performance of the\nheterodyne channel can be seriously deteriorated.\nBoth direct [11-[5] and heterodyne [6+[8] detection systems have been studied for ISL implementations.\nIn this chapter, the design of typical direct and heterodyne detection ISLs will be studied and the performances\nof both systems in a realistic operating environment will be analyzed.\n7.1 Design Specifications\nTable 7.1 summarizes the mission requirements for an optical ISL. Because of the large demand\nprojected for future space missions, a data rate which exceeds 200 Mbps with an averaged PBE less than lW\n\nis desired. The mean-time-to-failure0 the system should be better than 5 years. Based on the these\nof\nmission requirements, detailed specifications on the ISL can be defined. Table 7.2 lists some of the parameters\nthat are critical t the performance of the ISL. The choice of these parameters will be discussed in detail in\no\nfollowing sections.\n7.1.1 Modulation Format\nGiven the desired data rate (>200Mbps), modulation formats must be properly specified for both direct\nand heterodyne detection systems.\nDirect detection PPM svstem For direct detection systems, pulse-position modulation (PPM) is used to\nmodulate the transmitter laser. The PPM is chosen over the OOK scheme because of its coding gain and the\nnoise immunity 131, [ll]. It should be noted that because of the coding gain. the performance of the PPM\nsystem improves with increasing PPM order. In practice, however, it is not practical to use PPM with order\n\n171\n\nTable 7.1 ISL mission requirements.\n\nLINK DISTANCE\n\n40,000km (LEO-GEO)\nz=\n\n80,000km (GEO-GEO)\nDATA RATE\n\nR = 200 Mbps\n\nBIT ERROR RATE\n\n<\n\nSYSTEM WEIGHT\n\n50 kg\n\nLIFETIME\n\n>5 yr\n\n172\n\nTable 7.2 ISL Design Parameters.\n\nMODULATION FORMAT\nTR4NSMITTER LASER\nPOWER\nEXTINCTION RATIO\nMODULATION BANDWIDTH\nMULTIPLEWDEMULTIPLEXSCHEMES\nLlNEWIDTH\n\nOPTICAL ANTENNA\nAPERTURE DIAMETERS\nTRANSMIITER AND RECElVEFi 3PTICS\nTRACKING SPLIT\nEFFICIENCY\nRECEIVER FIELD-OF-V EW (FOV)\nRECEIVER BANDWIDTI4\n\nOPTICAL DETECTOR\nQUANTUM EFFICIENCY\nBANDWIDTH\n\nGAIN\nNOISE CHARACTERISTICS\n\n173\n\nwhich exceeds M=256because, at higher order PPMs, the system complexity and the required transmitter and\nreceiver bandwidths increase rapidly. Furthermore, in the presence of a finite modulation extinction ratio, the\nreceiver signal-to-noiser t o (SNR) is limited by the leakage signal in the background slots (cf. Chap. 3) and\nai\n\nan optimum PPM order exists which maximizes the system performance. For the analysis of direct detection\n\nPPM systems, it will be assumed that M 4 .\nHeterodvne NCFSK svstem For heterodyne systems, the noncoherent frequency-shift keying (NCFSK)\nscheme is chosen because of its superior performance in the presence of carrier phase noise [6]-[8]. It should\nbe noted that although coherent heterodyne schemes offer an improved detection sensitivity over the NCFSK\nsystem, they are not suitable for ISL implementations because the signal power required for optical carrier\nsynchronizationis difficult to achieve in practice [ 1521.\nFor the heterodyne NCFSK system, tone spacing between frequencies is an important parameter (cf.\nChap. 4). The performance of the NCFSK system can be optimized if the different transmitted signal\n\nhs\nwaveforms are orthogonal [28], [31]. T i is possible if the tone spacing is an integer multiple of the symbol\nfrequency, f,=l/T, [28],[29]. In the presence of carrier phase noise, the system power penalty also dcpends\non the tone spacing (cf. Chap. 4). The greater the tone spacing, the smaller the impact of carrier phase noise\non the system performance [8], [36]. However, greater tone spacing implies larger system bandwidth and, in\npractice, it is not possible to increase the tone spacing indefinitely. For the analysis of heterodyne NCFSK\nsystems, a tone spacing vd=fs will be assumed.\nFinally, since a fair comparison between direct and heterodyne systems can only be made if both\nsystems have similar coding gains, the analysis of the heterodyne channel will be carried out for a 4-ary\nNCFSK system.\n7.1.2 TransmitterLaser\n\nOne of the basic assumptions made at the beginning of the study is the availability of semiconductor\nlasers with sufficiently high power and reliability. The advantages of choosing a semiconductor laser include\nhigher power efficiency and reliability. In addition, semiconductor lasers are smaller in size and can be more\neasily integrated.\n\n174\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\nDirect detection PPM system For use in a direct detection PPM system, laser power as high as several tens or\nhundreds of milliwatts will be needed. A frequency and polarization multiplexed system (cf. Fig. 2.1) can be\n\nused to provide the required transmitter power [102],[103]. This scheme is chosen because of the limited\npower output of single laser diodes and the fact that laser diode arrays currently available suffer from poor\nreliability and large far-field beam divergence. Other beam combining techniques such as grating [I051 and\nwaveguide combining [102], [I031 are more difficult t implement and require a longer development cycle.\no\nThe power output of the combined laser beam is assumed to be 200 mW [105], [171].\nIn addition to the power output, the selection of transmitter lasers for direct detection PPM systems also\ndepends on the modulation bandwidth and the extinction ratio. The modulation bandwidth of laser diodes has\nbeen demonstrated to exceed 15GHz [91] and, for most practical systems, is well above the desired data rate.\nThe modulation extinction ratio is defined as the mtio of power output when no signal is transmitted versus\nthat when a signal pulse is sent [23]. In the presence of a finite extinction ratio, the detector background count\n\nis dominated by the residual optical signal which increases with increasing peak transmitter power. This finite\nextinction ratio can have a significant effect on the coding gain of the PPM channel because it limits the\nmaximum achievable S N R (cf. Chap.3). Typical values of the extinction ratio are between 1 and 10%. For the\nanalysis of the direct detection PPM system, a modulation extinction ratio of 5% will be assumed.\nHeterodvne NCFSK svstem The wavelength and polarization combining technique provides sufficient power\noutput for the direct detection PPM link. When implementing the heterodyne NCFSK system, however, lasers\nwith narrow spectral linewidths are necessary. Laser diodes currently available with high power output\ngenerally have spectral linewidths on the order of 0.01-lnm or, equivalently, 109-1011Hz, provide little\nand\n\nI\n\ncontrol over the lasing frequency [96]. Consequently, these lasers are not suitable for the heterodyne\n\n1\n\nfeedback to stabilize the lasing wavelength and suppress the carrier phase noise. Techniques such as\n\nI\nt\n8\nII\n\napplication. Instead, laser diodes with narrow spectral linewidth must be used. These lasers generally employ\n\ndistributed feedback (DFB) 12141 151, distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) [ 1161, or coupled cavity [ 1093 can\n[I\nbe used to achieve stable, single mode operation. However, laser diodes designed for narrow spectral\nlinewidths generally have smaller output power. Fortunately, over the past few years, there has been a steady\nincrease in the power output of frequency stabilized lasers. For the analysis of the heterodyne ISL, it will be\nassumed that, by 1990, frequency stabilized, narrow spectral linewidth, laser diodes will be available with an\n175\n\naverage power output of 30 mW [I711 and a spectral linewidth no greater than 5 MHZ.\nAn alternative to using frequency stabilized laser diodes in heterodyne systems is to use the diode\n\npumped solid state NdYAG laser. hevious efforts in developing the diode pumped Nd:YAG laser have been\nlimited by the low efficiency of the pumping mechanism. Recently, however, by using a tightly focused endpump geometry, pumping efficiency as high as 8% had been achieved which resulted in 80 mW CW power\noutput with only 1W of electrical power into a single semiconductor laser array pump [MI.Compared to\nsemiconductor diode lasers, the diode pumped NdYAG laser offers a much improved spectral purity and a\npotential increase in output power. However, a wideband external electro-optical modulator is needed to\nmodulate the laser which introduces additional loss in the signal power and consumes more prime electric\npower. A diode pumped NdYAG laser is expected to produce a power output of approximately IOomW with\ngood spectfal purity.\n7.1.3 Antenna Gain\nThe transmitter and receiver antenna gains or, equivalently, the transmitter and receiver aperture\ndiameters, determine the amount of signal power that can be focused onto the receiver.\nTransmitter Antenna Gain Ideally, when spatial tracking can be perfectly realized, it is desirable to choose a\nlarge transmitter antenna gain so that a higher signal intensity can be focused onto the receiver. In the presence\nof random pointing errors, however, transmitter antenna gain cannot be increased arbitrarily. In fact, given the\nRMS pointing error, an optimal transmitter antenna gain exists which minimizes the required signal power (cf.\nChap. 5). When the pointing error at the transmitter can be modeled as a Rayleigh distributed random\nvariable, the optimal antenna gain is inversely related to the square of the RMS pointing error at the transmitter\n\nso that the product ~ ~ . = G T , ~ O &\nis independent of the RMS pointing jitter. Table 7.3 summarizes the parameter\nfor a direct detection 4-PPM system and a heterodyne noncoherent 4-FSK system at different values of the\nPBE. Given the RMS pointing error, the optimal transmitter antenna gain can be chosen according to Table\n\n7.3.\nBecause the optimal transmitter antenna gain is inversely proportional to the square of the RMS pointing\njitter, the optimal antenna gain can be very large for systems with small RMS pointing jitters. For such\nsystems, a suboptimal design in which the transmitter antenna gain is smaller than the optimal value is usually\n176\n\nTable 7.3 The parameter ~ = C T ~ C Y $ ,\nat different values of the PBE.\n\nDirect Detection QPPM\n\nHeterodyne QFSK\n\n0.42\n\n0.22\n\nI\n\n0.48\n0.27\n\n0.15\n\n0.19\n\nI\n\n+ Derived with receiver parameters shown in Table 7.4.\n\n177\n\nI\n\nsystems, a suboptimal design in which the transmitter antenna gain is smaller than the optimal value is usually\nchosen. Because the antenna gain i not optimized, higher signal power is needed to maintain the system\ns\nperformance. However, since the transmitted beamwidth increases with decreasing transmitter antenna gain,\nsuch systems are less sensitive to the random pointing error. As a result, the power penalty due to random\npointing error is much smaller for systems using the suboptimal design. Figures 5.14 and 5.15 show the power\npenalty versus the antenna gain for a Cary PPM system and a 4-ary NCFSK system, respectively. Note that\nwhen the antenna gain is much smaller than the optimal value, the power penalty is very small (COS dB).\nReceiver Antenna Gain For direct detection systems, the amount of signal power collected by the receiver is\nproportional t the area of the receiver aperture. For such systems, it is desirable to use a receiver with as large\no\n\nan aperture diameter as possible. In practice, however, a larger receiver aperture implies a larger system\nweight, a higher launch cost and a greater power demand for the steering system. Consequently, the size of the\nreceiver aperture cannot be increased indefinitely. For the analysis of the direct detection ISL. a receiver\naperture diameter of 30 cm will be assumed [171]. In contrast, a larger aperture diameter does not necessarily\nimply a greater S N R for a heterodyne receiver, because, in addition to the receiver antenna gain, the S N R of a\nheterodyne receiver also depends on the alignment between the signal and the LO. Given an RMS tracking\nerror of the LO, an optimum receiver antenna gain can be found which optimizes the system performance (cf.\nChap. 5). When the tracking error can be modeled as a Rayleigh distributed random variable, this optimum\nreceiver antenna gain can be inversely related to the square of the LO tracking error. In fact, given the desired\nPBE and the modulation format, the parameter ~ R = G R ~ C T &\nis equal to the parameter y~ given in Table 7.3\nand is independent of the R M S tracking error. For the analysis of the heterodyne ISL, it will be assumed that\nthe diameter of the receiver aperture is chosen such that the required transmitter power is minimized.\n7.1.4 Transmitterand Receiver Optics\n\nIn addition to the transmitter and receiver aperture diameters, other transmitter and receiver optical\nparameters that affect the performance of the ISL include the transmitter and receiver optical efficiencies, the\ntracking split, the receiver field-of-view (FOV), and the optical bandwidth. The efficiencies of the transmitter\nand receiver optics depend on the number of reflecting and refracting surfaces. For the analysis, optical\nefficiencies of 50% and 35% will be assumed for the transmitter and receiver optics, respectively. The\n\n178\n\nwill be assumed to be 5%.\nIn addition t the signal power, the performance of the direct detection PPM system also depends on the\no\namount of background power collected by the receiver. In order to reduce the amount of background radiation\ncollected by the receiver, both the receiver FOV and the optical bandwidth should be carefully controlled.\nHowever, a small receiver FOV implies a more stringent tracking requirement, and a narrow band optical filter\nmay have an unacceptably high loss. Furthermore, when the transmitter laser is frequency multiplexed, the\nreceiver optical bandwidth should be wide enough to admit all wavelengths of the transmitter output. For the\nanalysis, a receiver bandwidth of 2 nm and FOV of 0.1 mrad will be assumed.\n7.1.5 Optical Detectors\n\nOptical detectors with high bandwidth and low noise are required for ISL applications. The quantum\nefficiencies of semiconductor photodetectors are typically on the order of 50%-90%. Pin photodiodes with\nbandwidths as high as 2OGHz have been reported in laboratory work [73]. However, because of the low\ndetector gain, pin diodes are used primarily in heterodyne systems where the detector thermal noise is\nnegligible compared to the LO shot noise. For direct detection ISLs, APDs with large internal gain are needed\nto overcome the detector thermal noise. Table 7 4 lists the typical characteristicsof a silicon-APD based direct\n.\n\ndetection receiver. F r the comparison, t e ratio of effective ionization coefficients of 0.01 will be assuri.led.\no\nh\nAn effective ionization ratio as small as 0.007 can be achieved with selected commercial devices [171].\n\nGiven the amount of optical power incident on the detector surface, the gain of the APD is an important\nparameter that must be properly specified. The effect of detector thermal noise on the receiver S N R can be\nminimized by increasing the detector gain. However, larger detector gain leads to an increased excess noise\nfactor F which in turn can reduce the receiver SNR. Given &=200 and Ts=5ns. the optimal detector gain\ncan be evaluated from Eq.(3.24) to be approximately 150. The excess noise factor at the optimal detector gain\nis therefore F,=3.5.\n\nNote that the optimal gain decreases with the 1/3 power of KS. At large signal level the\n\noptimal gain is 1 and the optimal excess noise factor is equal to 1. Therefore, a design which optimizes the\ngain at Ks=200 will have a power penalty of 5.4 dl3 at Ks==.\n\nTable 7.4 Typical Si-APD based direct detection receiver parameters.\n\nRatio of Ionization Coefficients\n\n1\nI\n\nkd\n\n00\n.1\n\nI I I\nIFI I\n\nDetector Gain\n\n150\n\nExcess Noise Factor\n\n3.5\n\nDetector Dark Current\n\nGain Dependent\nGain Independent\n\n180\n\n7.1.6 Design Summary\n\nThe design specifications for the ISL are summarized in Table 7.5.

Table 7.6 summarizes the\nreceiver sensitivity at different values of the PBE and coding orders at a data rate of 200 Mbps.\n7.2 Performance Evaluation\nGiven the link specifications,it is of interest to determine whether the mission requirements can be met\nwithin the design constraints. Furthermore, it is desirable to investigate the various trade-offs among the\nsystem performance, complexity, and component availability.\n7.2.1 Performance of the Direct Detection PPM System\nThe link budgets for a 4-ary PPM link at 1 P and 1W error rates are shown in Tables 7.7-7.8. These\n\nlink budgets are calculated assuming that the RMS pointing error is equal to 1 pad. Note that, by using a\n2OOmW transmitter laser and a QPPM encoding scheme, a 200 Mbps channel can be implemented with 6.2 dB\nand 3.3 dl3 power margins, respectively. These link budgets show that the transmitter pointing error dominates\nthe power allocation by limiting the transmitter antenna gain and imposing an additional power penalty. In\ncontrast, the power penalty due t receiver synchronizationerror is relatively small (0.1 dB).\no\n\n,,\nThe maximum data rate, R,, that the link can achieve is plotted in Fig. 7.1 versus the transmitter\npower PL for a QPPM system with RMS transmitter pointing error of 1 pad. A 3 dB power margin was\nincluded in the calculation of data rate. Note that at high laser powers, R,,,\n\nincreases linearly with increasing\n\nsignal power. At high signal powers, the receiver S N R is determined by the number of signal photons\n\n181\n\nTable 7.5 ISL design summary.\n\nModulationFormat\n\n11\n\nQPPM\n\nHeterodyne\nQ-NCFSK\n\n4-aryPPM\n\n4-ary FSK\n\n200 mW\n5%\n>15 GHz\n\n25mW\n\nDirect Detection\n\nrransmitter Laser\nPower\nExtinction Ratio\nModulation Bandwidth\nLinewidth\nOptical Antenna\nTransmitter Aperture Diameter\nReceiver Aperture Diameter\n\n>15 GHz\n3MHz\n\nTBDt\n30 cm\n\nTBDt\nTBDt\n\nTransmitter and Receiver Optics\nTransmitter Efficiency\nReceiver Efficiency\nTracking Split\nReceiver Optical Bandwidth\nReceiver Field-of-View\n\n50%\n35%\n5%\n2 nm\n0.1 mrad\n\n50%\n35%\n5%\n\nOptical Detector\nQuantum Efficiency\nGain\nExcess Noise Factor\nGain Dependent Dark Current\nGain Independent Dark Current\nBandwidth\nNoise Equivalent Temperature\nLoad Resistance\n\n70%\n150\n3.0\nA\nle8\nA\n>10 GHz\n400 O\nK\n2Kn\n\n70%\n1\n\n>10 GHz\n\nt To be determined by the PBE and RMS pointinghracking errors.\n\n182\n\nTable 7 6 Receiver sensitivity at 200 Mbps.\n.\n\nI\nM\n\nI\n\nI\n\nDirectDetectionPPMt\n\nPBE\n\nNumber of Photons/Bit\n2\n\nSensitivity\n\n10-3\n\n58\n\nl"\no\n\n111\n162\n\n- 4 1dBm\n5.\n-51.3 dBm\n- 9 7 dBm\n4.\n\nHeterodyne NCFSK\n\n10-9\n\n-55.7dBm\n\n40\n~~~\n\n10-3\n\n4\n\n10-6\n\n10-9\n10-3\n\n8\n\nlo"\n\n10-9\n\n~~~\n\n35\n63\n91\n\n-56.4dBm\n-53.8dBm\n-52.2dBm\n\n7\n1\n4\n2\n1\n\n-63.4\ndBm\n-60.4\ndBm\n-58.6\ndBm\n\n29\n5\n0\n71\n\n-57.2\ndBm\n-54.8dBm\n-53.2\ndBm\n\n5\n1\n0\n1\n4\n\n-64.7\ndBm\n-61.9\ndBm\n-60.4\ndBm\n\nt Derived with receiver parameters shown in Table 7.5.\n\n183\n\nTable 7.7 Link budget of a direct detection QPPM system at PBE=1W6.\n\n200 m W\n\n[Laser Power\n\n40,ooOh\nAntenna Gain\nTransmittert\nReceiver\n\n12.6 cm\n30 cm\n\nOptics Efficiency\nTransmitter\nReceiver\nReceiver Sensitivity @\n200Mbps and P B E = l v\n\n23.0dBm\n-295.4dB\n\nI\nI\n\n113.4 dB\n120.9 dB\n\n-3.0 dB\n\n63 Photonshit\n\n-53.8 dBm\n-1.8dB\n\nI\n\n-0.1dB\n\nPointing Loss\n\nI\n\n6.2 dB\n\nLink Margin\n\nt Optimum for 0%= 1 pad.\n\n184\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n1\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n1\nI\nI\n1\nI\nI\n\nTable 7.8 Link budget of a direct detection QPPM system at PBE=1t9.\n\nb\n1Modulation Format\n\nLaser Power\n\n40,000 km\n\nPath Loss\n\nI\n\n4-PPM\n\n23.0 dBm\n-295.4 dB\n\n~\n\nAntenna Gain\nTransmittert\nI\nReceiver\n~\n\nOptics Efficiency\nTransmitter\nReceiver\n\n10.6 cm\n3 cm\n0\n\n0.5\n0.35\n\n111.9 dB\n120.9 dB\n\n-3.0 dB\n4.6 dB\n\nReceiver Sensitivity @\nL # z m d PBE=1C9\n\nI Pointing ~ o s s\n\n-1.6 dB\n\n-0.1 dB\n3.3 dB\n\nt Optimum for 0%= 1 pad.\n\ni 85\n\nF\n\nulrecr uetectian urrM\n\nx\n0\n\nE\nCL\n\nFig.7.1.

Consequently, by fixing the S N R and hence the PBE, the maximum data rate\nt\nincreases linearly with increasing signal p w r As the signal power decreases, the effect of background\noe.\nradiation becomes more prominent and the maximum data rate no longer depends linearly on the transmitter\npower.\n\nThe performance of the link can be improved by reducing the RMS pointing error at the transmitter.\nSince the optimal transmitter antenna gain is inversely related to the mean square pointing jitter, a 6 dB\nimprovement in power margin can be realized if the RMS pointing jitter is reduced by a factor of two at the\n\no\ntransmitter. However, higher cost and complexity of the optical system are needed t achieve a small RMS\npointing jitter. In practice, RMS pointing jitter less than 0.2 pad is difficult to achieve. Performance of the\nPPM system can also be improved by using higher order encoding schemes. In general, for a block-encoded\nsystem, k=log2(M) bits can be transmiaed for every symbol sent across the optical channel. Therefore, by\nincreasing the order of PPM, a higher data rate can be achieved with a given signal power. However, at higher\norder PPMs, the system bandwidth and complexity increase rapidly with increasing PPM order. Furthermore,\nin the presence of a finite modulation extinction ratio, the maximum receiver S N R is limited by the residual\n\nsignal in the background slots. Consequently, one cannot increase the PPM order indefinitely. Figure 7.2 is a\nplot of the R,,\n\nversus PPM order for an I L with 200mW transmitter laser power at different values of the\nS\n\nmodulation extinction ratio rn and the PBE. Note that for 0.014n10.1, the performance improvement is\nnegligible for M >10.\n7.2.2 Performance of the Heterodyne NCFSK System\nTables 7.9-7.10 display the link budget of a 4-ary heterodyne NCFSK channel with 1 p a d RMS\npointing and tracking errors. A comparison of these link budgets with that of the direct detection PPM system\nshown in Tables 7.7-7.8 shows that the heterodyne 4-FSK system has an approximately 5-10 dB advantage in\nthe detection sensitivity over the direct detection PPM system. However, this advantage is quickly offset by\nthe smaller transmitter power, smaller receiver antenna gain, larger power penalty due to spatial tracking error,\nand power penalty due to carrier phase noise (cf. Table 4.4). It should be noted that the link budgets shown in\nTables 7.9-7.10 do not take into account the excess intensity noise of the transmitter and the LO. At a data rate\nof 1 Gb/s using 4-ary FSK, the power penalty due t the intensity noise is approximately 1.5 dB [ 1481.\no\n\n187\n\nI\n\nh\n\nv)\n\na\n\na\n\nv\n\nE\n\n--- m20.1\nm = 0.01\n\ni\n\nPPM O R D E R M\n\nFig.7.2.

In fact, the\nmaximum data rate, R,\n,\n,\n\nthat the ISL can support for the given link parameters is plotted in Fig. 7.3 versus\n\nthe transmitter power. With a 3 dB link margin, the transmitter power needed to achieve 10-6 error rate is on\n\nthe order of 100 mW. The performance can be improved by reducing the RMS pointing and tracking jitters.\nSince the required transmitter power is proportional to the product of mean square tracking and pointing jitters,\na 12 dB improvement in power margin can be realized if the RMS pointing and tracking jitters can be reduced\nfrom 1 pad to 0.5 pad. In this case,the 200Mbps QFSK channel can be implemented with 0.9 and 7.9 dB of\npower margin at PBE=lC9 and 10-6, respectively. Performance of the heterodyne channel can also be\nimproved by using higher order FSKs. However, as was the case with the direct detection PPM system, the\ntransmitter and receiver bandwidths increase rapidly with increasing FSK order. Consequently, it is not\npossible to increase the encoding order indefinitely.\n7.2.3 The ACTS-Shuttle Link\nThe link parameters for the proposed Advanced Communication Technology Satellite (ACTS)-shuttle\nlink were supplied by NASA-Goddard and displayed in Table 7.11. Note that these parameters differ fiom\nthose shown in Table 7.5 in that (a) a smaller laser power (70 mW average, 140 mW peak) is assumed for the\ndirect detection link, (b) a static pointing loss (1-2 dB)is included in the link budget and, most significantly,\n(c) much smaller RMS pointing and tracking jitters are assumed. For such a small (0.21 p a d RMS) pointing\njitter, the optimal antenna diameter is in excess of 50 cm. Consequently, the ACTS-shuttle link is designed\nusing suboptimal antenna gains. Tables 7.12(a),(b) summarize the link budget for the direct detection PPM\nand heterodyne QFSK links calculated using the parameters shown in Table 7.1 1. Note that because the\nsuboptimal design is chosen, the power penalty due to pointing and tracking errors is small (~0.2-0.4\ndB). As\na result, the performance of the heterodyne QFSK system is superior to that of the direct detection PPM\nsystem. Furthermore, since the peak transmitter power is equal to twice the average power, the receiver S N R is\noptimized a M=2. Consequently, the binary PPM system has a higher power margin compared to the 4-ary\nt\nPPM system.\n\n191\n\nh\n\nu)\n\nQ\n-c3\nY\n\nX\n\n0\n\nE\n\nL\n\n10\xe2\x80\x991\nI\n\n4\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI I l l\n\nI\n\nI\nO\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI l l\n\nIO0\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n500\n\nFig.7.3.

For systems with large (>OS pad) RMS pointing jitters, the spatial tracking error dominates\nthe link budget by limiting the maximum antenna gains and incurring additional losses. For systems with small\npointing jitters, on the other hand, the antenna gains are usually determined by the cost and sue constraints\nrather than performance consideration. When the antenna diameters are chosen to be much smaller than the\noptimal values, much smaller power penalties can be allocated for pointing and tracking errors. For the\nheterodyne system, power penalty due to the carrier phase noise is another major loss factor that must be\ncarefully considered. For a 200 Mbps QFSK system with 100 MHZ tone spacing and 3 MHz linewidth, the\npower penalty is approximately 0.8 dB at PBE = 1 .The power penalty due to carrier phase noise can be\nV\nminimized by increasing the FSK tone spacing and reducing the IF linewidth. In contrast, the receiver\nsynchronizationerror has a relatively minor effect (0.1 dB)on the link budget.\n\nThe performances of the direct and heterodyne detection ISLs can be compared by inspecting the link\nbudgets shown in Tables 7.7-7.12. Note that, even though the heterodyne channel offers a better detection\nsensitivity, it is more sensitive to the spatial tracking error and the carrier phase noise. Therefore, for systems\nwith large (=l pad) pointing and tracking errors, the direct detection PPM system has a superior performance.\nOn the other hand, for systems with small ( ~ 0 . 3\npad) pointing and tracking jitters, such as in an ACTS-shuttle\n\nlink, the heterodyne FSK system shows a larger power margin because of the higher sensitivity of the\nheterodyne receiver.\nFinally, it should be noted that the comparison above did not take into account the possibility of\nperformance improvement using error control codes (ECCs) [163]-11641. By using a proper error control\ncode, the desired PBE performance (~10-6) be achieved for systems with raw PBE on the order of IW3.\ncan\nHowever, since the ECC is expected to affect both direct detection PPM and the heterodyne FSK systems\nsimilarly, the conclusions derived from this study should not be affected significantly with the inclusion of\nECCs.\n\n196\n\nAPPENDIX A\nAPPROXIMATION OF THE DPSK ERROR RATE\n\nAn approximation t the DPSK e m r rate can be made by considering the alternative receiver structure\no\n\nshown in Figure A.1[16]. For a given bit period, the phase of the received signal r ( t ) is estimated and the\noutput of the phase estimator is then differentiallydetected. When only white Gaussian noise is present at the\nestimator input, the error in estimating the phase angle can be shown to have the following distribution:\n\nFor a DPSK receiver, the output of the phase estimator during the k& bit interval @(k) is delayed by one bit\nperiod and subtracted from the next estimator output. Since the additive noise over the two bit periods are\nuncorrelated, the resulted estimator error will be independent. Consequently, the probability distribution of the\ncorrelator output will be the self-convolution of Eq. (A.1). This calculation i in general very difficult. At\ns\nsufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio, however, the error in estimating the phase angle is expected to be small.\n\nIn which case sin<b,=Qn,\ncos@,,=l,erfc(%os@,,)=l, and the probability distribution can be approximated by\nthe s u m of a constant and a Gaussian peak:\n\nUsing this approximation,the convolution can be calculated to be\n\nwhere Y(kW,,(k)-@,,(k-l)\n\nis the phase error at the correlator output. A decoding error occurs when the\n\nmagnitude of Y exceeds pi /2. Using the probability distribution given by Eq. (A.3). the error probability can\nbe written as\n\nAt sufficiently high S N R , the difference between the PBE evaluated using Eq. (A.4) and the exact PBE is\n\nnegligible.\n\n197\n\n$&\n=\n\nPHASE\n\nYflo\n\nsin cut\n\nESTIMATOR\n\nFig.Al.

The arrival time of the kh photon can be shown to have\nthe probability distribution\n\nwhere (t0.T) is the observation period. The expectation can be evaluated by first condition on the number of\nphotons detected N T , then taking the expectation with respect to the random variable N T .

(C.l) is taken with respect to the shot noise process r (t), conditioned on the\ndetector photocount rate A(t). This expectation can be taken by differentiating the joint characteristics\nfunction @(co~.(iLL). and the result is given by Eq. (\xe2\x82\xac3.6). By substitutingEq. (B.6) into Eq. (C.l) and taking the\nFourier transform, the power spectrum of the photodetector output can be written as\n\nwhere H (a) the Fourier transform of the detector impulse response h ( t ) , G ,F are the detector gain and the\nis\nexcess noise, and\nT\n\nhT(u) l,I(t)e+ wtdt\n=\nis the Fourier transform of h(t). For the PPM signaling scheme, AT(^) is given by\n\nwhere P (a) the Fourier transform of the pulse shape p (t ), and the summation is over the codewords in the\nis\ninterval (-T ,T ) . By using the summation rule\n\nand the fact that ( 4 )are independent for nonoverlapping codewords, the expectation in Eq. (C.2) can be\nevaluated. Note that by using the fact\n\nthe dependence in the boundary T can be removed, and the resulting power spectrum is given by\n203\n\nIP\n+T (a)1q1- IR (0)12)\n\nwhere\n\nC.2 Power Spectrum of the PreprocessorOutput\n\nFor a square-law nonlinear preprocessor, the power spectrum of the preprocessor output can be\ncalculated by substituting Eq. (B.7) into Eq. (C.l) and taking the expectation with respect to the photocount\nrate h(r). Note that in the limit of a large photocount, only terms involving 13 and A4 are significant. The\nexpression for the power spectrum can therefore be simplified by dropping terms corresponding to lower order\n\nA\xe2\x80\x99s. By carrying out the Fourier transform on the remaining terms, the power spectrum o the preprocessor\nf\noutput can be written as\n\nId\n\n+ G4I h ~ ( o ) H f i ~ ( o ) H\n(w)*\n(a)\nwhere\nH~(w)\n=Jh*(r)e-iwdt\n\n.\n\n(C.10)\n\nThe expectation is taken with respect to the data stream (a\xe2\x80\x98&).By substituting Eq. (C.5) into Eq. (C.10) and\ntaking the expectation with respect to the data stream [dk ) ,the power spectrum of the preprocessed signal can\nbe obtained. Note that by taking expectation with respect to the third and fourth powers of h, it is necessary to\n\n204\n\nuse the sum rules\n\nz =z-z-z-z+2z\n\nkdun\n\nkJ,m k d , m k7n.l l q , k\n\n(C.11)\n\nk=l-\n\nand\n\n(C.12)\n\nThe results, after substitution, are very complicated. With some very simple assumptions, however, the\nexpressions can be simplified considerably. First, it will be assumed that the preprocessor filter blocks the dc\ncomponent of the signal, which is due largely to the uniform background count rate and contains no timing\ninformation. Next, note that after taking the expectation with respect to\n\ndk,\n\nthe expression of the power\n\nspectrum contains the integral of the following form:\n1 = 1 R (a\xe2\x80\x99)G ( w , ~ \xe2\x80\x99 ) d\nW\xe2\x80\x99\n\n(C.13)\n\nwhere R (a) given by Eq. ((2.4). and G ( w , ~ \xe2\x80\x99 )is some function of H (a) P (a).A plot of the function\nis\nand\nR (a)shows that the magnitude of R ( o ) is significant only in the vicinity of w=2xk/Ts. Therefore, if the\n\nfunction G(o)is slowly varying over the region where R is appreciable, we may approximate the function\nunder the integral sign by a train of delta functions,\n(C.14)\nwhere\n(C.15)\nis the area under each peak of R (0). The width of each peak of IR (a) is on the order of 2rc/MTs, where A2\nI\nis the order of the PPM. For most cases of interest, H(a) and P(a) are slowly varying with respect to\nI R (a) such that this approximation holds.\nI\nBy using the above assumptions, the power spectrum of the photodetector output can be approximated.\n\nThe result, after lengthy derivation, is given by\n\n205\n\nSz(w) = - IP(w)H(w)*P(w)H(w)1*6(o_w,)\nGG4\nT2\n\n+4\n\n(C.16)\n\nI\n1\n8\n\na\n\nT,\n\n1\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\nt\n\nII\nI\nI\nI\n\n1\n8\n\nI\n206\n\n1\n8\n\nLIST OF REFERENCES\n\nBall Aerospace Systems Division, "Tracking and data acquisition system laser intersatellite\ncommunications study," F86-04,Aug. 1986; prepared under contract NAS5-29128 for National\nAeronautics and Spce Administration.
