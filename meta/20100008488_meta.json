Ranging from the early astronomical measurements to analyses of samples from the Martian surface in the form of Martian meteorites. The first direct attempt to analyze the carbon species on the surface was in 1976 with the Viking GC-MS in-situ experiment which gave inconclusive results at two sites on Mars [1]. With the recognition in 1983 that samples of the Martian surface were already present on Earth in the form of Martian meteorites by Bogard and Johnson [2] new opportunities became available for direct study of Mars's samples in te rlraesbtrioalratories. Carbon isotopic compositional information suggested a reduced carbon component was present in the Martian meteorites [3-5]. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons associated with carbonate globules in ALH84001 were later identified [6,7]. Jull et al [8] noted that an insoluble component was present within Nakhla and more than 75% of its C lacked any 14C, which is modern-day carbon contaminant. This carbon fraction was believed to be either indigenous (i..e. Martian) or ancient meteoritic carbon phase. Within the fractures of Nakhla and ALH84001, Fisk et al [9,10] identified reduced carbon-enriched areas. Gibson et al. [11] using a combination of NanoSIMS, Focused Electron microscopy, Laser Raman Spectroscopy and Stepped-Combustion Static Mass Spectrometry analyses the presence of possible indigenous reduced carbon components within the 1.3 Ga old Nakhla.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20100008488, "endDate": "2010-03-05T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Lunar and Planetary Inst.", "location": "Houston, TX, United States"}}, "meetingId": "814c9f9921e94003b84369fe331cf396", "id": "88b59a1bbfda4e2dbfcddb4da1d833ff"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "NASA Johnson Space Center", "location": "Houston, TX, United States"}}, "meetingId": "814c9f9921e94003b84369fe331cf396", "id": "b13136d160a14485a2d2bb6787301e47"}], "name": "Lunar Planetary Science Conference", "location": "The Woodlands, TX", "id": "814c9f9921e94003b84369fe331cf396", "startDate": "2010-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20100008488, "id": "c0ee388de2024a36a2e1a45d16d303af", "publicationDate": "2010-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20100008488.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20100008488/downloads/20100008488.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20100008488/downloads/20100008488.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20100008488/downloads/20100008488.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
