These inversion-based techniques have been successfully applied to the endpoint tracking control of multijoint flexible manipulators and to aircraft control. The specified output trajectory uniquely determines the required input and state trajectories that are found through inversion. These input-state trajectories exactly track the desired output; however, they might not meet acceptable performance requirements. For example, during slewing maneuvers of flexible structures, the structural deformations, which depend on the required state trajectories, may be unacceptably large. Further, the required inputs might cause actuator saturation during an exact tracking maneuver, for example, in the flight control of conventional takeoff and landing aircraft. In such situations, a compromise is desired between the tracking requirement and other goals such as reduction of internal vibrations and prevention of actuator saturation; the desired output trajectory needs to redesigned. Here, we pose the trajectory redesign problem as an optimization of a general quadratic cost function and solve it in the context of linear systems. The solution is obtained as an off-line prefilter of the desired output trajectory. An advantage of our technique is that the prefilter is independent of the particular trajectory. The prefilter can therefore be precomputed, which is a major advantage over other optimization approaches. Previous works have addressed the issue of preshaping inputs to minimize residual and in-maneuver vibrations for flexible structures; Since the command preshaping is computed off-line. Further minimization of optimal quadratic cost functions has also been previously use to preshape command inputs for disturbance rejection. All of these approaches are applicable when the inputs to the system are known a priori. Typically, outputs (not inputs) are specified in tracking problems, and hence the input trajectories have to be computed. The inputs to the system are however, difficult to determine for non-minimum phase systems like flexible structures. One approach to solve this problem is to (1) choose a tracking controller (the desired output trajectory is now an input to the closed-loop system and (2) redesign this input to the closed-loop system. Thus we effectively perform output redesign. These redesigns are however, dependent on the choice of the tracking controllers. Thus the controller optimization and trajectory redesign problems become coupled; this coupled optimization is still an open problem. In contrast, we decouple the trajectory redesign problem from the choice of feedback-based tracking controller. It is noted that our approach remains valid when a particular tracking controller is chosen. In addition, the formulation of our problem not only allows for the minimization of residual vibration as in available techniques but also allows for the optimal reduction fo vibrations during the maneuver, e.g., the altitude control of flexible spacecraft. We begin by formulating the optimal output trajectory redesign problem and then solve it in the context of general linear systems. This theory is then applied to an example flexible structure, and simulation results are provided.", "title": "Optimal Output Trajectory Redesign for Invertible Systems", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-19T04:16:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19990068023, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Devasia, S."}, "organization": {"name": "Utah Univ.", "location": "Salt Lake City, UT United States"}}, "id": "2bbf3c54adf04a2ba24a08693b1e2a36"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19990068023, "publications": [{"volume": "19", "submissionId": 19990068023, "issue": "5", "publisher": "American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "id": "637f23cfbdec4f1ebaa53d7d977da23c", "publicationName": "Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics", "publicationDate": "1996-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
