The code uses a frequency-domain approach with second-order central differences and a pressure radiation condition in the far field. GUST3D requires as input certain mean flow quantities which are calculated separately by a potential flow solver. The solver calculates the mean ow using a Gothert's Rule approximation (ref. 3). On the airfoil surface, it uses the solution calculated by the potential code FLO36 (ref. 4). Figures 1-2 show the mean pressure along the airfoil surface for the two airfoil geometries. In Figures 3 - 8, we present the RMS pressure on the airfoil surface. Each figure shows three GUST3D solutions (calculated on grids with different far-field boundary locations). Three solutions are shown to provide some indication of the numerical uncertainty in the results. Figures 9 - 13 present the acoustic intensity. We again show three solutions per case. Note that no results are presented for the k1 = k2 = 2.0 loaded airfoil case, as an acceptable solution could not be obtained. A few comments need to be made about the results shown. First, since the last Workshop, the GUST3D code has been substantially upgraded. This includes implementing a more accurate far-field boundary condition (ref. 5) and developing improved gridding capabilities. This is the reason for any differences that may exist between the present results and results from the last Workshop. Second, the intensity results on the circle R = 4C were obtained using a Kirchoff method (ref. 6). The Kirchoff surface was the circle R = 2C. Finally, the GUST3D code is most accurate for low reduced frequencies. A new domain decomposition approach (ref. 7) has been developed to improve accuracy. Both the single domain and domain decomposition approaches were used in generating the present results.", "title": "Single Airfoil Gust Response Problem: Category 3, Problem 1", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T11:52:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20040182276, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Scott, James R."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Glenn Research Center", "location": "Cleveland, OH, United States"}}, "id": "5f0d48d726774003b950ed92a485d5ca"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20040182276, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20040182276, "id": "7273ab5288534322afb3eacfbe075751", "publicationName": "Fourth Computational Aeroacoustics (CAA) Workshop on Benchmark Problems", "publicationDate": "2004-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20040182276.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20040182276/downloads/20040182276.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20040182276/downloads/20040182276.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20040182276/downloads/20040182276.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
