In such an approach, the interaction of an isolated vortex with a laminar premixed flame is viewed as a unit process of a turbulent premixed flame in which the reaction zone keeps a laminar like structure locally; this is precisely the case of the wrinkled flame or flamelet regime in turbulent combustion. The present work complements previous studies and involves the study of the interaction of a vortex pair and a laminar premixed flame in a planar two-dimensional geometry, together with numerical simulations. This geometry is quite unique since most studies have considered axisymmetric vortex rings. Such a geometry offers several advantages over previous studies.", "title": "Stretch-induced quenching in flame-vortex interactions", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T19:03:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19940019683, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Samaniego, J.-M."}, "organization": {"name": "Ecole Centrale de Paris"}}, "id": "7e6c77a7965f42eca4a81e795be86500"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19940019683, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19940019683, "id": "021930db5a8a437aa024538e7486024d", "publicationName": "Stanford Univ., Annual Research Briefs, 1993", "publicationDate": "1993-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19940019161, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "The Fifth Annual Thermal and Fluids Analysis Workshop", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19940019683.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19940019683/downloads/19940019683.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19940019683/downloads/19940019683.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19940019683/downloads/19940019683.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
