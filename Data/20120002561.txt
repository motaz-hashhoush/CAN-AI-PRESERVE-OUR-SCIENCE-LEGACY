Both meteorites are regolith breccias, and contain xenolithic halite (and minor\nadmixed sylvite \xe2\x80\x93 KCl, crystals in their regolith lithologies. The halites are purple to dark blue,\ndue to the presence of color centers (electrons in anion vacancies) which slowly accumulated as\n40\nK (in sylvite) decayed over billions of years. The halites were dated by K-Ar, Rb-Sr and I-Xe\nsystematics to be 4.5 billion years old [2-4]. The \xe2\x80\x9cblue\xe2\x80\x9d halites were a fantastic discovery for the\nfollowing reasons: (1) Halite+sylvite can be dated (K is in sylvite and will substitute for Na in\nhalite, Rb substitutes in halite for Na, and I substitutes for Cl). (2) The blue color is lost if the\nhalite dissolves on Earth and reprecipitates (because the newly-formed halite has no color\ncenters), so the color serves as a \xe2\x80\x9cfreshness\xe2\x80\x9d or pristinity indicator. (3) Halite frequently contains\naqueous fluid inclusions. (4) Halite contains no structural oxygen, carbon or hydrogen, making\nthem ideal materials to measure these isotopic systems in any fluid inclusions. (5) It is possible\nto directly measure fluid inclusion formation temperatures, and thus directly measure the\ntemperature of the mineralizing aqueous fluid [1].\nIn addition to these two ordinary chondrites halite grains have been reliably reported in several\nureilites [5], an additional ordinary chondrite (Jilin) [6], and in the carbonaceous chondrite\n(Murchison) [7], although these reports were unfortunately not taken seriously. We have lately\nfound additional fluid inclusions in carbonates in several additional carbonaceous chondrites.\nMeteoritic aqueous fluid inclusions are apparently relatively widespread in meteorites, though\nvery small and thus difficult to analyze.\nIsotopic Work: Last year we reported results of the first O and H isotopic measurements of the\naqueous fluids present within the Monahans and Zag halites [8]. Variations of \xce\xb4D of the fluids\nrange over \xe2\x88\x92330(90; 2\xcf\x83) to +1200(90)\xe2\x80\xb0 for Monahans and \xe2\x88\x92300(96)\xe2\x80\xb0 to +90(98)\xe2\x80\xb0 for Zag.\n\xce\x9417O of the fluids range over \xe2\x88\x9216(22)\xe2\x80\xb0 to +18(10)\xe2\x80\xb0 for Monahans and +3(10)\xe2\x80\xb0 to +27(11)\xe2\x80\xb0\nfor Zag. The variations are larger than the reproducibility of standard analyses and suggest that\nisotope equilibria were under way in the fluids before trapping into halite. The mean values of\n\xce\xb4D and \xce\x9417O are +290\xe2\x80\xb0 and +9\xe2\x80\xb0, respectively. The mean values and the variations of the\nfluids are different from the representative values of ordinary chondrites, supporting our view\nthat the aqueous fluids were not indigenous to the H chondrite parent-asteroid(s) but rather were\nexogenous fluids delivered from somewhere else. The implication is that the halites travelled\nfrom another early solar system body (or bodies) that was (were) undergoing cryovolcanism. It is\ninteresting that the aqueous fluid \xce\xb4D is intermediate in composition between primitive meteorites\nand Oort cloud comet coma water [8].\nOrganics: Simple organic structures such as nanoglobules are commonly present in\nastromaterials, even those that have been metamorphosed to a significant degree [9]. For\nexample, they are present in CI chondrites which we know have been subjected to boiling\naqueous fluids. Our previous work on the aqueous fluid inclusions in meteoritic halite has\ndemonstrated that the fluids were never at temperatures greater than ~25C \xe2\x80\x93 far lower than CI\n\nchondrites, and more in line with most CM chondrites [1]. Terrestrial halite commonly contains\ntrapped organic structures, which can be perfectly preserved for hundreds of millions of years at\nleast (the record is 250 million years so far [10]). We thus investigated whether complex organic\ncompounds and structures were trapped within the growing meteoritic halites alongside fluid\ninclusions (and in fact may have served as nucleation points for the fluid inclusions.\nWe have already found that the meteoritic halites have inclusions that fluoresce under short- and\nlong-wave UV radiation which is the most sensitive text for the presence of potential organics\n(G. Cody, personal communication, 2009), although the fluorescing phases don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be\norganics. We therefore examined freshly-cleaved surfaces of meteoritic halite crystals for\ntrapped organic compounds by confocal Raman Microscopy in Andrew Steele\xe2\x80\x99s Lab at the\nCarnegie Institution [11]. Examination of Monahans and Zag halite grains with Raman imaging\nreveals the presence of small (<10 \xce\xbcm), primarily metal grains with oxidation/hydroxylation\nproducts and minor phases inconsistent with H-chondrite mineralogy that must arise from the\nhalite grains\xe2\x80\x99 originating body. The grains are generally subrounded and composed largely of\nmetal, magnetite and another phase which is probably fine-grained lepidocrocite (FeO(OH)).\nIdentification of lepidocrocite carries an element of uncertainty at the time of this writing due to\nbroad spectral features shared with clays and glassy phases, but in advance of data from other\ntechniques the identification as lepidocrocite is reasonable given the inclusions\xe2\x80\x99 apparent history\nas largely metallic clasts altered by interaction with brine. Additional phases include forsteritic\nolivine (Fo\xe2\x89\x8898), pyroxenes, a feldspar grain with Raman spectral affinity to anorthoclase We\nindeed identified organics in the halite as well, including macromolecular carbon (MMC). One\ninclusion features aliphatic material with Raman spectral features consistent with a mixture of\nshort chain aliphatic compounds. Our search for organics is continuing to other halite grains, and\nthe fluid inclusions within meteoritic carbonates.\nParent Bodies: The minerals and compounds discovered thus far within Monahans/Zag halites\nare indicative of an originating body at least partly composed of equilibrated igneous materials\n(high Fo olivine, possibly the metal) which was subjected to aqueous alteration (the halite parent\nbrine) and containing a light organic component (the short-chain aliphatic compounds).\nUltimately, this material was ejected from the originating body with little or no disruption, as\nevidenced with the presence of surviving fluid inclusions. An actively geysering body similar to\nmodern Enceladus [12] is a reasonable analogue. Also, the originating body may have been in\nclose proximity to the H chondrite parent in order to generate the number of halite grains seen in\nMonahans and Zag. Other candidates for Monahans/Zag halite parent bodie(s) include a young\nCeres with its possible liquid ocean or other similar C-, P- or D-class asteroids [13], and Main\nBelt comet(s) [14].\nReferences: [1] Zolensky M., et al.
