Programs of the\nEnterprise chart the evolution of the universe from\norigins to destiny, and improve understanding of\ngalaxies, stars, planets, and life. The Enterprise\nmission includes developing innovative technologies to support Space Science programs and making them available for other applications that\nprovide benefits to the Nation. Knowledge and discoveries will be shared with the public to enhance\nscience, mathematics, and technology education\nand increase the scientific and technological literacy of all Americans.\nImiplementation Strategy\nThe Space Science Enterprise is devdoping new\nprograms through the "faster, better, cheaper"\napproach. Program managers are encouraged to\naccept prudent risk, shorten development time of\ntechnologies and missions, explore new conceptual approaches, streamline management, and incorporate innovative methods and technologies to\nenhance efficiency and effectiveness. Collaborative\nefforts with other Federal agencies, such as the\nNational Science Foundation, Department of\nDefense, and Departmentof Energy, as well as with\ninternational partners, continue to play a key role in\nthe implementation strategy of the Enterprise.\nThe same spirit of innovation that embodies the\nSpace Science flight programs applies to technology development. Long-term, high-risk, high-payoff\n\n...\n\ntechnologies are key to implementing the Space\nScience mission. Technologies for advanced\nminiaturization, intelligent systems, autonomous\noperations, and simulation-based design will\nreceive special attention in FY99.\nEnterprise Resource Requirements\nThe President has requested the following budget\nfor FY99 to FY03 to support the accomplishment of\nSpace Science goals:\n\nPerformance Measures\nTo meet the near-term goals displayed in Chart 1,\nthe following objectives will be measured:\n\nOb]ecfive--sO/ve mysteries of the universe\nSpace Science spacecraft will chart the evolution\nof the universe and enhance our understanding of\ngalaxies, stars, and planets.\nThe performance target will be to successfully\nlaunch seven spacecraft, within 10 percent of\nbudget on average.\nThe Hubble Space Telescope (HST) will continue\nits observations of the universe. HST resolution will\n\ncomplete a 3-year research project to\ndetermine the expansion rate of the universe (the\nHubble constant), which determines its age.\nThe performance target will be to measure the\nHubble constant within an accuracy of about\n10 percent, as compared to previous measurements that differ among themselves by a factor\n\nof two.\n\n10\n\ni\nI\n\nThe Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility (AXAF)\nwill record images and spectra of the Milky Way\nand other galaxies.\nThe performance targets will be to:\n\n- Record 100 images and spectra at a resolution\nof better than an arcsecond, five to ten times\n\ni\ni\nI\n\nI\n\n-\n\nsharper than images gathered earlier by the\nEinstein Observatory.\nRecord data on approximately 50 compact\nstellar objects with a sensitivity 50 times\n\nThe Lunar Prospector, launched in 1998, is\ndesigned to provide a complete map of the lunar\nsurface.

RXTE is measuring\nrapid fluctuations of x-rays from cosmic sources\nand will conduct experiments to test the General\nRelativity Theory.\nl h e performance target will be to observe physical phenomena 25,000 times closer to the event\nhorizon of black holes than permitted with optical\nwavelength measurements.\n\nOt,jective-\xe2\x82\xacxp/ore the solar system\nThe Near-Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) will\nprovide high precision measurements of the shape\nand composition of the asteroid EROS,increasing\nour understanding of the early history of such bodies and the solar system.\nThe performance targets will be to:\n-- Orbit EROS closer than 50 kilometers,\n20-30 times closer than previous asteroid flybys.\n-- Measure the shape of EROS to an accuracy of\n10 meters or better, about 100 times better\nthan previous measurements of the asteroid\nMathilde.\n-- Complete the first direct compositional measurements of an asteroid.\n\nThe Transition Region and Coronal Explorer\n(TRACE) will observe energy propagation from\nsolar disturbances beginning at the bottom of the\nvisible solar atmosphere into the corona high\nabove. The observations will be made at both high\nspatial resolution (a few arcseconds) and high time\nresolution (a few seconds). The analysis of this data\nwill improve the understanding of solar activity and\nenhance the ability to predict its Occurrence and\neffects in interplanetary space and on the Earth.\nThe performance target will be to provide these\ndata with spatial resolution five times better than\nwas collected from the Yohkoh Soft X-ray\nTelescope.\n\nObject/v+Discover planets around other stars\nNASA will connect the twin 1O-meter telescopes at\n\nthe Keck Observatory in Hawaii into an 85-meterbaseline interferometer. This system will provide a\ncapability to directly detect hot planets with Jupitersize masses and characterize clouds of dust and\ngases permeating other planetary systems.\nThe performance target will be to assemble and\nlab-test the interferometer beam combiner.
