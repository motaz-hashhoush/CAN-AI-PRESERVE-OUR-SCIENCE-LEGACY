The coating eliminates the need for a liquid lubricant in the rotorcam, which has no crankshaft, flywheel, distributor or water pump. Developed by Murray United Development Corporation, it is a rotary engine only 10 inches long with four cylinders radiating outward from a central axle. Company officials say the engine will be lighter, more compact and cheaper to manufacture than current engines and will feature cleaner exhaust emissions. A licensing arrangement with a manufacturer is under negotiation. Primary applications are for automobiles, but the engine may also be used in light aircraft.", "title": "Engine Lubricant", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-20T23:05:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020080855, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020080855, "isbn": "0-16-042100-4", "id": "43658718e31a4722b5f43964c939eb3b", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1993", "publicationDate": "1993-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020080855.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020080855/downloads/20020080855.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020080855/downloads/20020080855.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020080855/downloads/20020080855.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
