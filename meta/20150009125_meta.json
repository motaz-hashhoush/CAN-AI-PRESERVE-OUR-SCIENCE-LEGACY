I will argue that these forces, taken in balance, are beneficial to the field and are partly responsible for the rapid progress in the search for planets and ultimately the search for life beyond the solar system. Specific examples will include indirect detection of Earth analogs from ground and space and the direct detection of gas giant and terrestrial planets.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20150009125, "name": "National Astronomical Observatory of Japan", "location": "Hawaii", "id": "2a9014f56e8146cfa25c196976c2f98a", "startDate": "2009-03-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20150009125, "id": "f0f74aafe6c749389af39154c74cb00f", "publicationDate": "2009-03-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
