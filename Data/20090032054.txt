INTRODUCTION\nThe James Webb Space telescope (JWST) will be a cutting edge general-purpose astronomical observatory in the\ntradition of the Hubble Space telescope and Spitzer Space telescope. The JWST instrument suite will enable photometry\nand spectroscopy from I to _ microns opening the earliest stages of star and galaxy formation to astronomical\ninvestigation. One of these instruments, NIRSPEC, is a moderate resolution I to 5 micron multi-object spectrograph\nutilizing cutting-edge neat-infrared detector technology to meet the ambitious instrumental and scientific requirements\nset by the JWST science case.\n\nThis is an incredibly busy time for the NIRSPEC detector System (DS) team. We have made 2 flight detector selections,\nhave achieved detector total noise requirements under lab conditions and have just recently completed Pathfinder testing\nat Goddard Space Flight Center\'s Detector Characterization Laboratory (DCL). Additionally, testing using the\ninstrument cryostat and test detector electronics has begun at Astrid EAS in Ottobrun, Germany. This article focuses on\nPathfinder testing and preliminary flight hardware test results. For a more detailed look at DS architecture and readout\npatterns readers are encouraged to refer to precious articles and references therein.\'\'\nPrevious papers on JWST NIR detectors concentrated largely on testing performed at Teledyne Imaging Systems (TIS)\nat Camarillo, CA and data from such testing made available for analysis by the DCL. This paper focuses on data\nobtained in-house in the DCL.\n\n2. DCL FACILITY\nThe Detector Characterization Laboratory is a state of the art facility at Goddard Space Flight Center, which specializes,\nin the testing and development of low background infrared detectors. The DCL is responsible for final testing and\ncalibration of the near-IR sensors for the NIRSpec detector system. Previous papers detailed testing of H2RGs\nperformed at Teledyne Imaging Systems (TIS). This testing was used in the selection of flight grade, flight spare and\nflight analogue devices, while testing at the DCL more extensively characterizes the selected devices. The DCL also\ntests the detector system electronics, cables, thermal control and other DS hardware.\nDCL equipment consists of several cryogenic vacuum enclosures that have been baffled and light-sealed for extremely\nsensitive dark current, total noise and fain measurements. Two sets of electronics have been used in these measurements,\nthe ETU electronics and the Pathfinder electronics. The ETU system was used in basic test and readout electronic\ndevelopment, as well as for basic understanding of H2rg behavior in the DCL test dewar. The Pathfinder configuration\nwas designed to use flight-like electronics and is being used to simulate array behavior as installed in the final NIRSpec\nsystem. For both the configurations the same H2RG arrays were used, 5042 and 5040.\n\n3. H2RGS\nThe NIR arrays used in JWST are Teledyne Imaging System\'s Hawaii 11 devices (H2RG\'s). NIRSpec utilizes two\nH2RGs, each with a 2048x2048 pixel format. The NIRSpec detectors have a wavelength sensitivity range of 0.6 microns\nto 5 microns. Two other instruments also utilize H2RGs: the Fine Guidance Sensor (FGS) and NIRCam, although\nNIRCam uses a mixture of short wavelength (1-2.5 micron) and long wavelength (1-5microns) devices. H2RGs are read\nout by TIS-developed ASICs, which enable signal amplification and digitization at cryogenic temperatures. Each H2RG\nis read out by its own ASIC. H2RG and ASIC development has been the product of a close collaboration between\nGoddard and TIS. A Goddard-built FPE powers the H2RGs and ASICs. Early testing utilized the well-characterized\nETU FPE, while recent tests have used the Pathfinder FPE, which operates identically to the FPE that will fly on JWST.\nGoddard computers process array outputs. Like the FPEs, early testing was performed using a well-characterized system\n(SWTS), while recent pathfinder tests were performed using a flight-like system (STIS). Test results reported here will\nspecify whether they were in the ETU/SWTS or Pathfmder/STIS configuration. The SCA/ASIC pairs remained\nunchanged for all tests.\n\n3.1 5040 and 5042\nThe overall goal of testing at the DCL was to achieve familiarity with the NIRSpec detector system prior to flight\nintegration. As such the SCAs used in the DCL tests were not flight-selected devices, but were selected to be\noperationally flight-like. For DCL testing we used 2 TIS SCA/ASIC pairs: 5040 and 5042. Both arrays were selected\nfrom the same `batch\' as the selected flight arrays so as to provide accurate comparison in behavior. 5042 is actually of\nrelatively high quality, with few hot pixels, low dark current and hi DQU as measured by Teledyne. However, it has a\nlarge Photo Emissive Defect (PED) that disqualified it from flight consideration. 5040 is of lower quality, but is a useful\noperational check against 5042. Because of its high quality, when ignoring the PED, 5042 makes and excellent test\ndevice for NIRSpec detector system calibration. See figure 1. H2RGs are read out in 4 columns of 512x2048 pixels\n\nreferred to as outputs 14 in this document. Each output has its own ROIC, necessitating separation of the outputs for\nnoise and dark current measurements.\n\nFigure 1: Dark ramp exposures of SO40 (left) and SO42 (right)\n3.2 Sampling up-the - ramp (SUTR)\nThe primary method of data acquisition for NIRSpec will be as\n88 frame sampling up the ramp exposures. Sampling up the\nramp uses a series of equally spaced non-destructive reads to\ncreate one exposure. Flux levels in each pixel are subsequently\nfound through iterative slope-fitting routines, making the method\nespecially efficient for the sparse, low flux targets that NIRSpec\nwill most commonly examine. SUTR has the added benefit of\nallowing Cosmic Ray rejection without loss of data.\nSampling up the ramp utilizes buildup of charge on each pixel to\nmeasure flux ( see figure 2). The entire array is reset at the\nbeginning of the exposure. Each pixel is read out at regular\nintervals throughout the ramp, creating a signal measured as a\nslope for each pixel. The H2RGs used in NIRSpec are read out\nevery 10.6 seconds for a total of 88 frames. NIRSpec further\nstructures the data into 22 groups of four frames each. NIRSpec\ntim e\narrays are 2048 x 2048 pixels, resulting in data cubes of\ndimensions 2048 x 2048 x 22. Using iterative slope-fitting on Figure 2 : One \'ramp\'. Each dotted line represents a noneach pixel this data cube is processed to produce an overall slope destructive read or \'frame\'. The slope of the dashed line is\nequal to the flux seen by the pixel.\nimage for the duration of the exposure.\nNoise in a SUTR exposure is not calculated in the same manner a correlated double sample (CDS) or Fowler sampling.\nInstead the noise in a SUTR exposure is given by:\n\ntuI\t\n\n0"\t\nrrrr. \xc2\xb0 1) r,t\t\n\n^,\t\n\n-6\xc2\xb0 1 j\t\n\n) :\t\n\nIrk .\n\n\t\n\nrtr\t\n\nrp,.t rt\t\n\n1j\n\n1 g --\n\nt\n\n\'idark\n\nWhere iduk is the flux, g, is the conversion gain, n is the number of frames per group (4 for NIRSpec) and in the\nnumber of groups (22 for NIRSpec). For complete derivation and discussion of this noise equation, see Mott et al.5\n\n3.3 Reference Pixel Subtraction\nTeledyne H2RGs utilize a 4 pixel wide frame of non-light responsive pixels for reference correction, meaning the photosensitive portion of the SCA is 2040x2040 pixels. The reference pixels are electrically identical to the photosensitive\npixels, so they can be used to remove a large portion of the electronic noise from the array images. The DCL had been\nutilizing a simplified reference pixel subtraction method based on testing performed at the University of Hawaii\'. This\nsimple reference pixel subtraction only used the horizontal reference pixels in the correction, ignoring the columns of\nreference pixels along outputs I and 4. While the horizontal reference pixels correspond to the `fast scan\' direction of the\narray, they cannot correct for 1/f noise or other noise appearing as horizontal bands across the detector. In response to\nthis the DCL has developed a reference pixel subtraction method that initially corrects using the horizontal reference\npixels, but performs a secondary correction utilizing the vertical reference pixels. This approach yields noise reductions\nof 2% to 8% over the simplified, horizontal reference pixel method.\n\n4. SCA TESTING RESULTS\nThis section presents the results from DCL testing of SO40 and SO42. All tests were performed in the DCL dark dewar\nunder cryogenic conditions. As the overall goal wad to characterize the flight ready detector system. The presented\nresults are from the Pathfinder HE and STIS configuration except for the ETU total noise result, which is presented as\nan illustration of the potential gain from ASIC tuning.\n\n5040\n\n4.1 Conversion Gain\nt 2=2 ^ AW\n\n5042\n\nCon version gain is of obvious importance to any astronomical\ndetector system. Each SCA has a different gain, as does each\nexperimental configuration, thus gain must be determined for\neach SCA/ASIC pair during the experiment. Conversion gain is\nalso subtly affected by signal level, requiring the determination\nof gain for the NIRSpec DS at extremely low signal levels not\nonly because total noise measurements are performed at the dark\ncurrent flux limit, but also because NIRSpec\'s primary\nastronomical targets will be distant, faint objects in the early\nuniverse. We utilize the noise signal squared technique for gin\ndetermination. This method uses a very faint, calibrated light\nsource to illuminate the SCA over the course of a series of\nmultiple frame rams. We then create a series of CDS images at\ndifferent flux levels by comparing each frame to the first frame\nof the ramp. With a series of ramps we can also find the noise on\nthe signal. We then use the relation\n\n1\n2\t\n2\t\n6total - 6CI)s + \xe2\x80\x94 S\n91\n\nIPC corrected ge =1.17 e4AD U\nFigure 3: Conversion gain results for SO40 (top) and\nSO42 (bottom)\n\nand find the conversion gain by plotting the noise vs. the\nsigna16. The slope of the liner regression is the conversion gain.\nWith conversion gains from multiple signal levels we interpolate\nback to a conversion gain for the zero-flux case. This gin does\nnot take into account the IPC factor, which, for the H2RGs we\nare using has been shown to be 12% in the low signal case.\nIncluding this factor yields the gains reported here and used in\nthe dark current and total noise measurements. For SO42 in the\nETU configuration we found g c= 1.21 e IADU. For the pathfinder\nconfiguration we found SO42\'s gain to be g,-1.17e-/ADU.\nFigure 3 shows the pathfinder gain measurements for SO40 and\nSO42.\n\n4.2 Dark Ramps\nThe Dark Current and total noise measurements both require a large number of long-duration dark SUTR exposures.\nEach dark ramp is taken as 88 10.6-second duration non-destructive reads. These 88 frames are then re-structured into 22\ngroups of 4 frames each. This is called a 22x4 MULTI ramp. While taking such a long dark exposure likely\noverestimates the dark current, data is taken using this method to accurately mimic the primary observing mode for\nNIRSpec. Experiments in altering the dark ramp procedure will be undertaken during NIRSpec flight calibration to more\nfully investigate the tradeoffs involved.\nIn general 50 of these ramps is obtained for each dark current and total noise measurement. Once the series of dark\nramps has been acquired, each ramp is converted into a slope image using the least-squares slope fitting found in the\nastro library DJS-ITERSTAT procedure. Reference pixel subtraction and 3-sigma clipping is also applied to the data.\nSince these darks are often taken overnight, after a full day of experiments the first 10 ramps are discarded from further\nprocessing in order to ensure only data from a fully stabilized system is included. The slope images are combined into a\nmean slope image. This procedure also generates records the standard deviation from the mean slope at each pixel as a\n`sigma\' image. In the dark ramp case, the mean slope image is the dark current, while the sigma image yields the total\nnoise. Figure 4 shows the mean slope and sigma images for 5042 in the pathfinder configuration.\n\nMeat Slope\t\n\nStandard Deviation\n\ne4s\t\n\n0.010 0\t\n\n- rr s\t\n\n1\n\nFigure 4: 5042 Mean Slope (left) and standard deviation images after reduction of 50 ramps.\n4.3 Dark Current\nDark current is the measurement of the inherent signal in a given detector. At the NIRSpec operating temperature of 37K\ndark current for the H2RG is dominated by quantum tunneling, which is sensitive to thermal stability, ROIC stability and\ninput voltages, this the dark current must be measured at each new configuration. These devices have extremely low\ndark current, so dark current measurements are taken only after the detector has been dark for at least 24 hours. The\nmajority of pathfinder tests (ASIC tuning, thermal stability, etc) are done with the dewar completely dark, allowing\naccurate dark current measurements, but gain, DQE and flat field measurements require light sources capable of creating\npersistence in the detector leading to dark current over estimation$.\nThe mean slope image found from the dark ramp series is a measure of the dark current at each pixel. Plotting the\ndistribution of these dark currents gives the mean dark current for the entire array. Figure 5 shows he dark current\nmeasured in the pathfinder configuration for both SO40 and 5042, separated by output. Table 1 summarizes the\npathfinder dark current results.\n\n0 n* ,\t\n\nWNW\t\n\nNW\n\nany\n\n%\n\n.\n\n*\n\n^T+,:\xe2\x82\xacnp u.zv?s\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\t\n\n\xc2\xa7\n\nWow\n\n2\n\ni\n\nC ^ FS\t\n\n#5\n\n105 \t\n\n>.;,\n\n^00&\n\n^\n\n400 ,\nr\n\nlow\n29\n5\n\nzT\naz\n\nuu wrw..v.:.n^wv.^ - uy..^.,v wve\t\n\n}^\n\na\n\n4 fi t.+a < r ..1v\t\n\nR^\n\nr.>:\n01010\t\n\nt\n\n\'W\n\n00"Ri\n\nW-11\n\nVon -Oams\n\nj\n\nkf^^ r,,`\n\nowl\n3\n\n{\n\ns\n\nOAK\n\n00M, OW6 0000 016 ocrej\t\n\nokul\ntPQ\n\nI\n\n\t\ntwo,\n\n\xc2\xb0\t\n\n` .,--011 1041 5\t\n\n^00\n\nfi\n\n4\n\ns*tea\n\n14\n\n^^2\n\n100\n\n\xc2\xb0\n\nn\t\n\n0\'.10615 G\t\n\nMoan -\n\ntc\n.5^\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2sD\n\nt\n\n4\n\np\n\ngo\n\ng\n\n40,\n\n40\n\nz\nd\n\na\t\n\n0,005\t\n\n4 0MM \xe2\x80\xa23.[W.\n\n0-010\t 0,05\t\n. i+tn1.\n\n-0\'0"\n\n0+tom\n\n00W tow 0,0 0\n\nu\n\nnw yo -)\n\nOutput 3\n\nOutput 4\nis,\nC,?\'\t\n\n.\n\ntii` } LF\t\n\n5\n\n\xc2\xa3 r` !\n\ntG 3\nkr\t\n\nMAW s,: Q.

Theoretically, the total noise in a 22x4 MULTI ramp is given by equation 1 in section 3, but in reality,\nachieving this goal requires a well-understood, well-tuned system. The noise per second per pixel is given by the sigma\nimage from the series of dark ramps discussed in section 4.2. Fitting a Gaussian to the distribution of these noise\nmeasurements gives the total noise for the entire detector. To convert from ADUs to electrons we multiply by the IPCcorrected conversion gain, g,\nWe have achieved the 6-electron noise goal in the ETU configuration with SO42, and are progressing steadily towards 6\nelectrons in the pathfinder configuration. We have found that the majority of the total noise is contributed by the Sidecar\nASIC readout electronics. These contributions can be minimized by careful adjustment of the ASIC. A great deal of\nETU testing at the DCL concentrated on tuning the detector system through small modifications to the ASIC microcode\nand personality file. Each ASIC is subtly different, and requires individual tuning and adjustment for optimal noise\nperformance. During flight integration and test the flight hardware will be put through the same tuning process as the\nETU and pathfinder configurations have been. Figure 6 shows the noise results for SO42 in the ETU configuration, while\nfigure 7 shows the total noise results for SO40 and SO42 in the pathfinder configuration.

SUMMARY\nPathfinder testing for a set of H2RGs has been completed at the DCL at Goddard Space Flight Center. These tests have\nestablished a baseline measurement for detector gain, dark current and total noise in a flight - like configuration. Although\ntesting non- flight grade components, we have achieved the NIRSpec DS requirements for gain and dark current in the\npathfinder configuration, and have achieved the total noise specification in the ETU configuration. Pathfinder testing has\nyielded a comprehensive process for tuning the Sidecar ASIC readout electronics, which will be the critical component\nin final flight integration, calibration and test. Likewise, the lessons learned in this testing are widely applicable, not only\nto the other near-IR JWST instruments NIRCAM and FGS, but will also be useful to other NIR space missions, as well\nas ground-based instrumentation currently under development for large observatories like Keck and Gemini. We are\nconfident that the H2RG devices, as well as the Sidecar ASIC readout electronics can be sufficiently tuned and\ncalibrated to meet or exceed even the stringent requirements of the NIRSpec science case, providing a state-of-the-art\ndetector system and spectrometer capable of probing the most fundamental questions of the early universe.\n\nREFERENCES\n[1] Rauscher, B.
