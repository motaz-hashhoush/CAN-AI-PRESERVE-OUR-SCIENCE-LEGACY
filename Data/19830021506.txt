CRUSTAL STRUCTURE NEAR JAPAN AND ITS ANTARCTIC STATION\nThe objective is to study the crustal structure near Japan and its\nAntarctic base by constructing a model of the regional. magnetic field and\ninvestigating the local magnetic anomalies and their origin.\n\nA-1. Re g ional Ma gnetic Charts\nIt has been attempted to construct a model of the regional geomagnetic\nfield over the Japanese islands and their neighborhood for the epoch 1980.0,\nby means of\t\n\nMAGSAT data (Nakagawa and Yukutake, Memo. Al-1) and the\n\naeromagnetic surve y data obtained by the Hydrograrhi.c Department in 1980\n(Ueda et al., Memo. Al-2). It was originally planned to make a model by\nincorporating the MAGSAT data with the surface data, with downward continuation of the MAGSAT data. .ncorporation of the MACSAT data is, however,\nleft for future work. The field synthesized by the model of the third\ndeg-^.e polynomials was compared with the existing reference field, IGRF\n1980.0 and MGST(4/81).\t\n\nBetter agreement is seen with MGST(4/81) rather\n\nt\'zan w\'_th IGRF 1980.0 (Ueda et al., Memo. Al-2). This seems to arise from\nthe difference in the number of terms included in the models. Poor approximation of IGRF is perhaps due to lack of terms higher than degree 10\nwhich also represents contribution of the core field.\n\n1.\t\n\nSpatial properties of the regional geomagnetic field\nFor the magnetically quiet period of K p _2 o , three component data\n\nX, Y and Z from MAGSAT Investigator-B tapes along individual paths over\nthe area of 120\xc2\xb0-160\xc2\xb0E and 18\xc2\xb0-58\xc2\xb0N were subjected to the polynomial fit,\nby means of Legendre functions, by iarying the maximum degree of series N\nfrom 1 to 9 (Nakagawa and Yukutake, Memo. Al-1). The study area was divided\ninto subdivisions, 5 regions for the data of the ascending path and 5 for\nthose of the descending path, in a strip bounded by orbital paths of every\n10\xc2\xb0 intervals of longitude. Fig. Al-1 shows the decrease in the magnitude\nof the coefficient with the degree of the polynomial terms for the Z\ncomponent along descending paths in region 8, which covers the area from\nthe southwestern part of Japan to the east coast of Siberia. The magnitude\n\nw\t\nPage 6\n\ni\nof the coefficient decreases rapidly from degree 1 to 6, and beyond degree\n6 the rate of decrease becomes small. Similar features are seen with X\nand Y components and those in all other regions. If the msgnitud2 of the\ncoefficient is regarded as representing the amplitude spectrum, this\nindicates that there are two distinct structures in the spatial spectrum\nof the observed field. One is the lower degree terms of large amplitude,\nand the other is the higher degree terms of small amplitude with low\ndecreasing rate.\nThe difference in the spectrum between the higher degree terms and\nthe lower ones is more clearly seen in the residual field after removing\nthe fitted polynomials. An example in Fig. Al-2 shows the rms residuals\nof the X-component plotted against the maximum degree of fitness for\nregion 3, which covers the region from southwestern Japan to northeastern\nChina through Korea.\t\n\nThe rms residuals decrease sharply from degree 1\n\nto 5, and become almost constant beyond degree 5. Similar feature are\nobservable with the Y and Z components as well.\nThe above feature in the spatial spectrum is very similar to the\nspectrum structure obtained from the spherical harmonic analysis of the\nglobal data, suggesting that these structures are of the origin of the\ncore and the crust respectively. The two t y pes of field become comparable\nat degree 13, corresponding to the wavelength of about 3000 km (Langel\nand Estes, 1982).\nIn the present analysis, however, the overlap of the spectrum of the\ncore and the crustal field does not always occur at the same degree. The\noverlap degree for the individual orbit paths waso..veraged in each region,\nand the trequency distribution of the average overlap degree in the 10 regionsisshown in Fig. Al-3.\t\n\nFor the X component, the over\'.ap degree is\n\neither 5 or 6 in 9 regions. For the Y component the critical degree\nconcentrates at 5. On the other hand, for the Z component it spreads\ntoward higher harmonics up to degree 7.\nFrom the degree of the polynomial one may roughly estimate the wavelength of the field. The degree n was related to wavelength a b y the\nequation\n^ = L/((n-i)/2]\n\nwhere L is the length of the path used for the analysis, which is taken\nas 7000 km.\t\n\nThe overlap degrees of 5 and 6 correspond to the wavelength\n\n\t\n\nPage 7\n\nOWGINAL PAGE 19\n\nOF POOR QUALITY\nof 3500 to 2800 km.\t\n\nThis is in agreement with the overlap wavelength\n\n3000 km derived from the spherical harmonic analysis of worldwide data.\ni\n\n2. Regional magnetic charts\n\'\t\n\nAeromagnetic Furveys were conducted by the Hydrographic Department of\nthe Maritime Safet y Agency in 1980 with fluxgate magnetometers for the\nthree components (Hydrog:aphic Department, 1982). \t\n\nAccuracy of the measure-\n\nment was about 10 nT for the Z component, and somewhat worse for the other\ncomponents, mainly controlled by the accuracy of orientation "f the instrument. Total intensity was computed from the component data. Fig. Al-4\nshows the flight tracks; the mean altitude of the flight was 3200 m. The\nsurveyed data along the flight tracks were subjected to the running mean\nover 60 km intervals, and expanded in a polynomial series of the \'bird\ndegree with longitude and latitude, as\n\nF, X, Y, Z = a l + a 2 ,,1\' + a 3 .1\' + a 4 m\' ` + a 5 ^\'a\' + a6\na7t\'3 + a\n+\n\n8 \xc2\xa2 2 V + a 9 ^\'a\' 1 + a10\\\'3\n\nwhere :\'(in radian) = \'(latitude)-: o , and\t\nwith\t\n\n0= 34.0\xc2\xb0N and } = 136.0\xc2\xb0E. \t\n\n^.\'(in radian) = \\ (longitude)-\\o,\n\nThe coefficients a l , a,,, .....a 10 were\n\ndetermined by a least squares method so as to satisf} the conditions\n(Ueda et al., Memo.

Al-5(a) to (d) show the computed values of F, X, Y, and Z, with\nthe coefficients in the above table. The calculated field changes very\ngradually, suggesting that the major part of the field represented by the\nthird aegree polynomial model should be originated from the earth\'s core.\nIf the wavelength of the field is estimated very roughly by a formula\npresented in a previous section, the third degree term is to represent the\nmagnetic field\t\n\nwavelength of 2500 km. In terms of spherical harmonics,\n\nthis corresponds to degree n= 16.\t\n\nAt this degree, the geomagnetic field\n\nobserved at the surface of the earth is considered to be dominated b y the\ncrustal fie f,:. One may say that the model expressed in a third uegree\npolynomial series represents mostly the core field, although it contains\nsmall fractions of contribution from the crustal field.\n3. Com p arison of the re g ional model with that derived from MAGSAT data\nThe regional field model expressed in a polynomial series was compared\nwith MGST(4/81) model (heda et al., Memo. Al-2). Field values at the grid\npoint of every 1\xc2\xb0 of longitude and latitude were synthesized from two models,\nthe regional field model and MGST(4/81).\t\n\nThe difference of the regional\n\nmodel minus MGST(4/81) is shown in kig. Al-6 for the total intensity. The\ndifference is small; its absolute value is less than 20 nT almost all over\nthe Japanese islands, except for the area near the border of the surveyed\narea, where the difference becomes -40 nT. Comparison was also made for the\nvector data. Discrepancy is insignificant in the central part, less than\n20 nT, for X and Z components. Regarding Y component, however, it becomes\n-80 nT; this large discrepancy might be caused by poorer orientation of\nairborne magnetometers. Hence, it may be said that, except for Y component,\nagreement between the regional model and MGST(4/81) is satisfactory.\nSimilar comparison was made with the field values computed from IGRF\n1980.0. The difference is shown in Fig. Al-7 for the total intensity.\nAlthough a zero line passes through the central part of the surveyed area,\nthe difference becomes as large as -80 nT toward the west, which is much\nlarger than in the case of MGST(4/81).\nBetter approximation of the model MGST(4/81) in comparison with IGRF\nseews to stem from the difference in the number of spherical harmonic terms\ninvolved (up to the degree and order of 13 in tdGST(4/81), and 10 in IGRF\n1980.0). As was discussed earlier, the regional model contains fields with\nwavelengths of 2500 km, which roughly corrresponds to degree 16 in terms of the\n\nl\ni\n\nPage 9\t\n\nspherical harmonic series. The IGRF 1980.0 model seems insufficient to\napproximate th^^ field of this wavelength. \t\n\nIt is perhaps due to the same\n\nreason that the past IGRF models (IGRF 1965.0 and 1975.0) have given rather\npoor approximation to the geomagnetic field over Japan and its vicinity.\nWhile the past IGRF models have always given 100 to 300 nT higher\nvalues for the total intensity than observation over the area of the Japan\nislands, the MGST(4/81) model has been confirmed to approximate the observed\nfield better. The field values along the flight tracks shown in Fig. Al-4\nwere synthesized from MGST(4/81), and then subtracted from the observed\naeromagnetic data, of which running means over 18 km intervals were taken.\nResiduals computed in this way are shown in Fig Al-8, where positive and\nnegative residuals are depicted in the opposite direction from the track\nline. It is seen that positive and negative residuals are distributed with\nalmost equal frequency, implying that the field value synthesized from\nMGST(4/81) is close to the mean field of the observed data.\n\nA-2. Local Magnetic Anomalies and Their Origin\nThe objective is to extract local magnetic anomalies and to investigate\ntheir ori_gi:. There are abundant data so far accumulated by the surface\nsurveys, not only on land, but also on the sea surface. Along with the\nMAGSAT data, they were originally planned to be integrated into a single\ndata set to generate the local magnetic anomalies. For this purpose it\nis necessar y to reduce all the data to those at a commcn altitude. A\ndownward continuation program by 1 , se of a Fourier analysis technique has\nbeen completed, but not yet used practically for extraction of the short\nwavelength anomalies. Only the method will be described here. \t\n\nAccordingly,\n\nMAGSAT datz: were analysed independently from the surface data, and reported\nseparately.\nTwo approaches were made to extract the local anomalies. The MGST\n(4/81) model w^:s subtracted from the observed values,and residuals were\ncomputed (Nakatsuka and Ono, Memo. A2-1).\t\n\nThe second approach is to apply\t\n\na polynomial series approximation to a limited segment cf the MAGSAT data\nand to compute the residuals (Nakagawa and Yukutake, Memo. A2-2). \t\n\nBo\'h\n\nanalyses have revealed interesting features in the crustal anomaly, but\nmany of the detailed structures still remain unresolved. \t\n\nA three-dimensional\n\nFourier analysis technique was explored with local Cartesian coordinates\n(Nakagawa and Yukutake, Memo. A2-2). A computer program for she downward\n\nIt\n\nPage 10\n\ncontinuation has been tested with lower order harmonics up to 3, only\ngiving long wavelength features.\nTotal intensity data in the oceanic area surrounding the Japanese\nislands were compiled and analysed (Fujita et al., Memo. A2-3). \t\nI\n\nData\n\nacquisition covers such a long period from 1961 to 1979, that correction of\nthe secular variation is needed to compare the data of different epochs.\nDefinitive International Geomagnetic Reference Field (DGRF) models were\nused for the correction. \t\n\nThe analysis is still under way. The results\n\nso far obtained are consistent with those of MAGSAT analysis.\t\n\nThe surface\n\ndata reinforce new findings made only vaguely by the analysis of MAGSAT\ndata.\nIn , estigation of the origin of the magnetic anomalies is the most \t\nretarded part of the project. Equivalent source procedure has been employed\nto infer the distribution of magnetization in the crust (Yanagisawa et al.,\n1982).\t\n\nThere are several factors conceivable for causing the observed\n\nmagnetic anomalies.\t\n\nHowever, the preliminary study seems to suggest that\n\neither the varying thickness of the crust or its thermal structure plays\nan important role in generating long wavelength anomalies.\n1.\t\n\nLocal ma gnetic anomalies derived from MAGSAT\n\n1-1. Anomalies as the residual field from MGST(4/81)\nAnomaly maps of total intensity and vector components were drawn for\nthe residuals of the observed field values from those computed by MGST(4/81)\nmodel (Nakatsilka and Ono, Memo. A2-1).\n(a)\n\nData selection: Only half orbit (ascending or descending) paths\n\npassing through the area in the vicinity of Japan (15\xc2\xb0-60\xc2\xb0N, 115\xc2\xb0-160\xc2\xb0E)\nwere picked-up.\t\n\nIn order to eliminate magnetic disturbance effect, the\n\nAttitude quality words\nwere excluded.\t\ndata for the period of K ?2\t\np- +\n(refer to NASA Technical Memorandum 82160) were checked and data points or\npoor quality in attitude (_ 4000) were excluded.\n(b)\n\nData processing : Every orbital series of data points was tested if\n\nit had sufficiently uniform distribution ir, dipole latitudes, and nonuniform ones were dropped.\t\n\nAft, t he subtraction of the reference field\n\nof MGST(4/81), the magnetic field data still included external (magnetospheric\nand ionospheric) disturbance fields.\t\n[a \xe2\x80\xa2 sin^ + h\xe2\x80\xa2cos\n\nA trigonometric function form\n\n0 + cl of dipole latitude ( ^ ) was fit within the dipole\n\nlatitude range of 15\xc2\xb0-55\xc2\xb0N, and the residuai between them was assumed to\n\n1\n\nr\nPage 11\n\nbe the crustal anomaly field. This o p eration was applied to each component\nand total intensity. A statistical process is then required to draw a\ntwo-dimensional anomaly map. We take a local Cartesian coordinate system\naround Japan, the origin of which is located at the point of 37.5\xc2\xb0N (geocentric), 137.5\xc2\xb0E, and at a geocentric distance of 6800 km. In order to find\nmesh point value a 3-dimensional linear regression formula was applied to\nall data within 160 km in Horizontal separations f--om the mesh point to be\nreduced, and the mesh point value at the mean elevation of these points\nwas determined. This regression analysis was condiicted at ever y 40 km\nmesh point, to get 2-dimensional mesh distribution of the magnetic field.\n(c) Results: Tl , e data processing described above was applied to four kinds\nof data subsets, .tamely A(ascending dusk-side paths only, 7587 points), D\n(descending dawn side paths only, 10488 points), H(high-altitude paths of\n>6800 km geocentric distance, 9745 points) and L(Low-altitude paths of\n<6500 km geocentric distance, 8330 points), and the set of all available\ndata (namely B, total of 18,075 data points). Fig. A2-1 shows the total\nintensity (F) anomalies around .Japan extracted from each data subset A. D,\nH and L. Magnetic anomal y maps F,X,Y and Z extracted from set B of all \t\n\nj\n\navailable data are shown in Fig. A2-2.\n(d)\n\nDiscussion\nWe see in Fig. A2-1 that, i q respect to the large scale anomaly, similar\n\npatterns are obtained irrespective of the data subset. This implies that\nthe reproducibility of anomaly patterns of this scale is good. Also, the\namplitude of anomalous field at lower altitude (d) is larger than at higher\naltitude (c). This result is consistent with the fact that the average\nelevational difference between these two data subsets is about 100 km, if\nwe consider the crustal anomaly decreases its amplitude in proportion to\nthe inverse square to cube of the distance.\nOn the other hand, there are some minor disturbances with shorter\nwavelength in Fi,g. A2-1, but they are not coincident with one another in the\nresults from each at the data subsets. As the data processing step effectively\ni\nincludes a low--pass f _tering operation, this process may be inadequate to\nreveal smaller-scale ,nomalies of shorter wavelength of a few hundred kilometers or less and also there may be the problem in the retrieval of the\nexternal field. Anyway, we cannot distinguish reliable magnetic anomalies.\nThe anomal y maps for the three components have also been made; they\nare more noisy than the total intensity. However, if all the available data\nare analysed together, the noisy character is very much reduced as seen in\nFig. A2-2(b)-(d). It is concluded that the ancmaly patterns with wavelengths\n\ni\nPage 12\n\nlonger than about 500 km can be sufficiently reproduced by the present\nanalysis.\n1-\xc2\xb0.\t\n\nAnomalies computed by the polynomial series\nIt has been confirmed that polynomial approximation "or a limited area\n\nis useful to separate the crustal field from the core field (Nakagawa and\nAn anomaly map was drawn for the area of 18\xc2\xb0\xe2\x80\xa258\xc2\xb0N\n\nYukutake, Memo. Al--!). \t\n\nand 120\xc2\xb0-160\xc2\xb0E, by means of the data on ail the satellite paths passing\nthrough the area of 8\xc2\xb0-68\xc2\xb0N and 110\xc2\xb0-170\xc2\xb0E for the magnetically quiet\nperiod K P<2\t\n= o\n\nSince it is knoy.m that the core field becomes comparable\n\nwith the crustal field at degrees from 5to 7, the 5th degree polynomials\nof latitude were used to subtract the core field, and the residuals were\nassumed to represent .he magnetic anomaly of crustal origin. Anomaly\ncharts were drawn at an altitude of 430 km, chat is an approximate mean of\nthe satellite paths.\t\n\nA chart of AZ anomaly is shown in Fig. A2-3. Besides\n\nshort wavelength anomalies, some of which are still seriously contaminated\nby noisy data contained in the original data set, an east-west trend of\nlong wavelength is noticeable.\t\n\nTwo causes are conceivable for this trend.\n\nOne is the nature of the filtering process. Although the polynomial fitting\nprocess filters out the long wavelength anomalies along thf. orbital p,-~h,\ni.e. the anomalies in the north-south direction, those with a strike in\nthe east-west direction perpendicular to the path remain unfiltered.\nSecondly, there is a possibility that the core field is not completely\nremoved by the 5th degree polynomials, and that the core field contained in\nthe 6th degree term dominates over the crustal field expressed by the rest\nof the polynomial series.\nAX, AY and AZ residuals were computed into Eridded values at 1.25\xc2\xb0\nintervals in longitude ani latitude without altitude correction, and\nexpressed in a double Fourier series of longitude and latitude. In order\ntc filter out the east-west trend appearing in Fig. A2-3, the first order\nharmonics were excluded from the series for synthesized. The results are\nshown in Figs. A2-4(a)-(c), where the series was synthesized up to the\norder of 31.\t\n\nIt is clear in Fig. A2-4(a) that the east-west trend is\n\nalmost completely removed. Instead, a weak tendency appears running in the\nnortheast-southwest direction. It is not known at the present whether this\nis partly of artificial origin or not. -,ome are real, such as a positive\n\n\'Deli along the Kuril islands from kamcha-ka to Hokkaid6. Although there\nare many anomalies of short wavelength, anomalies smaller than 500 km\n\nPagt 13\n\nare supposedly artifacts created by erroneous data.\n1-3. Results derived from MAGSAT data\nA positive anomaly of total intensity and the vertical comrc., \'_nt seems\nto exist along the trench. An anomaly along the Kuril islands is particularly intense (Figs. A2-2(a) and (d), Fig. A2-4(a)), which corresponds to\na narrow belt of positive anomaly observed at the surface ru..iing along the\nKuril Islands on the land side of the trench. \t\n\nOn the other hand, another\n\npositive belt that is also remarkable at the surface in the north-south\ndirection along the east coast of Northern Honsyd is not clearly recognizable\nat the satellite altitude. \t\n\nThis may suggest that the positive belt of\n\nNorthern Honsyu is of shallow origin in the crust, decaying rapidly with\nheight, while that of the Kuril Islands has deeper roots.\nIt is also i , teresting to point out that, over the Izu-Mariana trench,\na positive area extends north-south (Figs. A2-2(a) and (d), Fig. A2-4(a)).\nThis agrees well with the res<<lt of analyses of the marine data as will be\ndiscussed later, where the positive anomaly runs north-south in the west of\nthe trench.\t\n\nThese results seem to imply that it is a general feature of the\n\nmagnetic anomaly in the subduction zone th-_ the positive anomaly r,ins\nIf this is true, it would\n\nparallel to the trench on its island aide \t\n\nbecome an important key to disclose an evo. ioLi process of the island-arc\nand the trench structure.\nIt has been believed from the surface survey that the Japan Sea i:5\ncovered with a negative anomaly of AF and ^Z. \t\n\nHowever, Figs. A2-2(a), (c)\n\nand Fig. A2-4(a) indicate that only the northeastern part of the Japan Sea\nis negative, whereas the southwestern half is rather positive. This may\nbe related to the fact that the oceani: basin extends in the northeastern\npart of the Japan Sea, while in the southwestern part there are submarine\nrises such as the wide Yamato-tai rise.\t\n\nA similar feature is seen in\n\nOkhotsk Sea, where negative anomaly is more conspicuous. \t\n\nThis seems to\n\nsuggest an important nature of the back-arc basin.\nAnother feature to be noted is a negative anomaly of AZ that covers the\nKorean peninsula. This forms a pair with a positive anomaly in the south.\nIn the AY anomaly chart of Fig. A2-4(c). we may notice a quadrant structure\nat the place of the pair of dZ anomalies, where AY is positive in the northeast and soutb , :est quadrants, and negative in the northwest and southeast\nquadrants.\t\n\nThese a\t\n\ntypical patterns of the anomalies caused by dipole\n\nbeneath the ground with its magnetization in the direction of the present\n\ni\t\n\nPage 14\n\nr\n\nmagnetic field.\t\n\nAX anomaly is also consistent with this model. This\n\nsuggests that a highly localized magnetic mrterial with extremely intense\nnagnetizatioi is buried, perhaps at a shallow depth near the southwest tip\no* the peninsula.\n2.\t\n\nThree-dimensional Fourier analysis of MAGSAT data\nThe treatment in the previous section ignored changes in the field\n\nvalues caused b y the change in the satellite altitude from 350 km to 500 km\neven on a single path. This is one of the causes generating noises that\nconceal the detailed structure of the anomalies.\t\n\nThe altitude correction\n\nis an important step to refine the anomaly map.\nIn section A2-1-2, the field values were expanded into a Fourier\nseries of longitude and latitude.\t\n\nThis is a practical method when the data\n\nare given by the geodetic c-irdinates. \t\n\nHowever, this cannot be used for\n\nthe altitude correction, because the Fourier series in longitude and\nlatitude do not satisfy the Laplace equation in a rigorous sense.\nIn this section, we employed a local Cartesian coordinate system with\nits origin at 35 0 N, 140\xc2\xb0E. The z-axis is taken vertically downwards, and\nthe x- and y-axis toward the north and the east respectively on the plane\ntangent to the earth.\t\n\nThe coordinates of the satellite position_ were trans-\n\ntormed into the local coordinates, and the observed field was d.icomposed into\nX, Y and Z components or the Cartesian coordinates. The do )mposed values\nwere then subjec^:ed to a three-dimensional Fourier analysis (Nakagawa and\nYukutake, Memo. A2-2).\nAmong the data on the paths over the area of 8\xc2\xb0-68\xc2\xb0N and 110\xc2\xb0-170\xc2\xb0E,\nonly those with high accuracy of satellite attitude control were selected,\nalthough this process resulted in reducing the data set to about a quarter\nof the original size. The data thus selected were subjected to the polynomial\nfit. Since the core field is likel y to remain in the residuals even after\nthe trend was removed by the 5th degree series, we employed the 7th d gree\npolvnomi3ls to compute the residual anomaly field. Of the residuals obtained\nin this way, those inside the space -L/2<x<L./2, -L/2<y<L/2 were Fourier\nanalysed, taking the maximum order of harmonics as 3.\nFrom the Fourier series determined in this way, it has become possible\nto compute the anomaly field at any point in the three-dimensional space.\nThe anomalies at the altitude of 300 km T ere s y nthesized and are shown in Fig.\nA2-5.\t\n\nSince only the lower harmonics have bee\xc2\xab used for the analysis, the\n\nanomaly charts delineate only the long wavelength featu \xe2\x80\xa2 . Upward and\n\nPage 15\n\ndownward continuation was made and the magnetic anomalies at the altitude\nof 100 km and 500 km were computed, of which the anomalies of the vertical\ncomponent are shown in Figs. A2-6(a)and (b).\nEven in this crude approximation with only the lower harmonics, one may\nsee the magnetic features revealed in the previous section. AZ anomaly in\nFig. A2-5, for example, shows that the northeastern part of the Japan Sea\nis weakl y negative, while the southwestern part is positive. A positive\nanomaly is noticeable from the Kuril Islands to Hokkaido. A positive anomaly\nthat runs along the Izu-Mariana trench is not well recognized in this figure.\nIn order to see this relatively short wavelength anomaly, it is necessary to\ninclude higher harmonics in the series.\t\n\nOn the other hand, a negative\n\nanomal y covering the Korean peninsula is ver y remarkable in the present\ncase. Another feature to be mentioned is, though weak, a trend in the\ndirection of ENE to WSW of alternating positive anu negative anomalies.\nFurther investigation is needed to confirm whether this trend is real or not.\n3.\t\n\nLocal anomalies de r\n\nred from maritime data\n\nA large amount of daLa has alread y been accumulated from the surface\nsurveys, which call\n\n\t compared with the MAGSAT data.\t\n\nUnfortunatelv,\n\nhowever, these surface data are not well. compiled nor analysed in a form\nready to compare with the satellite data except for a very few works (Nomura,\n1979).\t\n\nAmong the data accumulated in the Oceanographic Data Center of\n\nH y drographic Department, Martitime Safety Agency, total intensity data\nobtained b y ship-borne proton precession magnetometers covering the region\nof 120\xc2\xb0E-160\xc2\xb0E and 15\xc2\xb0N-50\xc2\xb0N were analyzed (Fujita et al., Memo. A2-3).\nThe total number of data amounts to about 600,000, winch had been acquired\nduring the period from 1961 to 1979.\nSince the observation covers such a long period a certain kind of\ncorrection for the geomagnetic secular variation is necessary to reduce the\ndata to a common epoch for computing the magnetic anomalies. For the\ncorrection, we used the Definitive International Reference Field (DGRF) for\n1965.0, 1970.0 and 1975.0, together with the International Geomgnetic\nReference Field (IGRF) for 1980.0.\t\n\nIn the first place, comparison was\n\nmade of these reference field models wits. the observed fields at Japanese\nmagnetic observatories, Memambetsu (MMB), Kakioka (KAK), and Kanoya (M),\nas shown in Fig. A2-7.\t\n\nThe reference field values were linearly interpolated\n\nbetween 1965-70, 1970-75, and 1975-80.\t\n\nIt is obvious from Fig. A2-7 that\n\nPage 16\n\nthe total intensity of the reference field is larger than that observed in\nJapan by about 100 nT, and the differences are almost constant for the two\nperiods 1965-70 and 1975-80, but from 1970 to 1975 the differences increase\nabruptly by more than 50 nT at Memambetsu and at Kakioka. Therefore, the\nadopted reference field may be talon to represent the secular variation in\ntotal intensit y in Japan with an accuracy of about 50 nT. Since the amplitude of magnetic anomalies in total intensity around Japan in about 300 nT,\nthe magnetic anomaly chart based on these reference fields may not be\nseriousl y influenced by the correction of the secular variation.\nThe anomaly was obtained by taking; the difference between the observed\nvalues and those s-\xe2\x80\xa2 nthesized from the reference models. At each observation point, the difference was computed, i.e. observed total intensity minus\nreference total intensit y , and averaged every 0.25\xc2\xb0 x 0.25\xc2\xb0 area. Using all\nthe data from 1965 to 1979, Fig. A2-8 was depicted on the basis of these\naveraged anomalies.\nFor the two stable periods of the secular variation, i.e. the periods\n1965-70 and 1975-80, the anomalies were computed separately and compared.\nAlthough there is a tendency that the anomalies computed from the data in\n1966-70 have larger values than those in 1976-79, the general patterns of\nthe anomalies are similar in eaci, period. In Fib. A2-8, several features\nare remakable. (1) There are positive anomaly belts running parallel with\ntrenches on their continental side, such as the anomaly along the Kuril\ntrench, and tha\' associated with the Japan trench, and the anomaly parallel\nwith the Izu-Mariana trench. As has already been described, the anomalies\nalong the Kuril trench and the Izu-Mariana trench were visible at the satellite altitude, whereas the anomaly running; north-south in parallel with the\nJapan trench was not recognizable in the MAGSAT data. (2) The southwestern\npart of the Japan Sea is covered with a positive anomaly, and an area of\nnegative anomaly spreads to the north. This feature was confirmed by the\nMAGSA\'r dat.. However, the marine data suggests existence of a positive area\nagain further to the north. (3) A strong positive anomaly is clearly seen\nnear 40\xc2\xb0N and 155\xc2\xb0F.. This has not been confirmed by the satellite data.\nOn the other hand, the positive anomaly region in the Pacific Ocean\nmarked by "?" is not clearly established. In the Pacific Ocean it is\ndifficult to draw a clear anomaly pattern, due either to complex superposition of small scale magnetic anomalies or to sporadic distribution of\nthe regions where data are missing. The number of data used for calculation\nof averaged anomaly in each unit area amounts to several hundreds near\n\nPage 17\n\nI\n\nJapan but it is only several in the Pacific Ocean far off Japan.\n4. Possible causes of the magnetic anomalies\n\n1\t\n\n\'\t\n\nApplying an equivalent source procedure, distribution of magnetization\nin the earth\'s crust was determined to generate the observed total intensity\nanomalies at the MAGSAT altitude (Yanagisawa et al., 1982).\t\n\nIn comparison\n\nWith the other geophysical data, possible causes of the anomalies were\ninvestigated. Lateral variation in the thickness of the crustal layer is\none possible cause.\t\n\nThe other is difference in geothermal structure\n\nrevealed by heat flow measurements. These are the most likely sources for\nthe magnetic anomalies.\nBy placing magnetic dipoles at the surface of the earth with their\naxes parallel to the main field calculated from the 11GST(4/81) model, it was\nattempted to interpret the anomaly of total intensity at a satellite\naltitude shown in Fig. A2-9, which was derived by the method described in\nsection A2-1-1 b y subtracting the MGST(4/81) field from the observation.\nThe dipoles were placed at every 3\xc2\xb0x3\xc2\xb0 latitude-longitude mesh points. The\nuuzgnetic moment of each dipole was determined by means of an equivalent\nsource procedure proposed by Mayhew (1979) so as to fit the observed anomaly.\nThe magnetic moment thus obtained was then converted to a magnetization of\nthe earth\'s surface layer on an assumption that the layer has a uniform\nthickness of 30 km. Fig. A2-10 shows the distribution of magnetization\nthus obtained.\nA zone of high magnetization runs almost north-south near t.he center\nof the Japan Sea. Most of this high magnetization roughly coincides with\nthe location of the Yamato-tai, a sea platform with a shallow depth of less\nthan 2,000 m. Except for this high, the magnetization in the Japan Sea area\nis lower than that on the Japan Island by 1 x 10 -1 to 2 x 10 -1 A/m. The weak\nmagnetization is most pronounced to the north-eastern part of the Japan Sea,\ni.e., most of the Japan Basin and the Yamato Basin where the depth of the\nbottom is typically 3,000 to 3,500 m.\nFig. A2-10 was obtained by assuming a layer of 30 km thickness for the\nsource of magnetic anomalies. The anomalies in this figure can therefore\nbe interpreted as representing (1) the lateral variation of susceptibility\nin the magnetized layer. There is however, another possibility for explaining these anomalies, i.e. (2) lateral variation of the thickness of the\nmagnetized layer. If the thickness of the layer is assumed constant,\nvariation of its thickness causes the magnetic anomalies. \t\n\nFrom comparison\n\nPage 18\n\nr\n\nwith other geophysical data in this area, the second interpretation appears\nmore plausible.\nIt was tentatively assumed that the crustal meterial had a uniform\nsusceptibility of 4 x 10 -3 in SI unit (=3.2 x 10 -4 emu/cc).\t\n\nThen the crustal\n\nmaterial is magnetized by 1.6 x 10 -1A/m (1.6 x 10 -4 emu/cc) per unit volume\nunder the geomagnetic field of 40 A/m (=0.5 Gauss). \t\n\nThe magnetization\n\ncontrast in Fig. A2-10, where the thickness of the layer is assumed to be\na uniform 30 km, was converted to the differences of the thickness of the\nmagnetized layer with the uniform magnetization, 1.6 x 10 -1A/m. The contrast\nof 1.3 x 10 -1 A/m between the Japan Sea and the Japan Island in Fig. A2-10\ncorresponds to the 24 km difference in the thickness. This value certainly\ndepends on the assumed susceptibility, but suggests that the magnetized layer\nis substantiall y thinner in most parts of the Japan Sea.\nFrom the seismic data, crustal thickness is about 30 km beneath the\nJapan Island and about 10 km beneath the Japan Sea (Yoshii, 1979). If the\nCurie point isotherm is deeper than the crust/mantle boundary, the crust\nwould be magnetized, but the mantle would not be magnetized at all\n(Wasilewski etal., 1979).\t\n\nIf this is the case in this area, the thin\n\nmagnetized layer in the Japan Sea may be explained by the thin crust.\nOn the other hand, the heat flow through the sea floor of the Japan\nSea is about 100 riW/m 2 , and about twice the value observed on the Japan\nIsland (Yoshii, 1979). The Japan Sea area is characterized by low surface\nwave velocities, which means a hot upper mantle in this area (Abe and\nKanamori, 1970).\t\n\nAlso the large negative residual gravity anomalies indicate\n\nthat the upper mantle is light and hot (Yoshii, 1972). These facts suggest\nthat the Curie point isotherm is shallow beneath the Japan Sea and only the\nshallower part of the crust could be magnetized.\nFrom the heat flow values and geothermal gradients measured at the\nsurface, the depth of the 500\xc2\xb0C isotherm is estimated to be about 30 km\noeneath the central part of Japan (Watanabe, 1968). If this can be regarded\nas the thickness of the magnetized layer in central Japan, the 24 km difference of the thickness leads to a 6 km magnetized layer beneath the Japan \t\nSea. This is smaller than the Japan Sea crustal thickness (about 10 km).\nTherefore, this appears to suggest that the lower crust is not magnetized\nbecause of high temperature.\nStudy on the origin of the magnetic anomaly is still at its initial\nstage. Although two highly possible causes were investigated, there is no\n\nt\n\nPage 19\t\n\ni\t\n\ndecisive evidence to determine whether the anomaly is created by the lateral\nvariation of the thickness of the crust or by that of the depth of the Curie\npoint isotherm. Further investigation is needed.\n\nA-3.\t\n\nCrustal Structure in the Antarctic\nThe ultimate goal is to clarify the crustal structure in an area near\n\nthe Japanese Antarctic base stations, Syowa Station at 69 0 00\'S, 39035\'E\nand Mizuho Station at 70\xc2\xb042\'S, 49\xc2\xb020\'E, incorporating the geomagnetic data\nwith gravity and seismic data. The aeromagnetic survey was the central\nprogram related to the present investigation.. Under severe conditions the\naeromagnetic surveys were conducted and the data are now being analysed\n(haminuma and Shibuya, Memo. A3-1).\nWith a proton precession magnetometer, the aeromagnetic survey was\nintensively carried out around Syowa Station (Fig. A3-1) in 1980 and 1981. The\nsurvey was carried out along the 20 flight lines over the eastern and central\npart of Lutzow-Holm Bay, 3 hours each, with the flight elevation of 1500 feet\nover the ground surface in 1980.\t\n\nThe survey was also carried out in the\n\nYamato Mountain area, which was located 200-300 km south from Syowa Station,\nand in the area between Syowa and Mizuho Stations.\nFig. A3-1 shows the course of the aeromagnetic survey at 5000 feet which\nwas carried out in 1)81 and the total flight distance was 1685 km. Surveys\nat 1500 feet and 3000 feet were also carried out and the total flight distance\nwas 1120 km and 1325 km, respectively. \t\n\nThe total intensity of the geomagnetic\n\nfield for three different flight elevations of 3000, 5000 and 8000 feet is\ngiven in Fig. A3-2.\t\n\nThese surveys were carried out along the longitude of\n\n39\xc2\xb025\'E from 68\xc2\xb050\'S to 69\xc2\xb040\'S in latitude. As the surveys were done within\na few days, during a magnetically quiet period when K-index was 0-1, no\ncorrection has been made for the intensity values in Fig. A3-2.\nSecular variation of the geomagnetic field at Syowa Station, is given in\nFig. A3-3. The open circles indicate total intensity. The solid line\nindicates second-order least square regression of the observed values, where\nstandard deviation is 37 nT. The shorter broken line gives secular variation \t\ncalculated by the model IGRF(1980). The longer broken line gives similar\nsecular variation by IIGST(4/81).\nUsing the data obtained above, an isomagnetic chart of the total\nintensity is being made, and the analyses are in progress.\n\nt\n\nyi\n\nPage 20\n\nCRIGIN"AL PAGE IS\n\nOF\n\nPOOR QUALITY\n\nB. ELECTRIC CURRENTS AND HYDROMAGNETIC WAVES IN TIE IONOS:\'HERE AND\n\nMAGNETOSPHERE\n{\t\n\'\t\n\nThe objective is to investigate ionospheric and magnetospheric\ncontributions to geomagnetic variations, field-aligned currents, geomagnetic pulsations and hydromagnetic waves b y analysis of MAGSAT data,\nand if necessary also through comparison with ground magnetic variations.\n\nB-1. Ionospheric and Magnetosplieric Contributions to Geomagnetic Variations\nThe MAGSAT data were proved to be very useful in studying the ionospheric\nand magnetospheric contributions to geomagnetic field variations from various\nstandpoints. The main results obtained so far are summarized below.\n\n1. External field correction for satellite magnetic data\nA new conventional method was introduced to learn the features of\nexternal and internal contributions to the data obtained by 14AGSAT\n(Yanagisawa and Fukushima, Memo. B1-1). Let AB denote the difference\nbetween the magnetic field B observed by MAGSAT and that given by the\nMGST(4/81) model. AXmag and ^Z mag of the residual field in geomagnetic\ncoordinates were subjected to a harmonic analysis with Legendre functions\nin the latitude range of 1 55\xc2\xb0, b y means of the equation\nW = a n E l {E n (3) n + I n (a ) n+1 } P n (cosA)\t\n\n(1)\n\nwhere W is the magnetic potential for AB. The analysis was carried out\nfor the dawn and dusk sides separately. The calculated values of external\nand internal coefficients (E n and I n ) of the magnetic potential W are shown\nfor four classes of Dst values in Fig. B1-2 with the total number of data\nused at the right shoulder of each diagram.\nIt is clear in Fig. B1-2 that E 1 increases with the absolute value\nof Dst, whereas E 2 -E 6 are negligibly small in comparison with E 1 in all\t\ncases. This means that the magnetic field of origin external to the MAGSAT\nlevel is well approximated by a simple southward magnetic field along the\ngeomagnetic dipole axis. A noticeable dawn/dusk asymmetry of this southward\nfield is discussed in the next section.\nThe internal component cf AB consists of the induction current within\nthe earth and the electric current flowing in the ionosphere below the\n\ns\n\nPage 21\ni;\'* I^AC ? 15\n\nOF\n\nPOOR QUALITY\n\nMAGSAT level. I 1 seems to increase in approximate proportion to E,, but\nI 1 -I 6 do not change so much with E 1 value. We may assume here that the\nmagnetic field originated from E 1 and 1 1 terms represents the ring current\nfield and its induction effect, and the remaining fields (expecially those\nfrom 1 2 -L 6 ) the ionospheric current as a first approximation.\nFig. B1-3 shows the worldwide Z-anomaly map for (a) the dawn side and\n(b) the dusk side, after removing the MGST(4/81) model and the contributions\nfrom E 1 and L 1 terms. The two maps for the dawn and dusk sides differ considrably from each other because of the contamination from the ionospheric\ncurrent. The latitudinal profiles of Z-anomaly in Fig. B1-3 were averaged\nfor all longitude range, and the average is shown as delta-Z in Fig. B1-4\nwith standard deviations. (Fig. B1-4 confirms the peculiar latitudinal\ndependence of delta-Y found first by Maeda et al. (198\'?), but the discussion\nin this section is confined only to delta-Z for the dawn and dusk meridians.)\nThe mean delta-Z curve in Fig. B1-4 is thought to represent the contribution\nto Z along the dawn and dusk meridians from the ionospheric current dependent\non local time. Subtracting delta:-\'Z of Fig. B1-4 from the Z-anomaly maps\nof Fig. 111-3, we obtain the maps shown in Fig. B1-5, in which the two maps\nfor the dawn and dusk meridians are nearly the sane as each other.\nIn conclusion, it is shown that the magnetospheric contribution is\nWell represented by a simple southward field with a noticeable dawn/dusk\nasymmetry. The elimination of the ionospheric contributions (coming from\nbelow the MAGSAT level) gives a common anomaly map in the dawn and dusk\nregions.\n\n2. Dawn-dusk asymmetry of the ring current field\nThe values of coefficient E 1 (which represents the southward magnetic\nfield of magnetospheric origin) in eq. (1) of the previous section are\ncalculated for 26 days from November 2 to 27, 1979, and shown in Fig. B1-6\n(Yanagisawa and Fukushima, Memo. B1-2), together with the simultaneous\nDst and Kp values. The E 1 values generally vary in close correlation with \t\nDst, but they exhibit sometimes pronounced dawn/dusk asymmetry (enhancement\nat the dusk side, and a reduction at the dawn side), especilliv when Dst\nand Kp values are great. This tendency is seen in Fig. B1-7, which\ndemonstrates that the dawn/dusk asymmetry of E 1 values is noticeable for\nKpz3 - , but almost absent for Kp-.2+.\n\n!\n\nPage 22\nORIGINAL WAGE t3\nOF pOGR QUALITY\n\nThe quantitative relationship between E 1 and Dst values on the dawn\nand dusk sides is shown in Fig. B1-8 with the empirical formulae, which\ndemonstrate the dawn-dusk asymmetry of E 1 -Dst relationship but with nearly\nthe same offset value of 22-23 nT for Dst=O.\nSince the ground Dst contains also the contribution from the induced\nelectric current within the earth, which is a main part of I 1 in eq. (1),\nthe comparison of E 1 + i t versus Dst was also made and is shown in Fig.\nB1-9. From this figure we see that the average empirical formula for the\ndawn and dusk sides is E 1 + I 1 = -1.0 Dst + 24.\nA comparison of the results observed by OGO-5 (Sugiura, 1973) and\nMAGSAT was made to infer the -ing current flow in the magnetosphere. OGO-5\nobserved the minimum fielu depression at 2.3-3.6 R E . The empirical formulae\nare\nE1 (at OGO-5 level) _ -0.83 Dst + 45 nT,\nE 1 (at ;UGSAT level) _ -0.74 Dst + 22 nT,\nso that\t\n\nE 1 (MAGSAT) = 0.89 E 1 (OGO) - 18 nT.\n\nThe factor 0.89 in the last equation will be attributable to the difference\nin geocentric distance of the observation level of MAGSAT (\')1 R E ) and OGO\n(2.3-3.6 R E ). If we represent the ring current by a simple circular linecurrent, the factor 0.89 is obtained if the line current is assumed to\nbe situated around 8 R E . On the other hand, the difference of 18 nT between\nE 1 (MAGSAT) and 0.89 E 1 (OGO) will be reasonably attributed to an eastward\nring current, which must exist in the inner edge of the westward ring current\nregion to keep the plasma pressure of tripped charged particles in the\nmagnetosphere. If the inner eastward current is also represented by a\nsimple line-current at 2 R E , the current intensity is 3 . 10 5 A, which\nis not an unreasonable vaLu= (Yanagisawa and Fukushima, Memo. B1-3).\n\n3. Electric current through the plane encircled by the MAGSAT orbit\nIt is possible to calculate the total amount of electric current\npassing through the plane enclosed by the MAGSAT orbit by means of Ampere\'s\ntheorem (or integrated form of a Maxwell equation) shown in Fig. B-10, where\nos is a differential segment along the satellite orbit, and B t is the\nmagnetic field component tangential to the satellite orbit. The electric\ncurrent will be reasonably thought to flow in a way shown in the figure,\ni.e. as field-aligned current in the magnetosphere, and as horizontal\ncurrent in the ionosphere.\n\now\xe2\x80\x94\nPage 23\nORIGINAL PAGE [5\nOF POOR QUALITY\n\nAttention must be paid in this analysis to the fact that MAGSAT\nrequires 94 minutes to complete the magnetic field measurement over a\ncomplete circular path, and the earth rotates as much as 23.5\xc2\xb0 eastward\nunder the MAGSAT orbit. This condition will result in a spurious effect\non the calculated current under the MAGSAT orbit, unless the effect of\nthe earth\'s rotation is corrected.\nWe dealt with two kinds of B t -calculations, i.e. (a) MAGSAT orbit is\nfixed in the coordinate system, the earth is rotating, and (b) the earth\nis fixed, MLNGSAT orbit plane is shifting. The calculated total current J\nis denoted here as (Suzuki et al., Memo. 131-4)\nJ(I) with MAGSAT data, and J(II) with MGST(4/81) model in case (a),\nJ(III) with MAGSAT data, and J(IV) with MGST(4/81) model in case (b).\nIn the calculation in (b), the integraLion must be completed at the crosspoint of the two successive loci of the satellite (cross-point between\nT 1 and T 2 in Fig. B1-11), and B t must be taken tangential to the loci of\nMAGSAT orbits projected onto the earth (not parallel to the MAGSAT path\nin space). In a previous paper by Suzuki and Fukushima (1982), B t was\nteken always tangential to the MAGSAT orbit in space, so that the results\nincluded a spurious effect due to the earth\'s rotation. As to J(IV), the\nintegration is for a static magnetic field derivable from a magnetic\npotential, so that J(IV) must vanish theoretically. The actual result\nshowed that the total current is less than 3 . 10 5 A on a quiet day, and\nsuch an amount can be produced from a very small error in the absolute\nmagnetic field measurement and/or in the altitude determination of MAGSAT.\nFor example, the accumulation of 1 nT error in the absolute value of Bt\nresults in a total current of 4 . 10 4 A. An altitude error of only 150 m\nwill produce a total electric current of 10 5 A.\nSuzuki and Fukushima (1982) published the preliminary results of their\nanalysis. They compared the B t -integrations with the actual MAGSAT data\nand with the MGST( A /81) model field, as shown in Fig. B1-12. The both\nintegrals showed the total current of 4 . 10 6 A in magnitude with predominant\nsemidiurnal variation, and the difference of these two calculations was\nassumed to indicate the electric current in space below the MAGSAT level.\nHowever, the authors would like to revise their conclusion in this report\nbecause of criticism of the method of calculation described above.\nThe J(I)-J(II) calculation for a quiet day, that of November 5, 1979, in\nFig. 81-13(a) in nearly the same as that of the right diagram of Fig. B1-12\n\nPage 24\nGRI UNAL PAGE 14\nPOOR QUALITY\n\nOF\n\n(which is a reproduction from the Suzuki-Fukushima paper (1982), but with a\nslight correction on the previous work). This result contains a spurious\neffect of the earth\'s rotation. The apparent semi-diurnal variations of\nthe sunward or anti-sunward electric current in space below the MAGSAT\nlevel is now understood mainly as an effect from g2-term of the earth\'s\nmagnetic field (a paper for this interpretation is now in preparation).\ni\nThe reduction of semi-diurnal amplitude in the right diagram, with actual\nMAGSAT data in Fig. B1-12, in comparison with the middle diagram, with the\nMCST(4/81) model, will be due to an induction current in the ionosphere\nbelow the MAGSAT level, which flows to reduce the effect of the earth\'s\nrotation in a conducting medium. If the ionosphere were a perfect conductor,\nthe UT dependence of the curve in the left diagram of Fig. B1-12 should\nvanish.\nOn the other hand, in the results of the J(III) calculation in Fig. B1-13\n(b) on the same day of November 5, 1979, the total intensity of space current\nbelow the MAGSAT level is much smaller, i.e. less than 10 6 A. We are\ncontinuing the calculation of J(ITI) for many other days during the period\nof the MAGSAT flight in order to find or check the dependence of sunward or\nanti-sunward space current below the MGSAT level on (i) universal time,\n(ii) geomagnetic activity, (iii) solar wind and interplanetary magnetic\nfield conditions, and (iv) season. At this moment, we can show only one\nexample, that is on a disturbed day, November 13-14, 1979. As is shown in\nFig. B1-14, the space current under the MAGSAT orbit is anti-sunward in the\ndisturbed condition with its magnitude far exceeding 10 6 A in approximate\nproportion to the geomagnetic AE-index.\n7t was described in section B-1-2 that the dawn/dusk asymmetry of\nDst iF pronounced when the AE-index is large. Hence we may conclude that the\nincrease in the AE-index is accompanied by both the dawn/dusk Dst-Asymmetry\nand the intensification of anti-sunward space current below the MAGSAT\nlevel. For the disturbed condition, a schematic picture of Fig. B1-15 will\nemerge, which includes a partial ring current connected with the fieldaligned currents in the magnetosphere and the Pedersen current in the \t\nionosphere. Such a current system was proposed earlier by Fukushima and\nKamide (1973). Although the Hall current is more important for the auroral\nelectrojet, it is not shown in the schematic diagram of Fig. B1-15, because\nthe Hall current does not contribute at all to the net space current below\nthe MGSAT level because of its divergence-free flow within the ionosphere.\nIt must be emphasized here that the anti-sunward Pedersen current will\n\nIt\n\nPage 25\n\nORIGINAL pale\nOF POOR QUALI1`1f\ncontribute to the el.ectrojet along the auroral oval, although the auroral\nelectrojet is mainly due to the Hall current in the ionosphere.\n\n4. Geoma g netic Derturbations at low latitudes due to electric currents\nin the ionosphere and magnetosphere (Maeda et al., Memo. B1-5)\nF\' g. B1-16 shows the average perturbations (AH, AD, AZ and AF; observed\n;\nvalue\t\n\ni;inus the\t\n\nMGST(4/81) model) at low latitudes between 30\xc2\xb0N and\n\n30\xc2\xb0S. The difference in the observed results at dawn and dusk meridians\nis noteworthy, especially for Z, which was discussed in detail in a paper\nby Maeda et al. (1982).\t\n\n(The latitudinal profile in Fig. B1-16 is similar\n\nto that shown in Fig. B1-4, but it must be remarked that the abscissa and\nordinate of the two figures are drawn in opposite sense to each other, and\nthe period of data used is also different. Furthermore, Fig. B1-4 eliminates\nthe c, ,,itribution from the ring current effect.)\nThe average latitudinal profile of AD over 270\xc2\xb0-320\xc2\xb0 meridians is\nshown in Fig. B1-17, where the contours of equal AD values are indicated.\nWe notice here that the peculiar 4D at dusk exists at altitudes lower than\nabout 450 km centered at 8\xc2\xb0N and 8\xc2\xb0S in dip latitudes. There is another\nregion of ^D centered at clip latitude 5 0 N, at a height of about 500 km. If the\ncontour lines of equal AD are approximately regarded as stream lines of\nthe electric current in the ionosphere-magnetosphere, the electric current\nin the meridian plane flows across the geomagnetic field-lines indicated\nby dotted lines in Fig. B1-17.\nFig. B1-18 shows the latitudinal profile of M at various longitudes\nand the double amplitude (:IDn + .\'CDs) is shown to be proportional to 1/B,\nwhere B is the magnetic field intensity at the Gip equator. The altitude\ndependence of the ^D range is shown in Fig. B1-19; the range increases\nwith decreasing altitude, from 8 nT at 500 km to 40 nT at 300 km.\nThe peculiar AD on both sides of the magnetic equator seems to\nbe caused by a meridional current system in the ionosphere shown in Fig. \t\n\nt\nB1-20, i.--. upward at the magnetic equator. The fact that the AD range\nis proportional to 1/B (in Fig. B1-18) and to the sunspot number (in Fig.\nB1\xe2\x80\xa221) will support the ionospheric origin of AD anomaly. Takeda and Maeda\n(in preparation) have recently carried out a calculation of F-region dynamo\ndriven by pressure gradient in the evening, and obtained such a current\nsystem as that of Fig. 81-20. The electric currents flowing from or toward\n\nPage 26\nC RIG!NA; PArE iS\nOF PUCR QUALITY\n\nthe equator are not field-aligned but flow across the magnetic field-lines.\nThe meridioral currents in the dusk region in the F region have never been\nfound in the past, in contrast to the detection by rockets for the noon\nequatorial E region.\nA shift of the base line in AD seen in Fig. B1-16 (positive at dusk\nand negative at dawn) may be due to field-aligned currents from the northern\n(winter) hemisphere to the southern (summer) hemisphere in the evening\nand in the opposite sense in the morning; a numerical calculation by Takeda\n(1982) for a dynamo with NS-as y mmetr y seems to support this interpretation.\nFig. B1-22 shows the comparison of AH at dawn and dusk observed by\nMAGSAT with the ground Dst index, and Fig. B1-23 shows a good correlation\nbetween the dawn/dusk asymmetry with the AE-index. (The dawn/dusk asymmetry\nwith geomagnetic activity was also shown in Fig. B1-6 and 7.). The dawn/dusk\nasymmetry of AH and its good correlation with the AE index seem to support\nthe picture of current flow in the ionosphere and magnetosphere shown in\nFig. Bl-15, i.e. the presence of partial ring current and the contribution\nof anti-sunward :.arrent in the ionosphere to the auroral electrojet.\n\n5. Sudden commencement of magnetic storms observed by MAGSAT\nFrom the analysis of ground ma;netograms, Araki (1917) inferred the\npresence of the following three kinds of electric currents flowing in the\nionosphere during a sudden commencement (SC) of magnetic storms, i.e. (1)\nWestward zonal current induced by a sudden compression of the magnetosphere\nassociated with an eastward current at the magnetopause; (2) Twin-vortex\ncurrent for tht! preLi.minary reverse impulse on the ground, which will be\nattributable to a dusk-to-dawn electric field in the polar region; and\n\n(3) Twin -vortex type current due to a dawli-to-eusk electric field which\ndevelops after SC.\nSince MAGSAT was making an accurate three-component measurement of\nthe geomagnetic field above the ionosphere, it was expected to detect these\ncurrents flowing in the ionosphere through the comparison of MAGSAT and\nground data, because the current flowing in the ionosphere produces a\nmagne is field in an upposite Manse at the MAGSAT level and on the ground.\nThis section describes the real existence of currents (1) and (2) reported\nby Araki et al. (Memo. BL-6), although it was partly published in a paper\nb y Araki et al. (1982). Unfortunately, it was impossible to check current (3),\n\npage 27\n\nOF. p0GR QUAUTlf\n\nbecause the MAGSAT records suffered from high-latitude disturbances\nsoon after the SC\'s ."ncerned.\nTwenty-two SC\'s were observed according to the Solar Ceophysical Data\n(edite by J.V. Lincoln, published by WDC-A for STP, NOAH) during the MAGSAT\nobservation period of November 2, 1979 - May 17, 1980, Araki et al. (Memo.\nB1-6) examined 21 cases of SC\'s out of 22 cases.\nIn low latitudes, MAGSAT detected SC mainly in 11-component with a\nslightly greater amplitude (average value 1,3) in comparison with the ground\nSC data. In high latitudes, MAGSAT detected SC ir, both H- and D-components,\nbut their amplitude is rot always measurable (especially of latitudes higher\nthan 60\xc2\xb0) because of the contamii.atior. form polar disturbance. The larger\namplitude of the H-component SC at the MAGSAT altitude to that on the ground\nwill be due to a westward shiel-A ing current at the time of SC. The Zcomponent shows no significant change at the time of SC.\nA detailed case study w:.s made for two large SC\'s observed on November\n30, 1979, at a low latitude, and on March 19, 1980, at a high latitude.\nFig. B1-24 shows the SC on November 30, 1979, observed by MAGSAT at\n.he altitude of 550 km at 26.5\xc2\xb0S, 30.3\xc2\xb0W over the South Atlantic Ocean\nand on the ground (Hermanus in South Africa, Trelew in Argentina and its\nconjugate point Sam Juan in Puerto Rico). This SC showed a preliminary\nreverse impulse (PRI) in D-component, and MAGSAT recorded an eastward\ndeviation with its maximum magnitude of 10 nT within 3 minutes after the\nSC. A worldwide equi,,alent overhead current-system for this PRI is drawn\nfrom the ground data in Fig. B1-25 for the northern hemisphere, assuming\nthat the current flow is symmetric with respect t\xe2\x80\xa2, the geomagnetic equator.\nAt Eusebio (3.9\xc2\xb0S, 58.4\xc2\xb0W) in Brazil (+5.6\xc2\xb0 geomag. lat.), a ground station\nclose proximity to MAGSAT at the time of SC, the overhead current responsible for AD of PRi was northward. If the symmetry of the PRI current\nis assumed, AD of PRI at the ground subsatellite point of MAGSAT must have\nbeen eastwarc. Since a westward AD of PRI was observes; by MAGSAT, Araki\net al. (1982) concluded that the case of SC on November 30, 1979, was the\nfirst experimental evidence of the global ionos p heric current-system for \t\nPRI of SC.\nAnother example of SC with PEI is shown in Fig. B1-26, which took\nplace on March 19, 1980, when MAGSAT was passing over Magadan (60.0\xc2\xb0N,\n151.0\xc2\xb0E) in east Siberia. The D-component at MAGSAT first decreased by\n43 nT in about 2 minutes and recovered to the original level.

AB\xe2\x80\x9e is very useful in discussing the contribution from electric\ncurrents flowing in the ionosphere of entranced electric oncductivity during\nmagnetic storms, because the MAGSAT altitude is low enough to detect the\ninfluence of Hall current that attenuates steeply with height.\n+\t\n\nIn this report a new result of analysis is described, which dealt\nwith the field-aligned current distribution over the polar-cap region for\nan extremely quiet period when the interplanetary magnetic field was northward\nwith a magnetiude as large as 5-20 nT. Such an interesting case has never\nbeen reported, so that the present report introduces new knowledge on the\ndependence of field-aligned current patterns on solar wind conditions.\nFig. B2-1 shows two examples of the latitudinal profile of the residueal\nmagnetic field i_n the northern hemisphere on Ma y 10, 1980. As is usual\nwith quiet days, the locations of\t\n\ngions 1 and 2 were several degrees\n\nhigher in comparison with disturbed da y s; Region 1 currents were detected\nat 75.5-79.5\xc2\xb0 invariant latitude on the dawn side and at 74.9-78.4\xc2\xb0 on\nthe dusk side. The most striking feature on this quiet day is the large\nperturbations observed poleward of Region 1 with a fairly large amplitude\nof AB\xe2\x80\x9e or AF. Two examples of the observed characteristics during consecutive\npaths of MAGSAT in Fig. B2-2 show the presence of upward current in the\nmorning region and downward current in the afternoon region.\t\n\nThe intensity\n\nof this field-aligned current confined to the region above 80\xc2\xb0 latitude\nwas 1.7 times the Region 1 current intensity, and the current dirEction\nis opposite to Region 1 current. The concurrent AB\xe2\x80\x9e or AF observed by\nMAGSAT indicates the presence of a twin-vortex horizontal current confined\nto the polar-cap region, with an anti-sunward current over the geomagnetic\np,-le that is opposite to the ordinary Sq current (Iijima et al., Memo. B2-1).\nThe results of analysis of ground magnetograms at 8 high-latitude\nstations also support the above conclusion. The overhead current arrows\nfor the horizontal geomagnetic variation (deviation from the mean level\nbetween 2100-0300 MLT of May 10-11, 1980) in high latitudes in Fig. B2-3\nclearly show the existe;,ce of a reversed S q current near the geomagnetic\npole. This is further confirmed by Fig. B2-4, which shows the simultaneous\ngeomagnetic variation of AZ, namely positive in the region of a counterc1ockwise ionospLeric current, a,.., negative a the region of a clockwise\ncurrent in Fig. B2-3.\nAlthough the occasional appearance of a reversed S p current near the\ngeomagnetic pole has been advocated by Iwasaki (1971), Maezawa (1916) and\n\nPage 30\nQF POOR QUALITY\nothers from a comprehensive analysis of ground magnetograms at high-latitude\nobservatories during the period of northward interplanetary magnetic field,\nthe case on Ma y 10, 1980 is the first evidence for such a current in the\nionosphere revealed in the\n\nMAGSAT\n\ndata.\n\nB-3. Geomagnetic Pulsations and H y droma netic Waves\nIt was planned, when the Japanese\n\nMAGSAT\n\nTeam presented its proposal in\n\nFebruar y 1979, to study short-period hydromagnetic waves in the earth\'s environmental space through spectral anal y ses of geomagnetic fluctuations observed by\nKNGSAT\n\nand simultaneous data on the ground. However the team members for this\n\nitem had to fulfil other obligations during 1980-82, so the this subject remains a task for the future. We hope, however, that a number of interesting results\nwill came out in the near future after comparing the MAGSAT data and other simultaneous data,such as geomagnetic. VI.F wave and auroral observations at various\nplaces in high latitudes.\n\nReferences (except for the memoranda listed on Page 3)\n\nAbe, K., and H.
