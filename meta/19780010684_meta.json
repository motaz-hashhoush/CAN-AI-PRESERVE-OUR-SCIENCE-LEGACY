These programs include basic research in the description of these phenomena and applied research in their prediction and potential beneficial modification. NHEML is partitioned into four working groups. Two important and logical parts of the research programs are the experimental program in hurricane modification (STORMFURY) and the program in cumulus modification (FACE). The ultimate goal of STORMFURY is the reduction of the maximum winds associated with the eyewall of hurricanes; the goal of FACE is to acquire a thorough understanding of cumulus cloud behavior that will enable NHEML to increase precipitation from cumulus clouds. The operational structure of NHEML and related agencies are presented.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19780010684, "id": "1f2cd4bce36f46029049e28941af25dd", "publicationDate": "1977-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19780010684.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19780010684/downloads/19780010684.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19780010684/downloads/19780010684.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19780010684/downloads/19780010684.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
