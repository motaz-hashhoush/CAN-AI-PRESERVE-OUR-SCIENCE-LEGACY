The needed measurements\nare pressure, atmospheric temperatures, moisture content and\nwind velocity at various altitudes on regular, periodic\nschedules over the entire Earth.\nAt present, mathematical models that simulate the\nstructure and circulation of the atmosphere are under\ndevelopment.\nScientists already have numerical methods for longterm Integration of the governing thermo-hydrodynamical \'.\'.\'"\xe2\x80\xa2\nequations, electronic computers for carrying out the\ncalculations, and some understanding of the physics of the\nheating processes which produce the large-scale motions.\nNimbus B will be the first U.S. weather satellite to\nmake global observations of temperature over extended\nperiods which will provide improved meteorological Information\nfor experimental weather predictions with new mathematical\nmodels. \xe2\x80\xa2\n. .\n.\n\'\n\xe2\x80\xa2\'.\'\'\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\'\n\n-more-\n\n-16A National Academy of Sciences study has indicated that\nmeteorologists may be able to make reliable weather predictions\'\nfor major frontal systems as much as -two weeks in advance by\nusing global information gathered from satellite and conventional meteorological observing systems.\nOceanography\nThe oceans affect weather, transportation and the world\'s;\nsupply of food. Nearly all the moisture in rain clouds originates in the sea. More than 95 per cent of the cargo transported overseas goes by ship. The transfer of heat, moslture\nand momentum at the air-water interface is of fundamental importance to meteorologists. The ocean is a significant sburpe\nof food protein, not only directly for man but for the land\nanimals ultimately consumed by man.\nThe Nimbus B2 IRLS experiment is one method of communication between the satellite in space and buoys in the oceans.\nMoored and floating buoys (about four initially) will be\nin the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Participants in the buoy\nexperiment are the Naval OceanOgraphic Office, the Bureau of\nCommercial Fisheries and Woods Hole Oceanographlc Institution.-,While research ships will still be needed, sensors and\ndata collection equipment aboard the Nimbus satellite can\ncover all the oceans with great speed and economy.\nSatellites will be able to sample only the top few hundred\n\'feet, or about one per cent of the ocean\'s depth, but this\nportion is most important to the fishing and shipping industries,\nand coastal activities.\nIce Pack Reconnaissance\nThe Arctic Ocean and surrounding seas, as well as the\narea bounding the Antarctic continent, are seasonally or\nperennially covered with sea ice, but weather scientists do\nnot know enough about the properties, distribution, variability\nand behavior of the sea ice in these areas.\nIce and icebergs in remote areas could be covered by a\nspacecraft to furnish information for meteorological services,\nice patrols and the shipping industries.\n\n-more-\n\n-17-\n\nNIMBUS B2 METEOROLOGICAL EXPERIMENTS\nThe Nimbus B2 will carry seven weather-measuring instruments, including Infrared Interferometer Spectrometer (IRIS),\nSatellite Infrared Spectrometer (SIRS), Interrogation Recording and Locations System (IRLS), High Resolution Infrared\nRadiometer (HRIR), Medium Resolution Infrared Radiometer (MRIR),\nMonitor of Ultraviolet Solar Energy (MUSE) and a daytime camera,\nImage Disector Camera (IDC).\nThe daytime camera and infrared radiometers are line scan\nsystems. Each will generate one complete global picture daily.\nThe other four instruments are being satellite-tested for\nthe first time.\npect:\nInfrared Interferometer Spectrometer\nExperimenter:Dr. Rudolph H. Hanel, Qoddard\nh\nThis experiment will measure globally, the temperature\nfrom top to bottom in the atmosphere, together with water vapor\ncontent and ozone distribution. The 35-pound sensor will also\nprovide data on gases In the atmosphere such as carbon dioxide,\nNitrous oxide (N2Q).\xc2\xbb and methane (CHij.).\nOperating in the infrared spectral region, from 6 to 20\nmicrons (thousandths of a meter), IRIS will measure emitted\nradiation for determining temperature and ozone up to 15-mile\naltitudes, and water vapor up to 6 miles.\nAn important IRIS measurement will be the ozone distribution because ozone, normally found in the upper part of the\nEarth\'s atmosphere coverings absorbs incoming solar and outgoing Infrared radiation. It thus has an effect on the Earth\'s\nheat balance and on meteorological phenomena.\nThis instrument, with a 100-mlle-diameter field of view,\nis a Michelspn interferometer. IRIS analyzes the infrared\nspectrum radiated from the Earth\'s surface, or cloud tops,\nalong the orbital path. During each 11-second viewing\ninterval, image motion compensation corrects for spacecraft\ntravel.\nA computer compares the computed spectra with ideal black\nbody curves conforming to Planck\'s radiation formula. Thus,\nthe basic source temperature and the local departures at\nvarious wave lengths are established. Thereby, the atmospheric\ncomposition, cloud height and other parameters may be determined,\nThe IRIS was built for NASA by Texas Instruments,\nDallas.\n-more-\n\nInc.,\n\n-17a-\n\n-m\n\n-\n\n. \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2-\n\n- - ;. -\n\n-is- -\n\n\' . \xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2.-\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSatellite- Infrared Sjpectrpmeter\nExperimenter: t)r.

This can be accomplished\nby comparing the radiation pictures obtained in the atmospheric window channel and the two water vapor channels.\nThe patterns of water vapor distribution and of cirrus\nclouds resulting from such a comparison are closely related to\nthe dynamics of the atmosphere.\nThe 21-pound MRIR, a five channel radiometer, is designed\nto measure:\n* Water vapor absorption \xe2\x80\x94 this band, at 6.5 to 7.0\nmicrons, provides information on water vapor distribution.\nThe energy observed in this channel is connected with the\nrelative humidity of the upper atmosphere.\n* Atmospheric window \xe2\x80\x94 measures the temperature of the\nEarth in the 10-11 micron band where the atmosphere is transparent. These measurements provide information on the Earth\'s\nsurface temperature in the absence of clouds or cloud top\ntemperatures. In addition, maps showing equal lines or radiant\nemittance can be interpreted as cloud cover maps offering a\nbackup to daytime and Infrared pictures.\n* Stratospheric temperatures \xe2\x80\x94 this band, at 14-16 microns,\nprovides a measurement of the temperatures in the lower\nstratosphere by measuring the emission from the carbon dioxide\nabsorption band.\n* Water vapor absorption \xe2\x80\x94 this 20-23 micron band provides information on atmospheric structure and water vapor\ndistribution. The energy observed in this channel provides\ninformation on the relative humidity of the lower and middle\nsections of the atmosphere.\n* Albedo radiation \xe2\x80\x94 provides measurements of solar\nenergy levels in the visible and near infrared bands at 0.2 to\n4.0 microns.\nThe MRIR was built by the Santa Barbara Research Center,\nSanta Barbara, Calif., a subsidiary of Hughes Aircraft Co.\n-more-\n\n-23Monitor of Ultraviolet Solar Energy (MUSE)\nExperimenter: Dr. Donald I*.

The SNAP program is directed at development of\ngenerators and reactors for use in space, on land and in the sea.\nNimbus B2 will mark the first use of a nuclear power system on\na NASA spacecraft, although systems of this type have been used on\nNavy navigational satellites. (The SNAP-19 system is the same\none installed on the Nimbus B satellite.)\nWhile the SNAP-19 is not the primary power system for\nB2, this test flight is considered a logical and necessary\nand a major milestone in the development and acceptance of\nlived, highly reliable isotope power systems for space use\n\nNimbus\nstep\nlongby NASA.\n\nThe characteristics of nuclear subsystems for a future\noperational satellite will be assessed and up to 50 watts of\nadditional power will be available to supplement Nimbus B2\'s\nsolar cell power system. It is expected that the output of the\nsolar power system will be decreased by space radiation and\nother factors in three months to a level below that required for\nspacecraft housekeeping and simultaneous operation of all on-board\nmeteorological experiments. The additional power provided by the\nSNAP-19 will permit full spacecraft operation for more than a\nyear. In addition, the SNAP-19 power may be of special importance\nby providing power continuously in the event of a malfunction of\nthe solar power system.\nDescription\nThe basic SNAP-19 unit is a 25-watt generator fueled with\nthe radio-isotope plutonium-238. The chemically inert fuel is\ncontained in a rugged 6-X 3-inch cylindrical capsule in the\ncenter of the generator. Each fueled generator weighs about 28\npounds, is 11 inches high and 22 inches in diameter including\nheat-radiating fins.\nTwo SNAP-19 generators will be mounted in tandem on the\nNimbus B2 satellite. They will provide about 50 net watts of\nelectrical power. This power is in addition to the approximate\n211 watts to be provided by the satellite\'s large solar cell\npaddles.\n\n-more-\n\n-24a-\n\n-25Operatlon\nIn the generator, the spontaneous radioactive decay of the\nplutonlum-23o generates heat. Thermoelectric elements convert\nthis heat directly Into electrical energy. There are no\nmoving parts.\nAdvantages and Applications\nNuclear power is considered essential to the development\nof a long-lived, highly reliable, rugged, relatively small and\nlightweight electrical system for a variety of space applications\nIncluding Earth orbital satellites, lunar missions and probes to\ndistant planets. Present long-life spacecraft power systems\ndepend on the use of solar cells for generating power for direct\nuse and for recharging chemical batteries. Ever-Increasing\npower requirements, however, are creating difficult problems in\nthe design of increasingly larger solar cell panels and associated\nbattery storage systems. Additionally, nuclear power sources\nwould be required for any exploratory missions travelling great\ndistances outward from the Sun. The size of solar cells required\nfor such missions would be too large to be practical.\nA SNAP generator has the potential of supplying many watts of\nelectricity for several years. Since the operation of a SNAP\ngenerator does not depend on exposure to the Sun, only a minimal\nstorage battery system is needed for spacecraft operation. The\nisotope power source is a rugged device in comparison to solar\ncells and is significantly less susceptible to radiation and heat\ndamage.\nHeat Source and Safety Considerations\nThe unique properties of plutonium-238 make it an excellent\nisotope for use in space nuclear generators. At the end of\nalmost 90 years plutonium-238 is still supplying half of its\noriginal heat. Since, in the decay process, plutonium-238\nemits mainly the nuclei of helium, a very mild type of radiation,\nthe generator which houses the fuel requires no shielding and\nthus avoids a weight penalty for radiation protection of the\nspacecraft hardware.\nThe Nimbus B2 satellite will be placed in a 600-mile-high\npolar orbit and will remain in orbit for about 1,600 years, by\nwhich time essentially all of the plutonium-238 will have been\n1\nconsumed through the radioactive decay process.\nThe fuel form in the SNAP system Is biologically inert and represents no health hazard to people or marine life, and in most\nabort cases it will be contained within its capsules.\n-more-\n\n-26Before the use of the SNAP-19 system was authorized, a\nthorough review was conducted to assure that no undue health\nhazards existed to anyone involved in the launch or to the\ngeneral public.\nFor this review, extensive tests were conducted which\ndemonstrated that the fuel would be safely contained under all\naccident conditions.\nIn the\nremained in\nmonths and,\ndegradation\n\nabort of the Nimbus B last May, the fuel capsules\nsea water at a depth of 300 feet for about five\nas expected, there was no release of fuel or\nof the capsules.\n\nDevelopment of SNAP Radioisotope Program\nThe first significant step in the SNAP isotopic power\nprogram was SNAP-3. This proof-of-principle device was introduced to the world by President Eisenhower in 1959.\nThe first isotopic space generator was put into service\non June 29, 1961. The grapefruit-sized, five-pound, 2.7 watt\ngenerator, designated SNAP-3A*, was launched on a Navy navigational satellite to supplement the satellite\'s solar power.\nThe SNAP-3A generator marked its sixth anniversary last June.\nAt that time it had operated one year beyond its five-year\ndesign life. The satellite is still signaling intermittently\nto tracking stations around the world.\nThe AEG subsequently developed an advanced type of radioisotope thermoelectric generator \xe2\x80\x94 designated SNAP-9A \xe2\x80\x94 which\nweighs about 25 pounds and generates 20 watts of power. SNAP-9A\ngenerators provided all of the power for two Navy navigational\nsatellites launched in 1963.\nThe SNAP radiolsotope program has brought forth new technology which has resulted in the use of radioisotopes as\nsources of compact, reliable, long-lived power on land, on sea\nand in space. SNAP generators have operated, are now operating,\nor will operate in offshore oil platforms, weather stations,\nacoustic beacons, lighthouses, navigational and weather satellites,\nlunar experiments, deep sea and ocean bottom projects and other\npotential manned and unmanned space projects.\n* SNAP radioisotopic devices are designated by odd\nnumbers, reactors by even.\n-more-\n\n-27Contractors for SNAP-19\nIsotopes Inc., Nuclear Systems Division.

Nimbus B,\nlaunched in May of 1968, never achieved orbit because the\nrocket veered off course and had to be destroyed by the Range\nSafety Officer.\nTwo Nimbus experimental satellites took about 1-million\ncloud-cover pictures of the Earth. The day and night (infrared)\npictures produced from these two observatories have given\nmeteorologists a look at the Earth\'s cloud cover never before\npossible.\nMeteorology\nMeteorologists single out the APT camera (which provides\ninstant weather pictures to small ground stations anywhere)\nas the "single most significant contribution to meteorology\nin the past twenty years."\nMore than 400 APT stations are now scattered around the\nworld. In many parts of the world APT pictures are the major,\nand in some cases the only weather information source.\nA number of private users in the United States and\nnumerous foreign countries have built their own receivers\nand facsimile machines .at costs ranging from several hundred\nto several thousand dollars.\nMany of the world\'s large airports have APT pictures\nfor commercial pilots to study before a flight. Pilots can\nsee what the weather is currently like, during the day or at\nnight, from New York to London, or San Francisco to Tokyo,\nbefore taking off.\n,\nNimbus II demonstrated, for the first time, that infrared\npictures could be read out live" on simple APT ground equipment ,\nProbably the most significant results from Nimbus\nsatellites have been their ability to identify and track known\nmeteorological phenomena such as hurricanes and typhoons, extratropical cyclones arid frontal systems on a daily global basis,\nparticularly during night time (infrared).\nStorm system photographs have stimulated new studies\nand new approaches to determining the morphology and life\nhistory of storms.\n-more-\n\n-29The radiation measurements obtained with Nimbus II\'s\nMedium Resolution Infrared Radiometer (MRIR) experiment\nrender the best satellite observations yet of the vertical\nstructure of the lower atmosphere.\nRadiation measurements in the water vapor channel (6.4 6.9 microns) permit inferences of the total water vapor content in the upper atmosphere and atmospheric dynamics.\nThese moisture patterns provide the best means yet to\nmap, from a satellite, large scale stratospheric circulation\nand the course of Jet streams.\nProm HRIR and MRIR data, meteorologists have been able\nto observe the course and Intensity of .the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) as manifested by cloud formations girdling\nthe globe near the Equator.\nA typical set of infrared pictures was taken June 5, 1966,\nbetween 30 degrees North latitude and 30 degrees South latitude,\nAlthough activity was relatively weak on this day, the course\nof the ITCZ was followed around the entire globe.\nPictures showed that the ITCZ generally follows the 10\ndegree North latitude parallel except over the Indian Ocean\nand Africa, where it dips down to the Equator. It is most\nintense over India arid Indonesia and all but disappears over\nportions of the Pacific. Some lesser intensifications occur\nover Africa and South America. Over the Central Pacific, an\ninteresting splitting into two narrow bands occurs.\nOceanography\nIt has been possible at night under certain cloud-free\nconditions to detect areas of sharp temperature contrast, such\nas currents and upwelllng, from Nimbus HRIR photographs.\nA study on large scale fluctuations of the Gulf Stream\nwas based on Nimbus infrared pictures. Under cloudless skies\nthe northern boundary of the Gulf Stream between Cape Hatteras\nand 60 degrees West was identified by the contrasting gray\ntones on pictures over several months.\nNimbus Infrared data were compared with information\ncollected by a ship. Although a degree of uncertainty in\nboundary location arises from distortion in the satellite\nphotos, comparisons suggest that continuity can be established.\nThe Gulf Stream boundary was seen on Nimbus photos in\nabout 50 cases. Other ocean current boundaries and pronounced\nsea-surface temperature patterns, such as the Falkland and Brazil Current discontinuity, the Agulhas Current and the Kurohsio\nCurrent could be seen from Nimbus infrared photographs.\n-more-\n\n-30-\n\nIn one single infrared photo, oceanographers were able\nto trace the meandering path of the Gulf Stream for 1,000\nmiles.\nIce Pack Reconnaissance\nHigh resolution television cameras and infrared radiometers\non Nimbus were able to "photograph" an iceberg in the Weddell 1\nSea. This is the first known case in which an iceberg has been\nphotographed from a satellite over the Arctic or Antarctic.\nThe iceberg was an estimated 71 miles long and 20 miles\nwide.\nAnother series of Nimbus II pictures showed a southward\ndrift of an individual iceberg along the Greenland coast over\na six-week period. Progress was observed regularly as it\nfollowed the major East Greenland Current.\nBy such satellite photography, circulation and sea ice drift\nmeasurements are possible, adding new knowledge in the study\nof the central Arctic environment.\nNimbus II, regularly .covering the Antarctic areas,\npresented possibilities for mapping extremely remote areas\nwhere conventional techniques are at best difficult and expensive.\nNimbus pictures of the Weddell Sea regions depict a\nsemi-permanent coastline that is generally marked as a fixed\nfeature on charts of the Antarctic Ocean. Portions of this\ncoast have not been mapped for more than 20 years.\nNumerous fractures in the pack ice appear in all photographs of this area, revealing enormous stresses and strains\nin the ice.\nCartography and Geology\nInformation obtained by Nimbus weather satellites\nhas also provided useful data for geographers and geologists\nThe U.S. Geological Survey, after studying more than\n300 Nimbus I pictures over the Antarctic, found that relief\nmaps of the Antarctic were in slight error.\nAs a result, Mount Siple, a 10,000-foot high Antarctic\nmountain was repositioned 45 miles to the West. Nimbus I pictures of the Kohler Range area at the Antarctic showed one\ngroup of mountains, not two as depicted on earlier :maps.\n-more-\n\n-31Oeologists have used Nimbus photos to Increase their\nknowledge of past geologic formations In certain areas of the\nworld such as a river basin In Oregon, Paris Basin in Central\nPrance and the Appalachian Mountains of Pennsylvania.\nSnow Cover and Hydrology\nSnow depth of one inch or more can be detected by\nNimbus satellites as a continuous snow cover. Snow depths\nof less than one inch have usually been detected, but often\ndid not appear as continuous cover.\nAreas with snow cover greater than about three inches\nin nearly all cases had reflectivities significantly higher\nthan areas with lesser snow depths.\nNimbus II APT pictures of the East Coast of the United\nStates showed a very bright Delaware-Maryland-Virginia peninsula blanketed the day before by an eight-inch snowfall.\nThe rest of Maryland and Virginia had received only a trace\nto 4 Inches of snowfall and thus showed lesser reflectivities,\nAlthough present satellite photography cannot provide\nthe quantitative (three dimensional) measurements of snow\ndepth provided by a network of surface stations, it can provide the limits of snow cover and detailed qualitative estimates of snow depth in the areas between reporting stations.\nThis information is of much importance to hydrologists\nin making ground water run-off estimates and flood control\nforecasts.\n\n-more-\n\n-32LAUNCH VEHICLE\n\nThe launch vehicle used for the Nimbus B-2 satellite is\na Thorad-Agena-D rocket. The Thorad, or long tank Thor, is\nan uprated version of the Thrust Augmented Thor (TAT) used\nin combination with an Agena second stage to launch the first\ntwo Nimbus weather satellites.\nThe Thorad booster has a 50 per cent greater tank volume\nthan previous Thors which Increases engine burn time. Previous\nThors carried 33,000 Ibs. of RJ-1 fuel and 67,000 Ibs. of liquid\noxygen. Thorad carried 45,000 Ibs. of fuel and 100,000 its. of\noxidizer. Although no Increase in thrust is realized, the main\nengine burn time is increased from approximately 146 seco\'nds to\naboutL 218 seconds. . ^\n, ..\xe2\x80\x9e _\n._\n[i\nThe tfiree strap-on solid rocket motors used on the\nThorad are also uprated from the ones used on the TAT\'s. The\nThorad strap-ons provide 52,130 Ibs. of thrust for 37 seconds.\nThis compares with 54,300 Ibs. for 27 seconds for the old motors.\nThe greater propellant capacity of the Thorad coupled with\nthe new strap-on solid motors make it possible to boost about\n50 per cent more payload into Earth orbit than the original\nTAT.\nThe Agena-D second stage is the same configuration used\nin the past. Its 16,000-pound-thrust engine burns UDMH\n(Unsymetrlcal dimethyIhydrazine) and IRPNA (Inhibited red\nfuming nitric acid). For the Nimbus mission 3,824 Ibs. of\nUDMH fuel is carried and 9,703 Ibs. of IRPNA oxidizer.\nThe launch vehicle including the 18.7 foot Nimbus shroud\nstands 109.5 feet high. Because the spacecraft is designed\nto take cloud cover pictures near local noon during its south\nto north pass over the Earth, the possible launch time from\ncomplex 2 of the Western Test Range is restricted. The launch\n\'window for April 11 is 2:53 P-\'m. to 3:57 p.m. EST.\n\n-more-\n\n-33-\n\nSun-Synchronous Orbit\nA high noon orbit is ideal for weather satellites because\nit provides maximum illumination for photographic purposes,\nand pictures of the Earth will always be taken at the same local\nSun Times every day. Night photos will be taken about midnight\nlocal time.\nIn a Sun-synchronous orbit, the preceission (eastward drift)\nof Nimbus will be about one degree daily, at the same rate and\ndirection as the Earth moves around the Sun. The Sun will\nalways be behind Nimbus during daylight orbit, which results in\nideal lighting conditions for cloud cover photography.\nCountdown Milestones for Thorad-Agena-D Nimbus-\n\nLaunch\n\nEvent\n\nMinutes\n\nCountdown initiation\n\nT-750\n\nThorad preparation\n\nT-750\n\nWECO and Thorad telemetry checks\n\nT-730\n\nDestract checks\n\nT-680\n\nSolid motor arming\n\nT-620\n\nGantry removal\n\nT-500\n\nAgena tanking\n\nT-190\n\nAgena pressurization\n\nT-95\n\nCountdown evaluation and start\nterminal count\n\nT-60\n\n-more-\n\n-34Typlcal Sequence Of Flight Events\nEvent\n\nSeconds\n\nLiftoff\n\n0\n\nStart roll program\n\n2\n\nStop roll program - start pitch program\n\n16\n\nSolid motor burnout\n\n39\n\nEject solid motors\n\n102\n\nWECO steering commands commence\n\n125\n\nThorad Main Engine Cutoff\n\n222\n\nThorad Vernier Engine Cutoff\n\n231\n\nThorad-Agena separation\n\n237\n\nAgena first ignition\n\n256\n\nAgena first burn cutoff\n\n487\n\nAgena second burn ignition\n\n3261\n\nAgena second burn cutoff\n\n3267\n\nNimbus separation\n\n3517\n\nBegin Agena yaw and roll maneuver\n\n3519\n\nFire first Agena retro\n\n3710\n\nFire second Agena retro\n\n6217\n\nSECOR separation\n\n6385\n\n-more-\n\n-35-\n\nrH\n\n$\n\n00\n\nvo\no\nrH\n\nO\nCVI\n\nm\nrH\n\nCO\n^\nGO\n\nco\n\nOJ rH\n\n8\n\nroo .\n\nd o\n\no\no\nrH\n\ns>\n\nCO*\nrH\n\nin\n^\nrH\n\nvo\n\nm\no>\n\n-=1-\n\nVO\n\nOS\n\nON\n\nOJ\n\n5\xc2\xa3\n\xc2\xab\nI\n\nCVI\nrH\n\n8\n\nCO\n\xe2\x80\xa2t\n\nrH\n\nO\n\n8\n\ncvi\n\nvo*\n\nvb\n\nCO\nrH\n\nCO\nrH\n\nM>\n\nd)\n\nco\n\nbO\nOJ\nd\nrH\nCd T> -H\nCO\nCO\nVO\n\nO g -P\n\nrH\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xc2\xab\n\nCE* Cd 2\nOH\n4)\nOJ\n\nco\n\nin\n\nrH\n\nO\n\nrH\nj^rH\n\nt^rH\n\nCVI\nCVJ\n\nCT\\\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2%\n\nrH\n\n<M fn -P\n\n3\n\n0\n\nd\n\n(D\n\nCO\n\nOJ\nrH\n0) -H\n\n\xe2\x80\xa202\n\nOJ\nCO\n\n-P 0)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 i^\n\xe2\x80\xa2H -P\n-P 3\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nx:\n\n\xc2\xabl\n\nco\n\n3\n\n.p\n\nCVI\n\n-P\n\nco\nOJ\n\nO\n\n,-j_i\nP~l\n\nrH\nCO\n\nrH\nVO\nrH\n\nCO\nQ*\\\n\nLf*\\\n\nrH\n\nCO\n\nCO\nVO\n\not--\n\no^\\\n\n^J GJ\n\n-p\n\nbO\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\n\nin\n\nm\n\xc2\xa3>_\n\nVO\n\n00\n\nVO\n00\n\nH\nVO\nCVI\nCO\n\nvo\ncvi\nco\n\nvo\n\n.=!-*\nCO\n\nVO\n\nvo\n\nt^_\n\n(\xc2\xbb_\n\nCVJ\n\noo\nvo\n\nCO\n\nrH\nPC.\n\nT\n\n0)\nV\n1\n\nTj\n\ncd\nj^,\nO\n\nx:\n\nO\nrH OJ\nCd CO\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\n\nO\\\n\nQ e\n\nCO\n\nCVI\n\no\nrH\n\ncvi\nCVI\nCVI\n\nl>-\n\nco\nCVJ\n\nvo\nm op\n3F\nCM\n\nJs_\n\n55 "rl\n\nin\n\nH\n\n00\n\nCO\n\nvo\n\nm\n\nco\n\nEH\n\nd\no\n\n-p\no\n\nc\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\n\nd\n\ntu\nf-i\n\n0\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\n-P\nO\n\nCTJ\n\na\n\n(1)\n\nCO\n\nW*\nf_!\n\no\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2p\no\n2:\n.\np\n\nd\n\nT3\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\n\nOJ\n\nrH\n\nw\n\nO\nCO\n\nf_i\n\n\xc2\xa3j\n\n0\n\nO\n\no\n\n<\xc2\xa3\n\nW)\n\n1\n\xe2\x80\xa2O\n\n2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2o\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\n\n0\n\nrH\nO\nCO\n\nw\n\no\n2\n\na)\no\n\nX!\n\nd\no\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\n-P\nH\nd\nbO\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\n\n-P\nCO\n\nd\no\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\n(\n\nM\n(;_(\n\nd\n\nCH\n\nW\n\ncd\nd\n\n-P\n\nbO\n\n*tH\nC\nH\n\nO\n\n00\nfn\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\nCtH\n\nd\n\n-p\n\n0\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\n\na\nft\n<D\n\n3 13\nd d\ny\n\n<\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\n\n0\n-P\n\n^\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\n\nOJ\n\n4*\n\n-P\na)\n\nSH\n\n3\n\n3\n\nTO\n\n\xc2\xa3P\n\nCO\n\n\xe2\x80\xa20\n\nd\n\n-o\nd\n\n0?\n\no\nOJ\nco\n\nOJ\nCO\n\n*H\n^\n\n0\n\n-more-\n\no\no\n\nQ\n\nIz;\n\nd\n\no\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\n-P\n\ncd\nf-i\ncd\nft\nOJ\nco\nff,\nO\no\n\nw\n\nCO\n\n-36Flight Sequence\nThorad Phase\nAfter liftoff, the Thorad-Agena vehicle rises vertically\nfor about 16 seconds before beginning its pitch program.\nStarting at approximately two seconds after liftoff and continuing until 16 seconds, the vehicle rolls to the desired flight\nazimuth of 193.77 degrees. Roll and pitchover are controlled\nby the Thorad autopilot programmer. The three solid rocket\nmotors provide thrust for approximately 39 seconds and are\nejected at about 102 after liftoff. Beginning at approximately\n125 seconds, the WECO ground guidance system corrects the\nlaunch vehicle trajectory by comparing the vehicle trajectory\nwith a predetermined trajectory and then making small pitch\nand yaw steering corrections.\nMain engine cutoff of the Thorad is commanded by the\nWECO guidance system along with the start of the Agena start\nsequence. A Thorad fuel depletion switch can also command\nmain engine cutoff.\nAgena Phase\nSeparation of the Agena stage is initiated by command\nfrom the WECO ground station. Small retrorockets are Ignited\nto retard the flight of the Thorad first stage. Approximately\n12 seconds after separation the Agena and its spacecraft execute\na pitch maneuver followed by Agena engine start. Initial\nsteering corrections are provided by the WECO ground station\nwhich stops transmitting commands approximately .139 seconds\nafter engine start. First burn cutoff is determined by velocity\nof the Agena stage and is initiated by the Agena velocity meter.\nThe nose fairing which protects the Nimbus spacecraft during flight through the atmosphere is Jettisoned approximately\n10 seconds after first burn ignition of the Agena main engine.\nWhen velocity of the Agena reaches approximately 26,500\nfeet-per^-second, the Agena main engine shuts down and the\nvehicle begins a coast period.\nDuring the 46-minute coast period the Agena vehicle and\nNimbus spacecraft continue on a trajectory which takes it\nalmost 12,000 miles measured along the earth surface and from\nan altitude of 97 miles to an altitude of 686 mile\'s. At that\npoint the Agena main engine is fired for about 6 seconds to\ncircularize the orbit.\n\n-more-\n\n-37-\n\n0\n\nNimbus Separation\nDuring the approximately 250 seconds between Agena\nengine cutoff and spacecraft separati-on the vehicle\npitches up so that it is at an angle of about 80 degrees\nin respect to the horizon. At T plus about 58 and a\nhalf minutes explosive bolts are fired on the spacecraft\nadapter and compressed springs push the Nimbus spacecraft\naway from the Agena stage at a rate of about 4.5 feet-persecond.\nRetromaneuyer and Secor Separation\nAt two seconds after separation, a simultaneous roll,\nyaw maneuver is executed by the Agena. This maneuver results\nin the Agena flying roughly parallel to the Earth with\nits tail end forward. The first small retro engine is then\nfired. This lowers the orbit of the Agena in relationship\nto the Nimbus satellite.\nAt approximately 6,385 seconds into the flight an\n\'explosive pin puller is fired freeing the SECOR from the\nAgena and placing it in an orbit a few miles lower than\nthat of the Nimbus.\nA second retro maneuver places the Agena in an orbit\nwhere .it will maintain a minimum separation of at least\n500 feet from the Nimbus spacecraft for a period of at\nleast one year.\n\n-38<\n\xe2\x80\xa2z.\n\ni-H^-\xc2\xbb\n\nCO E\nOS\n\xe2\x80\xa2H P\n\n^5\n-\n\n4^ ^* *\n<U\n\nCO\n\nt\n\nbC\nCO\n4-*\n\na\np.\n5\nP\n\nc\n\n2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2d\n\n*\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\n\nCO\n\n^f\n\nf>\nrH\n\ni\n\ncu\n\n2\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\n\nCO N\nC CO\n3 fc\n\nCO\nfn\nCU\n\ncu\n\n4->\n<M\n\nt1rH\nin\n\xc2\xab\\\n\nO\nCM\n\ntrH\n\ns&\no\n\n. \xe2\x80\xa2d H\nE\nd)v^\n\n4^\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2H -d\n\nX> -H\n\xe2\x80\xa2H O\n\nxjco\n\niH 0\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\nCQ fn\nC -P\nO H\n\nrH rH\nrH >\xc2\xbb\n\nrH C\nrH\n\nb04^\nCU\nO 6\nt--r1\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\nQ \xc2\xa7\n\ncox:\n\nm-d\n\na^\n\n-? 3\nf-<H\n\n*&*->.\n\na>\n\xe2\x80\xa2d\n\n3\n\n4^\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\n4^\nrH\n\nCO\n4^>\nCO\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nco\nft\n\nCU CO\n\nH S\n0 CU\n04J\n0 CO\n>>\n>> CO\n\xe2\x80\xa2H 0\n0) b\n> 0)\n\xe2\x80\xa2H<\n4-1\nCO rH\nJ^rH\n0) <L>\n\nC \xc2\xab\n\nrH\n\n01^-*\n\n8\no\n\nCU cu\n\n\xc2\xabv\n\nvo\n\nH\n\nbO\n\nr, C\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\nCU bO\n\nec\n\nO cu\n\nCO 0\n\nCO\ng\n\n-P\n\nx:\n\nx:\n\nrH\nCO\n\nCU\nCU\n\nCO\n\n03\nCO\nrH\n\n-P\nO\n\nbO\n3\n\ncu\n\nco\n\n4J\nCO\nO\n\n0)\nrH\nO\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\n\n2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2d\ng\no\n\nx:\n\na\n1\n\no\nt-\n\nco\nXI\n\nCO\nXI\nrH\n\n8\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\n\nO\n\nrH\nCU\n\nm\no\n\xe2\x80\xa2>\nt-\n\nCM\n00\n\nrH\nCO\n\nrH\n\nCO\nft\n\nCO\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2d\nC\nCO\n\nC\nCO\n\n-d\nco\n\nSo\nCT\\\nO\n\n-d\nco\n\no,\nc\no\n\nx:\n\nbO\n\nO\nCVJ\n\no\nJ->\no\nco\n\no,\nc\no\n4J\n\nx:\n\nbO\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\n\ncu\n\n4^\n\ns\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\n\n-P\n-H\n\n0}\nrH\nrH\n0)\n\nC\nO\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\nCO\nrH\n3\n\nC\nO\n\ng\n\n-more-\n\no\n\nod\n\xe2\x80\xa2d\n\n0)\n\n3\n\n-P\nCO\n\nQ)\nO\n\nOH\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\n\n-39NIMBUS B2 PROJECT OFFICIALS\n\nNASA Headquarters, Washington\nLeonard Jaffe\n\nDirector, Space Applications\nProgram\n\nDr; Morris Tepper\n\nDeputy Director, Space Applications Program & Dir. of\nMeteorology\n\nDr. Richard Haley\n\nNimbus Program Manager\n\nBruton B.
