Probably the most critical\nimprovement was made possible with the arrival. in March, 1980\nat the Langley Research Center of the CDC CYBER-203 computer\nreplacing the CDC STAR-100 computer, With this new machine\nit is now possible to significantly increase the size of the\n\nmatrices used in the numerical simulation model,. With the incore storage increasing from 500,000 to 1,000,000 64-bit words\nit was possible for us to double the model matrix sizes by\nchanging the x and y-space dimensions from 90 and 64 to 128\nand 90, respectively. This increase in matrix size from 5,760\nto 11,520 32-bit words enables us to run the numerical simulation system over an area equivalent to the continental United\nStates, northern Mexico, and southern Canada when we employ a\n38.1 km grid mesh. This will, of course, greatly extend the\nuseful simulation (forecast) period fr7, ri approximately 12 to\nbetween 18 and 24 hours. When we "nest" down to finer mesh\nlengths, i.e., 19.05 and 9.525 km,the implications of this\nlarger matrix are further amplified by extending each area\nof coverage and therefore increasing the simulation (forecast)\nperiods at each of these scales as well. A bonus associated\nwith the arrival of the CDC CYBER -203 computer was the system\'s\n\n1\t\n\n.... ..... .....\t\n\n..._\t\n\n.\t\n\n.,..w^\t\n\nM.^.n...,3.e \xc2\xab.\t\n\n....e..,.r..w\t\n\nr...w.,..r,\t\n\nw.,...:..,...:\t\n\n. .^..a,,...:..... .-.....xw..wa.^\n\nx\n\n..r e..war.w#nni\'-u.\'W\n\n\t. \xe2\x80\xa2t\'i.,.c mna\n\n,..w^.,w... <r\xe2\x80\xa2.+\n\n\t.as_.>ml:su:.\t\n\n.....w.u.i;.w\'.:\t\n\n.52aYS3;H.wss:.. _..... _....-. . .\n\n\t_... ,..\t\n\n_..\t\n\nv^\n\ncapability for a five-fold increase in "scalar" computingspeed. While the numerical model is efficiently coded, i.e.,\ndominated by vector processing, the increased scalar processing\nspeed was still critically important in enhancing the speed with\nwhich the model simulation was processed. This was so because\neven the relatively minor amoi^nt of scalar computing was extremely slow on the STAR-100. Thus, even with the doubling\nof the two-dimensional matrix sizes, there was only a 20-30\npercent increase in total running time of the model due to the\nelimination of the significant overhead caused by scalar processing.\nA second critical area of improvement involves the use of\nmandatory and significant level radiosonde information in the\ninitialization process of the numerical simulation model. Previously we had been using only the National Weather Service\'s\nLimited Fine Mesh analysis geopotential height, tomperaturel\nand dew point temperature information vertically-spared on mandatory pressure level surfaces to initialize the simulation\nmodel. Since this information is analyzed only on the 1000,\n850, 700, 500, 400, 300, 250 and 200 MB surfaces there is a\ngreat deal. of information which is not included from the radiosonde reports which could be used to enhance the vertical structure\nin the model\'s initial state. This vertical structure is particularly crucial ov,, , r the great plains and front range of the\nRocky Mountains where relatively shallow and very well-defined\ninversion layers play a key role in establishing the hydrodynamical and -thermodynamical environment leading to severe\n\n2\nA\n\nstorm development. Often as many as 15 additional significant\nlevels of data are available in a radiosonde report and this\ncan occur in as many as 70 radiosonde reports on a given day.\nWe use this information by constructing interpolated level.\n\nof information\n\nin the vertical every 25 MB from 1000 to 500 MB\n\nbased on the Limited Fine Mesh Analysis. We then combine this\ninformation with the significant level radiosonde information\nby applying a standard analysis technique. We then interpolate\nto the simulation model\'s terrain-- following surfaces from\nthis vertically\xe2\x80\x94 denser hybrid analysis yielding a more comprehensive vertical structure of the atmosphere. Presently we\nare using this process through the 500 MB lever only because\nmost of the numerical model surfaces are below that pressure\nlevel. In the future this technique will be extended to 150 MB\nas the number of vertical levels increases in \'the numerical\nmodel above 500 MB.\nWith this increased low-level vertical data resolution\n,also comes a requirement for improved surface data. Since the\nmodel has excellent vertical resolution in the boundary layer\nwith levels at 250, 500, 750 and 1000 meters abovo the earth\'s\nsurface the addition of surface information could result in a\nmore complete vertical profile of boundary layer dependent\nvariables. Presently the source of surface data readily available from the Water and Power Resources data base are service\nA surface station reports of temperature, pressure, wind speed\nand direction, as well as dewpoint temperature. Because we do\nnot yet have implimented a dynamical. initialization technique\nthat enables us to use both wind and mass information we are\n3\n\nrestricted to use the surface dewpoint temperature onl y . In\n-the future we will be usin; all available surface data. The\nsurface dewpoint is used at initialization time by inputting\napproximately 250 service A reports of dewpoint temperature\nfrom surface observing stations between the Rocky Mountains\n\nand\n\nthe Mississippi\n\nRiver and between the borders of Canada\n\nand Mexico, Basically this surface dew point temperature ob-\n\nservation is built into the vertical lapse rate structure and\nthen interpolated horizontally such that it modifies the initial\ndew point observation at the surface at each Limited fine Mesh\nanalysis grid point before data is interpolated to the 38.1 km\nmatrix.\nThe fourth improvement to the numerical, simulation system\nconcerns the development and implimentation of a nested grid\nalgorithm. This algorithm is designed to give us the capability\nto specify a region in which -the hydrodynamical and thermodynamical\nmesoscale structure is being optimized for the development of\nsevere local storms. By combining hydrodynamical and thermodynamical forcing functions such as the time tendency of velocity\nconvergence, the moist static stability, and relative humidity\nwe can determine in space and time the optimal region for "building"\na finer-scale simulation mesh. More specifically, what we do is\nto "freeze" the dependent variables centered upon the region where\nthe nesting index reaches a critical preset threshold value and\ninterpolate the data to one-half the previous grid mesh length.\nThis new data set then becomes the initial state for a shorter\ntime period and higher resolution simulation in an effort to better\ndefine the environment where severe storms may best develop. This\n4\n\nprocess of establishing a new data set will continue as long as\nthe index threshold is exceeded thus selecting the bast candidate\nfor a simulation with a 19.05 km grid mesh. The index threshold\nis tested every hour for a relative maximum value. The same process is initiated during the course of the 19.05 km grid mesh\nscale simulation for an even shorter period but higher resolution\nsimulation at 9.025 km. The t o st is done every 30 minutes for\na\nthe 9.025 km simulation. Typically, the 19.05 km simulation is\nrun to six hours of real time and the 9.025 km simulation to 2\nhours of real time.\nThe fifth and final significant improvement to the numerical\nsimulation system concerns the linking of the simulation output\nto a sophisticated and very useful graphics software package.\nThis package accesses a group of display routines resident on the\nLangley computer system which enables us to project several critical fields for mesoscale and severe storm potential forecasting\nonto a relocatable geographical background which is highly detailed. The inherent flexibility in this software enables us\nto contour output fields with a variable contour interval and\nnumber as well as enabling us to modify the geographical display\nby projecting place names at the appropriate latitude and longitude. Such a package virtually eliminates any ambiguity that\nmight exist in associating a simulated field with its geographical\nposition and is extremely practical in facilitating the rapid\nassimilation by users of any model product.\nWhile the research and development effort was underway to\nimprove the numerical simulation system an effort was also undertaken to study the dynamical adjustments associated with a case\n\nof severe storm development. The case selected wa y April 10,\n1979. There were two prominent reasons for selecting this caso.\nFirst, it was an extremely severe outbreak day in which several\nlarge tornado-producing\n\nthundar g torms caused extensive loss of\n\nlife and property in the Re " Aver V,.Mey region of Texas and\n,\'\nOklahoma. Second, an unprecedented amount of observational data\nexisted for comparison with model simulations. This data was\navailable durint the spring of 1979 as a result of the SESAME\ndata gathering experiment which was under-Laken over the southern\nand central plains states, the Mississirpi, and the Missouri River\nValleys, Probably the most useful information made available to\nresearchers were three-hourly radiosonde balloon releases which\ncould give us a dramatically improved picture of the three-dimensional,\natmospheric structure in the vicinity of the severe storm occurrences.\nSuch information, which is, of course,far superior to the normal\nradiosondes taken every twelve hours can tell us much more about\nthe evolving three-dimensional. atmospheric structure before and\nduring the tornadic storms and tell us to what extent the numerical\nsimulation system was capturing this evolution. with this information available we could compare a variety of model-simulated and\nthree-hourly observed dynamical fields such as: velocity convergence, vorticity, moist static stability, equivalent potential\ntemperature, individual wind components, surface pressure, and\nmany others. We could also examine more closely individual terms\nin such critical dynamical equations as the Navier-Stokes, divergence, pressure-tendency, and vorticity equations in an effort to\nsort out the more subtle adjustments which lead to the evolution\nof the important observed features on that particular day. As\n6\n\nan example, during the period immediately proceeding the onset\nof tornadic activity a very pronounced mesoscale surge of southerly\nmomentum is observed\n\nto develop southeast\n\nof the tornadic region.\n\nThe existence of this feature is indisputable and is well-documented\nfrom the SESAME data sets. By studying these data sets from the\nperspective of a complete diagnostic "\n--nd dynamical breakdown of\ndominant terms in the previously mentioned equations and then\ncomparing them to a similar breakdown in the model simulation\nwe can gain insights into the imbalances which lead to the development of this feature and to what extent the model improvements can\nenhance the accuracy with which we simulate it. The southerly\nmomentum surge appears to have been instrumental in producing\nthe transport of warm moist air northward into the region of\nthe Red River Valley. This low-level tongue of warm moist air\naloft led to a drastic reduction in the vertical thermodynamical\nstability of the atmosphere in this region immediately prior to\ntornadic development. This feature also appears to have been\nresponsible for amplifying the vertical wind shear and low-level\nconvergence which allows the realization of the increased potential\nbuoyancy implied by the reduction in the thermodynamical stability\nin this region. As model development continues we may use such\nan ideal test case as a control to examine. the implications of each\nnew addition to the modelling system.\n\n7\n\n'
