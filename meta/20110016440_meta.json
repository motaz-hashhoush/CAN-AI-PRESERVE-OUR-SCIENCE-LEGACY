For modeling flows with viscosity about geometrically complex bodies in relative motion, the Chimera-overset-grid method is among the most computationally cost-effective methods for obtaining accurate aerodynamic results. CGT contains a large collection of tools for generating overset grids, preparing inputs for computer programs that solve equations of flow on the grids, and post-processing of flow-solution data. The tools in CGT include grid editing tools, surface-grid-generation tools, volume-grid-generation tools, utility scripts, configuration scripts, and tools for post-processing (including generation of animated images of flows and calculating forces and moments exerted on affected bodies). One of the tools, denoted OVERGRID, is a graphical user interface (GUI) that serves to visualize the grids and flow solutions and provides central access to many other tools. The GUI facilitates the generation of grids for a new flow-field configuration. Scripts that follow the grid generation process can then be constructed to mostly automate grid generation for similar configurations. CGT is designed for use in conjunction with a computer-aided-design program that provides the geometry description of the bodies, and a flow-solver program.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20110016440, "id": "38cfebc936b640358f2d3899fd83ffcc", "publicationName": "NASA Tech Briefs, December 2005", "publicationDate": "2005-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20110016435, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "NASA Tech Briefs, December 2005", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20110016440.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20110016440/downloads/20110016440.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20110016440/downloads/20110016440.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20110016440/downloads/20110016440.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
