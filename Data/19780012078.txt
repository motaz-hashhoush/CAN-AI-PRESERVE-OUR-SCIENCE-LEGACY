The vehicle is powered by a\n\nseparately excited, shunt-wound DC motor that was specially\n\ndeveloped by Siemens AG of West Germany. A DC chopper\n\ncontroller is used to control power to the electric motor.\n\nThe motor is bolted directly to the transaxle of the\n\nvehicle, eliminating the need for a clutch. A\n\nforward-or-reverse switch to control the direction of the\n\nvehicle is located on the dashboard. The lead-acid traction\n\nbattery is made up of 24 VARTA 6-volt modules connected in\n\nseries to form a 144-volt battery. This battery is located\n\n\n3\t\n\nORGINAL -PAGE IS\n\nOFPOO\n\nQUALITY\n\n\'under the cargo area. It is removed by opening the side\n\ndoor on the passenger side of the vehicle and sliding the\n\nbattery pack out with a special manually operated fixture\n\n(fig. 2).\nIn addition to standard hydraulic brakes, the\n\nvehicle is equipped with an electric regenerative braking\n\nsystem, which may be disconnected by a switch on the\n\ndashboard. When the brake pedal is depressed, the\n\nregenerative braking is initiated first,, followed by the\n\nhydraulic braking. Regenerative braking is effective down\n\nto zero speed. An off-board charger manufactured by VARTA\n\n3atterie AG charges the traction battery. It is controlled\n\nby an external timer. The charger is a 380-volt,\n\nthree-phase, 50-hertz alternating-current (AC) charger. It\n\nfully recharges the vehicle batteries in approximately 12\n\nhours. A separate 12-volt battery powers the vehicle\'s\n\nauxiliary electrical system and the regulator\'s electronics.\n\nThis battery is continuously charged by the 144-volt battery\n\nwith a 144-volt to 12-volt DC-to-DC converter.\n\nINSTRUMENTATION\n\nMeasurements taken during the performance testing of\n\nthe Volkswagen Transporter included vehicle speed, vehicle\n\ndistance, battery voltage, battery current, and ampere-hours\n\nfrom the traction battery. Battery voltage and current were\n\nrecorded on one strip-chart recorder; vehicle speed and\n\ndistance were recorded on another. The recorders were\n\ntwo-channel Honeywell Electronik 195 recorders. The battery\n\ncurrent was measured with a 250-ampere, 60-millivolt shunt\n\n(fig. 3).\nThis same shunt was also used to measure the\n\nintegrated battery current for the battery pack. An\n\non-board current integrator, Curtiss Model SHR-C3, was used\n\nfor this measurement. Its output was recorded manually\n\nafter each test.\n\nThe strip-chart recorders and the integrator were\n\noperated from a Tripp Lite DC-to-AC power inverter. The\n\ninverter was powered by a separate 12-volt battery that was\n\nfully charged before each test.\n\nA Nucleus Corporation Model NC-7 precision speedometer\n\n(fifth wheel) was used to measure the vehicle speed and\n\ndistance traveled. Auxiliary equipment used with the fifth\n\nwheel included -a Model ERP-X1 electronic pulser for distance\n\nmeasurement, a Model NC-PTE pulse totalizer, a Model ESS/E\n\nexpanded-scale speedometer, and a programmable digital\n\nattenuator. The fifth-wheel assembly was calibrated for\n\nevery constant-speed range test by using an electronic pulse\n\ngenerator to simulate rotation of the fifth wheel. The\n\naccuracy of the distance and velocity readings were within\n\n+1.0 percent of the readings.\n\n\n4\n\n\nThe strip-chart recorders and current integrators were\n\ncalibrated every two or three days. For these calibrations,\n\na Hewlett-Packard Model 6920B meter calibrator was used.\n\nThis meter has an accuracy of 0.2 percent of reading and a\n\nusable voltage range of 0.01 to 1000 volts.\n\nAfter the overall performance testing of the Volkswagen\n\nTransporter was completed, the strip-chart recorders were\n\nremoved and a 14-channel, frequency-modulated (FM) magnetic\n\ntape recorder was installed within the vehicle in order to\n\nobtain additional component data. These tests and the data\n\nand results obtained will be described in a later report.\n\nThe current and voltage into the battery and the energy\n\ninto the battery charger were measured while the battery was\n\nbeing recharged after each test. The current and voltage\n\nwere measured on a Honeywell strip-chart recorder. The\n\ncurrent measurement used a 500-ampere-per-100-millivolt\n\ncurrent shunt. Power into the charger was initially\n\nmeasured by an Ohio Semitronics, Inc., Model WM-365\\\n\nwattmeter. When an industrial kilowatt-hour meter (for 380\n\nV) was obtained, it was substituted for the wattmeter. The\n\nkilowatt-hour meter was a General Electric high-voltage\n\nV-65-S meter that was capable of handling 480-volt,\n\n60-cycle, three-phase current.\n\nFor the charger efficiency tests the Model WM-365A\n\nwattmeter was used in conjunction with Hall-effect current\n\nsensors manufactured by Ohio Semitronics, Inc.\n\nTEST PROCEDURES\n\nThe tests described in this report were conducted at\n\nthe Transportation Research Center Test Track, a three-lane,\n\n12-kilometer (7.5-mile) track located in East Liberty, Ohio.\n\nA description of the track is given in appendix B. When the\n\nvehicle was delivered to the test track, the pretest checks\n\ndescribed in appendix C were conducted. The first test was\n\na formal shakedown to familiarize the driver with the\n\noperating characteristics of the vehicle, to check out all\n\ninstrumentation systems, and to determine the vehicle\'s\n\nmaximum speed (appendix C).\nAll tests were run in\n\naccordance with ERDA Electric and Hybrid Vehicle Test And\n\nEvaluation Procedure ERDA-EHV-TEP (appendix E of ref. 1), at\n\nthe gross weight of the vehicle, 3075 kilograms (6780 lbm).\n\nRange Tests at Constant Speed\n\nThe vehicle speed for the highest constant-speed range\n\ntest was determined during checkout tests of the vehicle.\n\nIt was specified as 95 percent of the minimum speed the\n\n5\n\n\nvehicle could maintain on the test track when it was\n\ntraveling at full power. This speed was 69 kilometers per\n\nhour (43 mph) for the Volkswagen Transporter.\n\nRange tests were run at constant speeds of 40, 56, and\n\n69 kilometers per hour (25, 35, and 43 mph).\nThe speed was\n\nheld constant within +1.6 kilometers per hour (I mph), and\n\nthe test was terminated when the vehicle could no longer\n\nmaintain 95 percent of the test speed. The range tests were\n\nrun at least twice at all speeds.\n\nRange Tests under Driving Schedules\n\nBoth the 32-kilometer-per-hour (20-mph) schedule B\n\nstop-and-go driving cycle and the 48-kilometer-per-hour\n\n(30-mph) schedule C stop-and-go driving cycle, shown in\n\nfigure 4, were run with this vehicle. A complete\n\ndescription of cycle tests is given in appendix E of\n\nreference 1. A special instrument, called a cycle timer,\n\nwas developed at the Lewis Research Center to assist in\n\naccurately running these tests. Details of the cycle timer\n\nare given in appendix C. The cycle tests were terminated\n\nwhen the vehicle was unable to accelerate rapidly enough to\n\nreach the test speed in the prescribed time.\n\nAcceleration and Coast-Down Tests\n\nThe maximum acceleration of the vehicle was measured on\n\na level road with the battery fully charged and 40 and 80\n\npercent discharged.\nFour runs, two in each direction, were\n\nconducted at each of these three states of charge. Depth of\n\ndischarge was determined from the number of ampere-hours\n\nremoved from the batteries. Coast-down data were taken with\n\nthe drive switch in neutral after the acceleration tests and\n\nwith fully charged batteries in order to start the\n\ncoast-down runs from the maximum attainable vehicle speed.\n\nBraking Tests\n\nBraking tests on the vehicle were conducted\n\n(1) To determine the minimum stopping dkstance in a\n\nstraight-line emergency stop\n\n(2) To determine the controllability of the vehicle\n\nwhile braking in a turn on both wet and dry\n\npavement\n\n(3) To determine the brake recovery after the venicle\n\nwas driven through 0.15 meter (6 in.) of water at 8\n\nkilometers per hour (5 mph) for 2 minutes\n\n\n6\n\n\n(4) To determine the parking brake effectiveness on an\n\nincline\n\nInstrumentation used during the braking test included a\n\nfifth wheel programmed to determine stopping distance, a\n\nbrake pedal force transducer, and a decelerometer. A\n\ncomplete description of the braking tests is given in the\n\ndiscussion of test results and in appendix E of reference 1.\n\nTractive Force Tests\n\nThe maximum grade climbing capability of the test\n\nvehicle was determined from tractive force tests by towing a\n\nsecond vehicle. The driver of the towed vehicle, by\n\napplying the footbrake, maintained a speed of about 3\n\nkilometers per hour (2 mph) while the test vehicle was being\n\ndriven with a wide-open throttle. The force was measured by\n\na 13 000-newton (3000-lbf) load cell attached to the tow\n\nchain between the vehicles. The test was run with the\n\nbatteries fully charged and 40 and 80 percent discharged.\n\nCharger Efficiency Tests\n\nTwo methods were used to determine charger efficiency\n\nas a function of charge time. In the first method the GE\n\nV-65-S industrial kilowatt-hour meter was used to measure\n\ninput power to the charger by counting rotations of the disk\n\nand applying the meter manufacturer\'s calibration factor.\n\nThe charger output power was determined by multiplying the\n\naverage value of current by the average value of voltage.\n\nIndustrial kilowatt-hour meters are calibrated for\n\nsinusoidal waves only. The error in measuring input power\n\ndepends on the wave shape and may be as high as 5 percent.\n\nThe method of determining output power is correct only when\n\neither the voltage or the current is a constant during each\n\ncharging pulse. The battery voltage does change during each\n\ncharging pulse, which introduces a small error. The current\n\nshunts used to measure current are inaccurate for pulsing\n\ncurrent. The error depends on frequency and wave shape and\n\nmay exceed 10 percent.\n\nIn the other method used for determining charger\n\nefficiency a 50-kilowatt power meter was used on both the\n\ninput and output of the charger and a Hall-effect current\n\nprobe was used for current measurements. To minimize\n\nerrors, the same meter and current probe were used for both\n\nthe input measurement and the output measurement. The\n\naverage power measured was about 6 percent of full scale.\n\nThe influence of these inaccuracies on the determination of\n\ncharger efficiency is discussed in the component section of\n\nthis report.\n\n\n7\n\n\nTEST RESULTS\n\nRange\n\nThe data collected from all the range tests are\n\nShown in the table are the test\n\nsummarized in table I.\ndate, the type of test, the environmental conditions, the\n\nrange test results, the ampere-hours into and out of the\n\nbattery, the energy into the charger, and the instrument\n\nused in its measurement. These data were used to determine\n\nvehicle range, battery efficiency, and energy consumption.\n\nThe maximum speed of the vehicle was measured during\n\nIt is defined as the average speed that\n\nthe checkout tests.\nmaintained on the track under full power. The\n\ncould be\nmeasured maximum speed was 74 kilometers per hour (46 mph)\n\nfor this vehicle. This differs from the maximum speed used\n\nin the range tests.\n\nFour constant-speed range tests were run at 40\n\nkilometers per hour (25 mph), two at 56 kilometers per hour\n\nIn\n\n(35 mph), and three at 69 kilometers per hour (43 mph).\naddition, four schedule B range tests and four schedule C\n\nrange tests were run, two each with regenerative braking and\n\nThese test results\n\ntwo each without regenerative braking.\n\nare shown in table I. The constant-speed range test results\n\nare plotted in figure 5. Most of the range test results\n\nwere within +5 percent of the mean.\n\nMaximum Acceleration\n\nThe maximum acceleration of the vehicle was determined\n\nwith the batteries fully charged and 40 and 80 percent\n\ndischarged.

The maximum grade the Volkswagen\nTransporter can negotiate as a function of speed is shown in\nfigure 8 and table IV.\nGradeability Limit\n\nGradeability limit is defined by the SAE J227a\n\nprocedure as the maximum grade on which the vehicle can just\n\nmove forward. The limit was determined by measuring the\n\ntractive force with a load cell while towing a second\n\nvehicle at about 3 kilometers per hour (2 mph).\nIt was\n\ncalculated from the equations\n\n\nGradeability limit in percent = 100 tan\n\ns i n\n\nin SI units\n\nor\n\nGradeability limit in percent = 100 tan (sIn -\n 1\n\n)\n\nin U.S. customary units\n\n\n9\n\n\nwhere\n\nP\n\ntractive force, N (flbf)\n\n\nW\n\ngross vehicle weight, kg (Ibm)\n\n\nThe Volkswagen Transporter was capable of exerting the\n\nfollowing tractive forces for three states of battery\n\ndischarge:\n\n(1) Fully charged, 4270 newtons (960 lbf)\n\n(2) 40 Percent discharged, 3870 newtons (870 lbf)\n\n(3) 80 Percent discharged, 3470 newtons (780 lbf)\n\nAt a vehicle weight of 3075 kilograms (6780 ibm) the\n\nresulting gradeability limits were\n\n(1) Fully charged, 14.3 percent\n\n(2) 40 Percent discharged, 12.9 percent\n\n(3) 80 Percent discharged, 11.6 percent\n\nRoad Energy Consumption\n\nRoad energy is a measure of the energy consumed per\n\nunit distance in overcoming the vehicle\'s aerodynamic and\n\nrolling resistance plus the energy consumed in the\n\ndifferential drive shaft and the portion of the transmission\n\nrotating when in neutral. It was obtained during coast-down\n\ntests, when the differential was being driven by the wheels,\n\nand thus may be different than the energy consumed when the\n\ndifferential is being driven by the motor.\n\nRoad energy consumption\nfollowing equations:\n\nEn\n\n2.78xl0-4 W\n\nEn\n\nwas calculated from the\n\n\nVn-1\ntn -\n\nn ,MJ/km\n\nn -1\n\n\nor\n\nE\n\nE=\nn\n\n.0x1-5W\n\n9.07x10\n\nW\n\nVn-i - n\nV n - - n-i\n kWh/mile\n,\nt\n\n10\n\n\nwhere\n\n*\n\nvehicle mass, kg (ibm)\n\n\nV\n\nvehicle speed, km/h (mph)\n\n\nt\n\ntime, s\n\n\nVehicle coast-down tests were conducted both with and\n\nwithout the drive train (differential, transmission, and\n\nelectric motor) connected to the wheels.

The drive shafts were wired in\n\nplace so they did not drag.\n\nWith the drive shafts connectedr the vehicle was\n\nself-powered. When they were disconnected, it was necessary\n\nto tow the vehicle to speed before starting the coast-down\n\ntests.\n\nThe coast-down data used to calculate road energy were\n\naveraged and plotted as vehicle deceleration versus vehicle\n\nspeed in figure 9(a) with the drive shafts connected and in\n\nfigure 9(b) with them disconnected. Coast-down time\n\nincreases significantly when the drive train is disconnected\n\nfrom the wheels.\n\nThe results of the road energy calculations are shown\n\nin figure 10(a) and table V(a) for the vehicle with the\n\ndrive train connected and, in figure 10(a) and table V(b)\n\nwith it disconnected.\n\nRoad Power Requirements\n\nThe calculation of road power is analogous to the\n\ncalculation of road energy. It is a measure of the power\n\nneeded to overcome vehicle aerodynamic and rolling\n\nresistance plus the power losses from the differential, the\n\ndrive shaft, and a portion of the transmission. The road\n\npower Pn required to propel a vehicle at various speeds is\n\na-lso determined from the coast-down tests. The following\n\nequations are used:\n\n\nPn\n\n3.86xlO-W\n\nii\n\n\nV2\nnn\n\nv\n\n2\n\n\nn\xc2\xadn,, kW\n\n\nor\n\n\nPn=\n\n6\nn.08x1-5J\n\nW\n\n2\n\nV 2 i -V\nn-1 tn-i\n hp\nn,\nn -\n\nThe results of road power calculations are shown in figure\n\n11(a) and table VI(a) with the drive train connected to the\n\nwheels and in figure 11(b) and table VI(b) with it\n\ndisconnected. Both road energy and road power are\n\nsignificantly lower when the drive train is disconnected.\n\nIndicated Energy Consumption\n\nThe vehicle indicated energy consumption is defined as\n\nthe energy required to recharge the battery after a test\n\ndivided by the vehicle range achieved during the test, where\n\nthe energy is the input to the battery charger.\n\nInitially, the indicated energy consumption was\n\nmeasured by using a wattmeter and integrating over the\n\ncharge time. Then, when the [igh-voltage, three-phase\n\nkilowatt-hour meter became available, it was used to measure\n\nthe energy input to the battery charger after each range\n\ntest. The results derived from both methods on the same\n\ntests were all within 3 percent. Some overcharge of the\n\nbattery was usually required in order to assure that all\n\nbattery cells were fully charged and that the pack was\n\nequalized. The reported energy usage may be higher than\n\nwould be experienced with normal vehicle field operation.\n\nIndicated energy consumption as a function of vehicle speed\n\nis presented in figure 12 for the constant-speed tests and\n\nin table VII for the constant-speed and driving cycle tests.\n\nBraking Capability\n\nSimplified braking capability tests were conducted\n\naccording to the procedure outlined in appendix E of\n\nreference 1 in order to provide a preliminary evaluation of\n\nthe vehicle\'s braking capabilities. The procedure also\n\nincludes tests for handling which, at ERDA\'s direction, were\n\nnot conducted on this vehicle.\n\nStraight-line stops. - Six straight-line stops from 48\nkilometers per hour (30 mph) were made, three from each\ndirection. Stopping distance varied from 22.5 meters (74\nSix stops were also made from\nft) to 26.5 meters (87 ft).\n69 kilometers per hour (43 mph), again three from each\n\n\n12\n\n\ndirection. Stopping distances varied from 39.6 meters (130\n\nft) to 45.1 meters (148 ft).\n\nStops on a curve. - Three stops were made going into a\n\n0.3-g curve from 69 kilometers per hour (43 mph) on dry\n\npavement turning right, and three stops were made on the\n\nsame curve turning left. No difficulties were encountered\n\nin stopping within the 3.6-meter (12-ft) lane. The stopping\n\ndistance varied from 30.1 meters (99 ft) to 38.4 meters (126\n\nft).\nThe tests were repeated in a 0.2-g turn on wet\n\npavement. Again, the vehicle stopped smoothly with no\n\nproblems. The stopping distances varied from 30.1 meters\n\n(99 ft) to 40.2 meters (132 ft).\n\nWet brake recovery. - Three baseline stops were made\n\nfrom 48 kilometers per hour (30 mph) with dry brakes,\n\ndecelerating at 3 meters per second squared (10 ft/sec 2 ).\n\nThe average pedal force was 231 newtons (52 lbf).\nAfter the\n\nvehicle was driven through 0.15 meter (6 in.) of water at 8\n\nkilometers per hour (5 mph) for 2 minutes, the tests were\n\nrepeated. The stopping distances and pedal force were\n\nessentially the same, indicating that the brakes had\n\nrecovered on the first stop.\n\nParking brake. - Tests were conducted to determine\n\nparking brake effectiveness. The vehicle did not pass the\n\nparking brake test even after the brakes were adjusted and\n\nthe tests repeated. The parking brakes would not hold the\n\nvehicle on the 30-percent slope with the vehicle in either\n\nposition on the grade when a force of 400 newtons (90 lbfi)\n\nwas applied to the brake lever.\n\nCOMPONENT PERFORMANCE AND EFFICIENCY\n\nBattery Charger\n\nThe battery charger for the Volkswagen Transporter is\n\nan off-board charger made by VARTA. It is a 380-volt,\n\n50-hertz three-phase AC charger with a peak current input of\n\n30 amperes. A thyrister bridge circuit controls the usage\n\nrate to maintain a constant average battery voltage.\n\nTimer 1 is started when the charge is started and terminates\n\nthe charge in approximately 12 hours. In normal operation\n\nthe charger takes about 14 hours with a 50-hertz supply to\n\ncharge the battery. With the 60-hertz supply available in\n\nthe United States the charge time was reduced accordingly.\n\nTimer 2 begins running only when the battery reaches the\n\ngassing voltage. This timer can be set for zero to 4 hours.\n\nCharging can be terminated by either timer, depending on the\n\ncondition of the battery and the user\'s requirements. Both\n\ntimers are automatically restored to their starting\n\npositions upon completion of charge.\n\n\n13\n\n\nBattery charger efficiency test data are presented in\n\ntable VIIi and in figure 13. The indicated efficiencies of\n\nthe charger, as calculated from the readings on the\n\nindustrial kilowatt-hour meter and the average values of\n\ncharger output voltages and currents, are generally slightly\n\nhigher than the efficiencies that were calculated from\n\nwattmeter readings. Which set of values is more nearly\n\ncorrect has not been determined. However, most readings are\n\nwithin 3 percent of each other. Since the power efficiency\n\nis fairly constant over the entire time period, the energy\n\nefficiency is approximately equal to the average of the\n\npower efficiencies.\n\nSlight changes in the applied voltage or slight\n\nvariations in the battery voltage (due to temperature, age,\n\netc.) can adversely affect the charging current and the time\n\nrequired to attain full charge. Consequently, the amount of\n\nenergy that is delivered to the battery is largely\n\ndetermined by the judgment of the operator. During the\n\ntrack tests the battery was always purposely overcharged.\n\nBattery\n\nManufacturer\'s data. - The battery supplied with the\n\nVolkswagen Transporter vehicle was composed of twenty-four\n\n6-volt VARTA L800V3 lead-acid batteries connected in series.\n\nEach VARTA 6-volt battery is rated at 185 ampere-hours at\n\nthe 5-hour discharge rate. Characteristics supplied by the\n\nbattery manufacturer are shown in table IX.\n\nThe battery manufacturer\'s discharge data are presented\n\nin figures 14 and 15. Discharge current and voltage are\n\nshown as a function of time in figure 14.\nThe battery can\n\ndeliver 37 amperes for 5 hours (185 Ah) or 350 amperes for\n\n0.25 hour (87.5 Ab).\nAt a discharge current of 37 amperes,\n\nthe cell voltage is 2.01 volts; at a discharge current of\n\n350 amperes, the cell voltage drops to 1.77 volts.\n\nSpecific power versus the specific energy available for\n\nthe 6-volt battery is shown in figure 15. At a low specific\n\npower of 6.7 watts per kilogram, the available energy is\n\n0.126 megajoule per kilogram (35 Wh/kg).\nAt a higher\n\nspecific power of 60 watts per kilogram, the available\n\nenergy decreases to 0.054 megajoule per kilogram (15 Wh/kg).\n\nBattery acceptance. - Before the vehicle was\n\nroad-tested, the battery supplied by the vehicle\n\nmanufacturer was tested for terminal integrity and battery\n\ncapacity as specified in appendix E of reference 1.\n\n\n14\n\n\nAn electronic load bank was used to discharge the\n\nbattery for the terminal test and the capacity check.\nsince\n\nthe load bank was limited to a discharge voltage of 120\n\nvolts, the Volkswagen Transporter battery pack was\n\ndischarged in two subpacks, each with a nominal voltage of\n\n72 volts.\n\nThe terminal integrity test (300 A) and the capacity\n\ncheck were performed during a single discharge. The results\n\nof these tests are presented in figure 16.\nThe capacity\n\nremoved is plotted as a function of battery voltage for both\n\nthe front 72-volt and rear 72-volt battery subpacks. The\n\nfroht battery subpack (fig. 16(a)) was discharged at 300\n\namperes, followed by a 72-ampere discharge to a voltage of\n\nThe rear battery subpack (fig. 16(b)) was\n\n61.5 volts.\ndischarged at 300 amperes, followed by a 36-ampere discharge\n\nto a voltage of 61.8 volts. The average capacity removed\n\nfrom both subpacks was 163 ampere-hours. As this is 88\n\npercent of the rated capacity, the battery was acceptable.\n\nThe terminal temperature as measured by a thermocouple\n\nafter the 300-ampere test varied from 30 C to 130 C above\n\nambient.\nThe battery passed both tests.\n\nBattery performance at constant vehicle speed. - During\n\nthe track tests, motor current and voltage were constantly\n\nmonitored.\nPresented in figures 17 to 19 are the battery\n\ncurrent, voltage, and power, respectively, measured during\n\nthe 40-, 56-, and 69- kilometer-per-hour (25-, 35-, and\n\n43-mph) range tests.\nThe average battery current, voltage,\n\nand power during the first and last 25 percent of the\n\nvehicle range test are shown in table X.\nBattery power\n\ndecreased toward the end of the test, probably because of\n\nthe reduced power requirements as the temperature of the\n\nmechanical drive train components, tires, and associated\n\nlubricants increased during the test.\n\nGeneral battery performance. - Battery data for\n\nselected driving tests are shown in table XI. The\n\nelectrolyte specific gravities ranged from 1.266 to 1.280\n\nfor the fully charged battery and from 1.130 to 1.135 for\n\nthe discharged battery. The ampere-hour overcharge varied\n\nfrom 26 percent to 43 percent. While the overcharge was\n\nnecessary to equalize the cells and assure full charge for\n\nevery cell, it increased the total energy consumption. A\n\ncharge cycle that results in only a 10-percent overcharge is\n\nmore desirable.\n\nThe battery temperature had a tendency to increase from\n\nambient at the start of the test to an average of 7 degrees\n\nCelsius (13 deg F) above ambient at the end of the test.\n\n\n15\n\n\nBattery efficiency. - One complete battery charge was\n\nanalyzed to determine battery efficiency. This charge\n\nfollowed the 69-kilometer-per-hour (43-mph) constant-speed\'\n\ntest conducted on 5/27/77.\n\nBattery charger output voltage, current, and power are\n\npresented in figure 20 as a function of time. Total energy\n\ninput to the battery during charging was 30.2\n\nkilowatt-hours; the energy removed during the test was 17.9\n\nkilowatt-hours. The battery energy efficiency is therefore\n\n59 percent. However, as shown in table X, the ampere-hour\n\novercharge was 43 percent for this test. Correcting for a\n\nmore desirable overcharge of 10 percent reduces the battery\n\ncharge energy to 23.2 kilowatt-hours-and increases the\n\nbattery energy efficiency to 77 percent. A similar analysis\n\nperformed for the 40-kilometer-per-hour (25-mph) range test\n\nrun on 6/8/77 shows an uncorrected battery energy efficiency\n\nof 62 percent with a 35 percent overcharge and a corrected\n\nenergy efficiency of 77 percent with a 10 percent\n\novercharge.\n\nController\n\nThe Volkswagen Transporter controller is a DC chopper\n\ncontroller manufactured by Siemens AG. It controls the\n\nelectric motor power in accordance with the desired driving\n\nconditions. The Siemens controller has a nominal rating of\n\n144 volts and 321 amperes and weighs 50 kilograms (31.1\n\nibm).\nIt is easily accessible through a small door located\n\nat the rear of the vehicle (fig. 21).\nAs this vehicle is\n\npowered by a separately excited, shunt-wound DC motor, the\n\ncontroller consists of both an armature current control\n\ncapable of handling armature currents of up to 320 amperes\n\nand a transistorized field control current regulator. In\n\naddition to maintaining the desired vehicle speed, the\n\ncontroller provides the following features:\n\n1. If either the motor or controller overheats, the\n\namount of power supplied to the motor is reduced.\n\n2. If the battery voltage drops to a specified minimum\n\nvalue, the battery current is reduced.\n\n3. If the battery voltage exceeds a specified limit\n\nduring deceleration, regenerative braking is reduced.\n\n4. Overcurrent protection in the armature cuts off\n\nmotor current.\n\n5. If any of the braking or driving control wires\n\nfail, all motor power is automatically cut off.\n\n\n16\n\n\nFor speed regulation, the Volkswagen Transporter has\n\narmature control up to 22 kilometers per hour (14 mph); it\n\nthen employs field control to a maximum speed of about 70\n\nkilometers per hour. Figure 21 shows the controller\n\ninstalled in the rear of the vehicle.\n\nMotor\n\nThe Volkswagen Transporter vehicle is powered by a\n\nseparately excited, shunt-wound DC motor that was specially\n\ndeveloped for the vehicle by Siemens AG. The motor is\n\ndesigned to be easily serviced. It is light in weight with\n\na power-to-weight ratio of 0.188 kilowatt per kilogram. The\n\nmotor is equipped with a forced-ventilation system in which\n\na fan blows air in through the controller cooling fans and\n\nforces it axially through the motor. The blower becomes\n\noperative when the ignition key is turned on. It is powered\n\nThe motor\nby the main traction battery (144 V).\ncharacteristics are\nMaximum continuous rating, kW (hp)........\nMaximum peak rating, kW .................\nMaximum speed, rpm ..................\nMaximum torque at 2200 rpm, N-m .............\nNumber of poles .....................\n\n.. 16 (23)\n32\n6700\n160\n.4\n\nVEHICLE RELIABILITY\nNo major problems were encountered that prevented\ncompletion of the tests, although some minor problems\noccurred that delayed some tests. These problems were\nmostly related to the controller. On one occasion the\n12-volt accessory battery was not being charged, so the\n12-volt charger module in the controller had to be repaired.\n\nAnother delay occurred when the vehicle would not operate\n\nA malfunction in the\n\nover 22 kilometers per hour (14 mph).\nfield control circuit was limiting the vehicle speed. Some\n\ntransistors were defective and had to be replaced.\n\nAnother problem was encountered when the battery was\n\nbeing recharged. The charger operates at too high a current\n\nwhen charging a fully discharged battery. As a result the\n\nbattery overheated and would not cool down in time for the\n\nnext scheduled test. The problem was corrected by passing\n\ncool air from an air conditioner over the battery after the\n\ncharge was finished in order to reduce the cooling time.\n\nOther than these problems, the Volkswagen proved to be\n\nreliable throughout the test period.\n\n\n17\n\n\nDRIVER REACTION AND VEHICLE SERVICEABILITY\n\nThe vehicle was a comfortable, easy-to-handle vehicle\n\nat all speeds,. Although it was seldom required, the removal\n\nof the propulsion battery is easy and can be accomplished in\n\nless than 5 minutes. The armature control, field control,\n\nlogic components, DC-to-DC converter, and fuses are located\n\nin one unit on a slide-in tray that can be easily removed\n\nfrom the vehicle to simplify repairs.\n\n\n18\n\n\nAPPENDIX A\nVEHICLE SUMMARY \tDATA SHEET\nVolkswagen Werk AG\nGermany\n\nWolfsburg, West \t\n\n1.0\n\nVehicle manufacturer\n\n2.0\n\nVehicle\n\n3.0\n\nPrice and availability\n\n4.0\n\nVehicle weight and load\n4.1 Curb weight, kg (Ibm)\n4.2- Gross vehicle weight, kg (ibm)\n4.3\n\nconversion of standard VW Transporter (type 2)\non request\n\nCargoweight, kg(lbm)\n\n2268 (5000)\n\n3075 (6780)\n\n603\n\n-\n\n(1330)\n\n\n4.4- Number-of passengers\n4.5 Payload, kg (ibm) \t\n5.0\n\n3\n\n807 (1780)\n\nVehicle size\n5.1 Wheelbase, m (in.) \t\n5.2 Length, m (ft) \t\n5.3 Width, m (ft) \t\n\n2.42 (95.5)\n4.44 (14.7)\n1.75 (5.7)\n\n5.4\n\nHeight, m (in.)\n\n0.95 (37.5)\n5.5 Head room, m (in.) \t\n0.66 (26)\n\n5.6 \t Leg room, m (in.)\n2\n (ft2 )\n5.7 Frontal area, m\n5.8 Road clearance, m (in.)\n2 (1 single, 1 double)\n5.9 Number of seats\n6.0\n\nAuxiliaries and \toptions\n\n6.1.\n\n2 head;

B-1).\nbuilt by the State of Ohio and is now operated by a\n\n\ncontractor and supported by the state. It is located 72\n\nkilometers (45 miles) northwest of Columbus along\n\nU.S. route 33 near East Liberty, Ohio.\n\nThe test track is a 12-kilometer (7.5-mile) continuous\n\nloop 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) wide and 5.6 kilometers (3.5\n\nmiles) long. Three concrete lanes 11 meters (36 ft) wide in\n\nthe straightaways and 13 meters (42 ft) wide in the curves\n\nmake up the high-speed test area. The lanes were designed\n\nfor speeds of 129, 177, and 225 kilometers per hour (80,\n\n110, and 140 mph) with zero lateral acceleration in the\n\ncurves. The 3-kilometer- (1.88-mile-) long straightaways\n\nare connected to the constant 731-meter- (2400-ft-) radius\n\ncurves by a short variable-radius transition section.\n\nAdjacent to the inside concrete lane is a 3.66-meter\xc2\xad\n(12-ft-) wide asphalt berm. This berm is only banked\n\nslightly to provide a drainage slope. An additional asphalt\n\nlane 3.66 meters (12 ft) wide is located adjacent to the\n\noutside lane on the straightaways. The constant-speed and\n\ncycle tests were conducted on the inside asphalt lane\n\nbecause all tests were at relatively low speeds. The\n\nacceleration and coast-down tests were conducted on the\n\nstraight outside asphalt lanes because these were more alike\n\nthan the two iside asphalt lanes and because it was the\n\nportion of the track least likely to encounter traffic\n\ninterference. The track has a constant 0.228 percent\n\nnorth-to-south downslope. The TRC complex also has a\n\n20-hectare (50-acre) vehicle dynamics area and a 2740-meter\xc2\xad\n(9000-ft-) long skid pad for the conduct of braking and\n\nhandling tests.\n\n\n24\n\n\nAPPENDIX C\n\nVEHICLE PREPARATION AND TEST PROCEDURE\n\nVehicle Preparation\n\nWhen the vehicle arrived at the test track, a number of\n\nchecks were made to assure that it was ready for performance\n\nThese checks were recorded on a vehicle preparation\n\ntests.\nThe\n\ncheck sheet, such as the one shown in figure C-i.\nvehicle was examined for physical damage when it was removed\n\nfrom the transport truck and before it was accepted from the\n\nBefore the vehicle was operated, a complete visual\n\nshipper.\ncheck was made of the entire vehicle including wiring,\n\nbatteries, motor, and controller. The vehicle was weighed\n\nand compared with the manufacturer\'s specified curb weight.\n\nThe gross vehicle weight (GVW) was determined from the\n\nvehicle sticker GVW. If the manufacturer did not recommend\n\na GVW, it was determined by adding 68 kilograms (150 lbm)\n\nper passenger plus any payload weight to the vehicle curb\n\nweight.\n\nThe wheel alignment was checked, compared, and\n\ncorrected to the manufacturer\'s recommended alignment\n\nvalues. The battery was charged and specific gravities\n\nIf not,\n\ntaken to determine if the batteries were equalized.\nan equalizing charge was applied to the batteries. The\n\nintegrity of the internal interconnections and the battery\n\nterminals was checked by drawing either 300 amperes or the\n\nvehicle manufacturer\'s maximum allowed current load from the\n\nIf the\n\nbattery through a load bank for 5 minutes.\ntemperature of the battery terminals or interconnections\n\n\nrose more than 60 degrees Celsius above ambient, the test\n\nwas terminated and the terminal was cleaned or the battery\n\nreplaced. The batteries were then recharged and a battery\n\ncapacity check was made. The battery was discharged in\n\naccordance with the battery manufacturer\'s recommendations.\n\nTo pass this test, the capacity must be within 20 percent of\n\nthe manufacturer\'s published capacity at the published rate.\n\nThe vehicle manufacturer was contacted for his\n\nrecommendations concerning the maximum speed of the vehicle,\n\ntire pressures, and procedures for driving the vehicle. The\n\nvehicle was photographed head-on with a 270-millimeter\n\ntelephoto lens from a distance of about 30.5 meters (100 ft)\n\nin order to determine the frontal area.\n\nTest Procedure\n\nEach day, before a test, a test checklist was used.\n\nTwo samples of these checklists are shown in figure C-2.\n\n25\n\n\nThe first item under driver instructions on the test\n\nchecklist is to complete the pretest checklist (fig. C-3).\n\nData taken before, during, and after each test were\n\nentered on the vehicle data sheet (fig. C-4).\nThese data\n\ninclude\n\n(1)\n\nAverage specific gravity of the battery\n\n(2)\n\nTire pressures\n\n(3)\n\nFifth-wheel tire pressure\n\n(4)\n\nTest weight of the vehicle\n\n(5)\n\nWeather information\n\n(6)\n\nBattery temperatures\n\n(7)\n\nTime the test was started\n\n(8)\n\nTime the test was stopped\n\n(9)\n\nAmpere-hours out of the battery\n\n(10)\n\nFifth-wheel distance count\n\n(11)\n\nOdometer readings before and after the tests\n\nThe battery charge data taken during the charge cycle were\n\nalso recorded on this data sheet. These data include the\n\naverage specific gravity of the battery after the test, the\n\nkilowatt-hours and ampere-hours put into the battery during\n\nthe charge, and the total time of the charge.\n\nTo prepare for a test, the specific gravities were\n\nfirst measured for each cell and recorded. The tire\n\npressures were measured and the vehicle was weighed. The\n\nweight was brought up to the GVW by adding sandbags. The\n\ninstrumentation was connected, and power from the\n\ninstrumentation battery was applied. All instruments were\n\nturned on and warmed up. The vehicle was towed to the\n\nstarting point on the track. The fifth-wheel distance\n\ncounter and ampere-hour integrator counter were reset to\n\nzero. The test was started and was carried out in\n\naccordance with the test checklist. When the test was\n\nterminated, the vehicle was brought to a stop and the\n\n,post-test checks were made in accordance with the post-test\n\nchecklist (fig. C-5).\nThe driver recorded on the vehicle\n\ndata sheet the time, the odometer reading, the ampere-hour\n\nintegrator reading, and the fifth-wheel distance reading.\n\n\n26\n\n\nAt the end of the test, weather data were recorded on the\n\nAll instrumentation power was turned\n\nvehicle data sheet.\noff, the instrumentation battery was disconnected, and the\n\nfifth wheel was raised. The vehicle was then towed back to\n\nthe garage,,the post-test specific gravities measured for\n\nall cells and the vehicle was placed on charge.\n\nAfter the test, the engineer conducting the test\n\nThis data sheet\n\ncompleted a test summary sheet (fig. C-6).\nprovides a brief summary of the pertinent information\n\nreceived from the test. Another data sheet, the engineer\'s\n\ndata sheet (fig. C-7), was also filled out. This data sheet\n\nsummarizes the engineer\'s evaluation of the test and\n\nprovides a record of problems, malfunctions, changes to\n\ninstrumentation, etc., that occurred during the test.\n\nWeather data. - Wind velocity and direction and ambient\n\ntemperature were measured at the beginning and at the end of\n\neach test. These data were obtained from the control tower,\n\nwhich was located in the center of the test track. The wind\n\nanemometer was located about 1.8 meters (6 ft) from the\n\nground near the southern straight section of the track. The\n\nambient temperature readings were taken at the\n\ninstrumentation trailer near the west curve of the track.\n\nDuring most of the test period the winds were under 11\n\nkilometers per hour (7 mph).\n\nDetermination of maximum speed. - The maximum speed of\n\nthe vehicle was determined in the following manner. The\n\nvehicle was fully charged and loaded to gross vehicle\n\nweight. After one warmup lap, the vehicle was driven at\n\nwide-open throttle for three laps around the track. The\n\nminimum speed for each lap was recorded and the average was\n\ncalculated. This average was called the vehicle maximum\n\nspeed. This speed takes into account track variability and\n\nmaximum vehicle loading. This quantity was then reduced by\n\n5 percent and called the recommended maximum cruise test\n\nspeed.\n\nCycle timer. - The cycle timer (fig. C-8) was designed\n\nto assist the vehicle driver in accurately driving SAE\n\nschedules B, C, and D. The required test profile is\n\npermanently stored on a programmable read-only memory\n\n(PROM), which is the heart of the instrument. This profile\n\nis continuously reproduced on one needle of a dual-movement\n\nanalog meter shown in the figure. The second needle is\n\nconnected to the output of the fifth wheel and the driver\n\n"matches needles" to accurately drive the required schedule.\n\nOne second before each speed transition (e.g.,\n\nacceleration to cruise or cruise to coast), an audio signal\n\n\n27\n\n\nsounds to forewarn the driver of a change. A longer\n\nduration audio signal sounds after the idle period to\n\nemphasize the start of a new cycle. The total number of\n\ntest cycles driven is stored in a counter and can be\n\ndisplayed at any time with a pushbutton (to conserve power).\n\n\n28\n\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1. \t\nSargent, Noel B.; Maslowski, Edward A.; Soltis, Richard\n\nBaseline Tests of the C.
