Each engine part, component and assembly was examined and evaluated to determine the costs of its material and the method of manufacture based on specific annual production volumes. Cost estimates are presented for both the Stirling and Brayton engines in annual production volumes of 1,000, 25,000, 100,000 and 400,000. At annual production volumes above 50,000 units, the costs of both engines are similar, although the Stirling engine costs are somewhat lower. It is concluded that modifications to both the Brayton and Stirling engine designs could reduce the estimated costs.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19800018270, "id": "2fd79e8d289d42f9b0ce98dc4ffeb623", "publicationDate": "1980-05-31T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19800018270.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19800018270/downloads/19800018270.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19800018270/downloads/19800018270.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19800018270/downloads/19800018270.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
