The\nfollowing activities have been completed:\n0\n\nA listserve "eco-tech" was set up to serve as a clearinghouse\n\nof information about activities and\n\nevents relating to advanced technologies.\nA series of conference calls were organized on specific topics including data visualization mid spatial\nanalysis, and remote sensing.\nTwo meetings were organized at the 1996 ESAAnnual Meeting in Providence, Rhode Island. Topics\ncovered included concerns about tool and data sharing; interest in expanded development of\nground-based remote sensing technologies for monitoring; issues involved in training for using new\ntechnologies and increasing data streams, and associated implications of data processing\ncapabilities; questions about how to develop appropriate standards\n(i.e. surface morphology\ndassification standards) that facilitate the exchange and comparison of analytical results; and some\nthoughts about remote sensing platforms and vehicles.\n\nThe Vegetation Classification Panel of the Ecological Society of America (ESA) has worked closely\nwith the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC), Subcommittee on Vegetation Classification to\ndevelop and provide scientific review of a National Vegetation Classification Standard. The mission of the\npanel is to facilitate and support the development and review of a standardized, scientifically credible,\nNorth American vegetation classification system. Its objectives have been to provide a neutral forum for\nthe review of goals and standards for nomenclature, hierarchy, structure, and definitions for North\nAmerican vegetation classification; promote standardization of named units of vegetation and provide an\non-golng process of review for modifications and additions of named units; facilitate broad public access\nto information relating to a standardized North American vegetation classification system; and identify\nareas for further research and development.\nThe Panel, at its meeting in March 1996, completed an extensive review of the current draft of\nthe FGI)C Vegetation Classification and Information Standards. The Panel\'s main contribution was to\nprovide outside review and detailed editorial comments on the FGDC Report. Phase I of the Panel\'s\nwork concluded with its recommendations to the FGDC. The panel then moved into its second phase by\ndeveloping a document to address areas of interest to ecologists which remained unaddressed in the\nFGDC forum. Phase II focuses on developing florlstic-level standards and a taxonomic unit review\nprocess. The Panel began work on "An Initiative for a Standard Oassiflcation of Vegetation for the United\nStates" describing a process to establish a scientifically rigorous system to develop and review taxonomic\nunits at the floristic levels of the current FGDCstandards.\n\nP\n\nStudies\n\non Ecosystem\n\nManagement\n\nSeveral ecosystem management\n\nactivities aimed at bringing multiple perspectives to decision-\n\nmaking processes at many levels have been undertaken.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nA series\n\nof Conversations\n\nThese include:\n\non Ecosystem Management brought together stakeholders\n\nsegments of society to address challenges confronting\nmanagement of natural resources. Three conversations\n\nfrom\n\nall\n\nan ecosystem-based\napproach to the\nhave taken place, the first focusing on\n\nincorporating local values into ecosystem management, the second exploring the roles of the small\nbusiness community in ecosystem management,\nand the third concentrating\non the National\nEnvironmental\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPolicy Act (NEPA) and its role in ecosystem management.\n\nA symposium\n\ntitled "Ecology and the Social Sciences" was organized\n\nMeeting.\n\nDuring the symposium,\n\nphilosophical,\nmanagement,\nsymposium\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nfor the 1995 ESA Annual\n\nspeakers engaged each other and the audience\n\nin discussion\n\non\n\neconomic, sociological, legal, and institutional issues related to natural resource\nwith a special focus on ecosystem management.\nAn article summarizing\nthe\nwas published in the ESABuflain\n\nin April 1996.\n\nThe August 1996 issue of EcologicalApplications\n\nwas devoted the topic of ecosystem management.\n\nThe issue contained a report on the scientific basis for ecosystem management, as well as a forum\nentitled "Perspectives on Ecosystem Management," which featured 20 papers by authors from\ndiverse disciplines.\n\n'
