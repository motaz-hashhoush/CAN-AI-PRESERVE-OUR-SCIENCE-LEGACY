In block\n410, an electric field is established in proximity to the stimulus responsive nanoparticles. With reference to the exemplary\nembodiment of FIG. 3, the electric field is established\nbetween the first and second electrodes 310 and 320. The\nelectric field extends through the dispersion fluid 340 inproximity to the elongated electro-responsive nanoparticles 330.\nIn response to the established electric field, the stimulus\nresponsive nanoparticles are reoriented in block 420.

Relaxation when the electric field is turned off and is driven by\ngravity and is relatively constant for the different field\n50 strengths. In some embodiments, other particles may be\nincluded in the dispersion agent 340 to interact with the\nstimulus responsive nanoparticles, such as the elongated electro-responsive nanoparticles 330, to amplify changes in viscosity and surface tension and affect response times.\n55\nFIGS. 6A-6D illustrate exemplary reorientation and relaxation responses of elongated electro -responsive nanoparticles, such as those included in FIG. 5, according to one\nembodiment of the present disclosure. Elongated electroresponsive nanoparticles 520 with a biplaner director 220\n60 (FIG. 2) were dispersed between electrodes 310 and 320 as\nillustrated in FIG. 5. The elongated electro-responsive nanoparticles had a diameter of about 200 nanometers and a length\nof up to about 60 microns. The electrodes 310 and 320 comprise indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass separated by 60\n65 micron spacers.\nFIG. 6A is a graphical plot 610 depicting the typical angular variance of an elongated electro -responsive nanoparticle\n\nUS 8,362,760 B2\n7\nduring the cycle of reorientation and relaxation with an application of 10 V. The switching time was driven by the electric\nfield established between the electrodes 310 and 320. The\nelongated electro -responsive nanoparticle was observed\nusing an optical microscope (Leitz LaborLux 12 Me, Mag.\n20x). The angle of the elongated electro -responsive nanoparticle with respect to the glass plate plane was then calculated\nfrom the apparent length measured. The apparent length of\nthe elongated electro-responsive nanoparticle during reorientation and relaxation was measured using Matlab image\nanalysis.\nThe reorientation 612 of the elongated electro-responsive\nnanoparticle was initiated when the elongated electro-responsive nanoparticle was parallel to the electrode plane (0 -0\xc2\xb0)\nand finished when the elongated electro -responsive nanoparticle was perpendicular to the electrode plane (0=90\xc2\xb0). As\nshown in FIG. 6A, the re-orientation time 612 for the\nobserved elongated electro -responsive nanoparticle was\napproximately 0.385 seconds as measured using a frame\ngrabber (Guppy, Allied Visions Technology), which captured\noptical images every 0.055 seconds.\nAfter the elongated electro-responsive nanoparticle was\nperpendicular to the electrode plane (0=90\xc2\xb0), the voltage was\nmaintained for a period 614 to allow the position of the\nelongated electro -responsive nanoparticle to stabilize. The\nelongated electro-responsive nanoparticle was then allowed\nto relax 616 by removing the electric field until the elongated\nelectro -responsive nanoparticle returned to its initial position.\nThe observed reorientation time is compared to a predicted\nreorientation time in the graphical plot 620 of FIG. 6B. Equation (4) was used to model the observed elongated electroresponsive nanoparticle, where p is the density (1000 kg/m 3),\nL is the length (30 \xc2\xb5m), IAEI is the dielectric anisotropy of a\nperfectly aligned nematic (2), E. is the permittivity of free\nspace, E is the field strength, 0 2 is the final angle (90\xc2\xb0), and 0 i\nis the initial angle (0\xc2\xb0). This model assumes perfect alignment\nof the liquid crystal, no viscosity and uniform electric field\nstrength. In addition, a dielectric anisotropy value (AE) of -2\nwas assumed, which corresponds to a perfect alignment of the\ndirector field. Calculating the effective dielectric anisotropy\nvalue from the actual switching time data, leads to a IAEI\nvalue of 2.43x10-4 for afield strength of 10 V.\nObserved reorientation times for different applied voltages\n(60 V, 40 V, 10 V, and 5 V) are depicted in the graphical plot\n630 of FIG. 6C. As can be seen from FIG. 6C, the reorientation of the elongated electro -responsive nanoparticle is driven\nby the strength of the electric field. The responsive nature of\nthe elongated electro-responsive nanoparticle during reorientation is shown to reduce with a decrease of electric field\nstrength. The fastest reorientation time recorded, 0.11 seconds, is achieved with a field strength of 60 V (I V/\xc2\xb5m). The\nelongated electro -responsive nanoparticle remains active at a\nrelatively low voltage of 5 V (0.08 V/\xc2\xb5m), however, this is the\nthreshold voltage. At this low voltage, the field strength is not\nstrong enough to cause complete rotation of the elongated\n\n8\nelectro -responsive nanoparticle. As seen in FIG. 6C, the elongated electro -responsive nanoparticle only rotates approximately 75\xc2\xb0.\nFIG. 6D is a graphical plot 640 depicting the predicted\n5 reorientation times of the elongated electro-responsive nanoparticle with an application of different applied voltages (60\nV, 40 V, 10 V, and 5 V). Again, the predicted reorientation\ntimes are faster than the measured reorientation times. For\nexample, at 60V and 5 V, the predicted reorientation times are\napproximately 700 \xc2\xb5s and 8500 \xc2\xb5s, respectively. In compari10\nson, the reorientation of the elongated electro -responsive\nnanoparticle at 5 V does not reach 90\xc2\xb0.\nIt should be emphasized that the above-described embodiments of the present disclosure are merely possible examples\nof implementations set forth for a clear understanding of the\n15 principles of the disclosure.
