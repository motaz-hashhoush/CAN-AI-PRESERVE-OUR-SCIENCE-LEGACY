Crosswind and wind parallel passes were made through the clouds, with data being taken on the ice crystal concentrations and sizes. A total of 141 penetrations of 26 separate days in temperatures ranging from -7 to -24 C were performed. Subsequent measurements were also made 100 km away from the mountain. The ice crystal concentrations measured showed good correlation with the ice nucleus content in winter time, midcontinental air masses in Wyoming. Further studies are recommended to determine if the variations in the ice nucleus population are the cause of the variability if ice crystal content.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19830068495, "endDate": "1982-11-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "Conference on Cloud Physics", "location": "Chicago, IL", "id": "13bd18a802ce40ceb5b113907b42f211", "startDate": "1982-11-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19830068495, "id": "b62cabf7bfa54f6d8e26592a38d40134", "publicationDate": "1982-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
