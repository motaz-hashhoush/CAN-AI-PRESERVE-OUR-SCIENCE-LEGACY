These fused\nquartz ampoules are used to house material samples\nsubject to thermal cycling from 20" C. to temperatures\nexceeding + 1ooo\'C. Presently, high temperature resistant adhesive cements are utilized to attach the fused\nquartz ampoules to the metal insertion-retrieval mechanism. Adhesives that can withstand the extreme temperatures contemplated for use with the present technique\nwould likely be of a ceramic origin and brittle. Thus,\nfailure of the adhesive connection may occur due to the\ndifferent coefficients of thermal expansion between the\nfused quartz and the metal insertion-retrieval rod. Also,\ncemented objects may not be reusable, leading to higher\ncosts and creating additional problems after each thermal cycling test.\nAlso, fused quartz to metal seals have been employed\nby fusing various transition materials such as Kovar and\nPyrex between the metal holder and the fused quartz\nand molybdenum to quartz seals can be made without\nthe use of a transition layer. Holders made with a transition material, as well as clamps employing O-ring type\nconnections have a limited temperature capability and\nare thus not suitable in the temperature cycling>tests\ncontemplated by the present invention. The molybdenum to fused quartz seals are not temperature limited,\nbut their formation involves a highly specialized process and is of limited availability. Each of these prior art\nsystems require construction of a new holding mechanism for each test operation.\nIt is therefore an object of the present invention to\nprovide a reusable novel connection or clamp mechanism between objects adapted to be subjected to thermal cycling.\nAnother object of the present invention is a novel\nreusable clamp for connecting two objects.\nA further object of the present invention is to provide\na clamp connection for two objects that will maintain a\nsnug connection therebetween throughout the temperature cycle of 20" C. to looo" C. and without danger of\nrupturing fragile test objects.\nAn additional object of the present invention is a\nmethod for releasably connecting a fused quartz object\nto a thermal cycling resistance insertion tool.\nA further object of the present invention is a clamp\nmechanism for a thermal cycling test object that will\nmaintain constant pressure on the test object during a\ntemperature cycle.\nAnother object of the present invention is to provide\na reusable retention mechanism for insertion and with-\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\ndrawal of a fused quartz object relative to a high temperature environment.\nAccording to the present invention the foiegoing and\nadditional objects are attained by providing a reusable\nclamp device integrally attached to or formed with a\ntemperature resistant metal insertionhetrieval rod or\nsting device and adapted to releasably retain a test fused\nquartz ampoule. The reusable clamp device is in the\nform of a sleeve having a first end portion integral with\nthe metal rod and a second end portion being a plurality\nof circumferentially disposed spaced fingers extending\nfrom and along the longitudinal axis of the first end\nportion. At least a portion of the spaced fingers are\nprovided with circumferentional exterior threads to\nreceive a threaded lock aut or collar thereon. As the\nlock nut is tightened, a squeezing or inwardly biasing\nforce is exerted on the fingers to cause a clamping force\nto be exerted on the portion of the fused quartz ampoule\npositioned within the fingers. A compressible seal or\npacking is provided between the quartz ampoule and\nthe fingers. This compressible seal. is selected from a\nmaterial which has an anisotropic thermal expansion\ncoefficient with negligible expansion in the plane of the\nquartz rod walls but a relatively large coefficient of\nexpansion in the radial direction to thereby maintain a\nsnug fit between the fused quartz material and the\nclamp when temperature cycled between 20\' C. and\nlooo" c.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION O F THE DRAWINGS\nA more complete appreciation of the invention and\nmany of the attendant advantages thereof will be better\nunderstood as the same becomes more readily apparent\nby reference to the following detailed description when\n35 considered in connection with the accompanying drawings, wherein:\nFIG. 1 is a sectional view of a portion of a reusable\nclamp device according to the present invention and a\nportion of the elongated insertionhetrieval extension\n# sting therefor;\nFIG. 2 is a part sectional view of the clamp shown in\nFIG. 1 in a operative position retaining two objects\ntogether;\nFIG. 3 is a sectional view of the device shown in\n45 FIG. 2 and taken along line 1 11 1 of FIG. 2; and\n1-1\nFIG. 4 is a view similar to FIG. 2 showing an alternate embodiment of the present invention.\n3o\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION O F THE\nINVENTION\n5\n0\nReferring now more particularly to the drawings,\nthere is shown (FIG. 1) a reusable clamp device generally designated by reference numeral 10. Clamp 10 is\nmachined from stainless steel, tantalum, Inconel (trade55 name for an alloy consisting essentially of 80% Ni, 14%\nCr and 6% Fe) or other equivalent heat resistant materials and is essentially in the form of a sleeve having a first\nportion 12 thereof being integral with an elongated tube\nor rod sting 14. Sting 14 is securely attached via sleeve\n60 16 to an automated furnace insertionhetrieval mechanism (not shown).\nA plurality of spaced fingers 18 form the other end of\nclamp 10 and extend from end 12 thereof. Fingers 18\n(six shown in the preferred embodiment) are tapered\n65 w e r the length thereof and are disposed in spaced cir. cumferential relationship about the longitudinal axis of\nclamp 10. A threaded segment 19 (FIGS. 1 and 2) is\nprovided on the exterior surface over a portion of the\n\n3\n\n4,49 1,427\n\nlength of fingers 18. Threaded segment 19 serves to\nreceive lock nut or collar 20 to circumferentially encompass fingers 18. As lock nut 20 is tightened by the\nthreaded connection, the trailing area thereof provides\nan increasingly inwardly biasing force along the circumference of fingers 18 due to the tapered construction thereof. This squeezing force is transmitted as a\nuniform grip to the fused quartz ampoule 25 (FIG. 2)\ndisposed within fmgers 18. A compressible graphite\ntype foil seal layer 27 having a relatively high radial\ncoefficient of thermal expansion is disposed between the\nfused quartz and the metal fingers 18 to thereby assure\na snug fit for a m w l e 25 during the thermal cycling\ntests. rn the preferred embodiment, foil 27 was Constructed of multiple layers of graphite foil tape of 0.005\ninch thickness. Foil tapes of this type are available, for\nexample, from the Union Carbide Corporation under\nthe tradename Grafoil and are available in the thickness\nrange of 0.005 to 0.020 inch. Any thickness within this\nrange would be suitable for use in practice of the present invention and in the illustrated embodiments Grafoil\n0.005 inch thickness was employed in multiple layer. In\naddition to providing a snug fit for the quartz ampoules\nOver the wide thermal cycling range. The foil layer 27\npermits a tight grip to be applied to ampoules 25 withOut endangering rupture or breakage thereof due to the\ncompressible shock absorbing physical property characteristics of the foil.\nIn FIG. 4 an alternate embodiment of the invention is\nshown and designated generally by reference numeral\n40.As shown therein, the entire length of fingers 48 are\nprovided with fine tapered threads for receiving lock\ncollar nut 50. This tapered threaded arrangement serves\nto provide adequate squeezing force on fingers 48 to\nretain the quartz test ampoule 55 therein and without\ndanger of rupturing the ampoule during thermal cycling\ntests. When desired, threads 48 may be formed on the\nsame radius (or non-tapered) and the cam surface 43 of\nnut 50 engages cam shoulder 44 to provide adequate\nsqueezing force on fingers 48 to retain ampoule 55 in\nposition. Again, a compressible graphite foil seal 47 is\nprovided between fingers 48 and test ampoule 55 to\ncompensate for the different coefficients of thermal\nexpansion between the quartz and metal clamp structures.\nDuring temperature cycling of the metal clamped\nquartz ampoules, both the ampoule and lock collar will\nbe expected to increase in diameter as the temperature\nincreases. Since any metal that can be considered useful\nfor practice of the present invention, Le., those having\nrelatively high coefficients of thermal expansion compared to that of fused quartz, a temperature increase\nwill be detrimental to maintaining a snug fit. The annular lock nut (20 or 50) will expand to a larger internal\ndiameter and even though the clamp fingers (18and 48)\nwill expand as slabs, the expansion of the fingers will\nnot match the void left by the expanding nut. However,\nby using the graphite foil tape with a large radial thermal expansion coeftieient as intervening layers, employed in the present invention, the greater expansion of\nthe foil will help maintain the snug fit between the fingers and test ampoule at all temperatures in the cycle.\nCalculations for the minimum graphite foil thickness\nrequired to compensate for the differing coefficients of\nthermal expansion between the quartz ampoules and the\nspecific clamp embodiments of the present invention\nhave been made and are readily reproducible for specific clamp ampoule dimensions. The coefficients of\n\n4\n\nthermal expamion for the specific examples described\nherein were:\n5\n\n~\n\n~\n\n~\n\n~\n\n"\n\ntantalumctamps\ngraphite foil radial\n(Grafoil)\ngraphrte fad*\n\n10\n\nI\n\n) to quartz ~\n~\n\nE\n\n~\n\n0.55\n\nt\n\nx 10-6/"c.\n"\n\n= 6.5 x 10-6/"C.,\n= 21 x IO-b/*C..\nE -0.4 % 10 6/"C (20\' C.-1090" C )\n0.5 x 1 -(\'/"C. (1090\'c.-2200" C . ) and\n0\n\n(~\n\n~\n\n~\n\n14x IO 6/oCc,\n\nVarious changes and modifications in the specific\nexamples are considered within the scope Of the inven15 tion. For example, Sting 14 may be a solid rod Or tubular\nand may be constructed of any material having the\nthermal resistant properties necessary to be utilized in\nthe temperature range disclosed herein- Also, this ternP r t w e range may be expanded as SO required for sPe20-CifiC tests. A% clamp 10 may be n~&~ined\ndirectly\nfrom sting element 14 Or it may be formed separately\nand integrally secured to sting 14 in a Conventional\nminner.\nIt is thus seen that the present invention as described\n25 herein is directed to specific embodiments thereof\nwhich are given merely to illustrate the invention and\nare not intended to serve as exhaustive examples\nthereof. The materials employed in these specific embodiments are also given to comply with the statutory\n30 requirements of preferred embodiment description and\nare not intended to serve as limitations on applicants\'\nbroad inventive concept as defined in the appended\nclaims. Also, although the specific clamps described\nherein show six fingers as the holding mechanism, the\n35 increase or decrease of this number is considered within\nthe scope of the invention as claimed. Also, although\nthe graphite foil was used in this embodiment, any anisotropic material with a high radial thermal expansion\ncoefficient is considered within the scope of this inven40 tion.\nIt is therefore to be understood that various niodifications and variations of the present invention will be\napparent :o those skilled in the art without departing\nfrom the spirit and scope of the appended claims.\nWhat is claimed as new and desired to be secured by\n45\nLetters Patent of the United States is:\n1.
