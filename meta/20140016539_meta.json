While large efforts have been expended on studying, bounding, and modeling the orbital performance of the insulation systems, little effort has been expended on the ground hold and ascent phases of a mission. Historical cryogenic in-space systems that have flown have been able to ignore these phases of flight due to the insulation system being within a vacuum jacket. In the development phase of the Nuclear Mars Vehicle and the Shuttle Nuclear Vehicle, several insulation systems were evaluated for the full mission cycle. Since that time there had been minimal work on these phases of flight until the Constellation program began investigating cryogenic service modules and long duration upper stages. With the inception of the Cryogenic Propellant Storage and Transfer Technology Demonstration Mission, a specific need was seen for the data and as such, several tests were added to the Cryogenic Boil-off Reduction System liquid hydrogen test matrix to provide more data on a insulation system. Testing was attempted with both gaseous nitrogen (GN2) and gaseous helium (GHe) backfills. The initial tests with nitrogen backfill were not successfully completed due to nitrogen liquefaction and solidification preventing the rapid pumpdown of the vacuum chamber. Subsequent helium backfill tests were successful and showed minimal degradation. The results are compared to the historical data.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20140016539, "endDate": "2014-07-30T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "Reston, VA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "70f2a14996c24254bba169ff9b8215f4", "id": "35e277a02abc4698a748af8575436e8f"}], "name": "Propulsion and Energy Forum 2014", "location": "Cleveland, OH", "id": "70f2a14996c24254bba169ff9b8215f4", "startDate": "2014-07-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20140016539, "id": "163c05466fb646dc8ed0bfb472632482", "publicationDate": "2014-07-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20140016539.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20140016539/downloads/20140016539.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20140016539/downloads/20140016539.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20140016539/downloads/20140016539.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
