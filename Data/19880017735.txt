This\naffiliation encouraged state-of-the-art\ninnovations in the field. A few years\nlater, NASA recognized the terrestrial\npotential of aerospace technology and\nestablished the Technology Utilization\nProgram.\nSince its inception, the Technology\nUtilization Program has spawned\nthousands of spinoff products ranging\nfrom automotive engines to frozen food\nwrappers. This spinoff success inspired\nthe 1980 Stevenson-Wydler Act, which\nformalized the Government\'s affiliation\nwith American business by requiring all\nFederal research laboratories to actively\ntransfer new technology to the private\nsector. As a result of NASA\'s\nachievements, other Federal laboratories\nmodeled the Technology Utilization\nProgram. The 1986 amendment to the\nStevenson-Wydler Act expanded the\nTechnology Utilization Program by\nsetting aside Government funds for\nservice to the private sector.\n\n-Space\n\nAct, 1958\nThe Technology Utilization Program\nroutinely offers NASA\'s research to any\nUnited States company that seeks NASA\'s\nknow-how. However, few citizens are\naware that NASA offers its expertise to\nAmerican entrepreneurs who run parttime businesses from a garage as\nfrequently as it advises large computer\nmanufacturers. Most requests, in fact,\ninvolve ordinary technical problems.\nFor example, a pottery firm maly seek\nan insulating material for maintaining\nuniform temperatures in their kilns.\nPerhaps they are testing a new ceramic\nand need research information. A\ntechnology utilization officer may solve\nthe problem in a series of telephone\nconversations or by referring the\nrequestor to a knowledgeable scientist.\nThe Technology Utilization officer can\nalso recommend other NASA field\ncenters and over 300 federal research\nlaboratories.\nThis brochure details the services of\nthe Technology Utilization Program and\nhighlights spinoff products in various\nstages of completion. With a little\ningenuity, the next successful NASA\nspinoff can be yours.\n\nAblative rocket chamber\n\nmIGIML PAGE\n\nm\n\nR PHO.mRAPH\n\nContents\nThe Lewis Research Center\nNASA\'s Technology Utilization Program\nTechnology Utilization Services\nFrom the Research Laboratory to the Marketplace\nA New Engine for the Automotive Industry\nCutting Power Costs for UHF-TV Stations\nJet Fuel Conservation Serves the World of Sports\nReinforced Plastic for High Temperature Applications\nGiving New Life to Lady Liberty\nFrom Fuel Pumps to Heart Pumps\nResources\nAcknowledgments\n\nAerial view of NASA\'s Lewis Research Center\n\nThe Lewis Research Center\nReaching for the Stars\nDuring the past 46 years, thousands of\nLewis Research Center employees have\nworked on projects for America\'s aerospace program. While some of their\ninnovations head toward the stars, many\nof their products have been recognized\nby the research community here on Earth.\nFor example, each year Research G\nDevelopment magazine recognizes 100\nof the most significant new technical\nproducts. Since 1966, 53 products from\nLewis have received the distinguished\n"IR-100" Award. On the all-time\nwinner\'s list, Lewis ranks fifth, and\nNASA as a whole ranks second with 73\nawards. Considering that the other\nmembers of the top five are Fortune 500\ncompanies (General Electric, Varian\nAssociates, and Westinghouse), this is a\nnotable achievement.\nWhile NASA\'s mission is to develop\ntechnology "for the benefit of all\nmankind, " the Lewis Research Center is\nNASA\'s primary field center for aircraft,\nrocket, and automotive propulsion. In\nrecent years Lewis has taken the lead in\npower generation and space\ncommunications programs. These areas\nprovide Lewis\' scientists and engineers\nwith the opportunity for sharing their\nnew technology with their countrymen.\nThe following overview of the research\ndirectorates describes the broad range of\nprograms being conducted at Lewis.\n\nThe Aeronautics Directorate\nSince 1941 the Aeronautics Directorate\nhas been a pioneer in developing\n\nadvanced aircraft propulsion systems. Its\nresearch is divided into a theory group\nand an applications group. The Internal\nFluid Mechanics Division focuses on\ncomputational methods and computer\nmodeling. The Propulsion Systems\nDivision emphasizes research and\ndevelopment in applications such as gasturbine engines, rotary engines,\nadvanced high-speed turboprops,\nrotorcraft, propeller technology, and\naircraft icing. The Heart of aerospace\nresearch includes high-temperature, highstrength materials, fluid dynamics\nreaction kinetics, heat transfer, acoustics,\ncombustion, and aerodynamics.\n\nThe Aerospace Technology\nDirectorate\nThe Materials Division develops\nadvanced materials to support Lewis\'\naerospace mission. High-temperature\nmetal alloys, metal composites, ceramics,\nand high-temperature polymers are\ntested for aircraft engines, and\nlightweight composites are tested for\naerospace structures. Bearings and\nlubrication materials are also studied.\nThe Microgravity Materials Science\nLaboratory supports NASA\'s planning for\nlow-gravity research projects for the\nspace station.\nAs a companion to the Materials\nDivision, the Structures Division\nspecializes in structural mechanics,\nfatigue, fracture mechanics, struc1:ural\ndynamics, structural integrity, and\nadvanced concepts.\n\nThe Power Technology Division\ndevelops power generation systems. Its\nresearch programs encompass photovoltaics, energy storage, space systems,\nnuclear systems, fuel cells, and the\nStirling cycle engine. The division is also\nworking on improving the electrical\nproperties of advanced materials.\nThe Space Electronics Division does\nresearch in all areas of space electronics\nand communications, including antenna\nsystems, electron-beam technology,\nsuperconductivity, and solid-state and\ndigital-systems technology.\nThe Space Propulsion Technology\nDivision develops electric propulsion\nsystems for deep-space vehicles and for\nthe space station. This division is also\nconcerned with tracking satellites.\n\nThe Space Flight Systems\nDirectorate\nThis directorate focuses on specific\nspaceflight projects rather than general\n\nThe arc-spray technique, an IR-100 Award winner\n\nresearch. For example, NASA\'s\nworkhorse, the Atlas Centaur is one of\nthe country\'s most successful launch\nvehicles. The Advanced Communications\nTechnology Satellite Project Office has\nthe mission of developing higher\ncapacity communications satellites.\nTechnical areas include high-frequency\nelectronics and solid-state technology\nwith emphasis on high-speed switching\ncircuits.\n\nThe Space Station Systems\nDirectorate\nThe design and construction of the\nelectrical system for the space station is\nthe primary mission for this directorate.\nThe electrical system will include\nbatteries, photovoltaics, and solar\ndynamics. If the space station houses an\ninternational crew, the system will need\nto accommodate a wide variety of\nvoltages and frequencies.\n\nTesting ceramic coatings in Mach 0.3 combustion rig\n\nNASA\'s Technology Utilization Program\nA Pot of Gold for American Industry\nWhether you\'re tackling a small project\nor a major venture, the Technology\nUtilization Program is eager to share\nNASA\'s products and procedures with\nyou. While TU officers do not act as\ngeneral consultants, they do serve two\nmajor audiences: entrepreneurs and\nindustry. First, the officers seek\nAmerican entrepreneurs with ideas for\ninnovative products or markets. Second,\nthey provide technical solutions for\nindustries with existing products or\nmanufacturing processes.\nWhile you\'ve heard the saying "There\n\\\nis no free lunch," the Technology\nUtilization Program is an exception to\nthat rule. You will be pleased to learn\nthat, in general, NASA does not charge\nfor this pot of gold at the end of the\nresearch rainbow. However, there may\n\nAircraft thrust bearings\n\nbe a nominal licensing fee for the use of\npatented inventions.\nJust as a business associate may refer\nyou to a resource, the Technology\nUtilization Program acts as a resource for\nNASA technology. The TU Program goes\none step further, however, by developing\na client relationship. If two companies\nhave a mutual interest in a product,\nNASA may bring those companies\ntogether. Otherwise, all requests are\nconfidential. Finally, paperwork is\nrequired only when patent fees are\ninvolved.\nSince American tax dollars support\nNASA\'s research, TU officers are\nenthusiastic in assisting the private\nsector. Successful NASA spinoffs\npromote competition and boost the\neconomy by creating new jobs.\n\nAdvanced turboprop model in the Lewis 8- by 6-Foot Supersonic Wind Tunnel\n\nTechnology Utilization Services\nWe\'d like you to think of NASA as\na resource.\n-Daniel G. Soltis\nEvery NASA field center has a\nTechnology Utilization Office. Contacting\nany center will connect you to NASA\'s\nnetwork of information and services.\nWith a bit of imagination, you may be\nthe next entrepreneur or company to\nintroduce a new product to the\nAmerican marketplace.\n\nTechnology Utilization\nOfficers\nExpert help in applying\nNASA\'s innovations to your\nneeds\nTechnology Utilization officers will\nmatch your needs with the scientists and\nengineers who can assist you in solving\nyour technical problems. The TU officer\nwill also provide you with special\npublications detailing NASA\'s research.\n\nApplications Teams\nProblem-solving assistance to\nthe private sector\nStaffed by professionals, applications\nteams work to identify problems that\nmight be solved by NASA technology.\nThese teams have conducted projects in\nthe areas of safety, health, transportation, and environmental protection.\n\nCOSMIC\nAn affordable source of\nNASA\'s computer programs\nThe Computer Software Management\nand Information Center, COSMIC, is a\nlibrary of thousands of computer\nprograms and their documentation. For\na nominal fee, you can access a variety\nof programs. General purpose programs\ninclude management and computer\noperations. Engineering programs\nperform tasks such as structural analysis,\nelectronic circuit design, chemical\nanalysis, and fluid systems design. Other\nprograms determine building energy\nrequirements and optimize mineral\nexploration.\n\nInventions for Licensing\nThousands of inventions\navailable for licensing in the\nUnited States\nTo promote competition, NASA\nencourages nonexclusive licenses for\ncommercial use of its inventions. If you\ninvest your resources in the early\ncommercial stages of an invention, an\nexclusive license may be granted.\nGenerally, an exclusive license is issued\nfor 5 to 10 years and requires royalties\nbased on sales or use.\n\nBearings\n\nScientific and Technical\nInformation Facility\nA centralized office serving\nthe professional community\nand the general public\n\n(STAC \'s).

First, potential markets\nfor the product are identified. After the\nproduct is designed, the production\ntechniques are developed. Finally, the\nproduct is test marketed and advertised.\nMost often, the market research and\nproduct development is performed by\nthe entrepreneur. In this instance, NASA\nfunctions as an information resource.\nOccasionally, however, the private\nsector may not have the facilities\nnecessary to adapt the aerospace\ntechnology. In this situation, the\nTechnology Utilization Office may\ndesign an applications project in which\n\nNASA takes an active role in\ncommercializing the technology.\nApplications projects are tailored to\nthe product and the company. \'The\nfollowing spinoff stories illustrate the\ndiversity and the stages of the\ntechnology utilization process. The\nStirling engine project illustrates the\nexperimental phase of the process. The\nklystron tube and riblet film projects\npresent the final development and\nmarketing stages. In the case of\nferrofluids and PMR-15, the products\nhave been on the market for years.\nFinally, IC 53 1 represents 20th century\ntechnology preserving 19th century\ncraftsmanship.\n\nAir-ow straighteners in a NASA wind tunnel\n\n19\n\n\' I \'\n\n.\n\n:I\nI .\n\n\'1\n\ni ,\n\nC R I G M L PAGE\n\nrnllR PHOTa$RAPH\n\nI\n\nA New Engine for the Automotive Industry\nTbe Stirling Engine\n\nNASA has been the ky to\nlegitimizing the Stirling engine.\nNASA\'s impetus brought the Stirling\ntechnology from the Smithsonian to\nprivate industry.\n-Greg Gutgsell\' Stirling Engine\nProject Manager, Deere G Company\nTechnology utilization in\nprogress\nImagine your automobile never\nneeding an oil change, getting 41 mpg\nand accelerating from 0 to 60 mph in\nless than 13 seconds. Imagine your\nautomobile without an exhaust system\nand with 50 percent fewer moving parts\nthan a piston engine automobile. Such a\nmachine would run cooler and would be\neasier to manufacture. Finally, since this\nengine would not be dependent on\npetroleum products, you could grow the\nfuel in your own backyard.\nYou might be surprised to discover\nthat this "heat-cycle engine" is displayed\n\nat the Smithsonian National History\nMuseum. Designed in the early 1800\'s,\nthe Stirling engine was not considered\nfor modern day use until the energy\ncrisis of the 1970\'s. Since the Stirling\ncan burn fuels ranging from natural gas\nto hardwood, NASA and the Department\nof Energy considered breathing new life\ninto this antique technology. Before a\ncommercial product could be brought to\nmarket, though, the energy crisis eased.\nIn the late 1970\'s the technical\ncommunity sparked renewed interest in\nthe Stirling. Deere & Company, the\nlargest diesel manufacturer in the\nWestern World, was tracking novel\nmeans of propulsion. Mechanical\nTechnology, Inc., a prominent\ntechnological innovator, had created a\nmodern version of the Stirling. And at\nNASA\'s Lewis Research Center in\nCleveland, engineers were pursuing\npower sources for space applications.\nThrough a series of conferences, NASA\nengineers drew MTI and Deere into the\nStirling engine project as potential\nmanufacturers. Since the Stirling equals\n\nO R I G M C PAGE\n-OR\nPWKERAPH\n\n-.\n.:\n,\n\nSHrlfng-engine-pow& &livery van\n4\n\n.\n\n.\n\nStirling engines have the potential to generate electricityfor space applications.\n\nor surpasses the most efficient diesel\nengine, Deere committed to evaluating\nand testing a Stirling engine mounted in\na delivery van.\nTest results from the prototype\npromise excitement for the automotive\nindustry. In tests at Langley Air Force\nBase, the Stirling-powered van reached\nhighway speeds and demonstrated\nsurprising torque response. At present, \'\nDeere is in the process of convening a\nlaboratory engine into a commercial\nproduct. If Deere can define the\npotential market and profitability of a\nStirling engine delivery van, American\nconsumers may be driving a Stirlingpowered vehicle before the end of this\ncentury.\n\nFew Americans are aware that NASA\nacts as a goodwill ambassador to\nAmerican enterprise. In the case of the\nStirling engine, a research group from\nNASA Lewis presented the merits of the\nStirling to manufacturers and customers.\nAs a result of their efforts, the U.S. Air\nForce, the Department of Energy, MTI,\nand Deere have partnered with NASA in\nthe Automotive Stirling Engine Program.\nPotential customers include the Air Force,\nPurolator Courier, the American Trucking\nAssociation, and the U.S. Postal Service.\nThe Stirling engine, however, is just\none of many products that NASA\'s\nTechnology Utilization Program is\ntransferring from the aerospace industry\nto the private sector.\n\nMultistage depressed-collector klystron tube\n\nCutting Power Costs for UHF Television Stations\nThe Klystron Tube\nWorking with NASA has been a\nvery positive experience.\n-Earl McCune, Klystron Tube\nProject Manager,\nVarian Associates, Inc.\n\nTechnology utilization coming\ninto the home stretch\nHave you ever wondered why UHF\ntelevision stations don\'t transmit the\nsame picture quality as the major\nnetworks? One reason is that television\ntransmitters are less efficient at UHF\nfrequencies.\nBecause UHF stations broadcast at a\nhigher frequency, a typical 2-millionwatt UHF station spends about $150,000\na year for electricity-five times the\namount a VHF station spends. To save\nmoney, UHF stations broadcast at\nreduced power. If you live within their\nbroadcast range, you probably don\'t\nnotice any difference in the quality of a\nUHF picture. But at greater distances,\nwatching UHF stations can be more like\nlistening to the radio.\nIronically, radio technology provided\nthe basis for cutting UHF power\nconsumption costs by 50 percent. In the\nearly 1970\'s the NASA Lewis Research\nCenter developed a radio wave amplifier\nthat improved communications satellite\n\ntransmissions. The Technology\nUtilization Office and the research\nengineers set the stage for relaying this\nsatellite technology back to the\nAmericans who had funded the project.\nSince the early days of television, UHF\nstations have used klystron tubes to\namplify their signals. Recognizing that\nthis new radio wave amplifier\ntechnology would apply directly to the\nklystron tube, Lewis targeted its research\nfor the UHF industry. With certain\nmodifications, Lewis hoped to improve\nthe energy-saving klystron tubes used by\nUHF stations.\nVarian Associates, Inc., the largest\nmanufacturer of klystron tubes in North\nAmerica, recognized an opportunity to\nupgrade its product and joined tlhe test\nproject. Within 3 years, the venture\ncycled from computer simulations to a\ndemonstration of the completed\nproduct-the multistage depressedcollector klystron.\nExpected to be on the market by 1990,\nthe enhanced klystron tube could save\nthat 2-million-watt UHF station $75,000\nper year. Nationwide, UHF stations could\nsave an estimated $25 million a year.\nHow will this technology benefit\nAmericans? UHF stations will broadcast a\nbetter-quality picture, and PBS patrons\nmay notice a decrease in membership\ndrives.\n\nJet Fuel Conservation Efforts Serving\nthe World of Sports\n?\'Be riblet film provided a\nszgnaficant reduction in friction\ndrag that translated into higher\nboat speed.\n-John Marshall, coordinator of the\nStars 81 Stripes Design Team\n\nClassic technology utilization\nOn February 5, 1987, the racing yacht\nStars G Stripes overwhelmed Australia\'s\nKookaburra 11with a 4-0 sweep and\n1\n\nwon the coveted sailing prize, the\nAmerica\'s Cup. At the 1984 Los Angeles\nOlympics, the United States surprised the\nsports world by winning the silver\nmedal in the four-oar-with-coxswain\nrowing event. In both cases an\nunderwater advantage gave the\nAmericans an edge over the foreign\ncompetition.\nApplied to the hull of each vessel was\na layer of riblet film. Tests by the Stars\nand Stripes design team showed that the\nfilm added an estimated \'/i knot to the\nspeed of the boat. At the Olympics, with\nthe competition under way, engineers\nworked against the clock to apply the\nriblet film to the unseeded American\'s\nrowing shell. The results? Laurels for the\nUnited States teams.\n\nThe riblet technology resulted from\nNASA Langley Research Center\'s\nexploration of new ways to improve an\nairplane\'s fuel efficiency. Experiments\nshowed that etching V-shaped grooves\non an airplane\'s surface reduced windfriction drag.\nIn. 1980 a 3 Company engineer\nM\ndiscovered an article about the riblet\ntechnology in the TU publication NASA\nTech Briefs. Originally, the riblets were\nmachined on flat aluminum. The engineer\nsuggested molding the grooves onto a\nlightweight plastic film, adding an\nadhesive backing, and pressing the sticky\nfilm onto the skin of an airplane, thereby\nproviding an affordable modification.\nAfter talking with the Technology\nUtilization Office, 3M offered to design,\nproduce, and test the riblets.\nEncouraged by the results of wind\ntunnel tests, 3M reported its findings to\nthe Boeing Company, the world\'s largest\nproducer of commercial aircraft. At\npresent, 3M and Boeing are working to\nbring the riblet technology to cornmercia1 aviation. If they are successful, riblet\nfilm could translate into a fuel saving of\n$200 million to $300 million per year.\n\nApplying ribletfilm to a racing sbell\n\nStars C Str\n\nHigh-temperature turbine blades for advanced gas-turbine engines\n\nReinforced Plastic for High-Temperature\nApplications\nNASA responded to our customer\'s\n\nneed for bigher temperature resins\nin their jet engines.\n-Walter Brueggemann,\nMaterials Scientist,\nFerro Corporation\nBenefits for the aerospace\nindustry\nGeneral Electric uses prepregs in jet\nengines. Hamilton Standard uses\nprepregs in jet engine nozzles. The\nsupersonic wind tunnel at Arnold\nEngineering Development Center uses\nprepregs. In fact, the aerospace industry\nrelies on prepregs, but what are they?\nPrepregs are materials that are\nimpregnated with a resin.\n\nTesting a high-temperature composite material\n\nWith the significant cost of jet fuel,\none of the goals of aerospace research is\nto decrease the weight of airplanes,\nthereby increasing fuel efficiency. In an\neffort to create lightweight, highstrength, and low-cost materials, Lewis\nResearch Center developed an\nimpregnating resin, PMR- 15, that\nenhanced the temperature resistance of\ncomposites to a service ,temperature of\n600 O . Through the efforts of the\nF\nTechnology Utilization Office, Ferro\nCorporation, a leader in specialized\ncomposite materials, obtained the\nformula for PMR- 15. After experimenting with the formula, Ferro\ndeveloped a new material known as\n.. Ferropreg CPI 2237 R. With its\nresistance to high temperature, this\ncomposite material found acceptance in\naircraft engines and structures.\n\nGiving New Life to Lady Liberty\nNASA\'s IC 531 formula is a permanent solution to steel corrosion.\nThis technology will save millions\nof dollars in steel repair and\nreplacement around the world.\n-Parke Schaffer, Jr , President\nInorganic Coatings, Inc.\nTechnology utilization and\nindustry-partners in\nrestoration\nWhen you think of the Statue of\nLiberty, you think of the symbols that\nrepresent the fabric of the United\nStates-freedom, opportunity, independence. You probably do not think of\nthe space shuttle. However, the launch\ngantries at the Kennedy Space Center\nprovided the stimulus for Lady Liberty\'s\ncorrosion-resistant coating.\nIn 1980 the National Park Service\ndiscovered corrosion and deterioration\nin the century-old Statue of Liberty.\nThey set out on a 7-month search for a\ncorrosion-resistant coating that would\n\nprotect the statue for the next 100 years.\nThe search ended when Inorganic\nCoatings, Inc., introduced them to IC\n53 1, a permanent coating developed by\nNASA.\nGoddard Space Flight Center had\ndeveloped a coating to protect launch\ngantries from the environment and the\nhot rocket exhaust of a space launch.\nThrough a series of events, Inorganic\nCoatings, Inc., became the sole manufacturer and named the coating IC 5 3 1.\nNontoxic and nonflammable, IC 53 1\ncreates a hard ceramic finish with\nexcellent abrasion resistance-durable\nenough to preserve the 300-foot statue\nfor centuries.\nThe statue\'s designer, Frederic\nBertholdi, boasted that his creation\nwould last as long as the pyramids of\nthe Nile. However, he did not reckon\nwith the environment and two million\nvisitors a year. So while Lady Liberty\nrepresents the craftsmanship of 19th\ncentury engineers, the technology of\n20th century engineers preserves that\nachievement.\n\nFrom Fuel Pumps to Heart Pumps\n\nNASA technology launched not just\n\na single company but a new\nindustry.\n-Ronald Moskowitz, president of\nFerrofluidics Corporation\nA pay-off for risk-taking\n\nscientists\nIf you were a gambler, would you\ninvest in a company that didn\'t have\nproducts or customers? Maybe, you say.\nWhat if that company\'s idea was to\nsolve manufacturing problems with\nmagnetized fluids? Well again, maybe\nnot.\nIf you had invested in Ferrofluidics\nCorporation in 1969, you might have\nlost your shirt. Sales that year were\n$65,000. But if you had taken the risk,\ntoday you could retire on your\ndividends. The Ferrofluidics story is a\nstriking example of the technology\nutilization process spinning off a new\ncompany and creating new jobs.\nIn the early days of the United States\nspace program, a Lewis Research Center\nscientist discovered a solution to the\n\nTechnician examining a microcircuit\n\nproblem of sending weightless fuel to\nthe engine of an orbiting spacecraft.\nMagnetizing the fuel allowed it to be\ndrawn into the engine by a magnet.\nThese iron-enriched fluids were called\nferrofluids.\nIn the mid-1960\'s Avco Space Systems\nDivision faced a different problem. With\none side of the spacecraft facing the sun\nand the other facing away from the sun,\ntemperature control was crucial.\nBlending their expertise with NASA\nresearch, Avco developed a ferrofluid\nthat cooled the hot side and warmed the\ncold side of an orbiting spacecraft.\nTwo enterprising Avco scientists\nrealized that ferrofluids offered vast\nproblem-solving potential in areas other\nthan spaceflight. With a license from\nNASA for the technology, they left Avco\nin 1969 and formed Ferrofluidics Corporation. In their first year, they used\nferrofluids to solve a manufacturing\nproblem in the sealing of computer chips.\nSince that time, ferrofluids have been\nused as cooling agents in stereo speakers\nand are finding growing acceptance in\nareas that range from artificial heart\npumps to automated machine tools.\n\nComputer-controlled machining of a transition duct\n\nResources\nTechnology Utilization\nOfficers\nLeonard A.
