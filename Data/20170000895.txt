LCUSP will do this by (1) developing a copper alloy additive manufacturing design process, (2)\ndeveloping a new Nickel Jacket additive manufacture/application process (3) additive manufacture of a 35K-class regenerative\nchamber/nozzle, (4) testing chamber and then chamber/nozzle system in a hot fire resistance test.\n\nIntegration with other projects/programs and partnerships\nLiquid Propulsion System (LPS) Test Bed (being developed at MSFC with additive\nmanufactured components such as injectors, LOx and H2 Turbopumps plans to utilize\nthe LCUSP Combustion Chamber or utilize the capability established under this project\nto fabricate a chamber. Test and Fabrication Data infused into Lander Technology\nOffice methane thruster work. Follow-on regen Methane Engine Thrust Assembly for\n4K lbf (META4) chamber design utilized SLM GRCop-84 process developed by LCUSP\nand incorporates LCUSP chamber mid-line weld design to enable required\nlength. LCUSP printed faceplate provided strength, conductivity, and oxidation\nresistance needed for staged combustion testing in a much shorter time than it would\nhave taken to procure stock and machine a traditionally fabricated GRCop faceplate,\nallowing MSFC to provide the first US data to USAF SMC. Industry partners are\ninvestigating possible partnerships with LCUSP for possible opportunities for fabrication\nof SLM combustion chambers to reduce cost of engine development.\n\nTechnology Infusion Plan:\nPC, Propulsion, HEOMD, Potential use in\nmanufacturing process of flight engines\n2017.

The interface samples have been fabricated and machined and will be\ntested in May. A bigger issue has arisen with leaks identified in Unit 2. The leaks were found post HIP at the\nends of the chamber and is suspected to have occurred during tooling extraction or HIP. Fault analysis and\nUnit 2 fix are being investigated at this time. CT scans show majority of the EBF3 application was done well,\nthe end effects/crack can be mitigated and Unit 1 forward section was successful and had no leakage.

The owner of the\nmachine shop building has started updating the building and will need the building\naround mid-April/ early-March. 2016 This risk affects meeting the milestones associated\nwith ACME-3.

Machine shops need to be identified and confirmed that they\ncan accommodate fabrication requests. Any transportation needs should be identified.\nSecondary equipment needed for the assembly and integration need to be identified and\nconfirmed or bought.\nStatus 01/12//2017 Updated LxC from 1x4 to 3x4 resulting in an increasing trend. The closure\ndate was updated from 01/18/2017 to 01/31/2017. The new facility space does not have\nwater. The project will need to supply water tanks (approx. 500 gallons per tank) and a\npump. At least one tank will be needed to hold clean water and at least three will be\nneeded to hold used water. Used water cannot be drained on-site. Used water tanks will\nneed to be hauled away by the heavy lift organization. Heavy lift could be prioritized to\nassist with SLS and cause a delay with hauling away the water tanks. Used water tanks\nwill be cleaned and brought back. Three-phase power for operation of the ACES-3\nsystem will need to be brought in. USACE is providing an M100 power distribution\npanel but the project will need to locate a power source. These issues could impact\ncost and schedule. The project would like to begin fabrication based on preliminary\ndrawings. EV is suggesting to wait until issued drawings are released before any\nfabrication.

CCC provided analytical\nmodels for the team to review. The team has provided feedback to CCC. The current\ndesign and fabrication method for the ACES-3 nozzle requires additive manufacturing\n(AM). Using AM may require the material of the nozzle to be changed to better suit the\nfabrication process. A material change will result in a requirements change, but this is a\nminimal impact.

The accumulator for ACME-2 does work as intended.\nThe materials used for ACES-2 and ACME-2 are different, so it is unknown if a one-forone comparison can be assumed.\nStatus 01/12/2017 Planned testing using the ACES-2 accumulator that would generate\npotential design data may be impacted by available resources (e.g. workforce).

This can\naffect the printing process because of complications like clogging or binding. Having a\ndesign that allows for easy extraction and removal of the hose for cleaning purposes is\nideal. The CDR for the gantry system that encompasses the hose design will occur in\nearly December.\nStatus 01/12/2017 CLOSED Testing was performed using the energy chain that will be used\nfor hose management.
