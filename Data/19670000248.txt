b'July 1967\n\n\t\n\nBrief 67-10248\n\nNASA TECH BRIEF\nNASA Tech Briefs are issued to summarize specific innovations derived from the U.S. space program,\nto encourage their commercial application. Copies are available to the public at 15 cents each\nfrom the Clearinghouse for Federal Scientific and Technical Information, Springfield, Virginia 22151.\n\nRectilinear Display Gives Acceleration Load Factor\r\nand Velocity Information\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nA spacecraft entry monitoring system (EMS) is developed to provide a rectilinear display of acceleration load factor and velocity information to which an\nastronaut may respond with manual spacecraft attitude corrective maneuver commands.\nThe display is derived from a commercially available tape that has a pattern corresponding to critical\nflight data imprinted on one side and an emulsion\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National\nAeronautics and Space Administration. Neither the United States\nGovernment nor any person acting on behalf of the United States\n\nbonded to the other side. The tape is contained in a\nscroll-type assembly and is driven horizontally according to electrical inputs to the X-axis motor. A vertical\ndevice (Y-axis) is located at a point behind the tape\non which a scribe is driven proportional to electrical\ninputs to the Y-axis motor. The scribe removes the\nemulsion from the tape to produce the X-Y trace as\nthe tape translates in the X- (horizontal) direction and\n\nGovernment assumes any liability resulting from the use of the\ninformation contained in this document, or warrants that such use\nwill be free from privately owned rights.\n\nthe scribe moves in the Y- (vertical) direction\nNotes:1. Application of this display technique is practically\nunlimited since it rectilinearly displays two variables. Nature of the variables impose no limitations\nso long as the axes of the display are properly\ndriven. Criteria imprinted on the tape may be color\ncoded if desired and their nature is limited only\nby the terms of the two variables used to drive the\ndisplay axes. Because the display employs a scroll\ntechnique, criteria on the tape could include multiple variables and scalings, provided the inputs to\nthe driven axes are compatible.\n\nBrief 67-10248\t\n\n2.
