b'Makidi I\nNitou Makidi\nAugust 16, 2012\nSummer Final Report\nThe summer of2012 has been filled with many memorable events and activities. As an\nintern, I had responsibilities that had to be fulfilled. My tour of duty was completed as an\nadministrative student trainee in the Information Technology and Communications Services\nBusiness Office (IT-A). In accordance with the Business Objectives and Agreement ofthe\nBusiness Office and my performance plan, I was to provide business office support, improve\nbusiness, project management, and technical work processes. With this being stated, I supported\na project called "The Big Move Project" (TBMP), which will take course over the next several\nyears. The Big Move Project is the planning of the Information Technology (IT) Directorate\'s\nrelocation to various buildings in the course of upcoming years, when designs and the building of\nCentral Campus have been completed. Working directly with my supervisor and the project\nmanager, I was responsible for gathering both administrative and operational area requirements\nfor the Information Technology (IT) Directorate, along with its outsourced support and\ncontractors, such as IMCS, NICS, and ACES. My first action was to create rubrics that will serve\nas a guideline for the information that should be given by each branch of IT. After receiving that\ninformation via a few KAITS actions, I was able to start the consolidation process, and begin\nworking on a presentation. A SharePoint was created shortly after for others to view the\nprogression of the project, which I managed. During the consolidation ofthis information, I\nwould occasionally present to the IT Deputy Director and IT Chiefs. The draft of this\npresentation was shown to employees of Center Operations (T A) and stakeholders-IT Chief\nOfficers and contractor managers-in the relocation of IT to make them aware of what\nrequirements must be met that will enable IT to be accommodated appropriately in the design of\nCentral Campus Phase 11-the time in which IT and its contractors are scheduled to be relocated.\nBesides supporting TBMP, I also supported the Section 508 Policy Compliance\nCoordinator, R. Liang. Section 508 is a policy that requires employers to implement accessibility\nassurance of information and technology to disabled communities. On Thursday, July 19, 2012,\nI was able to go to Camp Boggy Creek-a camp for disabled children-for an education\noutreach, in collaboration with the Education Office. We shared with them information about\n\nMakidi 2\nhow astronauts live and work in space, they were able to ride hovercrafts, build paper rockets,\nand then launch them outside. Although this outreach was quite fun with the kids at the camp,\nthis was a learning opportunity to gain some insight to those with cognitive and physical\ndisabilities, the problems they typically face, and in tum, how to accommodate those with\ndisabilities in the work environment. In the process of implementing accessibility and Section\n508 compliance, I attended various teleconferences, did field runs to supply closed-caption call\nphones to employees with limited hearing, and helped with the development of the charter ofthe\nSection 508 Compliance Working Group.\n\n'
