A\nrotary-percussive sample acquisition device was developed with an emphasis on\ntoughness and robustness to handle the\nharsh environment on Mars. It is the\nfirst rover-based sample acquisition device to be flight-qualified (see Figure 2).\nThis drill features an autonomous tool\nchange-out on a mobile robot, and novel\nvoice-coil-based percussion.\nThe drill comprises seven subelements. Starting at the end of the drill,\nthere is a bit assembly that cuts the rock\nand collects the sample. Supporting the\nbit is a subassembly comprising a chuck\nmechanism to engage and release the\nnew and worn bits, respectively, and a\nspindle mechanism to rotate the bit. Just\naft of that is a percussion mechanism,\nwhich generates hammer blows to break\nthe rock and create the dynamic environment used to flow the powdered\nsample. These components are\nmounted to a translation mechanism,\nwhich provides linear motion and senses\nweight-on-bit with a force sensor. There\nis a passive-contact sensor/stabilizer\n\nSample Exit Tube\n\nmechanism that secures the drill\xe2\x80\x99s position on the rock surface, and flex harness management hardware to provide\nthe power and signals to the translating\ncomponents. The drill housing serves as\nthe primary structure of the turret, to\nwhich the additional tools and instruments are attached.\nThe drill bit assembly (DBA) is a passive device that is rotated and hammered\nin order to cut rock (i.e. science targets)\nand collect the cuttings (powder) in a\nsample chamber until ready for transfer\nto the CHIMRA (Collection and Handling for Interior Martian Rock Analysis). The DBA consists of a 5/8-in. (\xe2\x89\x881.6cm) commercial hammer drill bit whose\nshank has been turned down and machined with deep flutes designed for aggressive cutting removal. Surrounding\nthe shank of the bit is a thick-walled\nmaraging steel collection tube allowing\nthe powdered sample to be augured up\nthe hole into the sample chamber. For\nrobustness, the wall thickness of the DBA\nwas maximized while still ensuring effective sample collection. There are four recesses in the bit tube that are used to retain the fresh bits in their bit box.\nThe rotating bit is supported by a backto-back duplex bearing pair within a\nhousing that is connected to the outer\n\nDBA housing by two titanium diaphragms. The only bearings on the drill\nin the sample flow are protected by a\nspring-energized seal, and an integrated\nshield that diverts the ingested powdered\nsample from the moving interface. The\nDBA diaphragms provide radial constraint of the rotating bit and form the\nsample chambers. Between the diaphragms there is a sample exit tube\nfrom which the sample is transferred to\nthe CHIMRA. To ensure that the entire\ncollected sample is retained, no matter\nthe orientation of the drill with respect to\ngravity during sampling, the pass-through\nfrom the forward to the aft chamber resides opposite to the exit tube.\nThe drill spindle mechanism (DSM),\nnested within the chuck/spindle subassembly, provides the torque to rotate\nthe bit for drilling and unlocking the\nfresh bit assemblies from the bit box.\nThe mechanism is actuated by an electrically commutated gear motor that drives\nthe spindle shaft via a spur gear train.\nThe maximum mean contact stress in\nthe bearings is kept low to prevent lube\ndegradation. Mounted to the shaft is a\ndirt-tolerant torque coupling that transmits torque to the bit. The coupling accommodates axial, radial, and angular\nmotion between the bit and spindle\nChuck interface\n\nBit (box) retention feature\n\n(1 of 8)\n\nSpindle interface\nSample\nChamber 2\n\nSample\nChamber 1\n\nDBA Bearing\nSeal and\nShield\nFigure 1. The Drill Bit Assembly (left) and Sample Paths and Interfaces (right) for the DBA.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2012\n\n5\n\nDetail A\n\nDetail B\n\nFigure 2. The flight MSL Drill undergoing system-level testing after it has been integrated at the end of\nthe robotic arm on the MSL Rover.\n\nshaft to permit the following functions:\nthe transmission of the hammer blow directly onto the bit, the mating of a fresh\nbit, and release of the bit both in free\nspace and under load.\nThe drill chuck mechanism (DCM),\nalso residing within the chuck/spindle\nsubassembly, enables the drill to release\nworn bits and take hold of fresh ones\nstored on the rover front panel. The de-\n\nsign driver was not just to survive a\nworst-case load scenario \xe2\x80\x94 the complete slip of the rover on a Martian\nslope \xe2\x80\x94 but to release the bit while subjected to it.\nThe drill percussion mechanism\n(DPM) generates the impact needed to\nbreak the rock and the dynamic (vibration) environment required to move\npowdered sample through the DBA.\n\nThe mechanism operates at 1,800\nblows-per-minute and has variable impact energy levels that range from 0.05\nto 0.8 Joules. The DPM is a functionally\nsimple device consisting primarily of a\nhammer assembly, energy storage\nspring, and housing/linear bearing assembly. The DPM is actuated by a longstroke voice coil that is operated using\nan open loop voltage drive method.\nWithin the DPM is an array of reed\nswitch sensors that provides coarse\nhammer position telemetry.\nThe drill translation mechanism\n(DTM) provides the linear motion of\nthe bit, spindle, chuck, and percussion\ndrill subassemblies for the following\nfunctions: maintaining 120 N weight-onbit (WOB) during sample acquisition,\ngenerating the retraction force to extract the bit from the hole, and mating\nto a fresh bit in the bit box.\nThe dual-bridge force sensor is required to sense the low WOB because\nthe nominal axial load is too low to be\nobserved in the actuator current telemetry. The inner diameter of the force sensor is axially clamped to the ball nut.\nThe force sensor outer diameter is axially constrained between two preloaded\nwave springs. The force sensor and wave\nsprings are housed in a gimbal assembly,\nwhich couples the translation mechanism to the translation tube. The gimbal\nisolates the ball screw and force sensor\nfrom radial and bending loads.\nThis work was done by Avi B. Okon, Kyle\nM. Brown, Paul L. McGrath, Kerry J. Klein,\nIan W. Cady, Justin Y. Lin, and Frank E.\nRamirez of Caltech, and Matt Haberland of\nMIT for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nFurther information is contained in a TSP\n(see page 1). NPO-47523\n\nUltra-Compact Motor Controller\nApplications include industrial robotic arms, industrial machinery, and automobiles.\nLyndon B. Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nThis invention is an electronically\ncommutated brushless motor controller\nthat incorporates Hall-array sensing in a\nsmall, 42-gram package that provides\n4096 absolute counts per motor revolution position sensing. The unit is the size\nof a miniature hockey puck, and is a 44pin male connector that provides many\nI/O channels, including CANbus, RS232 communications, general-purpose\nanalog and digital I/O (GPIO), analog\nand digital Hall inputs, DC power input\n\n6\n\n(18\xe2\x80\x9390 VDC, 0\xe2\x80\x93l0 A), three-phase motor\noutputs, and a strain gauge amplifier.\nThis controller replaces air cooling\nwith conduction cooling via a high-thermal-conductivity epoxy casting. A secondary advantage of the relatively good heat\nconductivity that comes with ultra-small\nsize is that temperature differences within\nthe controller become smaller, so that it is\neasier to measure the hottest temperature\nin the controller with fewer temperature\nsensors, or even one temperature sensor.\n\nAnother size-sensitive design feature is\nin the approach to electrical noise immunity. At a very small size, where conduction paths are much shorter than in\nconventional designs, the ground becomes essentially isopotential, and so\ncertain (space-consuming) electrical\nnoise control components become unnecessary, which helps make small size\npossible. One winding-current sensor,\napplied to all of the windings in fast sequence, is smaller and wastes less power\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2012\n\nthan the two or more sensors conventionally used to sense and control winding currents. An unexpected benefit of\nusing only one current sensor is that it\nactually improves the precision of current control by using the \xe2\x80\x9csame\xe2\x80\x9d sensors\nto read each of the three phases. Folding\nthe encoder directly into the controller\nelectronics eliminates a great deal of redundant electronics, packaging, connectors, and hook-up wiring. The reduction\nof wires and connectors subtracts substantial bulk and eliminates their role in\n\nbehaving as EMI (electro-magnetic interference) antennas.\nA shared knowledge by each motor\ncontroller of the state of all the motors\nin the system at 500 Hz also allows parallel processing of higher-level kinematic\nmatrix calculations.\nThis work was done by William T.

This refrigerator has the potential to provide efficient, continuous cooling to temperatures below 50 mK for detectors, and has\nthe benefits over existing magnetic coolers of reduced mass because of faster\ncycle times, the ability to pump the\ncooled fluid to remote cooling locations\naway from the magnetic field created by\nthe superconducting magnet, elimina-\n\ntion of the added complexity and mass of\nheat switches, and elimination of the\nneed for a thermal bus and single crystal\nparamagnetic materials due to the good\nthermal contact between the fluid and\nthe paramagnetic material.\nA reliable, thermodynamically efficient\npump that will work at 1.8 K was needed\nto enable development of the new magnetic refrigerator. The pump consists of\ntwo canisters packed with pieces of\ngadolinium gallium garnet (GGG). The\n\ncanisters are connected by a superleak (a\nporous piece of VYCOR\xc2\xae glass). A superconducting magnetic coil surrounds each\nof the canisters. The configuration enables driving of cyclic thermodynamic cycles (such as the sub-Kelvin Active Magnetic Regenerative Refrigerator) without\nusing pistons or moving parts.\nThis work was done by Franklin K. Miller of\nGoddard Space Flight Center. Further information is contained in a TSP (see page 1). GSC15573-1\n\nShape Memory Composite Hybrid Hinge\nThe hinge can be used for in-space deployment of antennas, reflectors, cameras, solar panels,\nand sunshields, as well as in any structure requiring hinges.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nThere are two conventional types of\nhinges for in-space deployment applications. The first type is mechanically deploying hinges. A typical mechanically\ndeploying hinge is usually composed of\nseveral tens of components. It is complicated, heavy, and bulky. More components imply higher deployment failure\nprobability. Due to the existence of relatively moving components among a mechanically deploying hinge, it unavoidably has microdynamic problems. The\nsecond type of conventional hinge relies\non strain energy for deployment. A tapespring hinge is a typical strain energy\nhinge. A fundamental problem of a\nstrain energy hinge is that its deployment\ndynamic is uncontrollable. Usually, its\ndeployment is associated with a large impact, which is unacceptable for many\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2012\n\nStrain Energy\nFlange\n\nShape\nMemory\nTube\n\nFold\nLine\n\nThe Shape Memory Composite Hybrid Hinge is composed of two strain energy flanges and one shape\nmemory composite tube.\n\n7\n\nspace applications. Some damping technologies have been experimented with\nto reduce the impact, but they increased\nthe risks of an unsuccessful deployment.\nCoalescing strain energy components\nwith shape memory composite (SMC)\ncomponents to form a hybrid hinge is\nthe solution. SMCs are well suited for deployable structures. A SMC is created\nfrom a high-performance fiber and a\nshape memory polymer resin. When the\nresin is heated to above its glass transition temperature, the composite becomes flexible and can be folded or\npacked. Once cooled to below the glass\ntransition temperature, the composite\nremains in the packed state. When the\nstructure is ready to be deployed, the\nSMC component is reheated to above\nthe glass transition temperature, and it\nreturns to its as-fabricated shape.\nA hybrid hinge is composed of two\nstrain energy flanges (also called tape-\n\nsprings) and one SMC tube. Two folding lines are placed on the SMC tube to\navoid excessive strain on the SMC during folding. Two adapters are used to\nconnect the hybrid hinge to its adjacent\nstructural components. While the SMC\ntube is heated to above its glass transition temperature, a hybrid hinge can be\nfolded and stays at folded status after\nthe temperature is reduced to below its\nglass transition temperature. After the\ndeployable structure is launched in\nspace, the SMC tube is reheated and the\nhinge is unfolded to deploy the structure. Based on test results, the hybrid\nhinge can achieve higher than 99.999%\nshape recovery.\nThe hybrid hinge inherits all of the\ngood characteristics of a tape-spring\nhinge such as simplicity, light weight,\nhigh deployment reliability, and high deployment precision. Conversely, it eliminates the deployment impact that has\n\nsignificantly limited the applications of a\ntape-spring hinge. The deployment dynamics of a hybrid hinge are in a slow\nand controllable fashion. The SMC tube\nof a hybrid hinge is a multifunctional\ncomponent. It serves as a deployment\nmechanism during the deployment\nprocess, and also serves as a structural\ncomponent after the hinge is fully deployed, which makes a hybrid hinge\nmuch stronger and stiffer than a tapespring hinge. Unlike a mechanically deploying hinge that uses relatively moving\ncomponents, a hybrid hinge depends on\nmaterial deformation for its packing and\ndeployment. It naturally eliminates the\nmicrodynamic phenomenon.\nThis work was performed by Houfei Fang and\nEastwood Im of Caltech, and John Lin and\nStephen Scarborough of ILC Dover LP for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s\nJet Propulsion Laboratory.

NPO48370\n\nBinding Causes of Printed Wiring Assemblies With Card-Loks\nGoddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland\nA document discusses a study that\npresents the first documented extraction loads, both nominal and worstcase, and presents the first comprehensive evaluation of extraction\ntechniques, methodologies, and tool\nrequirements relating to extracting\nprinted wiring assemblies (PWAs) with\nCard-Loks during EVA (extra vehicular activity). This task was performed\nfor the first time during HST (Hubble\nSpace Telescope) Servicing Mission 4.\n\nWith impending missions to Mars and\nto the Moon relying on an astronaut\xe2\x80\x99s\nabilities to perform repair and servicing\ntasks during EVAs, this study provides\nsome insight into what challenges may\nbe encountered during a repair/\nreplacement of a PWA with Card-Loks.\nExtraction techniques presented in this\nstudy could be applicable to other PWA\ngeometries with similar locking devices.\nGround-based extractions also benefit\nfrom the techniques and extraction tool\n\nrequirements presented in the study.\nThe findings highlight techniques that\nwork reliably, efficiently, and provide design requirements for tools necessary for\nextracting PWAs with Card-Loks on\nground.\nThis work was done by Hans Raven of\nATK and Kevin Eisenhower of Alliant Techsystems for Goddard Space Flight Center. Further information is contained in a TSP (see\npage 1). GSC-16160-1\n\nCoring Sample Acquisition Tool\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nA sample acquisition tool (SAT) has\nbeen developed that can be used autonomously to sample drill and capture\nrock cores. The tool is designed to accommodate core transfer using a sample tube\nto the IMSAH (integrated Mars sample\nacquisition and handling) SHEC (sample\nhandling, encapsulation, and containerization) without ever touching the pristine core sample in the transfer process.\nThe SAT can be divided into four subelements termed the spindle/percussion assembly (SPA), magnetic chuck assembly (MCA), core bit assembly (CBA),\nand the core break-off assembly (CBO).\n\n8\n\nThe SPA is used to impart the necessary\nrotational degree of freedom to the CBA\nto clear cuttings and impart the required impact energy to facilitate rock\nfracture. The percussive nature of the\ntool is imparted through the use of an\neccentric CAM/lever mechanism. The\nMCA is designed to actively release the\nCBA to the SHEC and in air (no load),\nand passively under large enough side\nloads, and in air (no load). The magnetic chuck uses two diametrically polarized rings (permanent magnet) stacked\none on top of the other. A low-torque actuator is then used to engage or disen-\n\ngage the chuck by aligning or de-aligning the polarized ring poles. The CBA\naccepts the rotational degree of freedom from the SPA and is used to clear\nthe rock cuttings using a two-lead flutecoring bit. The CBA also transfers the\nimpacts of a striker inside the SPA to the\nrock being drilled. Furthermore, the\ncoring bit shapes and defines the geometric constraints of the core sample.\nLastly, the CBO is housed inside the\nCBA and is used to create break-off and\ncapture the core sample. It is actuated\nthrough the use of a torque nut that axially retracts an outer tube using an\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2012\n\nAcme thread. The outer tube has a series of ramps that drives a set of teeth\ninto the shaped core, fracturing the\nbase of the core and effectively capturing the core within a sample tube. The\ntool is designed to allow the captured\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2012\n\ncore to be transferred out of the aft portion of the CBA and CBO without ever\nhaving to handle the core after capture.\nThis work was done by Nicolas E. Haddad,\nSaben D. Murray, Phillip E. Walkemeyer,\nMircea Badescu, Stewart Sherrit, Xiaoqi Bao,\n\nKristopher L. Kriechbaum, Megan Richardson, and Kerry J. Klein of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s\nJet Propulsion Laboratory. For more information, contact iaoffice@jpl.nasa.gov. NPO47564\n\n9\n\nManufacturing & Prototyping\nJoining and Assembly of Bulk Metallic Glass Composites\nThrough Capacitive Discharge\nCommercial uses include spacecraft debris shielding, energy-absorbing panels on military\nvehicles, and sporting goods.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nBulk metallic glasses (BMGs), a class of\namorphous metals defined as having a\nthickness greater than 1 mm, are being\nbroadly investigated by NASA for use in\nspacecraft hardware. Their unique properties, attained from their non-crystalline\nstructure, motivate several game-changing aerospace applications. BMGs have\nlow melting temperatures so they can be\ncheaply and repeatedly cast into complex\nnet shapes, such as mirrors or electronic\ncasings. They are extremely strong and\nwear-resistant, which motivates their use\nin gears and bearings. Amorphous metal\ncoatings are hard, corrosion-resistant, and\nhave high reflectivity. BMG composites,\nreinforced with soft second phases, can be\nfabricated into energy-absorbing cellular\npanels for orbital debris shielding.\n\nOne limitation of BMG materials is\ntheir inability to be welded, bonded,\nbrazed, or fastened in a convenient\nmethod to form larger structures. Cellular structures (which can be classified\nas trusses, foams, honeycombs, egg\nboxes, etc.) are useful for many NASA,\ncommercial, and military aerospace applications, including low-density paneling and shields. Although conventional\ncellular structures exhibit high specific\nstrength, their porous structures make\nthem challenging to fabricate. In particular, metal cellular structures are extremely difficult to fabricate due to\ntheir high processing temperatures.\nAluminum honeycomb sandwich panels, for example, are used widely as\nspacecraft shields due to their low den-\n\nsity and ease of fabrication, but suffer\nfrom low strength.\nA desirable metal cellular structure is\none with high strength, combined with\nlow density and simple fabrication. The\nthermoplastic joining process described here allows for the fabrication\nof monolithic BMG truss-like structures\nthat are 90% porous and have no heataffected zone, weld, bond, or braze.\nThis is accomplished by welding the\nnodes of stacked BMG composite panels using a localized capacitor discharge, forming a single monolithic\nstructure. This removes many complicated and costly fabrication steps.\nMoreover, the cellular structures detailed in this work are among the highest-strength and most energy-absorbent\n\nBack Plate\n\nBMG Features: (a) Enlarged view of capacitive discharging technique used to fuse BMG cellular structures. (b) A BMG composite honeycomb sandwich panel\njoined using the new technique. (c) A four-layer BMG composite foam fabricated by joining each node of adjacent panels into a single monolithic structure. (d) A compression test in a two-layer welded structure showing buckling and eventual fracture of the welded joints.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2012\n\n11\n\nmaterials known. This implies that a\nfabricated structure made from these\nmaterials would have unequaled mechanical properties compared to other\nmetal foams or trusses.\nThe process works by taking advantage of the electrical properties of the\nmatrix material in the metal-matrix composite, which in this case is a metallic\nglass. Due to the random nanoscale\narrangement of atoms (without any\ngrain boundaries), the matrix glass exhibits a near-constant electrical resistivity\nas a function of temperature. By placing\nthe composite panels between two copper electrode plates and discharging a\ncapacitor, the entire matrix of the panel\ncan be heated to approximately 700 \xc2\xb0C\nin 10 milliseconds, which is above the\nalloy\xe2\x80\x99s solidus but below the liquidus. By\ndesigning the geometry of the panels\ninto the shape of an egg box, the electrical discharge localizes only in the tips of\neach pyramidal cell. By applying a forging load during discharge, the nodes of\nthe panels can be fused together into a\nsingle piece, which then dissipates heat\nthrough radiation back into a glassy\nstate. This means that two panels can be\nmetallurgically fused into one panel\nwith no heat-affected zone, creating a\nseamless connection between panels.\n\n12\n\nDuring the process, the soft metal particles (dendrites) that are uniformly distributed in the glassy matrix to increase\nthe toughness are completely unaffected\nby the thermoplastic joining. The novelty is that a truss (or foam-like) structure can be formed with excellent energy-absorbing capabilities without the\nneed for machining. The technique allows for large-scale fabrication of panels,\nwell-suited for spacecraft shields or military vehicle door panels.\nCrystalline metal cellular structures\ncannot be fabricated using the thermoplastic joining technique described\nhere. If metal panels were to be assembled into a cellular structure, they would\neither have to be welded, brazed,\nbonded, or fastened together, creating a\nweak spot in the structure at each connection. Welded parts require a welding\nmaterial to be added to the joint and exhibit a soft and weak heat-affected zone.\nBrazing and bonding do not form a metallurgical joint and thus exhibit low\nstrengths, especially when the panels are\npulled apart and fasteners require highstress-concentration holes to be drilled.\nNo equivalent rapid heating method exists for assembling metal panels together\ninto cellular structures, and thus, those\nparts must be foamed, machined, or in-\n\nvestment cast if they are to form a monolithic structure. If the crystalline panels\nwere to be joined using capacitive discharge, as with a spot welder, their bond\nwould be very weak, and the panels\nwould have to be extremely thin. In contrast, the strength of joined BMG parts\nhas been demonstrated to have strength\ncomparable to the parent material. This\ntechnique opens up the possibility of\nusing large-scale BMG hardware in\nspacecraft, military, or commercial applications.\nThis work was done by Douglas C.

Since the\nradio frequency (RF) and local oscillator\n(LO) signals are far apart, system design\nbecomes much simpler.\nA proprietary planar GaAs Schottky\ndiode process was developed that results\nin very low parasitic anodes that have\ncutoff frequencies in the tens of terahertz. This technology enables robust\nimplementation of monolithic mixer\nand frequency multiplier circuits well\ninto the terahertz frequency range.\nUsing optical and e-beam lithography,\nand conventional epitaxial layer design\nwith innovative usage of GaAs membranes and metal beam leads, high-performance terahertz circuits can be designed with high fidelity.\nAll of these mixers use metal waveguide structures for housing. Metal machined structures for RF and LO coupling hamper these mixers to be\nintegrated in multi-pixel heterodyne\narray receivers for spectroscopic and imaging applications. Moreover, the recent developments of terahertz transistors on InP substrate provide an\nopportunity, for the first time, to have\nintegrated amplifiers followed by Schottky diode mixers in a heterodyne receiver at these frequencies. Since the\namplifiers are developed on a planar architecture to facilitate multi-pixel array\nimplementation, it is quite important to\nfind alternative architecture to waveguide-based mixers.\nTransmission lines such as microstrips\nand striplines are very lossy at terahertz\nfrequencies, and therefore have a\ndetrimental effect on the performance\nof Schottky diode mixers, and they have\nhigher conversion loss and noise temperatures. These mixers were designed\nusing CPW coupling structures, which\nhave lower loss and are more amenable\nto planar architecture and higher level of\nintegration. CPW lines were used to couple the RF and LO signal to a pair of anti-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2012\n\nJPL\n\nLEI\n\n20.0kV\n\nX120\n\n100\xc2\xb5m\n\nWD 24.4mm\n\nA photograph of the fabricated Subharmonic Mixer devices.\n\nparallel diodes. The LO is injected from\none end where there is a CPW impedance-matching network and a quarterwavelength short-circuited stub (at the\nLO frequency), which shorts the RF at\nthe LO end of the circuit. On the RF\nend, there is a CPW impedance-matching network and an open-circuited, quarter-wavelength stub (at the LO frequency), which acts as a short at the LO\nfrequency at the RF end of the circuit.\nThe IF is taken out through a CPW filter\nfrom the RF end of the diodes.\nIn an integrated receiver system, the\nCPW lines \xe2\x80\x94 both for the RF and LO \xe2\x80\x94\ncan directly connect to low-noise amplifiers for the RF and frequency multiplier\noutput for the LO.\nMost of the reported results for subharmonic mixers at 670 GHz use low-loss\nwaveguide coupling structures and\nmetal housing. At the time of this reporting, this is the first time a planar CPW\ntopology has been used to design and\ndevelop a subharmonic mixer at these\n\nfrequencies. This design architecture\neasily leads to seamless integration with\nplanar CPW amplifiers and can be used\nfor multi-pixel heterodyne arrays.\nThis work was done by Goutam\nChattopadhyay, Erich T.

The IESDM is\nnew sensor technology targeted for integration into a Space Environmental\nMonitor (SEM) subsystem used for the\ncharacterization and monitoring of\ndeep dielectric charging on spacecraft.\nUse of an AC-coupled lock-in amplifier\nwith closed-loop sense-signal nulling via\ngeneration of an active guard-driving\nfeedback voltage provides the resolution,\naccuracy, linearity and stability needed\nfor long-term space-based measurement\nof the IESDM. This implementation relies on adjusting the feedback voltage to\ndrive the sense current received from the\n\nresonator\xe2\x80\x99s variable-capacitance-probe\nvoltage transducer to approximately\nzero, as limited by the signal-to-noise performance of the loop electronics. The\nmagnitude of the sense current is proportional to the difference between the\ninput voltage being measured and the\nfeedback voltage, which matches the\ninput voltage when the sense current is\nzero. High signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) is\nachieved by synchronous detection of\nthe sense signal using the correlated reference signal derived from the oscillator\ncircuit that drives the mechanical resonator. The magnitude of the feedback\nvoltage, while the loop is in a settled state\nwith essentially zero sense current, is an\naccurate estimate of the input voltage\nbeing measured. This technique has\nmany beneficial attributes including immunity to drift, high linearity, high SNR\nfrom synchronous detection of a single-\n\nfrequency carrier selected to avoid potentially noisy 1/f low-frequency spectrum of the signal-chain electronics, and\nhigh accuracy provided through the benefits of a driven shield encasing the capacitance-probe transducer and guarded\ninput triaxial lead-in.\nMeasurements obtained from a 2channel prototype electrometer have\ndemonstrated good accuracy (|error| <\n0.2 V) and high stability. Twenty-fourhour tests have been performed with virtually no drift. Additionally, 5,500 repeated one-second measurements of 100\nV input were shown to be approximately\nnormally distributed with a standard deviation of 140 mV.\nThis work was done by Brent R.

NPO-47339\n\nDiscontinuous Mode Power Supply\nGoddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland\nA document discusses the changes\nmade to a standard push-pull inverter\ncircuit to avoid saturation effects in the\nmain inverter power supply. Typically,\nin a standard push-pull arrangement,\nthe unsymmetrical primary excitation\ncauses variations in the volt second integral of each half of the excitation\ncycle that could lead to the establishment of DC flux density in the magnetic core, which could eventually\n\ncause saturation of the main inverter\ntransformer.\nThe relocation of the filter reactor\nnormally placed across the output of\nthe power supply solves this problem.\nThe filter reactor was placed in series\nwith the primary circuit of the main inverter transformer, and is presented as\nimpedance against the sudden changes\non the input current. The reactor averaged the input current in the primary\n\ncircuit, avoiding saturation of the main\ninverter transformer. Since the implementation of the described change, the\nabove problem has not reoccurred, and\nfailures in the main power transistors\nhave been avoided.\nThis work was done by John Lagadinos\nand Ethel Poulos of Pulse Systems, Inc. for\nGoddard Space Flight Center.

Considering the very large scale integration\n(VLSI) design aspect, as transistor feature size is decreased to 50 nm and\n\n14\n\nbelow, there is sizable increase in the\nnumber of transistors as more functional building blocks are embedded in\nthe same chip. However, the consequent\nincrease in power consumption (dynamic and leakage) will serve as a key\n\nconstraint to inhibit the advantages of\ntransistor feature size reduction.\nPower consumption can be reduced\nby minimizing the voltage supply (for dynamic power consumption) and/or increasing threshold voltage (Vth, for re-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2012\n\nducing leakage power). When the feature size of the transistor is reduced, supply voltage (Vdd) and threshold voltage\n(Vth) are also reduced accordingly; then,\nthe leakage current becomes a bigger\nfactor of the total power consumption.\nTo maintain low power consumption,\noperation of electronics at sub-threshold\nlevels can be a potentially strong contender; however, there are two obstacles\nto be faced: more leakage current per\ntransistor will cause more leakage power\nconsumption, and slow response time\nwhen the transistor is operated in weak\ninversion region.\nTo enable low power consumption\nand yet obtain high performance, the\n\nCMOS (complementary metal oxide\nsemiconductor) transistor as a basic element is viewed and controlled as a fourterminal device: source, drain, gate, and\nbody, as differentiated from the traditional approach with three terminals:\ni.e., source and body, drain, and gate.\nThis technique features multiple voltage sources to supply the dynamic control, and uses dynamic control to enable low-threshold voltage when the\nchannel (N or P) is active, for speed response enhancement and high threshold voltage, and when the transistor\nchannel (N or P) is inactive, to reduce\nthe leakage current for low-leakage\npower consumption.\n\nThis work was done by Tuan A.

The innovation\nmonitors transactions to memory, and calculates a form of sumcheck on-the-fly,\nthereby relieving the processors of calculating the sumcheck in software.\nThis sumcheck could be calculated\nusing addition operations, or CRC-type\n(cyclic redundancy check) operations \xe2\x80\x94\nwhichever is most economical in terms of\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2012\n\ndie area and power consumption. In each\nof the NMR systems, the sumcheck logic is\ninitialized at the start of a task (a well-defined unit of work that will be performed\nby each of the NMR systems), then captured and transmitted to the vote-taker at\nthe end of the task. The vote-taker compares the sumchecks, determines if errors\nhave occurred, and what action, if any,\nshould be taken to correct the errors.\nThe advantage over existing techniques is that minimal logic is required\nto implement the sumcheck unit, mini-\n\nmal power is consumed by the sumcheck\nunit when active, and the unit can have\na reduced power sleep mode when inactive. Calculating a sumcheck for a task\nusing the sumcheck unit requires no additional cycles, and so has lower latency\nthan calculating it as a post-task in the\nprocessing unit.\nThis work was done by Keith Bindloss and\nCarl Dobbs, Sr. of Coherent Logix for Goddard Space Flight Center.

To realize the resolution and signal\nsensitivity of today\xe2\x80\x99s x-ray microcalorimeters, significant improvements in the blocking filter stack are needed.\nUsing high-transmission polyimide\nsupport mesh, it is possible to improve\noverall throughput on a typical microcalorimeter such as Suzaku\xe2\x80\x99s X-ray\nSpectrometer by 11%, compared to previous flight designs.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nHeat management with common textiles such as nylon and spandex is hindered by the poor thermal conductivity\nfrom the skin surface to cooling surfaces. This innovation showed marked\nimprovement in thermal conductivity of\nthe individual fibers and tubing, as well\nas components assembled from them.\nThe problem is centered on improving the heat removal of the liquidcooled ventilation garments (LCVGs)\nused by astronauts. The current design\nuses an extensive network of water-cooling tubes that introduces bulkiness and\ndiscomfort, and increases fatigue. Range\nof motion and ease of movement are affected as well. The current technology is\nthe same as developed during the\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2012\n\nApollo program of the 1960s. Tubing\nmaterial is hand-threaded through a\nspandex/nylon mesh layer, in a series of\nloops throughout the torso and limbs\nsuch that there is close, form-fitting contact with the user. Usually, there is a\nnylon liner layer to improve comfort.\nCirculating water is chilled by an external heat exchanger (sublimator).\nThe purpose of this innovation is to\nproduce new LCVG components with\nimproved thermal conductivity. This was\naddressed using nanocomposite engineering incorporating high-thermalconductivity nanoscale fillers in the fabric and tubing components. Specifically,\ncarbon nanotubes were added using\nnormal processing methods such as\n\nthermoplastic melt mixing (compounding twin screw extruder) and downstream processing (fiber spinning, tubing extrusion). Fibers were produced as\nyarns and woven into fabric cloths. The\napplication of isotropic nanofillers can\nbe modeled using a modified Nielsen\nModel for conductive fillers in a matrix\nbased on Einstein\xe2\x80\x99s viscosity model.\nThis is a drop-in technology with no\nadditional equipment needed. The\nloading is limited by the ability to\nmaintain adequate dispersion. Undispersed materials will plug filtering\nscreens in processing equipment. Generally, the viscosity increases were acceptable, and allowed the filled polymers to still be processed.\n\n17\n\nThe novel feature is that fabrics do\nnot inherently possess good thermal\nconductivity. In fact, fabrics are used for\nthermal insulation, not heat removal.\nThe technology represents the first material that is a wearable fabric, based on\ncompany textiles and materials that will\nsignificantly conduct heat.\n\nThis work was done by L.

A variety of polystyrenebased quaternary ammonium hydroxides\nhave been reported as anion exchange\nfuel cell membranes. However, the hydrolytic stability and conductivity of the\ncommercially available membranes are\nnot adequate to meet the requirements\nof fuel cell applications. When compared\nwith commercially available membranes,\npolystyrene-imidazolium alkaline membrane electrolytes are more stable and\nmore highly conducting. At the time of\nthis reporting, this has been the first such\nusage for imidazolium-based polymeric\nmaterials for fuel cells.\nImidazolium salts are known to be\nelectrochemically stable over wide po-\n\ntential ranges. By controlling the relative ratio of imidazolium groups in\npolystyrene-imidazolium salts, their\nphysiochemical properties could be\nmodulated.\nAlkaline anion exchange membranes\nbased on polystyrene-imidazolium hydroxide materials have been developed.\nThe first step was to synthesize the\npoly(styrene-co-(1-((4-vinyl)methyl)-3methylimidazolium) chloride through a\nfree-radical polymerization. Casting of\nthis material followed by in situ treatment of the membranes with sodium hydroxide solutions provided the corresponding hydroxide salts. Various ratios\nof the monomers 4-chloromoethylvinylbenzine (CMVB) and vinylbenzine (VB)\nprovided various compositions of the\n\npolymer. The preferred material, due to\nthe relative ease of casting the film, and\nits relatively low hygroscopic nature, was\na 2:1 ratio of CMVB to VB.\nTesting confirmed that at room temperature, the new membranes outperformed commercially available membranes by a large margin.

Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio\nTextile-based composites could significantly benefit from local toughening\nusing nanofiber coatings. Nanofibers,\nthermoplastic or otherwise, can be applied to the surface of the fiber tow bundle, achieving toughening of the fiber\ntow contact surfaces, resulting in\ntougher and more damage-resistant/tolerant composite structures. The same\ntechnique could also be applied to other\ntechnologies such as tape laying, fiber\nplacement, or filament winding operations. Other modifications to the composite properties such as thermal and\n\n18\n\nelectrical conductivity could be made\nthrough selection of appropriate nanofiber material.\nInvestigations of the failure and damage mechanisms of textile composites\nhas led to the conclusion that toughening of the matrix material would result\nin increased material performance. Several approaches exist in which the bulk\nof the matrix is modified either through\nchemical formulation or the addition of\nfillers. These methods can detrimentally\naffect the processability of the resulting\nmatrix material. Other methods exist\n\nthat rely on modification of the fiber material (so-called \xe2\x80\x9cfuzzy fiber\xe2\x80\x9d approaches) that results in reduced fiber\nperformance.\nControl of the needle electric potential, precursor solution, ambient temperature, ambient humidity, airflow, etc.,\nare used to vary the diameter and\nnanofiber coating morphology as\nneeded.

Additionally, any\nnumber of different nanofiber materials\ncan be simultaneously applied.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2012\n\nThis method produces a product with\na toughening agent applied to the fiber\ntow or other continuous composite precursor material where it is needed (at interfaces and boundaries) without interfering with other composite processing\ncharacteristics.\nThis work was done by Lee W.

The apparatus is capable of\ncontrolled, rapid heating of sample\ncoupons to temperatures of 200 to 350 \xc2\xbaC\nand above. The vacuum chamber permits\noperation under vacuum or special atmospheric gas mixtures.\nA radiant heating system using tungsten-halogen lamps was chosen to heat\nthe spores to the desired temperatures.\nThis method of heating was preferred\nbecause there was no physical contact\nbetween the heater and the sample\ncoupons, the radiant heat can be controlled more precisely than heating\nmethods by conduction and convection,\nand halogen light bulbs are readily\navailable. The design allowed for the\nbulbs to radiantly heat the backside of\nthe sample coupons, avoiding possible\nsterilization of the spores by a method\nother than just heating, such as ultraviolet radiation.\nThe material chosen for the sample\ncoupons was silicon, due to its favorable\nproperties for this application.

This means that the silicon\ncoupons are able to absorb a significant\nportion of the radiation output by the\nhalogen light bulbs, but not re-radiate\nmuch mid-infrared radiation at the sample temperatures. This unique property\nof silicon allows for the sample coupons\nto be heated very quickly and accurately\nusing the radiant heat from the halogen\n\nlight bulbs.

This\ninnovation describes the formulation of\na chemical preservative that prevents\nmicrobial growth and inactivates the\ndegradative enzymes. This extends the\ntime that saliva can be stored or transported without losing its diagnostic value. Multiple samples of saliva can be collected if needed without causing discomfort to the subject and it does not\n\nrequire any special facilities to handle\nafter it is collected.\nThe preservative contains sodium\ndodecyl sulfate (SDS), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and Tris\nbuffer. This preservative was developed\nto preserve saliva from astronauts during spaceflight without refrigeration to\ndetermine if virus DNA was present.\nSaliva with added preservative can be\n\n21\n\nstored at room temperature for up to 60\ndays without any measureable degradation. Viral DNA is routinely measured\nfrom saliva stored in this manner without refrigeration. Thus, this preservative can be used to preserve critical\nmacromolecules (nucleic acids and proteins) without consuming power\nresources. This preservative has been\nused on flight experiments aboard both\nthe Space Shuttle and the International\nSpace Station.\nSaliva contains hormones such as cortisol and DHEA, cytokines (immune\nmarkers), DNA and RNA viruses, antibodies, and many other substances of\ndiagnostic value. Saliva also contains\n\nmany bacteria that produce proteases\nthat destroy proteins, nucleases that\ndestroy DNA and RNA, and other\ndegradative enzymes. Typically, saliva\nand other body fluids are refrigerated\n(or frozen) to prevent or slow the degradation process. Refrigeration and freezers are extremely limited resources in\nspacecraft, undeveloped countries, and\nduring activities away from electricity.\nAlthough not tested, the preservative is\nexpected to be effective for other body\nfluids such as urine and blood. In addition, the toxicity of the preservative is\nvery low.\nThe preservative consists of 0.5%\nsodium dodecysulfate (a detergent),\n\n1.0 mM EDTA (a metal chelator), and\n1.0 mM Tris (a buffer to maintain correct pH). The preservative is stable at\nroom temperature for at least six\nmonths. A small volume of the liquid\npreservative is added to saliva (or other\nbody fluids), the mixture is mixed by\ninversion, and then is left undisturbed\nat room temperature until the analysis\nis conducted. No other preservative has\nbeen identified that stabilizes saliva and\nother body fluids at room temperature\nfor subsequent analyses.\nThis work was done by Duane L.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, TX\nCurrent transcranial color Doppler\n(TCD) transducer probes are bulky and\ndifficult to move in tiny increments to\nsearch and optimize TCD signals. This\ninvention provides miniature motions of\na TCD transducer probe to optimize\nTCD signals.\nThe mechanical probe uses spherical\nbearing in guiding and locating the tilting crystal face. The lateral motion of\nthe crystal face as it tilts across the full\nrange of motion was achieved by minimizing the distance between the pivot\nlocation and the crystal face. The smallest commonly available metal spherical\nbearing was used with an outer diameter\nof 12 mm, a 3-mm tall retaining ring,\nand 5-mm overall height. Small geared\nmotors were used that would provide\nsufficient power in a very compact package. After confirming the validity of the\nbasic positioning concept, optimization\ndesign loops were completed to yield the\nfinal design.\nA parallel motor configuration was\nused to minimize the amount of space\nwasted inside the probe case while minimizing the overall case dimensions. The\ndistance from the front edge of the crys-\n\n22\n\ntal to the edge of the case was also minimized to allow positioning of the probe\nvery close to the ear on the temporal\nlobe. The mechanical probe is able to\nachieve a \xc2\xb120\xc2\xb0 tip and tilt with smooth\nrepeatable action in a very compact\npackage. The enclosed probe is about 7\ncm long, 4 cm wide, and 1.8 cm tall.\nThe device is compact, hands-free, and\ncan be adjusted via an innovative touchscreen. Positioning of the probe to the\nhead is performed via conventional\ntransducer gels and pillows. This device\nis amendable to having advanced software, which could intelligently focus and\noptimize the TCD signal.\nThe first effort will be development of\nmonitoring systems for space use and\nfield deployment. The need for longlived, inexpensive clinical diagnostic instruments for military applications is\nsubstantial. Potential future uses of this\nsystem by NASA and other commercial\nend-users include monitoring cerebral\nblood flow of ambulatory patients, prognostic of potential for embolic stroke,\nultrasonic blood clot treatment, monitoring open-heart and carotid endarterectomy surgery, and resolution of the\n\ncontroversy regarding transient ischemic attacks and emboli\xe2\x80\x99s role.

In order to mitigate the\nissues of autonomous navigation in\nrough water, a hybrid controller called\n\n23\n\nPOSTMAN combines the concept of\nPOS (point of sail) tack planning from\nthe sailing domain with a standard PID\n(proportional-integral-derivative) controller that implements reliable target\nreaching for the motorized small boat\ncontrol task.\nThis is an embedded, adaptive software controller that uses look-ahead\nsensing in a closed loop method to perform path planning for safer navigation\nin rough waters. State-of-the-art controllers for small boats are based on\ncomplex models of the vessel\xe2\x80\x99s kinematics and dynamics.

Most of today\xe2\x80\x99s largescale problems can extend to hundreds of\ngrids, and over 100 million grid points.\nHowever, due to the lack of efficient tools,\nonly a small fraction of information contained in these files is analyzed.\nOVERSMART (OVERFLOW Solution\nMonitoring And Reporting Tool) provides a comprehensive report of solution\n\nconvergence of flow computations over\nlarge, complex grid systems. It produces a\none-page executive summary of the behavior of flow equation residuals, turbulence model equation residuals, and component forces and moments. Under the\nautomatic option, a matrix of commonly\nviewed plots such as residual histograms,\ncomposite residuals, sub-iteration bar\ngraphs, and component forces and moments is automatically generated. Specific\nplots required by the user can also be prescribed via a command file or a graphical\nuser interface.

The gas in the core of a rocket\nplume can often be modeled as a timedependent, high-temperature, turbulent, reacting continuum flow. How-\n\never, due to the vacuum conditions on\nthe lunar surface, the mean molecular\npath in the outer parts of the plume is\ntoo long for the continuum assumption\n\n25\n\nto remain valid. Molecular methods are\nbetter suited to model this region of\nthe flow. Finally, granular and multiphase flow models must be employed to\ndescribe the dust and debris that are\ndisplaced from the surface, as well as\nhow a crater is formed in the regolith.\nAt present, standard commercial CFD\n(computational fluid dynamics) software is not capable of coupling each of\nthese flow regimes to provide an accurate representation of this flow process,\nnecessitating the development of custom software.\n\nThis software solves the fluid-flow-governing equations in an Eulerian framework, coupled with the particle transport equations that are solved in a\nLagrangian framework. It uses a fourthorder explicit Runge-Kutta scheme for\ntemporal integration, an eighth-order\ncentral finite differencing scheme for\nspatial discretization. The non-linear\nterms in the governing equations are recast in cubic skew symmetric form to reduce aliasing error.

To\ndo this, some information about the\ncamera needs to be known, such as its\nposition and orientation relative to the\nEarth. This can be provided by common\ninertial navigation systems (INS). Once\nthe location of the camera is known, it is\nuseful to project an image onto some\nrepresentation of the Earth. Due to the\nnon-smooth terrain of the Earth (mountains, valleys, etc.), this projection is\nhighly non-linear. Thus, to ensure accurate projection, one needs to project\nonto a digital elevation map (DEM).\nThis allows one to view the images over-\n\nlaid onto a representation of the Earth.\nA code has been developed that takes\nan image, a model of the camera used to\nacquire that image, the pose of the camera during acquisition (as provided by\nan INS), and a DEM, and outputs an\nimage that has been geo-rectified. The\nworld coordinate of the bounds of the\nimage are provided for viewing purposes. The code finds a mapping from\npoints on the ground (DEM) to pixels in\nthe image. By performing this process\nfor all points on the ground, one can\n\xe2\x80\x9cpaint\xe2\x80\x9d the ground with the image, effectively performing a projection of the\nimage onto the ground. In order to\nmake this process efficient, a method\nwas developed for finding a region of in-\n\nterest (ROI) on the ground to where the\nimage will project.\nThis code is useful in any scenario involving an aerial imaging platform that\nmoves and rotates over time. Many other\napplications are possible in processing\naerial and satellite imagery.\nThis work was done by Adnan I. Ansar,\nShane Brennan, Daniel S. Clouse, Yang\nCheng, Curtis W.

This algorithm builds upon the robust convergence capability of Variable Sampling\nMapping (VSM), in combination with\nthe known success of various deconvolution algorithms. VSM is an alternative\nmethod for enforcing the amplitude\n\n26\n\nconstraints of a Misell-Gerchberg-Saxton (MGS) algorithm. When provided\nthe object and additional optical parameters, VSM can accurately recover\nthe exit pupil wavefront. By combining\nVSM and deconvolution, one is able to\nsimultaneously recover the wavefront\nand the object.\nTo recover the exit pupil wavefront,\nand the unknown object, first one must\ncollect image plane data of the optical\n\nsystem under test. To increase convergence robustness, diversity images are\ncollected. Next, a guess of the wavefront\nis made. This can be based on a prior estimate, or a simpler random solution of\nsmall values. This guess of the exit pupil\nand the image data will provide a starting point for VSM phase retrieval.\nAfter several iterations of VSM phase\nretrieval, the algorithm will estimate the\npoint spread function (PSF) based on\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2012\n\nthe current estimate of the exit pupil\nwavefront. This estimated PSF is then\ndeconvolved from the image data to provide an estimate of the object. At this\npoint, one has an estimate of the object,\n\nand the estimated wavefront. The\nprocess is then repeated with the object\nincluded in the model in VSM. The entire process is repeated until a convergence criterion is met.\n\nThis work was done by Jeffrey Smith for Goddard Space Flight Center. Further information\nis contained in a TSP (see page 1).

Kennedy Space Center, Florida\nDetermining the Z-R relationship\n(where Z is the radar reflectivity factor\nand R is rainfall rate) from disdrometer\ndata has been and is a common goal of\ncloud physicists and radar meteorology\nresearchers. The usefulness of this quantity has traditionally been limited since\nradar represents a volume measurement,\nwhile a disdrometer corresponds to a\npoint measurement. To solve that problem, a 3D-DSD (drop-size distribution)\nmethod of determining an equivalent 3D\nZ-R was developed at the University of\nCentral Florida and tested at the Kennedy\nSpace Center, FL. Unfortunately, that\nmethod required a minimum of three disdrometers clustered together within a microscale network (\xe2\x89\x881-km separation).\nSince most commercial disdrometers\nused by the radar meteorology/cloud\nphysics community are high-cost instru-\n\nments, three disdrometers located within\na microscale area is generally not a practical strategy due to the limitations of these\nkinds of research budgets.\nA relatively simple modification to the\n3D-DSD algorithm provides an estimate\nof the 3D-DSD and therefore, a 3D Z-R\nmeasurement using a single disdrometer.\nThe basis of the horizontal extrapolation\nis mass conservation of a drop size increment, employing the mass conservation\nequation. For vertical extrapolation, convolution of a drop size increment using\nraindrop terminal velocity is used. Together, these two independent extrapolation techniques provide a complete 3DDSD estimate in a volume around and\nabove a single disdrometer. The estimation error is lowest along a vertical plane\nintersecting the disdrometer position in\nthe direction of wind advection.\n\nThis work demonstrates that multiple\nsensors are not required for successful implementation of the 3D interpolation/extrapolation algorithm. This is a great benefit since it is seldom that multiple sensors\nin the required spatial arrangement are\navailable for this type of analysis.\nThe original software (developed at\nthe University of Central Florida, 1998\xe2\x80\x932000) has also been modified to read\nstandardized disdrometer data format\n(Joss-Waldvogel format). Other modifications to the software involve accounting for vertical ambient wind motion, as\nwell as evaporation of the raindrop during its flight time.\nThis work was done by John Lane of ASRC\nAerospace Corporation for Kennedy Space\nCenter.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA methodology for designing spacecraft trajectories in any gravitational environment within the solar system has\nbeen developed. The methodology facilitates modeling and optimization for\nproblems ranging from that of a single\nspacecraft orbiting a single celestial body\nto that of a mission involving multiple\nspacecraft and multiple propulsion systems operating in gravitational fields of\nmultiple celestial bodies. The methodology consolidates almost all spacecraft trajectory design and optimization problems into a single conceptual framework\nrequiring solution of either a system of\nnonlinear equations or a parameter-opti-\n\n28\n\nmization problem with equality and/or\ninequality constraints.\nThe use of multiple reference frames\nthat generally translate, rotate, and pulsate between two arbitrary celestial bodies facilitates analysis of such complex\ntrajectories as those that pass (possibly\nmultiple times) through gravitational\nfields of multiple celestial bodies. A\nbasic building block that can accommodate impulsive maneuvers, maneuverand non-maneuver-based mass discontinuities, and finite burn or finite control\nacceleration maneuvers, is used to construct trajectories. The methodology is\nimplemented in an interactive computer\n\nprogram, COPERNICUS, wherein numerical integration, multi-dimensional\nnonlinear root-finding, and/or sequential quadratic programming are used for\nsolving trajectory design, targeting, or\noptimization problems constructed by\nthe analyst.\nThis work was done by Gerald Condon of\nJohnson Space Center; Cesar Ocampo, Ravishankar Mathur, and Fady Morcos of the University of Texas; Juan Senent of Odyssey Space\nResearch; Jacob Williams of ERC, Inc.; and\nElizabeth C.

Two solutions are provided, in which a sensor is located just\nunder the water surface, and at a few to\ntens of meter depth under the water surface.\nThe first option is a Fish Eye Lens (FEL)\ndigital-camera combination, situated just\nunder the water surface that will have nearfull-hemisphere (360\xc2\xb0 azimuth and 90\xc2\xb0 elevation) field of view for detecting objects\non the water surface. This sensor can provide a three-dimensional picture of the airspace both in the marine and in the land\nenvironment.\nThe FEL is coupled to a camera and\ncan continuously look at the entire sky\nabove it. The camera can have an Active\nPixel Sensor (APS) focal plane array that\nallows logic circuitry to be built directly in\nthe sensor. The logic circuitry allows data\nprocessing to occur on the sensor head\nwithout the need for any other external\nelectronics.\nIn the second option, a single-photon\nsensitive (photon counting) detectorarray is used at depth, without the need\nfor any optics in front of it, since at this location, optical signals are scattered and arrive at a wide (tens of degrees) range of\nangles.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2012\n\nBeam scattering through clouds and\nseawater effectively negates optical imaging at depths below a few meters under\ncloudy or turbulent conditions. Under\nthose conditions, maximum collection\nefficiency can be achieved by using a\nnon-imaging photon-counting detector\nbehind narrowband filters.\nIn either case, signals from these sensors may be fused and correlated or decorrelated with other sensor data to get\nan accurate picture of the object(s)\nabove the submarine. These devices can\ncomplement traditional submarine\nperiscopes that have a limited field of\nview in the elevation direction. Also,\nthese techniques circumvent the need\nfor exposing the entire submarine or its\nperiscopes to the outside environment.\nThis work was done by Hamid Hemmati,\nJoseph M. Kovalik, and William H.
