Abstract\n\nThe Advanced Supersonic Technology configuration concept, AST-100, is an update of the\nLangley Research Center Reference Configuration baseline. The combination of wing\n|\nthickness reduction, nacelle recontouring for minimum drag at cruise, and the use of the\nhorizontal tail to produce lift during climb and cruise resulted in an increase in maxi-!\nmum lift-to-drag ratio. At cruise, the increase was about four percent over the previous Reference Configuration maximum lift-to-drag ratio. Lift-to-drag ratio improvement\nmade possible a reduction in engine size. Lighter engines and lower fuel weight associated with this resizing result in a six percent reduction in takeoff gross weight\ncompared to the Reference Configuration. AST-100 takeoff maximum effective perceived\nnoise at the runway centerline and sideline measurement stations was 114.4 decibels.\nSince 1.5-decibels tradeoff is available from the approach noise, the required engine\nnoise suppression is 4.9 decibels. Maximum overpressure (sonic boom) which would be\ngenerated by the AST-100 is slightly lower than that of the Reference Configuration.\nThe AST-100 largest maximum overpressure would occur during transonic climb acceleration when the aircraft was at relatively low altitude. Calculated standard +8\xc2\xb0C day\nrange of the AST-100, with a 292 passenger payload, is 7348 km (3968 n.mi.) or 70.4 km\n(38 n.mi.) greater than the Reference Configuration range taken from NASA CR-132374 for\na hot day at a cruise Mach number of 2.7. Fuel price is the largest contributor to\ndirect operating cost (DOC). However, if the AST-100 were flown subsonically (M = 0.9),\nDOC would increase approximately 50 percent because of time related costs.\n\n17. Key Words (Suggested by Author(s))\n\n18.

Baber, Jr.\nNASA Langley Research Center\nand\n\nE. E. Swanson\nVought Corporation\nHampton Technical Center\nSUMMARY\nThe Advanced Supersonic Technology configuration concept, AST-100, reported\nin this document is an update of the Reference Configuration baseline. In\nthis study, it was found that the combination of wing thickness reduction\n(to the minimum practical), nacelle recontouring for minimum drag at cruise,\nand using the horizontal tail during climb and cruise resulted in an increase\nin maximum lift-to-drag ratio. At cruise, the increase over that of the\nReference Configuration is about 4 percent.\nImprovement in aerodynamic efficiency made possible a reduction in engine\nsize from 363 kg/sec (800 Ibm/sec) airflow to 323 kg/sec (712 Ibm/sec).\nLighter engines and lower fuel weight associated with this resizing result in\na 6-percent reduction in takeoff gross weight compared to the Reference Configuration.\nThe AST-100 takeoff maximum effective perceived noise at the runway centerline and sideline measurement stations was 114.4 decibels. By applying the\n1.5 decibel allowable tradeoff from the approach noise, which is below the\n108 decibel limit, the required engine noise suppression is 4.9 decibels.\nOver the Mach number range considered, the maximum overpressure (sonic boom)\nwhich would be generated by the AST-100 is slightly lower than that of the\nReference Configuration. The largest maximum overpressure associated with\nthe AST-100 would occur during transonic climb acceleration when the aircraft was at relatively low altitude.\nCalculated "hot" (standard +8<>c) day performance of the AST-100, with a\n292 passenger payload, is 7349 km (3968 n.mi.).\nLateral-directional stability and control results indicate the need for\nfurther lateral-control research in the Supersonic Cruise Aircraft Research\n(SCAR) program to improve the data base.\n\nFuel price is the dominant element in direct operating cost (DOC). At\n30 cents per gallon, it accounts for 61 percent of DOC and, if doubled in\nprice, would account for 70 percent of DOC. If the AST-100 were flown subsonically (M = 0.9) instead of supersonically, DOC would increase approximately 50 percent.\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe Langley Research Center has, since 1972, been actively engaged in, and\ncontractually supporting, work in advanced supersonic technology for potential\napplication to future U.S. transport aircraft. Early conceptual studies, for\nexample reference 1, have identified configuration, stability and control,\nand performance problems. Continuing research has provided solutions to many\nof these problems, which were essentially aerodynamic in nature. An advanced\nsupersonic technology concept study performed in 1973 generated a baseline\nconfiguration. The objective of this study, reported in reference 2, was to\ndefine a Reference Configuration and related characteristics achievable\nthrough integration of research results obtained in the interim between 1969\nand 1973 (references 1 and 2).\nThe Reference Configuration provides a useful baseline for tradeoff studies!\nand for the quasi application of future technology improvements. Thus, this\nconfiguration has been used as the baseline for a tradeoff study reported\nherein. The study objective was to update the Reference Configuration through\napplication of recently obtained test data (from Langley full-scale tunnel\nand Ames 12^foot pressure tunnel) and advancements in analytical techniques\nand aerodynamic technology. Basic criteria for the study were as follows:\no Five abreast seating of 292 passengers, all tourist class with\nseat pitch of 0.864m (34 in.).\no Standard day cruise at M = 2.7.\no Range of 7408 km (4000 n.mi.) on standard day +8\xc2\xb0C* at M = 2.62.\no Engine size based on either noise considerations (ref. 3), transonic\nacceleration (with hot day thrust margin of 1.2), or cruise, whichever is critical.\ne\no Land on existing runways with tire footprint no greater than that of\nDC-8-50.\n\n*"Hot day" as used herein is a so-called "simple hot day." That is, the :\ntemperature at any altitude as found in the U.S. Standard Atmosphere, 1962\ntables is increased by the hot day increment (+8\xc2\xb0C for mission analysis and\n+10\xc2\xb0C for noise analysis) and the speed of sound is calculated for the increased\ntemperature, whereas other state variables are assumed to be the same as for a\n:\nstandard day.\n2\n\no Stability and control - Specifics can be found in the appropriate\nsection, but generally stated the criteria were:\nConfiguration to be trimmed,for minimum trim drag, throughout the\nflight envelope.\nNo significant pitch-up in the takeoff or landing modes.\nSatisfactory short-period characteristics at approach speed.\nCruise static margin at l.Og of at least three percent of the\nreference chord to offset reduction in stability due to flexibility at the required 2.5g maneuver.\nCruise directional stability such that the yawing moment derivative, Cn , is equal to or greater than zero for a 2.5g maneuver..\nThe current configuration is designated Advanced Supersonic Technology-100\n(AST-100). Significant changes resulting from the study are: wing thickness\nreduction and nacelle resizing, with an attendant improvement in transonic\nand supersonic lift-to-drag ratios; and a resized rudder to insure adequate\nyawing moment to compensate for a failed outboard engine.\nLateral and direction stability and control analyses were not performed for\nthe Reference Configuration prior to publication of reference 2. However,\nsubsequent effort in this area was expanded to evaluate the AST-100 lateral\nand directional characteristics. These characteristics, along with the\nlongitudinal stability and control, are presented in this report. Results\nfrom the control analysis illustrate the need for research on arrow-wing\nlateral control devices to generate experimental data for design of controls\nwhich provide adequate low-speed roll control.\nSonic Boom and direct operating cost analyses and engine definition was\nperformed by personnel of the Aeronautical Systems Division, Langley Research\nCenter. The remainder of the work reported herein was done by the Advanced\nAircraft Technology Group of the Vought Corporation, Hampton Technical Center.\nSYMBOLS\nComputations in the course of this study were performed in U.S. Customary\n(English) Units. Results were converted to the International System of Units\n(SI) by using conversion factors given in reference 4 and are presented in this\nreport along with the Customary Units.\nac\n\naerodynamic center\n\nA\n\ntotal equivalent body area, for cuts taken along Mach lines\n\n;\n\nA-\n\nequivalent body area due to lift and volume effects, for\ncuts taken along Mach lines\n\nAv\n\nequivalent body area due to volume effect, for cuts taken\nalong Mach lines\n\nAR\n\nwing aspect ratio\n\nb\n\nwing span\n\nc\n\nf\n\nreference mean aerodynamic chord\n\nc\n\nrudder chord\n\nc .\n\nvertical tail chord\n\ne.g., C.G.\n\ncenter-of-gravity\n\ncm\n\ncentimeter\n\nC\n\nCelsius\n\nCn\n\ndrag coefficient,\n\nq sWref\n\nskin friction drag coefficient\nr,\n\ndrag coefficient due to lift\n\nn\n\nwave drag coefficient\n\nACrv\nTAIL\nC.\n\ndrag increment due to 3.5 deg. angle of attack of the\nhorizontal tail\nlift coefficient,\n\nj i\n\nI l l l s V ^ V / l v l l l V ^ l ^ l l l f ^\n\nAC,\nTAIL\n\nLlft\n- \xe2\x80\xa2 ~ \xe2\x80\x94\n\nlift increment due to 3.5 deg. angle of attack of the\nhorizontal tail\n\nC,\n1\n\nrolling moment coefficient,\n3\n\nC-i\n\nrate-of-change of rolling moment coefficient with angle\nof sideslip\n\n3\n\nRolling Moment\nq Swref b\n\nCm\n\npitching moment coefficient, -

This new technology was utilized to evaluate wing thickness\nreduction, nacelle recontouring for minimum drag at cruise, and the use of the\nhorizontal tail in a lifting attitude during climb and cruise, for possible\nincrease in lift-to-drag ratio (L/D), and hence performance improvement over the\n\nconcept of reference 2. Basic aircraft geometry including wing area and\nplanform from the Reference Configuration was held constant. Passenger compartment arrangement and fuselage shape are essentially the same as the\nReference Configuration. Minor fuselage refairing was required to maintain\na favorable Mach number, M = 2.7, cross-sectional area distribution because of\nwing thickness reduction and rearward movement of the wing for balance.\nWing Thickness Selection\n\'A series of iterations were performed in which chordwise and spanwise thickness\ndistribution was varied and analyzed for effect on zero-lift wave drag at\nM = 1.2 and 2.7. In addition to the conventional criteria of basic wing\nstrength, the constraint of housing the main landing gear in the wing, without\nprotuberances, was imposed. Initially, the fuselage, empennage, and nacelles\nremained the same as for the Reference Configuration, and no attempt was made\nto optimize the M = 2.7 area distribution curve. In the wing thickness\n\'analysis, the thickness distributions of the Reference Configuration and\n509B (ref. 5) wings were compared as shown in figures 1 and 2. The 509B wing\nis believed to be representative of the minimum thickness achievable without\nincurring significant structural weight penalty. The 509B wing wave drag is\nlower than that of the Reference Configuration by 11 counts at M = 1.2 and 4.4\ncounts at M = 2.7. Therefore, the 509B wing was considered initially to be a\ncandidate wing for the AST-100. However, the tires would not fit within the\nmold lines of the thin wing of the 509B with allowance for minimum tire growth\nand clearance with structure. A new thickness distribution was developed to\nprovide minimum tire-gear clearance, with the outboard section from about 60\npercent semi-span to the tip sized by flutter criteria rather than strength.\nThickness was increased from 2.8 percent to 3 percent from the wing fin location\nto the tip to reduce structural penalty in this area. In addition, the maximum\nthickness was moved rearward from 50 percent to 60 percent chord to increase\nthe depth of the rear spar. Figures 3 and 4, respectively, show the AST-100\n(initial) spanwise thickness distribution and chord-wise maximum thickness\nlocation. Unfortunately, these changes results in wave drag increases over\nthe Reference Configuration of 15.7 counts at M = 1.2, and 2.0 counts at\nM = 2.7. To analyze this large increase in wave drag, the 509B wing was modified to increase tip thickness to three percent. This increased wave drag by\n5.1 counts at M = 1.2, and 1.6 counts at M = 2.7 over the original 509B\nwing.\nTo further examine the influence of the chordwise and spanwise thickness\ndistribution on wave drag, an interim AST-100 wing was generated with inboard\nmaximum thickness location forward of that of the AST-100 (initial) wing.\nInboard spanwise thickness was the same as the AST-100 (initial). The tip\nsection was the same as the Reference Configuration. Wave drag for this concept\nwas close to that of the AST-100 (initial). The selected profile for the\nAST-100 designated AST-100 (final) is shown in figures 5 and 6. The final\nAST-100 wing was selected as having characteristics closest to optimum with\nachievable geometry. For example, the maximum t/c chordwise location is as far\nrearward as practical and, of the wings considered in this study, it has the\nlowest volume and hence the lowest wave drag. At M = 1.2 the AST-100 wave\n\n10\n\ndrag is 3 counts lower than that of the Reference Configuration and 1.7 counts\nlower at cruise. Table I is a brief summary of results from some of the wing\nthickness distributions studied. These results indicate that the wave drag at\nM = 1.2 and 2.7 is quite sensitive to the combination of chordwise and spanwise\ndistribution and wing volume.\nThe AST-100 (final) wing was located to satisfy balance requirements.\nCorrect\nnacelle and empennage geometry was incorporated and the fuselage was then recontoured for minimum drag. The AST-100 (final) wing, along with the aforementioned changes, was then used in developing the drag polars for the final\nperformance analysis. A thickness map of the selected wing configuration is\nshown in figure 7.\nAST-100 Description\nThe AST-100 passenger seating arrangement, shown in figure 8, is the same as\nthat of the Reference Configuration. Seating is 5 abreast, all tourist class,\nto accommodate 292 passengers with a seat pitch of 0.864m(34 in.). Volume is\navailable below the cabin floor forward of the wing structural box for passenger baggage and containerized cargo. However, no cargo has been considered in\nthis study. Basic mission fuel is contained in itegral fuel tanks in the wing.\nA 15142 liter (4000 gal.) reserve fuel tank for extended range and/or centerof-gravity control is located in the aft fuselage. Figure 9 shows the general\narrangement of this arrow-wing configuration with geometric characteristics \xe2\x80\xa2\npresented in Table II.\nThe main landing gear is a two-strut arrangement with 12 wheels per strut. A\ncursory floatation analysis based on a final takeoff gross weight (TOGW) of\n325,679 Kg (718,000 Ibm) and a tire size of 36 x 11 indicated that floatation\ncriteria for landing on a runway of 0.610m (24 in.) flexible pavement with a\nsubsoil California Bearing Ratio (CBR) of 15 was satisfied. Since detailed\ndesign of the main landing gear was beyond the scope of this study, volume for\nclearance was provided based on wheel diameter and strut length only. Nose\nlanding gear was located forward of that of the Reference Configuration. This\nreduced flight crew compartment overhang and should improve ride quality in\nhigh-speed taxi conditions.\nThe AST-100 engine is a scaled version of the single spool variable geometry\nturbine non-afterburning turbojet Reference Configuration engine. Additional\nengine information can be found in the PROPULSION section. Nacelle geometry\nwas revised from the Reference Configuration "D" pod for cruise drag reduction\nas previously noted. Figure 10 shows a comparison of the two pod shapes.\nTypical engine installation is presented in figure 11.\nWing control surfaces are essentially the same as those of the Reference\nConfiguration. However, a minor modification to the inboard flaps, as an\n;\nincrease in span, was possible due to nacelle contour changes, a small increase\nin inboard nacelle displacement from the fuselage centerline, and fuselage\nrefairing. This inboard flap change increased the area thereof by 2.29 m^ <\n(24.6 ft2) per flap, or an increase of nearly 17 percent over the Reference\nConfiguration.\n\n11\n\nIdentification of the various wing control surfaces along with their respective\nsizes can be found in Table III.\nLOW-SPEED AERODYNAMICS\n\nMethod\nLow-speed aerodynamic characteristics were drived primarily from experimental\ndata of reference 6. Supplementary data such as air conditioning and propulsion drags, and landing gear drag were taken from references 2 and 1,\nrespectively.\nIn the low-speed regime, three flight modes were considered; namely, take-off\nand initial climb, climb-out, and approach. The conditions and parameters\nassociated with each of these is shown in Table IV.\nDrag data (horizontal tailoff) from reference 6 was adjusted for skin friction\ndifference between model and full-scale Reynold\'s numbers by the use of\nreference 7. The basic wind tunnel data from which the AST low-speed data was\ndeveloped is plotted in figure 12(a) & (b). The data was corrected for leading edge suction differences between model test and full-scale flight conditions\nby the use of a modified form of the equation given in reference 8. In reference 8, the classical form of the drag-due-to-lift, C^/TiAR, for an elliptically\nloaded wing was used for 100 percent suction. Hence, the expression used for\nleading-edge suction parameter s, defined as the measured suction in percent of\nthe total theoretical suction was\ntana s = \xe2\x80\x94 100 .\nx\nCL tana - CL /irAR\n\nThe values of s so determined are plotted on figure 12(a) & (b) as a function\nof CL- This curve is designated s model test - In addition drag coefficients\nfor 100 percent suction and 0 percent suction, calculated as C. ArrAR and\nCL tana, respectively are also plotted on figure 12(a) & (b). The suction\nincrement from test Reynold\'s number, R^, to full-scale R.. was taken at selected\nC L \'S from scaling curves generated in tests (unpublished) in the Ames Research\nCenter 12-Foot Pressure Tunnel. This increment was then added to the test\nsuction values plotted in figure 12(a) & (b) to obtain suction values for fullscale, which are also plotted on the same figures. Rearranging the equation\nand substituting, from figure 12(a) & (b), for C L 2 /7rAR, CL tana and s the\n\\\nappropriate values of CD 10Q%, CQ Q%, and s full-scale, the full-scale drag-dueto-lift was determined.\n\n12\n\nAn incremental downwash angle on the horizontal tail of 4\xc2\xb0 for flap-deflection\nfrom 20\xc2\xb0 to 40\xc2\xb0 was determined by interpolation using reference 6 data and\nunpublished results from tests in LRC\'s 7- by 10-foot tunnel. The latter\nsource was also used to estimate downwash due to 5\xc2\xb0 flap deflection (climb-out\ncase). These downwash angles were algebraically added to the angle of attack,\nand the tail incidence/elevator deflection angles (averaged) for an effective\nangle of attack to calculate CD as C, tana, where C, was obtained as AC.\nfrom tail-on and tail-off data of reference 6.\n\nThe ACD\n\nthus obtained for\n\nthe incremental flap deflection from 20\xc2\xb0 to 40\xc2\xb0 was subtracted from the\nreference 6 data for 5p-| aD = 40\xc2\xb0. In addition, the difference between model\nand full-scale horizontal tail skin friction, as estimated by use of the\nreference 7 computer program was also subtracted from reference 6 data for\nSFI = 40\xc2\xb0 to obtain a full-scale tail CD tQta1 of 0.0027 for the\n6\nin,o = 20\xc2\xb0- This model drag coefficient, as corrected to full-scale, was\nr I ap\ncompared to an estimated drag coefficient "buildup" of induced drag and profile\ndrag and found to be higher by 0.0035. This difference was attributed to interference drag. A similar drag coefficient "buildup" for the horizontal tail was\ndone for the climb-out configuration (Sp-, aD = 5\xc2\xb0). With the interference drag\ncoefficient assumed to be 0.00035, a total drag coefficient of 0.0009 was\nestimated for the horizontal tail.\nThe tail drag coefficients, based on the proper reference area, were then added\nto the reference 6 tail-off CD. For takeoff, this CD value was corrected for\nground effects by the method used in reference 2. Air conditioning and propulsion drag coefficients were taken from reference 2 with the latter being\ncorrected to the AST-100 engine airflow rate. Landing gear drag, for takeoff\nand approach, obtained from reference 1 is shown in figure 13.\nLow-Speed Drag Polars\nTakeoff and initial climb.- The takeoff and initial climb drag polar, obtained\nby the methods just described is shown in figure 14. Significant parameters\nare presented in Table IV with pertinent configuration geometry shown in\nTable III. This polar reflects the ground plane effect for an average height\nof the center of gravity above ground, h, to wing span, b, ratio of 0.2. From\nfigure IV-1A-26 (ref. 2) the lift increases 18 percent at an h/b = 0.2 whereas\nfigure IV-1A-33 (ref. 2) shows that C D increases non-1inearly with angle of\nattack, resulting in an increase of 0.0052 at the angles associated with the\ntakeoff/initial climb C, of 0.44.\ni\nClimb-out.- The climb-out polar in figure 15 is for landing gear retracted and\ntrailing-edge flaps at 5\xc2\xb0 (see table IV). Ground effect is not included in this\npolar. Profile drag is reduced significantly due to landing gear being up and\nflaps retracted from 20\xc2\xb0 to 5\xc2\xb0. Above a lift coefficient of 0.6, the polars of\n\n13\n\nfigures 14 and 15 are similar because drag reduction due to gear and flap\nretraction is more than offset by the lack of ground effect on lift for the\n"climb-out" condition.\nApproach.- The approach polar is presented in figure 16. For the approach,\nthe airplane is trimmed at the most aft center of gravity, 0.5600 c f, compared to climb center of gravity at 0.5375 c \' . (See Table IV). An important\ndifference between this polar and the one on figure 14 is that this one does not\ninclude ground plane effects. Since for out-of-ground effect condition the drag\nis reduced to a lesser extent than the lift, the L/D is significantly reduced\nabove a C. of 0.20 compared to the takeoff and initial climb polar.\nLift-to-Drag Ratios\nLift-to-drag ratios, taken from the polars of figures 14, 15, and 16 as a\nfunction of lift coefficient are presented in figure 17. Trends are as expected,\nwith the landing gear retracted and 5\xc2\xb0 flap deflection (climbout) configuration\nproducing the highest lift-to-drag ratios to a C. of 0.60.\nValues of L/D at design lift coefficients for the AST-100 are compared with\nthose of the Reference Configuration (ref. 2) in Table IV. The lift-to-drag\nratio, taken at the appropriate design C for takeoff and initial climb and\nclimbout, is about 0.82 higher for the AST-100. The L/D increase in the\napproach mode was not as large, with the increment being 0.26. Similar improvements in maximum L/D were noted at the optimum lift coefficients. Improvements\nin L/D for AST-100 compared to that of the Reference Configuration are attributed to updated test data (ref. 6) and the application of leading edge suction\nscaling effects.\nHIGH-SPEED AERODYNAMIC CHARACTERISTICS\n\nMethod\n\nThe method chosen for aerodynamic analysis of the AST-100 involved combining\nanalytically corrected zero-lift drag increments with lift-dependent drag based\non experimental data and a semi-empirical estimate of the horizontal tail\ncontribution to drag due to trim incidence. Zero-lift drag for the AST-100 was\ndetermined from a superposition of skin friction and roughness drag, wave drag,\npropulsion bleed drag, and air conditioning drag as discussed in detail in\nreference 2. The various drag increments presented in this reference were\nadjusted to reflect geometric differences between the AST-100 and the Reference\nConfiguration. Procedures used to establish each of these drag contributions !\nare outlined in several sub-sections which follow.\nSkin Friction and Roughness Drag.- The T1 method described in reference 9 was\nused to compute skin friction drag. Friction drag for a given Mach number/\naltitude combination was computed by representing various configuration\n\n14\n\ncomponents by appropriate wetted areas and reference lengths. Assumed\nconditions were smooth flat plate, adiabatic wall, and turbulent boundary layer.\nTransition was considered to be fixed at the leading edge of each component.\nComponents such as wing or tail, which have significant variations in reference\nlength, were subdivided into strips to improve the accuracy of friction drag\nestimates.\nBelow cruise, the ratio of roughness drag to skin friction drag developed in\nreference 2 for the Reference Configuration was used to determine roughness\ndrag increments for the AST-100. For the Mach 2.62 cruise condition, the\nroughness drag increment was assumed to be 6 percent of the skin friction drag.\nSkin friction and roughness drag data established for AST-100 at M = 0.6, 1.2,\nand 2.62 in the manner just described were used to adjust the values for the\nReference Configuration to reflect the effect of AST-100 geometry.\nThe skin friction drag data base for the Reference Configuration was limited to\n18,288m (60,000 ft).\nFor higher altitudes, a linear correction factor of\ndCD/dh = 0.123031 x 10"6 per meter (0.03750 x 10"6 per foot) was used to\n;\naccount for skin friction and roughness drag variation with altitude. This\nReynolds number effect was included in the range calculations for this study.\nComponent wetted areas and skin friction drag coefficient for the three Mach\nnumbers just cited, along with applicable altitudes, are presented in Table V.\nHave drag.- The supersonic area rule was the basis for AST-100 wave drag\ncomputations. The computer program employed is described in reference 10.\nTypical (in this case M = 2.62) equivalent area distributions for fuselage and\noverall configuration are presented in figure 18. With equivalent area distributions established, wave drag values were then computed for M = 1.2 and 2.62.\nThese wave drag points were used to adjust the wave drag data of reference 2\nfor other Mach numbers to account for the AST-100 geometry, as previously indicated for skin friction and roughness drag increments.\nAir-conditions and propulsion bleed drag.- Air-conditioning and propulsion\nbleed drag increments were obtained from reference 2. No modifications or\ncorrections were applied to the air-conditioning drag values. The data from\nreference 2 was for 363 kg/sec (800 Ibm/sec) airflow engines. Therefore,\npropulsion bleed drag values were scaled by the ratio 712/800 to make them consistent with the 323 kg/sec (712 Ibm/sec) airflow engines of the AST-100. These\ntwo drag increments as used in the AST-100 performance analysis, are presented\nin figure 19 as a function of Mach number.\nLift-dependent drag.- Reference 2 was the source of lift-dependent drag for the\nAST-100. The characteristic polar shapes contained therein are based on windtunnel data which were subsequently corrected for differences in wing reference\narea and aspect ratio as indicated in the reference. Since wing area and aspect\nratio for the AST-100 is identical to that of the Reference Configuration the\ndrag polar data from reference 2 were applicable to the former without correction.\n\n15\n\nHorizontal tail incidence drag.- The horizontal tail is set at an angle of\nattack of 3.5 degrees (relative to the local flow) for (L/D) to improve\nmax\ncruise performance. A small drag penalty is associated with the lift so generated. Semi-empirical estimates of this tail lift increment, in coefficient\nform, were made from delta wing theoretical and experimental data of reference\n11 and modified by information from references 12 or 13, as appropriate, to\naccount for the AST-100 horizontal tail being of clipped-delta planform. Drag\ncoefficient due to lift,Cp. , was calculated as a component of the normal force\ncoefficient by writing the latter as a function of C. and tail angle of attack\nand using C. values obtained in the manner just described. These incremental\nlift and drag values are shown in figure 20.\nDrag Polars\nOverall drag polars for the AST-100 were developed by combining zero-lift drag\nincrements (including air conditioning and propulsion bleed drag) and the\nhorizontal tail lift and drag increments with the characteristic polars from\nreference 2. The resulting polars are tabulated, for Mach number 0.6 through\n2.62, in Table VI. Three typical drag polars are plotted in figure 21 for\nM = 0.6, 1.2, and 2.62.\nMaximum Lift-to-Drag Ratios\nMaximum lift-to-drag ratios were graphically determined from the data of\nTable VI plotted as per figure 21. The resulting (L/D) values are shown in\nmax\n\nfigure 22 as a function of Mach number along with comparable values for the\nReference Configuration. From figure 22 it can be seen that (L/D) for\nmax\nAST-100 is higher than that of the Reference Configuration over the Mach number\nrange considered. The combination of wing-thickness reduction and nacelle and\nfuselage recontouring resulted in an increase in maximum (L/D) of about 0.35,\nor 4 percent, at cruise.\nSTABILITY AND CONTROL\nSubsequent to publication of reference 2, a 0.10- scale model of the Reference\nConfiguration was tested in the LRC 30 x 60-Foot Full Scale Tunnel. Analysis\nof these data, reported in reference 6, indicated that the Reference Configuration has, compared to the estimated aerodynamic characteristics of reference 2,\nlower longitudinal stability at low angles of attack, less negative wing-body :\nzero-lift pitching moment, and gradual pitch-up at the lift coefficient associated with the defined minimum flight speed.\nThe AST-100 is, therefore, believed to be a more realistic baseline configuration since the low speed aerodynamic characteristics developed herein are based\n16\n\non improved experimental data of reference 6 and recent unpublished data\nobtained in the ARC 12-Foot Pressure Tunnel.\nCriteria\nPrior to determining stability and control characteristics of the AST-100,\ncriteria were set forth as follows:\nLongitudinal\n(Take-off) - Forward center of gravity set at a position for neutral stability;\ncenter-of-gravity range of 66.cm (26 inches); landing gear location set by nosewheel lift-off speed, consistent with maximum lift coefficient in ground effect;\ncontrol to geometry limit in full ground effect, and no significant pitch-up.\n(Landing) - Aft center-of-gravity limit based on the ability to provide nose :\ndown pitching acceleration of 0.08 rad/sec? at the minimum demonstrated speed,\nat the normal landing weight (critical condition); satisfactory dynamic shortperiod characteristics at the approach speed with stability augmentation, and\nno significant pitch-up.\n(Cruise) - A positive static margin > 3 percent at M = 2.7 to compensate for\nfor loss of stability due to structural flexibility at the required 2.5g pullup maneuver condition.\nLateral-Directional\n(General) - Negative roll due to positive sideslip (positive dihedral effect).\n(Taxiing) - For cross-wind taxiing, minimum control speed shall be sufficiently\nlow such that nose-wheel steering can be used.\n(Take-off) - Directional control sufficient to trim the airplane in a 15.4 m/sec\n(30Kt) 90 degree cross-wind. Directional control sufficient to counteract an\noutboard engine failure at full thrust engine failure speed for balanced field\nlength of 3200m (10,500 ft.).\n(Landing) - Airplane shall possess, in the approach mode, inherent Dutch-roll\nstability with acceptable levels of undamped natural frequency (u^ > 0.4 rad/sec);\nacceptable levels of damped natural frequency obtained by use of a yaw damper.\nLateral control, at or above the normal approach speed, shall be sufficient to\nproduce a 30 degree roll response in 2.5 seconds after initiation of a rapid,\nfull control (assuming a 0.25 second ramp at initiation of control input);\ndirectional control at or above the normal approach speed, shall be sufficient\nto produce a 10 degree sideslip angle with not more than 75 percent of full\nlateral control to maintain wings-level flight.\n(Cruise) - Directional stability such that C\n\n> 0 at\nB "\n\nn\n\nmaneuver.\n\nM = 2.7\n\nfor the 2.5g\n\n17\n\nData Base\nHigh-lift configuration longitudinal stability and control data were obtained,\nas previously noted, from reference 6 and unpublished ARC data. This experimental data included leading edge flap deflection, trailing edge flap deflection,\nthrust, and horizontal tail incidence/elevator deflection effects. Transonic\nand supersonic data were obtained from unpublished results from LRC 8-Foot\nTransonic Tunnel Test No. 503 and LRC Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel Test No. 827,\nrespectively, These data were corrected for horizontal tail volume differences\nand based on the reference dimensions of the AST-100 by the method presented in\nreference 2.\nLateral-directional stability and control data for the high-lift configuration\nwere taken from reference 1, and unpublished results from LRC 7 x 10-Foot High\nSpeed Tunnel Test No. 893, corrected for vertical tail volume, ventral position\nand size differences and based on AST-100 reference dimensions. Reference 1 was\nalso the source of supersonic data. The data were corrected for vertical tail\nvolume, ventral position and size differences and based on AST-100 reference\ndimensions.\nWing flexibility associated with lateral control deflections, high-speed wing\ntwisting, and fuselage bending effects were taken from reference 1.\nControls\nLongitudinal, lateral, and directional control elements, which are partially\nidentified in Table III were considered to be as follows:\nLongitudinal\nLateral\nDirectional\nLeading-edge flaps\nOutboard ailerons\nAll-movable rudder\nTrail ing-edge flaps\nOutboard-spoiler-slot ( full - s P an > three\nSe ment\nAll-movable horizontal and inverted slot\n9\n\'\ntail/geared elevator\ndeflectors\nInboard flaperons\nStatic Longitudinal Stability and Control\nThe effect of horizontal tail size and control deflection on stability and trim\nof the AST-100 was investigated for the approach mode at a T/W of 0.164. Results\nare plotted on figure 23. A subsequent paragraph presents the selection of\nhorizontal tail size in terms of tail volume coefficient and as related to\ncenter-of-gravity limits to satisfy longitudinal stability and control criteria.\nLongitudinal control power capability was estimated for various combinations of\ntail incidence, i.L , and elevator deflection, 6 . The data indicated that an\n6\n18\n\ni f /<5\nL\n\nc\n\ncombination of + 20/25 degrees would give maximum control effectiveness.\n\nData at maximum incidence/deflection were corrected to full-scale Reynold\'s\nnumber by the use of information from reference 2 (fig. Vl-2-8). Pitching\nmoment increments for various combinations of tail incidence/elevator deflection,\nfrom tunnel test data corrected for the difference in horizontal tail arm and\nbased on full-scale exposed tail area, are presented in figure 24.\nAnalysis of reference 6 data indicated a forward shift in aerodynamic center of\napproximately 4 percent c f which, combined with less negative wing-body zerolift pitching moments, negates the tail up-load required to trim the Reference\nConfiguration. As a result, for the AST-100 approach, a slight tail down-load\nis required to trim, notwithstanding a 2.26 percent negative static margin\nduring the approach mode of flight. For climb and cruise performance computations the horizontal tail/elevator were considered to be at the incidence/\ndeflection required for minimum trim drag and hence produce maximum L/D. The\ntail, for this condition, therefore, provides an up-load. Required center-ofgravity locations to achieve the condition of minimum trim drag are presented\nin figure 25 as a function of Mach number.\nSupersonic stability of the AST-100 was estimated from the aerodynamic center\ndata of reference 2 (figure Vi-2-12) which was developed for low-lift coefficients. This data was corrected for the more rearward location of the AST-100\nwing and additional flexibility associated with the larger horizontal tail.\nThe resulting flexible airplane aerodynamic center location is shown on figure\n25 as a function of Mach number. It can be seen that there is a large static\nmargin for Ig level flight at supersonic speeds. This is more than adequate to\ncompensate for loss of stability in the 2.5g maneuver at cruise conditions.\nFurther, from figure 25, static stability in the transonic region is lower than\nthat at supersonic speeds, which is highly desirable from a transonic maneuverability consideration.\nTakeoff and climb-out center-of-gravity limits were estimated based on TOGW,\nand pitch moment of inertia, takeoff T/W and takeoff C^\nin ground effect\nmax\n(for take-off) and out of ground effect (for climb-out). Landing center-ofgravity limits were influenced by normal landing weight (and pitch inertia) and\nrequired pitching acceleration to comply with control criteria. By noting the\nmaximum trim capability at minimum demonstrated speed from figure 23 and determining the center-of-gravity position for neutral stability, at the approach\nspeed, forward and aft center-of-gravity limits were calculated. Results are\nshown on figure 26 as a function of tail size expressed as horizontal tail\nvolume coefficient, V. It can be seen that the tail size required to satisfy\nlongitudinal stability criteria is 0.0472 which corresponds to a tail area of\n39.95 m2 (430 ft 2 ). Tail area as used here included the elevator.\nParameters affecting nose-wheel lift-off, and which were considered in the\nanalysis, are: wing body zero-lift pitching moment (in ground effect), horizontal tail maximum lift coefficient (in ground effect), takeoff maximum airplane lift coefficient (in ground effect), landing gear location rearward of\nthe center-of-gravity limit, and takeoff center-of-gravity range. Nose wheel t\nlift-off was established by performing take-off control calculations to\n\n19\n\ndetermine landing-gear location rearward of the take-off aft center-of-gravity\nposition. These calculations required the assumption of reasonable values of\nnose wheel lift-off speed (corresponding to CL = 0.52), T/W (= 0.296) and tail\nC.\n(= 1.896). The result was an acceptable landing-gear location of 167.6cm\nmax\n(66 in.) aft of the 0.56 c ref thereby confirming the validity of the nose wheel\nlift-off conditions assumed for the calculations.\nFinalized static stability and trim data for the AST-100 in the initial climb,\nclimb-out at engine "cutback", and approach modes of flight are presented in\nfigures 27, 28, and 29, respectively. As can be seen on figure 29, the critical\ndesign case was for normal landing weight (at lowest approach speed) rather than\nfor maximum landing weight, for which the pitch moment of inertia was larger.\nFrom the data of figures 25, 27, 28, and 29, the AST-100 center-of-gravity range\nis from 42.95 to 56.00 percent of the reference mean aerodynamic chord.\nStatic Lateral-Directional Stability and Control\nAST-100 static lateral-directional stability and control characteristics are\nbased on estimates for the Reference Configuration made subsequent to publication of reference 2. These earlier estimates were modified to account for\ndifferences in aft fuselage length, and ventral fin size and location. This\nunpublished analysis indicated that the critical directional stability condition\nwas for cruise at M = 2.7 with the flexible airplane required to exhibit at\nleast a zero level of directional stability (Cn Q > 0) in a 2.5g pull-up maneuver.\n?\n2\nPrior analyses have indicated that a vertical tail of 15.8m (170 ft ) would\nprovide sufficient directional stability in the high-lift configuration but\ninadequate stability in the 2.5g maneuver at M = 2.7. To reduce dependency\nupon the vertical tail for stability, this deficiency in directional stability\ncan be alleviated by use of a large aft fuselage-mounted ventral fin. It must,\nhowever, be compatible with the ground clearance angle for landing. The ventral\nfin designated l^ in LRC Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel Test No. 827 (unpublished)\nhas a full-scale area of 20.25m2 (218 ft 2 ). This ventral (with vertical tail)\nwill provide adequate directional stability and can be accommodated on the\nAST-100.\nWing-body test data from LRC Test No. 827 for a wing leading-edge radius of 0.5\npercent wing chord was used to develop AST-100 lateral-directional stability\ncharacteristics. Based on trends of wing-mounted fin and ventral fin data, the\nvertical tail contribution to side force was extrapolated. Using this sideforce trend, the vertical tail contribution to directional stability was estimated. This estimated data was corrected for tail size and location. Measured\nwing-mounted fin contribution to lateral-directional stability was taken from\nLRC Test No. 827 results and corrected to AST-100 fin area. Finally, measured\ncontribution of the ventral, U2, was also found in LRC Test No. 827 data.\nBefore summing, all component data were based on AST-100 reference dimensions.\nTest model leading-edge sweep was 74/65 degrees compared to 74/70/65 for the\nAST-100. Consequently, test rolling moment due to sideslip was corrected for\n20\n\nleading sweep by the method of reference 14. Flexibility effects applied to\nthe developed data were taken from reference 1.\nEstimated cruise (M = 2.7) static lateral-directional stability characteristics\nfor a flexible AST-100 are shown on figure 30 as a function of lift coefficient.\nThe lift coefficient of 0.098 for Ig cruise is the highest coefficient consistent\nwith conditions at the end of cruise. From this figure it can be seen that there\nis sufficient directional stability to meet the criterion of Crig > 0 in a 2.5g\n"pull-up" maneuver.\nWhereas for a normal takeoff, the thrust is less than maximum available, it is\nincreased to the maximum of the operating engines in the event of an engine\nfailure. This, therefore, is the critical condition for directional control\nsizing. For the previously selected vertical tail size of 15. 8m^ (170 ftO, a\ndirectional control surface sizing parametric study was performed. Conditions\nwere, a TOWG of 325,679Kg (718,000 Ibm), an aft center-of-gravity at 0.56 C^,\nand full-thrust engine-failure speed of 97.2 m/sec (189Kts).\nA three dimensional control effectiveness (i.e. rate-of-change of fin angle-ofattack with control surface deflection), T3d1m, has been developed and presented\nin reference 15 to account for control chord and span dimensions as follows:\n\n1*\n+\ns\n- span of control surface\n2dim (avg.)\n\nc\n\n(avg.)\n\naverage surface cnord\n\n^ + g >2A\n\nc\n\nvt\n\nAn effectiveness parameter, K,, was developed as a function of control deflection,\nand a flexibility factor, K,,, was assumed so that T\' = K-jK^ dim\'\nK, and 1C, are presented in figure 31.\n\nThe\n\nfactors\n\n\'\n\nVertical tail contribution to lateral-directional stability for the Reference\nConfiguration was developed (aforementioned unpublished analysis) subsequent\nto reference 2 publication. This data was corrected for AST-100 vertical tail\nlocation and is presented in figure 32. Data from this figure, in combination\'\nwith calculated values of T\', was used to calculate yawing moment capability f\nwhich is presented in parametric format in figure 33. It can be seen that there\nare numerous combinations of rudder size and control deflection which will\n\n21\n\nsatisfy static yaw balance for the failed outboard engine condition. As a\ncompromise between maximum aerodynamic benefits from an all-movable vertical\ntail and control actuation problems associated therewith, a full-span 40 percent\nchord rudder with a maximum deflection of 35 degrees was selected.\nMaximum rigid lateral control contributions from outboard ailerons, outboard\nspoiler-slot and inverted spoiler-slot deflectors, and inboard flaperons have\nbeen estimated previously (unpublished analysis). Estimated rigid contributions\nwere modified by factors from reference 1 to account for flexibility associated\nwith control deflection. Results, along with yawing moment contributed by these\ncontrols, are presented in figure 34 as a function of lift coefficient.\nThrough the use of Laplace transform techniques, the single degree-of-freedom\nroll equation was solved to express roll angle, 4>, as a function of time for a\nramp control input. The resulting equation was used to determine rolling moment\nL, (and subsequently the coefficient C1) required to achieve a given roll angle\nin a specified time. Available rolling moment, in coefficient form, was derived\nfrom figure 34. Available and required rolling moment coefficient are plotted\nas a function of equivalent airspeed in figure 35 for takeoff and figure 36 for\napproach. For takeoff, reference 16 permits the required bank angle (30 deg.)\nto be reduced by the ratio of maximum landing weight inertia to TOGW inertia.\nSince this ratio, for the AST-100, is .863 the required (reduced) bank angle is\n25.9 degrees. Satisfactory roll response, at and above lift-off speed, is\nindicated in figure 35. Figure 36 indicates satisfactory roll response in the\napproach mode above 97.7 m/sec (190Kts). Further, it should be noted that, at\nspeeds less than the normal approach speed of 80.5 m/sec (156.4Kts), the roll\nresponse would be inadequate to meet a Level 2 (ref. 16) roll requirement.\nTwo conditions, steady sideslip during the approach and during takeoff ground\nroll in 90-degree cross wind, were considered in determining lateral and\ndirectional control required to trim.\nFor the approach, lateral and directional control deflections were estimated by\nsolving the two degree-of-freedom roll and yaw steady-state trim equations for\npositive sideslip angles of 6, 8, and 10 degrees at zero bank angle (wings\nlevel). Results, shown in figure 37, indicate adequate directional control and\npositive dihedral effect (left rudder and right roll control). Achievable sideslip data for the lateral control limits of 75 and 100 percent were developed by\ncross plotting data from the lower part of figure 37 as the upper part of\nfigure 38. The lower part of figure 38 was produced by cross plotting data from\nthe upper part of figures 37 and 38. These results clearly indicate that a 10degree sideslip (wings level) cannot be achieved with 75 percent (or less) of\nmaximum roll control at speeds below 102.9m/sec (200 Kts). Furthermore,\nadherence to 75 percent of maximum roll control capability limits the effective\ndihedral to 7 degrees of sideslip at 77.7 m/sec (151Kts). To increase the\nachievable-sideslip angle will require an increase in roll control capability\nand/or a decrease in positive dihedral effect. Neither of these potential\nsolutions were pursued since further iteration for sizing was beyond the scope\nof this study. Refinement effort to overcome these deficiencies (roll angle\nresponse and "wing level" sideslip) would be hindered by limitations of the\npresent experimental knowledge of the effectiveness of lateral controls on\n\n22\n\narrow wings under the influence of aeroelastic deformations. Hence, the need\nfor further lateral-control research is indicated.\nTake-off ground roll cross-wind directional control capability was evaluated on\nthe basis of minimum achievable sideslip angle (9.3 deg) with maximum lateral\ncontrol and associated airplane speed (77.7 m/sec, 151Kts) selected from figure\n38. Operationally allowable cross-wind speed, calculated as Vcw = VtanB, is\n12.7 m/sec (24.7Kts). The rationale here is that since the AST-100, in the\napproach mode, is limited to cross-winds < 12.7 m/sec (24.7Kts) rather than the\ngoal of 15.4 m/sec (30Kts), the cross-wind criterion for ground roll should be\nconsistent with the approach cross-wind constraint. Directional control\nrequirements, in terms of rudder deflections, were determined by equating yawing moment, 6 C\n(due to rudder deflection) to airplane yawing moment (due\nr n6^\nto sideslip) expressed as C 3n\n\ne\n\nIt was assumed that rotation about the longi-\n\ntudinal axis of the aircraft was not required. Results, as a function of takeoff ground roll speed, are shown in figure 39. It can be seen that, in a 12.7\nm/sec (24.7Kts) cross-wind, directional control cannot be maintained at groundroll speeds less than about 46.3 m/sec (90Kts). The implication is that, in\nsuch cross-winds, nose-wheel steering and/or differential thrust would have to\nbe used during the initial segment of take-off ground roll.\n\nDynamic Stability\nFor the AST-100, only the approach mode of flight was considered in evaluating\nthe inherent longitudinal short-period and lateral-directional stability\ncharacteristics. This was done by performing a simple controls-fixed dynamic\nanalysis to obtain roots of the characteristic-uncoupled equations of motion\nand comparing these roots with handling qualities criteria selected from\nreferences 16 and 17.\nFor the longitudinal mode, examination of the roots of the characteristic\nequation of motion indicated that the AST-100 inherent characteristics, for the\ncritical case of approach with a center-of-gravity at .56 C f (2.25 percent\nnegative static margin), are unacceptable when compared with the referenced\ncriteria. The problem was alleviated by incorporating a modest level of pitchrate damping which appeared promising, based on a simple Hardened Stability\nAugmentation System (HSAS) concept presented in reference 18. Since the damping\nratio, with an assumed HSAS pitch-rate damping gain of 3 degrees of i t /degree\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nper second of 6, is greater than 1.3 the short period characteristics would\nstill be unacceptable. As the low-speed approach with the center-of-gravity\nat the aft limit is the only condition at which the airplane would be flown\nunstable (see fig. 25), the use of SAS that included a pitch-stiffness function\nin lieu of the simple HSAS seemed feasible. A pitch-stiffness gain of 1 degree\nof i\'t/degree change in attitude, 6, combined with the aforementioned pitch-rate\ndamping gain produced acceptable short period characteristics as shown on\nfigures 40 and 41.\n\n23\n\nExamination of the roots of the characteristic equations of motion (see\nTable VII) indicates that the inherent AST-100 lateral-directional dynamic\nstability characteristics are: a stable spiral mode; and unacceptable rolldamping mode; and an unstable Dutch-roll mode with acceptable undamped natural\nfrequency. Inherent Dutch-roll characteristics, at normal and maximum landing\nweights, for the approach mode are presented in figure 42. The effect of\nincreased damping ratio is illustrated here. It can be seen that a yaw damper\ncapable of providing a damping ratio slightly greater than 0.2 would correct\nthe AST-100 Dutch-roll characteristics from unsatisfactory to satisfactory.\nPROPULSION\nEngine Description\nThe engine cycle selected for the AST-100 study was the same as for the\nReference Configuration. This engine is a single spool, non-after-burning,\nJP-4 fueled turbojet with a variable geometry turbine and nozzle. The exhaust\nnozzle is convergent-divergent and completely variable in both throat and exit\nareas. Nozzle areas were varied throughout the flight envelope to achieve a\nfully expanded flow within the nozzle.\nSeveral changes in the baseline Reference Configuration such as reduced wing\nthickness and nacelle recontouring, which were discussed in CONFIGURATION\nDEVELOPMENT, resulted in drag reduction. This in turn resulted in a reduction\nin the engine size required and, consequently, a reduction in engine weight and\nnacelle size.\nTurbine geometry was sized to meet engine flow requirements at the design\npoint. However, at part power, turbine geometry was allowed to vary such that\nthe engine could continue operation at the compressor design point with lower\nturbine inlet temperature. Compared to an engine with a fixed geometry turbine,\nthis mode of operation can yield a given thrust level at reduced fuel\nconsumption.\nIn the course of the study, several engines were studied. The one selected for\nthe AST-100 was designated AST-JP-2; the numeral 2 simply denoting the second\nin a series.\nPerformance\nResults of preliminary takeoff, noise, and mission analysis studies dictated\nengine size for the engine cycle selected. Design point parameters for the\nAST-JP-2 were:\no- Overall pressure ratio of 15:1\no Turbine inlet temperature of 1700\xc2\xb0K (3060\xc2\xb0R)\no Uninstalled corrected compressor airflow of 323 kg/sec (712 Ibm/sec)\n\n24\n\nAn engine defined by these parameters would produce an uninstalled sea-level\nstandard day static thrust of 327.390N (73,600 Ibf).\nRequired engine performance parameters were computed by the use of the ratio of\nrequired corrected airflow to the baseline corrected airflow. For example,\nrequired gross thrust, F\nwas determined as\n\nCWa^\nF\n\n9r\n\n= F\n-~f9b CWab\n\nEffects such as inlet, nozzle, thrust reverser, service air bleed of 0.454 kg/sec\n(1 Ibm/sec) and power extraction of 149KW (200 HP) are included in the installed\nperformance for the AST-JP-2 engine.\nThe computer program used in the reference 2 study was employed to generate two\n.sets of installed performance data. One set, for a simple hot day of standard\n+10\xc2\xb0C atmospheric conditions was used in the takeoff and approach noise analysis.\nThe other set, for a simple hot day of standard +8\xc2\xb0C atmospheric conditions,\nwas used in the mission analysis portion of the study. The data are presented\nin figures 43 through 52. Static thrust and related thrust-to-weight ratio are\nsummarized in the following table.\n\nSea Level\nStandard Day\nStd. + 8\xc2\xb0C Day\n^tri + in\xc2\xb0r r>;w\n\nUnin.stalled\nStatic Thrust, N(lbf)\n\nT/W\n\n327,390 (73,600)\n\n.41\n\nInstalled\nStatic Thrust, N(lbf)\n306,447 (68,892)\n293,485 (65,978)\n?QO\n\n?fifi (fi^ ?7fi^\n\nT/W\n.38\n.37\n\xe2\x80\xa2jg\n\nEngine Weight\n\nThrough the use of scale factors which are a function of the corrected airflow\nratio (previously defined), it was possible to compute engine weight and\ndimensions. These scale factors, taken from reference 19 and presented in\nfigure 53, are considered to be typical for a single and two-spool turbojet\nengine. AST-JP-2 engine weight was calculated to be 5914 kg (13011 Ibm) by\nscaling from the weight of the General Electric GE-4 engine with the scale\nfactors shown in figure 53. The weight of the gas generator, nozzle, and thrust\nreverser is included in the engine weight.\nNacelle\nAs noted in a previous section, the engine nacelle was recontoured to reduce\nthe drag thereof below that of the Reference Configuration "D" nacelle. The\nAST-JP-2 nacelle was defined geometrically by scaling the GE-4 nacelle to match\nthe AST-JP-2 airflow of 323 kg/sec (712 Ibm/sec). Once again, scaling was by\nuse of data from figure 53. To the correctly sized engine, a fully expanded\n25\n\nexhaust nozzle was added to meet the following conditions:\nM = 2.7\nAltitude = 19812m (65000 ft)\n\nStandard + 8\xc2\xb0C atmosphere\nAir intake capture diameter and length were sized from data in reference 1 as a\nfunction of airflow modified by the appropriate scale factor from figure 53.\nThe cylindrical cowl, from the compressor face to the nozzle exit, was sized\nat the same diameter as the nozzle exit. The air intake was given a conic\nsection shape to match the capture diameter and cowl diameter over the scaled\nair intake length. An isentropic spike was selected as the air intake centerbody. A sketch of the resulting nacelle profile, along with tabulated dimensions, is shown in figure 54.\nMASS CHARACTERISTICS\nMethod\nIt was necessary to establish the mass and size characteristics of a configuration which could achieve, within the given criteria, the desired mission goal\nstated in the INTRODUCTION. A number of candidate aircraft configurations were\nsubjected to a computerized mass properties evaluation and sizing synthesis on\nthe basis of TOWG and thrust-to-weight ratio (T/W). The structural mass\nanalysis was based on an all titanium primary structure. Design features/\nfabrication techniques for major components were assumed to be as follows:\no\no\no\no\n\nWing and Aerodynamic Surfaces - Stresskin titanium skin/core\nsandwich panels\nFuselage - Titanium skin/stringer/frame construction\nLanding Gear - Two strut main gear and single strut nose gear\nstructure of high strength steel alloy\nEngines - Single spool, non-afterburning turbojet with variable\ngeometry turbine and exhaust nozzle\n\nAll mass evaluations were performed using a Vought developed LRC "in-house"\nComputerized Statistical Mass Properties Estimating Program. This program was\nused to generate mass data for the Reference Configuration. Hence, its use in\nthe present study ensured that all evaluations were performed on a consistent\nbasis and thus any trends developed from design variations would be real value\ndifferences. Payload, cruise speed, and range parameters were held constant,\nwhile design gross mass (DGM) and T/W were varied. The sizing synthesis and\nconfiguration selection involved the generation of a matrix of approximately\n100 candidate aircraft with an array of DGM\'s varying from 308,445 kg\n(680,000 Ibm) to 340,195 kg (740,000 Ibm) with the standard day, sea level\nuninstalled T / W \' s varying from 0.36 to 0.50. Data from this program were then\nused in mission performance evaluations reported in the MISSION ANALYSIS\n26\n\nsection. The AST-100 with a design gross mass of 325,679kg (718,000 Ibm) was\nselected as the configuration having the capability of meeting mission goals.\nThis is a 6 percent reduction in take-off gross weight compared to the Reference\nConfiguration (ref. 2).\nMass and Inertia\nGross mass breakdown in the form of a bar chart is presented in figure 55 where\nthe major items of weight are identified and are also shown as a percentage of\n, TOGW. A mass summary by principal subsystems of structure, propulsion, systems\n\' and equipment, fuel and payload, is presented in Table VIII. To give the reader\ninsight into the mass accountability "bookkeeping," a detail mass distribution,\nby subsystems, is shown in Table IX.\nMoments of inertia for the AST-100 about the three axes, X, Y, and Z, were\ncalculated for two flight conditions, takeoff and approach, since these are the\nflight modes for which dynamic stability and control analyses were performed.\nFor the approach mode, inertias were calculated for both normal and maximum\nlanding weight (TOGW - .5x mission fuel weight). These inertia data are given\nin Table X.\nBalance characteristics of the AST-100 were tailored so that all takeoff, cruise\nand landing center-of-gravity points lie within the limits dictated by longitudinal stability and control criteria. Combinations of fuel burn-tank sequencing were investigated, and the most forward and aft boundaries, compatible with\nthe stability and control constraints determined. A plot of these boundaries,\nvarying with weight, is presented in figure 56. Aerodynamically constrained\ncenter-of-gravity limits are as follows:\nPercent c\n\nref\n\nForward Limit\nTakeoff\nLanding\nBegin Cruise\nEnd Cruise\n\nAft Limit\n\n53.75\n42.00\n\nPosition for\nMin. Trim Drag\n\n56.00\n56.00\n48.50\n49.80\n\nAll required center-of-gravity locations throughout a typical flight profile\nlie within the boundaries shown in figure 56, which are attainable by proper\nfuel burn/transfer management.\n\n27\n\nENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS\n\nNoise\nAST-100 noise characteristics have been calculated for both takeoff and approach\nconditions. Jet exhaust noise as effective perceived noise level (EPNL) and the\nairframe noise as overall sound pressure level (OASPL) were calculated for the\nmeasurement stations prescribed in reference 3. The relative location of these\nstations is shown in figure 57.\nEngine noise calculation is based on method 2 of reference 20. Details of the\nnoise prediction method are given in section VI-5 of reference 2. However, the\nmethod used in the present study included some modifications taken from\nreference 21. One of these was the use of the variation of OASPL with relative\njet velocity from reference 21 instead of from reference 20. The difference\nbetween these two can be seen in figure 58. Further, the variation of density\nexponent with jet relative velocity is taken from reference 21 rather than using\na constant value of 2 as per the reference 20 method. Finally, the variation of\ndirectivity corrections with frequency and jet relative velocity were also taken\nfrom reference 21 instead of from the reference 2 study.\nEngine performance, speed of sound, and atmospheric absorption factors for noise\nattenuation were based on a 25\xc2\xb0C (77\xc2\xb0F) day and 70 percent humidity.\nTakeoff Noise Analysis.- Takeoff noise level evaluation consisted of an engine\nsizing parametric study and a final noise analysis compared to the criteria of\nreference 3. The effects of trailing edge flap angle and engine power setting\non takeoff noise level at the measurement stations shown in figure 57 were\nincluded in the study. For this study TOGW was held constant at 326,363 Kg\n(718,000 Ibm). Deflection of the three inboard flaps was varied from 5\xc2\xb0 to 20\xc2\xb0.\nSpeed at start of rotation and lift-off varied, of course, with flap angle. For\neach flap deflection and power setting selected, a takeoff noise profile was\ngenerated. At maximum gross thrust, the exhaust gas velocity at sea level\nstandard day + 10\xc2\xb0C takeoff is 971 m/s (3188 ft/s), (see fig. 50(a)). This results\nin unacceptable noise levels. Therefore, the effect of reduced power settings,\ncorresponding to jet exit velocities from 701 m/s (2300 ft/s) to 762 m/s\n(2500 ft/s) for a sea level standard + 10\xc2\xb0 day, was examined. Each takeoff\nprofile was constrained to pass through the thrust "cut back" point of 214m\n(700 ft) altitude at a down-range distance of 5944m (19500 ft). At the "cut\nback" point, the three inboard trailing edge flaps were retracted to 5\xc2\xb0 and\nengine power reduced to the minimum allowed by reference 3.\nFigure 59 shows the effect of takeoff distance, to clear a 10.68m (35 ft)\nobstacle, on the EPNL at the 6486m (3.5 n.mi.) point from brake release as a ;\nfunction of flap deflection and power setting. If the initial engine power ;\n(jet exit velocity) is reduced, then the acceleration is lower and hence air-i\ncraft speed at the 6486ml (3.5 n.mi.) point is lower. At lower speed, this L/|D\nis reduced, and consequently, a higher "cut-back" thrust level is required to\nmeet the "one engine out" requirement of reference 3. Thus, for a given takeoff\n28\n\ndistance, the lower the initial power setting (jet exit velocity), the higher\nthe thrust required after "cut back" and, hence, the higher the noise level at\nthe measurement point as shown in figure 59.\nThe effect of takeoff distance on the EPNL at the sideline measurement point\n(fig. 57) was also determined as a function of flap deflection and power setting.\nResults are shown in figure 60. It can be seen that, for a given power setting\n(jet exit velocity), sideline noise is slightly dependent upon takeoff distance\nand flap deflection and, conversely, more strongly dependent upon engine power\nlevel.\nInstalled T/W varies for each power setting (jet exit velocity). For example,\nusing the upper plot of figure 61 it can be seen that, for an uninstalled T/W\nof 0.41 and a jet velocity of 701 m/s (2300 ft/s), the installed T/W is 0.259,\nwhereas at 762 m/s (2500 ft/s), the installed T/W is 0.282. Using these\ninstalled T/W\'s, the variation in noise level with jet exit velocity can be\nobtained and then related to uninstalled T/W\'s.\nThe effect of uninstalled T/W on EPNL at the 6486m (3.5 n.mi.) point for a takeoff distance of 3200m (10,500 ft) and three jet exit velocities can be seen in\nfigure 61. For each T/W the takeoff distance was held constant by changing the\nflap deflection and initial rotation speed. For each jet exit velocity, and\nhence each T/W, there is a value of EPNL at which the sideline noise is equal\nto the centerline noise. The locus of these points is also shown on figure 61.\nReference 3 limits the EPNL at the two takeoff measurement points and the\nmeasurement point for approach to 108dB (see fig. 61). However, reference 3\nallows noise tradeoffs to be made between the three measurement points with\nthe provision that no more than 2dB can be applied to noise exceedence at any\npoint and that the sum of exceedence cannot be greater than 3dB. The approach\nnoise, to be discussed later, is less than 108dB. Since reference 3 permits\n3dB of the difference between the allowable noise level and the actual approach\nnoise level to offset the exceedence at the two takeoff noise measurement points,\nthe limit at these points can be raised to 109.5dB (see fig. 61).\nIn order to meet the aircraft mission requirements without excessively large\nengines, the T/W range of engines investigated in this analysis have noise\nlevels which, without suppression, exceed the limits of reference 3. Therefore,\njet noise suppression is required. Required suppression as a function of\nuninstalled T/W is shown in figure 62. It should be noted that for a 3200m\n(10,500 ft) takeoff distance, noise suppression is required over the range of\nT/W\'s considered in this study. Since suppression is required, the decision\nwas made to size the engine for cruise rather than on the basis of noise. For\nthe AST-100 the selected uninstalled T/W was 0.41. This corresponds to an\ninstalled, full-power thrust of 290.360N (65276 Ibf) per engine at sea level\nstandard +10\xc2\xb0C day conditions. Based on the trade-off study reported in\nreference 2, the AST-100 trajectory was constrained so that the aircraft would\nreach the "cut back" altitude of 213m (700 ft) at 5944m (19,500 ft) from brake\nrelease to maximize speed at "cut back." At this point, flaps were retracted\nfrom 20\xc2\xb0 to 5\xc2\xb0.\n29\n\nThe variation of takeoff noise level with reduced power setting corresponding\nto jet exit velocities from 701 m/s (2300 ft/s) to 762 m/s (2500 ft/s) was\ndetermined and is presented in figure 63. As initial thrust level (jet\nvelocity) increases, the sideline noise level increases. As a consequence of\nthe thrust level increase, aircraft speed at the 6486m (3.5 n.mi.) point\nincreases. With the speed increase, L/D increases with the result that a lower\nthrust level is required, after "cut back," to maintain the "one engine out"\nrequirement of reference 3. Thus, as the takeoff thrust level (jet level)\nincreases, the thrust level required at "cut back" is lower and the centerline\nnoise level is reduced as shown in figure 63. It can be seen that the minimum\namount of suppression required occurs at the condition where the sideline noise\nand centerline noise are equal; in this case, at a jet exit velocity of 752.9m/s\n(2470 ft/s).\nTakeoff thrust level corresponding to partial power jet velocity of 752.9 m/s\n(2470 ft/s) is 224.336N (50,433 Ibf) per engine for a standard +10\xc2\xb0C day. With\nthis thrust level, the AST-100 trajectory was set to reach the "cut-back" point\nat an altitude of 216m (710 ft) rather than 213m (700 ft) in an effort to meet\nthe airframe noise constraint of 108dB at the runway centerline measurement t\npoint.\nThe takeoff trajectory, including the cut-back point and the two noise measurement locations, is shown in figure 64. Lift-off occurred at 107.0 m/s\n(208.1 knots) with the speed at the 6486m (3.5 n.mi.) point being 124.0 m/s\n(240.9 knots). At this point, with 5\xc2\xb0 flap deflection, lift coefficient, C. ,\nis 0.378, which corresponds to an L/D of 10.1.\nThe variation of EPNL along the runway centerline and along a sideline position\n649m (0.35 n.mi.) from the centerline is presented in figures 65 and 66,\nrespectively. Also shown is the reference 3 allowable noise level and the\namount of suppression (4.9dB) required. From these figures it can be seen that\nthe maximum centerline noise at the 6486m (3.5 n.mi.) point is 114.4dB and the\nsideline maximum is 114.4dB.\nContour plots of EPNL (unsuppressed engine) for 115dB and 108dB are presented\nin figure 67.\nApproach Noise Analysis.- For the aircraft in the approach mode, noise level was\nevaluated for the measurement point defined in reference 3. This point is 1852m\n(1.0 n.mi.) from the 15.24m (50 ft) altitude threshold point along the runway\ncenterline as shown in figure 68. For the approach, trailing edge flaps were\ndeflected to 20\xc2\xb0. Lift coefficient during approach was 0.55, which is the same\nas for the Reference Configuration. The normal landing weight of 206,364kg\n(454,000 Ibm) was used^for this analysis. At these conditions, the approach\nspeed was 81.75 m/s (158.8 knots) and the L/D was 5.9. With the aircraft flying\nat 3\xc2\xb0 approach, the EPNL at the reference 3 measurement point was calculated to\nbe 103.IdB.\nAirframe Noise Analysis.- The airframe overall sound pressure level (OASPL) was\ncomputed by the use of the following equation:\nOASPL = 10\n\n30\n\n,3.17\n\n,,0.88\n\nwhere:\n\nV\nW\nR\nS\nAR\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\naircraft speed in m/s\naircraft weight in Kg\naircraft altitude in m\nwing area in m?\nwing aspect ratio\n\nThe airframe OASPL value from this equation is applicable to the runway centerline directly under the aircraft. Parameter input values and the corresponding\nairframe OASPL at the two measurement points, as defined in reference 3, were\nas follows:\n\nParameter\n\nTakeoff Point\n6.49km (3.5 n.mi.)\nFrom Brake Release\n\nAR (gross)\n\n1.726\n\n1.726\n\n1021.56 (10,996)\n\n1021.56 (10,996)\n\n124.00 (240.9)\n\n81.75 (158.8)\n\n245.50 (835)\n\n112.47 (369.0)\n\n, m 2 (ft 2 )\n\nS\n\nLanding Point\n1.85km (1.0 n.mi.)\nFrom 50 ft. Obstacle\n\ngross\nV, m/s (knots)\nR, m(ft)\nW, kg(lbm)\nOASPL, dB\n\n325,679 (718,000)\n108\n\n205,930 (454,000)\n\n\\\n\'\n\n107\n\nSince OASPL is not a time dependent function, the above values are the maximum\nthat an observer at either measurement point would perceive. Because EPNL is a\ntime-related function, the reference 3 EPNL limitation of 108dB is not directly\napplicable to the airframe OASPL. However, the EPNL will be less than 108dB if\nthe maximum value of OASPL is equal to or less than 108dB.\nSonic Boom\n\nSonic Boom Analysis.- Equivalent area distributions, due to volume and lift,\nrequired for sonic boom analyses, were computed by the use of methods described\nin references 10 and 22, respectively. These methods were modified to include\nangle of attack effects. Using these equivalent areas and the procedures of\nreferences 23 and 24, near field pressure signatures located at three body\nlengths below the aircraft, were defined. By the method of reference 25, these\nnear-field pressure signatures were extrapolated to ground level. This method\npermits the incorporation of variations in atmospheric properties and flight\nconditions such as acceleration and flight path angle. Hence, the effects\nthereof are included. A reflection factor of 1.9 was used in these analyses.\nFor comparison purposes, both the AST-100 and Reference Configuration were\nanalyzed for sonic boom through climb and cruise segments. Aircraft properties\nand flight conditions used in these analyses are listed in Table XI(a) and (b).\n31\n\nSonic Boom Results.- Equivalent area distributions which are typical of those\nfor transonic and supersonic climb, along with that for the start of cruise,\nare shown in figures 69, 70, and 71, respectively. Associated pressure signatures for these conditions are shown in figure 72. From these and other similar\nplots of the variation of overpressure increment with time, the maximum overpressure, Ap IDaX , was obtained and plotted against Mach number. The result is\nin figure 73.\nAt low supersonic Mach numbers ApRlcLX increases rapidly as Mach number decreases.\nFurther analysis indicated that a caustic (super boom) would occur on the ground\nfor the AST-100 at a Mach number slightly below 1.15 and for the Reference\nConfiguration slightly below M = 1.17. This is due to the shock focusing effect\nof acceleration at low flight altitudes (see ref. 26).\nAt higher Mach numbers the ApHlCL/\\ curves typically exhibit two peaks.\n\nIn this\n\ncase, the first at M = 1.6, is attributed to the opposing effects of increasing lift and increasing altitude. The second peak, at M = 2.2 for the Reference Configuration and M = 2.4 for the AST-100, is the result of shock\ncoalescence into the higher-strength N-wave signature.\nAt low supersonic Mach numbers more complex mid-field signatures occur as\nillustrated by figure 72(a).\nOver the Mach number range considered, the Ap\nwhich would be generated by\nmax\nthe AST-100 is slightly lower than that of the Reference Configuration. This\nis because of the smaller equivalent body area due to volume effects and lower\nweight of the AST-100 compared to the Reference Configuration.\n\nMISSION ANALYSIS\n\nMission analysis objective for the AST-100, as taken from the Reference Configuration criteria, was a design range of 7408Km (4000 n.mi.) and 292 passengers\nplus baggage, which translates into a payload of 27,682kg (61,028 Ibm).\nAlthough the AST-100 is sized for M = 2.7 cruise at standard conditions, it\nis required that it achieve the range objective on a hot (standard +8\xc2\xb0C) day.\nOn the basis of equal stagnation temperature, a standard +8\xc2\xb0C day Mach number\nof 2.62 corresponds to M = 2.7 at standard conditions and hence was selected\nas the cruise Mach number for mission analysis in order not to exceed M = 2.7\nstagnation temperature. The desired mission profile was taken from reference 2\nand is presented in figure 74. Fuel reserves allowance from FAR 121.648 SST\nFuel Requirements (tentative standard proposed by the FAA) was modified for a\nchange in holding altitude from 457m (1,500 ft) to 4572m (15,600 ft).\n:\nAs pointed out in the CONFIGURATION DEVELOPMENT section, the wing area and planform of the Reference Configuration were retained for the AST-100. However, resizing in terms of engine size and overall aircraft weight was performed. Resizing was accomplished through a parametric study, which determined the effect\nof (T/W) ratios on range for various takeoff gross weights.\n32\n\nPlots of TOGW as a function of T/W for the design range and range as a function\nof T/W for various TOGW\'s are presented in figure 75. Figure 76 is a similar\ntype plot with the independent variable being installed T/W rather than uninstalled T/W. Based on a takeoff field length constraint of 3200m (10,500 ft),\nan uninstalled T/W = 0.41 and a design range of 7408km (4000 n.mi.), a TOGW\nof 325,679kg (718,000 Ibm) was found from figure 75. This is the final takeoff\ngross weight for the AST-100.\nThe NASA Mission Analysis Computer Program (PAB-2011) was used for a final\nmission performance evaluation of the AST-100. The following data were inputs\nto the program:\n(1)\n\nTakeoff gross weight - 325,679kg (718,000 Ibm)\n\n(2)\n\nPayload - 292 passengers plus baggage, 27,682kg (61,028 Ibm)\n\n(3)\n\nOperating Weight - 149,448kg (329,476 Ibm)\n\n(4)\n\nDesired Range - 7408km (4000 n.mi.)\n\n(5)\n\nCruise Mach number - 2.62 at standard + 8\xc2\xb0C day\n\n(6)\n\nDescent distance (part of range) - 370km (200 n.mi.)\n\n(7)\n\nLow and high speed drag polars for AST-100\n\n:\n\n(8) Installed thrust and fuel flow data for AST-100 engines with a sea\nlevel static installed thrust of 293,485N (65,978 Ibm) per engine (standard\nday +8\xc2\xb0C ambient temp.) and corrected airflow of 323kg/sec (712 Ibm/sec)\n(9)\n\nClimb speed schedule - figure 77\n\nSignificant final performance results for the AST-100 as obtained from PAB-2011\nprogram are:\n(1)\n\nStart of cruise L/D\n\n- 8.91\n\n(2)\n\nStart of cruise altitude - 18,898m (62,000 ft)\n\n(3)\n\nRequired trip fuel\n\n- 119,295kg (263,000 Ibm)\n\n(4)\n\nRange\n\n- 7,349km (3968 n.mi.)\n\nExtensive mission segment data are presented in Table XII. A simplified flight\nprofile representation of mission performance is shown in figure 78.\nComputed performance of the AST-100 indicates a range that is 59.3km (32 n.mi.)\nshort of the objective of 7,408km (4000 n.mi.) or 0.8 percent less. Due to the\ndifference being so small, there was no merit in further iterations. It should\nbe noted, however, that the AST-100 range on a standard +8\xc2\xb0C "hot" day exceeds\nthat of the Reference Configuration (ref. 2) on a standard day (M = 2.7 cruise)\nby 70.4km (38 n.mi.) and at 19,958kg (44,000 Ibm) lower TOGW.\n\n33\n\nDIRECT OPERATING COST\n\nComponent elements of direct operating cost (DOC) were estimated for the AST-100\nby the use of the model of reference 27 (updated to 1975 cost experience).\nNominal values and assumptions used in the DOC analysis are listed in Table XIII.\nA detail breakdown of DOC is given in figure 79 in the form of "pie" charts and\nis tabulated in Table XIV. At a price of 30 cents per gallon, fuel cost is\ndominant; figure 79 shows that it accounts for about 61 percent of DOC. If fuel\nprice is doubled, it then accounts for 70 percent of DOC. As can be seen from\nfigure 79, aircraft depreciation is the other major contributor to DOC. Collectively, fuel and depreciation account for 80 percent of the direct operating\ncost. The importance of fuel price increases is further illustrated in figure\n80.\nDue to the significance of fuel price and depreciation (as related to purchase\nprice), technological improvements can make a major contribution in the area of\nfuel consumption and fabrication techniques to enhance economic performance.\nInnovations which reduce specific fuel consumption, increase lift-to-drag ratio,\nand reduce airplane weight and cost should be given high priority for implementation. These innovations will have a greater impact on the operation of supersonic airplanes than on subsonic airplanes since fuel consumption is a relatively\nless important part of DOC for the latter, Further, should fuel cost continue\nto rise at a faster rate than other costs, such technological innovations will\nbecome progressively more important. Conversely, however, the supersonic airplane is less sensitive to other costs. For example, from figure 80, it can be\nseen that doubling airplane cost increases DOC about 28 percent, whereas doubling\nfuel cost increases DOC about 60 percent. Reasonable variations in annual\nutilization rates or period of depreciation can be seen to have a much smaller\neffect on DOC.\nThe effect on DOC of operating the AST-100 subsonically (M = 0.9) at two load\nfactors is shown in figure 8.1 along with supersonic (M = 2.62) operation at the\nsame load factors. Calculations for the 55 percent load factor cases included\nthe slightly favorable influence of off-loading fuel which yeilds about a 2\npercent reduction in DOC. If the airplane is flown at the lower speed, DOC\nincreases approximately 50 percent. Comparison of costs at these two speeds\nreveals that fuel costs are nearly the same but wide variations exist in time\nrelated costs. Costs such as crew and maintenance rise drastically because of\nthe extra time required to complete the mission. The severe penalties paid for\noperation of the AST-100 at subsonic speed mean that low-speed flight time must\nbe held to an absolute minimum. Likewise, supersonic design must not be compromised for subsonic operation.\n\n34\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nThe AST-100 has been defined by: application of additional experimental data,\nobtained since establishment of the Reference,Configuration as the Advanced\nSupersonic Technology (AST) baseline concept; the use of improved analytical\ntechniques; and more extensive analyses, especially in the stability and control\narea. Therefore, the AST-100 is a viable replacement for the Reference Configuration as the updated AST baseline.\nReduction of wing thickness in the root area, recontouring engine nacelles for\nminimum drag and the use of the horizontal tail to produce lift during climb\nand cruise, has resulted in an overall improvement in maximum lift-to-drag ratio\nfor the AST-100 over the Reference Configuration, the difference at cruise being\napproximately 0.35.\ni\n;\nMission range for the AST-100, computed for a standard +8\xc2\xb0C day, is 59.3km\n(32 n.mi.) less than the design goal of 7408km (4000 n.mi.), or 0.8 percentless.\nResizing engines to 323 kg/sec (712 Ibm/sec) airflow for the AST-100 compared to\n362kg/sec (800 Ibm/sec) airflow for the Reference Configuration implies a\nsignificant reduction in block fuel and total reserve fuel required, as was\nindeed the case.\nTakeoff at jet exit velocity of 752.9m/sec (2470 ft/sec) is the condition for\nequal noise at the centerline and sideline measurement stations, which is the\ncondition for minimum-required suppression. Noise exceedence at both stations\nwould be 6.4dB. Application of 1.5dB tradeoff at each station, from the approach\nnoise, results in 4.9dB required suppression.\nResults from the AST-100 lateral-directional stability and control analysis\nindicated that the arrow-wing concept has several inherent deficiencies,\nespecially in the high-lift approach mode. Namely, these are roll angle response\nand inadequate "wing-level" sideslip capability. Any attempt at configuration\nrefinement to eliminate these deficiencies would be impeded by the lack of\nexperimental data for lateral controls on aeroelastically deforming arrow wings.\nThis emphasizes the need for further lateral-control research in the Supersonic\nCruise Aircraft Research (SCAR) program.\nDirect operating cost analysis showed that fuel price has a dominant role in the\nDOC of a supersonic cruise aircraft with depreciation being the next largest\nelement. Hence, innovations which reduce specific fuel consumption, increase\nlift-to-drag ratio, and reduce aircraft weight and cost should be given high\npriority for implementation. Finally, the analysis indicated that such a severe\npenalty, associated with time related costs, would be paid for operation at subsonic speed that this mode of operation would have to be held to an absolute ,\nminimum.\n\n35\n\nREFERENCES\n1.\n\nThe Boeing Company: Mach 2.7 Fixed Wing SST Model 969-336C (SCAT-15F),\nDocument No. DGA-11666-1, Nov. 1969\n\n2.\n\nLTV Aerospace Corporation, HTC: Advanced Supersonic Technology Concept\nStudy, Reference Characteristics, NASA CR-132374, Dec. 21. 1973\n\n3.\n\nDepartment of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration Noise\nStandards: Aircraft Type and Airworthiness Certification, Federal Aviation\nRegulations Part 36, June 1974\n\n4.\n\nMechtly, E.
