The 15-yr moving correlation between the Tropical Atlantic SST (TAtlSST) index (SST anomalies from 30deg S to 30deg N and 60deg W to 20deg E) and Korean precipitation (precipitation anomalies from 35-40deg N and 120-130deg E) during June-July-August (JJA) exhibits strong inter-decadal variation, which becomes positive at the 95% confidence level after the 1980s. Intensification of the linkage between the TAtlSST index and Korean precipitation after the 1980s is attributed to global warming via the increased background SST. The increase in the background SST over the Atlantic provides background conditions that enhance anomalous convective activity by anomalous Atlantic SST warming. Therefore, the overall atmospheric responses associated with the tropical Atlantic SST warming could intensify. The correlation between the TAtlSST index and Korean precipitation also exhibits strong inter-decadal variation within 1980-2010, which is over 0.8 during early 2000s, while it is relative low (i.e., around 0.6) during the early 1980s. The enhanced co-variability between the tropical and the mid-latitude Atlantic SST during the early 2000s induces a TAtlSST-related Rossby wave source over the mid-latitude Atlantic, which excites stationary waves propagated from the Atlantic to the Korean peninsula across northern Europe and northeast Asia. This Rossby-wave train induces a cyclonic flow over the northern edge of the Korea, which intensifies southwesterly and results in precipitation over Korea. This observed decadal difference is well simulated by the stationary wave model experiments with a prescribed TAtlSST-related Rossby wave source over the mid-latitude Atlantic.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"volume": "51", "submissionId": 20180000564, "issue": "8-Jul", "issn": "0930-7575", "publisher": "Springer Verlag", "eissn": "1432-0894", "id": "5cf350689aec434c9c019ee2006f99a6", "publicationName": "Climate Dynamics", "publicationDate": "2017-12-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20180000564.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20180000564/downloads/20180000564.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20180000564/downloads/20180000564.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20180000564/downloads/20180000564.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
