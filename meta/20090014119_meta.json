Vith other airplanes it is possible to approach the stall without any perceptible warning other than the reading of the air-speed meter, in which case the danger of inadvertent stalling is considerably greater. Although it is not within the scope of this paper to discuss stalling characteristics, it is desired to point out that in general the danger of inadvertent stalling is greatest with those airplanes that behave worse when the stalling occurs; that is, with airplanes in which the stall starts at the wing tips. A warning of the impending stall is desirable in any case, but is particularly desirable with airplanes of the latter type.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20090014119, "id": "9e5b5aaa6f6947d89bb650552f7366f2", "publicationDate": "1938-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19930081478, "type": "SUPERSEDED_BY", "title": "NACA Stall-Warning Indicator", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}, {"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19930081478, "type": "SEE_ALSO", "title": "NACA Stall-Warning Indicator", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20090014119.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20090014119/downloads/20090014119.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20090014119/downloads/20090014119.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20090014119/downloads/20090014119.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
