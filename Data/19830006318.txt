The analysis of MAGSAT data by Japanese colleagues has\n\n1 \\\n\nbeen accelera\' d over the past four months. The present report contains\nmainly the work done ,liter we submitted S papers for the special issue\nof the Geo physical Research Letters published in April 1982.\nt\n\n2.\n\nGraphical Display of MAGSAT Data\nInvestigator -B tapes are subject to direct analysis for studying\n\ngeomagnetic anomalies in the vicinity of Japan. The CHRONFIN tapes are\nfirst processed at the Geophysics Research Laboratory of the University\nof Tokyo, so as to illustrate 3-components (X, Y and Z) as well as their\nresiduals from the MGST(4/81) model with the indication of UT, magnetic\nlocal time, invariant latitude, geographic longitude and altitude. These\nprocessed materials are distributed to those investigators who are studying\nthe electric currents in the ionosphere and magnetosphere.\n\n3.\n\nRelevant Data for Comparison with MAGSAT Data \t\n\nj\n\nThe Hydrographic Office of the Maritime Safety Agency will soon\npublish the results of ar airborne magnetic survey over the sea around\nJapan carried out in 1979-80. The Geographical Survey Institute will\nsoon publish the results of a magnetic survey on land in Japan for the\nepoch of 1980. These data will be used in the future for the comparison\nof MAGSAT and ground-level data. The Japanese Antarctic Expedition carried\nout in recent years airborne magnetic survey, gravity survey, heat flow\nmeasurement, and artificial explosion for seismic study around Syowa Station\n(in the area of 69\xc2\xb0-71\xc2\xb0S and 39\xc2\xb0-44\xc2\xb0E), and these data will become available\nvery soon for the future correlative study with MAGSAT data.\nIn addition to the above data, some relevant data collected by polar- \t\n\nf\n\norbit satellites (such as electron data by TIROS-,N and NOAA-6) are being\nstudied by Y. Kamide with the cooperation of some U.S. scientists. \t\n\ni\n\nf\t\n\nPage 3\t\n\nI\t\n\n_\n\nORKWM PAGE W\nOf POOR QM"Y\n4. Frogress in the MAGSAT Data Analysis\n\n4-1. Geomagnetic anomalies around Japan\nInvestibator-B tapes are now being analysed to extract the magnetic\n\'\t\nanomalies in the area of 18\xc2\xb0-58 * N and 120 0 -160 0 E. I.Nakagawa and\nI\t\n\n` r\n\nT. Yukutake first applied a polynomial fit to X, Y, Z and F data of\nindividual satellite paths, and computed the residuals from the general\ntrends approximated by the 5th degree polynomials (see the Fifth Progress\nReport of Investigation from Japanese MAGSAT Team). The residuals thus\nobtained are supposed to give magnetic anomalies with their origin in\nthe crust. An example is shown in Fig. i for AZ anomalies, in which\n\ni\t\n\nan east-west trend is noticeable. This may P-\t\nY p erhaps be caused b Y the\nP\t\nnature of the filtering process applied, because long wavelength anomalies\nhave been filtered out only along the orbital path, i.e. approximately\nin the north-south direc_iot;, whereas those perpendicular to the path\nremain unfiltered.\nDouble Fourier analyses were applied to the AX. AY and AZ residuals\nof gridded values at 1.25\xc2\xb0 intervals in longitude and latitude. No\naltitude correction was made on the gridded values. In order to filter\nout the east-west trend, the Fourier series were synthesized without\ntheir first order harmonics. The results are shown in Fig. 2(a)-(c).\nIt is clear in Fig. 2(a) that the east-west trend seen in ^Z anomalies\nof Fig. 1 is almost completely removed; instead, a weak tendency appears\nrunning in the northeast-southwest direction. It is not known whether\nor not this is partly from an artificial origin. Some are real, such as\na positive belt along the Kuril Islands from Kamchatka to Hokkaido. It\nis also of interest that, to the west of -he Izu-Mariana trench, a\npositive area extends north-south, parallt-1 to the trench. This agrees\nwell with a new finding derived from the analyses of the surface data\nby boats. For further investigation of detailed features, it is highly\nnecessary to make altitude correction on the satellite values. Three- \t\n\nl\n\ndimensional Fourier analyses are new under way.\n\n^^\n\nPage 4\n\nORIGINAL PAGE IS\nOF POOR QUALITY\nr-r\n\n4-2. Separation of external and internal fields froi the vector data\n\n\t\n\n1]\n\n<\n\nalong the orbital paths\nOne of the pre-treatments required for studying \xe2\x96\xbae crustal anomalies\nis the removal of the long wavelength field caused by n external origin.\nThe residual field in reference to the 13th degree field model MGST(4/81) \t\nis contaminated by the external field and subjected to time charge. This\neffect was examined by M. Yanagisawa. On an assumption that the residual\nfield can be expressed by zonal terms of spherical functions, the magnetic\npotential\n\n( W)\n\nwas expanded along an orbital path as follows,\n6\n\nW = a E\n\n{E n (g) n\n\n+ I n (r) n+1\n\n} P n (cos e),\n\nn=1\nwhere a is the earth\'s radius, a is colatitude and P n (cos e) is the\nLegendre function. This assumption is justified when the ring current\nin the equatorial plane is the predominant source of the external field.\nFrom the residual north component (,^Xmag) and the vertical ^,omponent\n(AZmag) over the latitude range of -55\xc2\xb0 to +55\xc2\xb0 of each half oroit (Fig. 3),\nEn and I n were determined. In this cas e, En represents the effect of\nthe field external to the orbit such as that of the magnetospheric\nphenomena, whereas I n includes not only the field with its origin in\nthe earth\'s interior but also the field generated at the level of the\nionosphere.\nEn and I n were cc.uputed from 1765 half-orbital paths. They were\nfirst derived from dawn and dusk data separately, in four classes of\nDst values. The results were averaged within respective classe-\' and\nshown in Fig. 4 with vertical bars representing standard deviation (10).\nThe numbers on the right shoulder of each block are those of half orbits\nused for the analyses of each class. E 1 is the most predominant in each\nclass. It increases with the decrease of Dst-index. There is a marked\ndifference between the E 1 terms of the dawn side and the dusk side data.\nThe difference is likely to be caused by a dawn-dusk asymmetry of the\nring current. The dawn-dusk asymmetry also appears in the I 3 . This\nmay be due ti the ionospheric current asymmetry. From these analyses,\nit may be said that the effect of the external magnetic field (which\nmust be eliminated before the crustal magnetic anomaly is discussed)\nis not so simple that it can be represented by a uniform ring current.\n\n\\\n\n-1\n\nPage 5\nI\n\nORIGINAL PAGE W\nOF POOR QUALITY\n4-3. Toroidal current in the equatorial ionosphere: its frequency analysis \t\n\n{,\n\nH. Maeda et al, have been . ontinuing the study of the peculiar change\nin D-component observed by MAGSAT in the dusk-side equatorial region,\t\nwhich is attributable to a toroidal electric current in the dusk ionosphere \t\n\nJ\n1\n\nwithin the meridian plane. They extended the analysis of the AD variations\nup to May 29, 1980 ( total 7 months data) as shown in Fig. 5. Subjected\nto the frequency analysis, the variation of trio AD-amplitude was\n!\t\n\ndetermined to show a dominant period of \'-32 days as given in Fig. 6.\n\n4-4. Storm sudden commencement observed by MAGSAT\nOn March 19, 1980, around 0617 UT, MAGSAT observed a storm sudden\ncommencement ( SSC) it 50\xc2\xb0-60\xc2\xb0 in geomagnetic latitude. The MAGSAT record\nshowed a definite positive 4H (amounting to \' L50 nT) and a first large\nnegative AD (ti -30 nT) followed by a much weaker pos.-ive AD, indicating\nthat horizontal disturbance vector rotates during this SSC event as shown\nin Fig. 7. T. Araki is investigating the current system associated with\nthis SSC through the analysis of both the MAGSAT data and ground-based\ngeomagnetic data.\n\n4-5. Detailed structure of field-aligned currents\nT. Iijima has been investigating in detail the structure of fieldaligned currents associated with substorms ( AL ? 300 nT). Fig. 8 shows\nlatitudinal profiles of ABYM and ABXM for 4 segments between 1500 and\n1900 MLT, which were obtained by averaging disturbances observed by\nMAGSAT over the north polar region on 6 severely disturbed days of\nNovember 1979. The noteworthy points are:\n(1) Field-aligned current densit y (= u rot 11 aB ) is deterrined\no\nYM\t\n(in this example, average values between\nprincipally by the termu\n0 dGax\n1500 and 1900 MLT for Region 2 and Regio., i currents are 0.68 and 0.92\na^B XM\ni:A/m2\t , respectively), whereas the term - \t\nl shows a secondary\nay\nu o\t\ncontribution ( which is largest between Regions 2 and 1 with the average\nmagnitude of 0.11 uA/m2 between 1500: and 1900 MLT). In comparison with\nthe customary estimation by means of an infinite, east-west elongated\nsheet field-aligned current, the actual Region 2 ( and Region 1) current\t\nexhibits somewhat larger ( and smaller) density, ?specially between these\ntwo regions.\n\nr\n\nORIGINAL PAM W\nOF POOR QUALITY \t\n\nPage 6\n\n(2) It is worth examining the spatial dependence of div AB., which\nindicates the contribution from horizontal ionospheric curfints. The\n3AB\nvalue of div AB, is determined principally by the term aL and the\naAYM\nDY term looks negligible. From 1600 to 1900\ncontribution from the\t\nY\nMLT in the north polar region, MAGSAT data show the negative and positive\nvalues of div\n\nA. in Regions 2 and 1, respectively. P preliminary\n\ncalculation of div AB l (based on the result shown in Fig. 8) seems to\nshow a non-linear steep spatial gradient between Regions 2 and 1, which\nwill imply a possible local enhancement in the poleward electric field\nexisting between Regions 2 and 1, especially at late evening MLT sector\n(1800-1900). This kind of analysis is now planned also for the morning\nregion of the northern hemisphere and the entire south polar region.\n\n4-6. Electric current in space below the MAGSAT level\nThe total electric current passing through the plane encircled by\nthe MAGSAT orbit is being calcu\'ated by A. Suzuki et al., with a direct\napplication of Ampere\'s theorem. A preliminary result for such a space\ncurrent on quiet days shows that the space current below the MAGSAT level\nis about 2 x 10 6 Amperes in its maximum magnitude, and it is sunward near\n9h and 21h UT, when Japan is situated near the dawn and dusk meridians.\nIt is then worth checking whether or not the presence of such a space\ncurrent in the ionosphere can be found in the difference between the\nMAGSAT and ground magnetic measurements over Japan. More analysis is\nunder way in order to check or find the dependence of such a space current\ngeomagnetic activity, and other solar-terrestrial conditions. It\nhas been also tried to check whether the line-integral of the tangential\ncomponent of the MGST(4/81) model geomagnetic field will vanish along\nthe path projected onto the earth rotating under the satellite; a\npreliminary result showed that the total current in this integration\nis as small as 3 x 10 5 Amperes in its maximum magnitude.\n\nPage 7\n\nORIGINAL PAGE 18\nOF POOR QUALITY\n5.\n\nPublication\nThe following papers appeared in the Geophysical Research Letters,\n\nVol.9, No.4, issued in April 1982.\n"Preliminary Interpretation of Magnetic Anomalies over Japan and Its\nSurrounding Area" ( Paper 21,0022) by M.
