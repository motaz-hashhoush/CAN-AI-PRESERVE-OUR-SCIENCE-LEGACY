b'Modeling Programs Increase Aircraft Design Safety\nNASA Technology\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cF\n\nlutter\xe2\x80\x9d may sound like a benign word when\nassociated with a flag in a breeze, a butterfly,\nor seaweed in an ocean current. When used in\nthe context of aerodynamics, however, it describes a highly\ndangerous, potentially deadly condition.\nConsider the case of the Lockheed L-188 Electra\nTurboprop, an airliner that first took to the skies in 1957.\n\nAn F/A-18 E/F model undergoes flutter clearance testing in the\nLangley Research Center Transonic Dynamics Tunnel.\n\n72\t\n\nTransportation\t\n\nTwo years later, an Electra plummeted to the ground\nen route from Houston to Dallas. Within another year,\na second Electra crashed. In both cases, all crew and\npassengers died.\nLockheed engineers were at a loss as to why the\nplanes\xe2\x80\x99 wings were tearing off in midair. For an answer,\nthe company turned to NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Transonic Dynamics\nTunnel (TDT) at Langley Research Center. At the time,\nthe newly renovated wind tunnel offered engineers the\ncapability of testing aeroelastic qualities in aircraft flying at\ntransonic speeds\xe2\x80\x94near or just below the speed of sound.\n(Aeroelasticity is the interaction between aerodynamic\nforces and the structural dynamics of an aircraft or other\nstructure.) Through round-the-clock testing in the TDT,\nNASA and industry researchers discovered the cause:\nflutter.\nFlutter occurs when aerodynamic forces acting on\na wing cause it to vibrate. As the aircraft moves faster,\ncertain conditions can cause that vibration to multiply\nand feed off itself, building to greater amplitudes until\nthe flutter causes severe damage or even the destruction\nof the aircraft. Flutter can impact other structures as well.\nFamous film footage of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge in\nWashington in 1940 shows the main span of the bridge\ncollapsing after strong winds generated powerful flutter\nforces. In the Electra\xe2\x80\x99s case, faulty engine mounts allowed\na type of flutter known as whirl flutter, generated by the\nspinning propellers, to transfer to the wings, causing them\nto vibrate violently enough to tear off.\nThanks to the NASA testing, Lockheed was able to\ncorrect the Electra\xe2\x80\x99s design flaws that led to the flutter\nconditions and return the aircraft to safe flight. Today, all\naircraft must have a flutter boundary 15 percent beyond\nthe aircraft\xe2\x80\x99s expected maximum speed to ensure that\nflutter conditions are not encountered in flight. NASA\ncontinues to support research in new aircraft designs to\nimprove knowledge of aeroelasticity and flutter. Through\nplatforms such as Dryden Flight Research Center\xe2\x80\x99s Active\nAeroelastic Wing (AAW) research aircraft, the Agency\n\nresearches methods for in-flight validation of predictions\nand for controlling and taking advantage of aeroelastic\nconditions to enhance aircraft performance.\n\nPartnership\n\xe2\x80\x9cFlutter clearance is a big part of the cost to approve\na new aircraft for flight,\xe2\x80\x9d says Marty Brenner, aerospace\nengineer at Dryden. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat we\xe2\x80\x99ve been supporting is\nhow to estimate what this boundary is based on flight\ntest data.\xe2\x80\x9d To do this, Dryden partnered with ZONA\nTechnology of Scottsdale, Arizona, through the Small\nBusiness Innovation Research (SBIR) program.\nAn industry leader in aeroelastic modeling software,\nZONA engaged in multiple SBIR projects with Dryden\nfor predicting flutter boundaries, developing adaptive\ncontrols to help suppress impending flutter, and\ninnovating new ways of conducting flutter testing without\nwind tunnels. Through these partnerships, ZONA has\ndeveloped unique technology that help aircraft designers\nensure the performance and safety of their vehicles in\nefficient, cost-effective ways.\n\nBenefits\nThe ZONA Online Flutter Estimator (ZOFE), one\nof the outcomes of the company\xe2\x80\x99s collaboration with\nDryden, is a software tool that not only helps manufacturers design safe, flutter-free aircraft, but also helps maintain\nthe safety of the flight tests of these designs.\n\xe2\x80\x9cDuring the flight test, you don\xe2\x80\x99t want the aircraft\nrunning into flutter,\xe2\x80\x9d says PC Chen, ZONA\xe2\x80\x99s president.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the same time, you do want to know where the flutter\nboundary is. This software allows you to fly the aircraft in\npreflutter conditions, then calculate or predict the flutter\nboundary at the higher speed.\xe2\x80\x9d\nZOFE takes the real-time measurements acquired\nduring the flight test and applies a technique to extrapolate the aircraft\xe2\x80\x99s flutter boundary, Chen explains,\nallowing designers to obtain essential information without\npotentially endangering the test aircraft or pilot.\nSpinoff 2011\n\nDryden Flight Research Center\xe2\x80\x99s Active Aeroelastic Wing aircraft shows off its form during a research flight.\n\nZOFE is in use by the U.S. Air Force for special projects for testing flutter suppression and innovating new\nkinds of air vehicles. Major aircraft manufacturers are also\ntesting the product.\nIn the meantime, ZONA is developing an additional\ninnovation in partnership with Dryden that promises\npotentially significant changes to flutter testing. Through\nSBIR contracts, ZONA created its Dry Wind Tunnel\n(DWT) technology for conducting ground flutter testing\nwithout a wind tunnel.\n\xe2\x80\x9cA lot of wind tunnel data is suspect because of tunnel\neffects,\xe2\x80\x9d explains Brenner. Wind tunnels are not big\nenough to accommodate full-scale test aircraft, so smaller\nmodels of the aircraft have to be used instead. While these\nmodels still provide valuable aerodynamic information,\nBrenner says, \xe2\x80\x9csome parameters don\xe2\x80\x99t scale up properly to\na full-scale aircraft.\xe2\x80\x9d\nZONA\xe2\x80\x99s DWT uses shaker devices to mimic the\neffects of aerodynamic forces on a full-scale wing or airSpinoff 2011\n\n\t\n\ncraft. The system\xe2\x80\x99s software can calculate the aerodynamic\nforces and give that command to the shaker, which then\napplies that force to the true structure so engineers can\nrecord and observe the effects. The company claims that\nDWT can thus eliminate the uncertainties inherent in\nwind tunnel testing\n\xe2\x80\x9cDWT is more accurate,\xe2\x80\x9d says ZONA project manager Jennifer Scherr, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause you have all of the control\nsurfaces included, you are not making a scaled-down\nversion of the aircraft, and you don\xe2\x80\x99t have the\nwind tunnel walls adding other variables to the\nmix.\xe2\x80\x9d The technology also helps eliminate significant costs. Chen notes that the wind tunnel\nflutter test for a recent new aircraft design cost about\n$3 million to fabricate the scaled-down model\nand around $50,000 a day for\nthe wind tunnel testing.\n\xe2\x80\x9cFlight flutter testing of\na new or modified vehicle is very expensive and\n\nA model created by ZONA Technology\nshows aircraft deformations due to flutter.\n\nTransportation\t\n\n73\n\nTransportation\n\ntime consuming,\xe2\x80\x9d says Starr Ginn, Dryden\xe2\x80\x99s aerostructures deputy branch chief and contract monitor for the\nPhase II Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR)\nproject to develop the DWT. \xe2\x80\x9cIt takes roughly 25 people\nto prepare the aircraft, a large staff in the control room,\nfuel costs for each flight, and time in-between flights to\nreview the data. Using the DWT will help identify where\nthe flutter sensitivity is on the ground, allowing for a\nreduced number of flutter test points.\xe2\x80\x9d\nZONA continues to work with Dryden to advance the\nDWT technology, and is planning testing on the AAW\naircraft in 2011. The company\xe2\x80\x99s NASA partnerships have\nbeen essential for its ability to innovate new technologies,\nsays ZONA engineer and director of operations Darius\nSarhaddi.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAeroelasticity is not something that everyone needs,\xe2\x80\x9d\nhe explains. \xe2\x80\x9cThis type of technology is very narrow. For\nour business, government partnership is very important.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIt may be a specialized field, but the benefits of\nZONA\xe2\x80\x99s NASA partnerships\xe2\x80\x94helping keep flutter confined to flags and seaweed\xe2\x80\x94are very real. v\n\n'
