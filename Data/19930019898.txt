The hybrid package is on the order of several\ncentimeters in length and a few centimeters in height\nand width. The package includes an L-shaped carrier\nhaving a base surface and a vertical wall extending up\nfrom the base surface and forming a comer therewith,\nexternal connection pins extending through the vertical\nwall. Modular blocks rest on the base surface against the\nvertical wall and support microwave monolithic integrated circuits on top surfaces thereof connected to the\nexternal connection pins. The modular blocks lie endto-end on the base surface so as to be modularly removable by sliding along the base surface beneath the external connection pins away from the vertical wall.\n23 Claims, 10 Drawing Sheets\n\nU.S. Patent\n\nJune 8, 1993\n\nSheet 1 of 10\n\n5,2 18,357\n\nPatent\n\nJune 8, 1993\n\n5,218,357\n\nSheet 2 of 10\n\n108a\n1\n\n,100\n\n\\101\n\n1021\n\nFIG.
