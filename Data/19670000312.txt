Conventional electron microscopes generally do not permit\nleisurely viewing over extended periods. Visual\ndisplay with a standard oscilloscope requires either\nhigh electron microscope beam strength or the use of\nphotographic techniques to avoid image flicker.\nThe solution:\nDirect-view storage display tubes in an integral\nsystem which combines features found in scanning\nelectron microscopes, electrostatic energy analyzers,\nand CRT display methods. This microscope display\nsystem provides (I) slow-scanning rates, used with the\ntwo direct-view storage display tubes, , allowing the\nmicroscope electron beam to be continually focused\nsharply on\' the specimen while the image is slowly\n"written" on the display tubes; (2) a superimposed\n(continued overleaf)\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the Atomic\nEnergy Commission and/or the National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration.

The\nelectrostatic energy analyzer plates refocus the electrons at the analyzer slits. Electrons that have traversed the specimen with little loss of energy are\nfocused at the lower slit, while the upper slit is used\nto observe electrons that have suffered appreciable\nenergy loss. Behind the slits are cesium iodide scintillators with quartz light pipes leading to the photomultiplier tubes; the outputs of the photo multipliers\nand amplifiers are then applied to the storage tubes.\nThe two display patterns produced on the storage\ntubes simultaneously produce images of the specimen using two different electron energies.\nAn optical device permits the observation of the\ntwo displays by superimposing and viewing the images\nthrough separate color filters. A pair of mirrors, such\nas used in a periscope, produces an image of one\ndisplay tube which appears to be located midway\nbetween the tubes. A second set of semisilvered\nmirrors, similarly arranged, is placed in the viewing\npath of the first set of mirrors. With the four mirrors\nadjusted exactly, the images are congruent, and\nexhibit no parallax problems or differences of magnification.\nSince the eye has difficulty judging the relative\nillumination of nonadjacent areas in a nonuniform\nfield, but may quite easily distinguish slight color\nchanges in nearby areas, a set of color filters is used\nto observe contrast effects of the displays being presented at different electron energies. Although the\nillumination of the storage tubes normally appears\nyellow-green (P20 phosphor), illuminated areas of the\nfirst display tube, when used with a red filter, will\nappear bright pink, and areas of the second tube,\nviewed through a blue filter, appear bright green. In\na display region where both images are contributing\nan appreciable portion of the light, a slight change in\nillumination from either display will produce substantial color variation. Thus neighboring areas of a\nBrief 67-10312\n\nspecimen, varying slightly in the relative number of\nelectrons being contributed to the two energy images,\nappear substantially different in hue. At the design\nstrength of the microscope electron beam of 1 x 10\namperes, with slow scan, a photomultiplier output\namplifier of moderate gain and bandwidth is adequate\neven for observations in energy rgions where there\nare relatively few electrons, allowing good resolution\nfor very faint specimens.\nThe extended storage time of the direct-view storage\ndisplay tubes, as compared with phosphor decay times\nof standard oscilloscope tubes, permits visual observation of a single slowly scanned raster. Specimen\nexamination may begin before a single scan is completed, with the presentation persisting for many\nseconds, even at high display intensities. In addition,\nsuccessive "writes" may be partially added, permitting averaging and integration over long observation\ntimes without extremely slow initial scanning. Successive scans may be piled up until visual observation\nindicates that a good statistical integration has been\nachieved. A recording camera and/or the optical\nsuperposition device may be interposed leisurely while\nthe displays are retained in storage.\nNotes:\nI. Magnification may be chosen by simple switching,\nand specimen position is also obtained electronically. The color optical system provides contrast\nwithout specimen "staining", and identification of\nspecimen constituents is possible.\n2. The factor causing the greatest degree of difficulty\nin the practical use of the system has been the\nrelatively poor quality and characteristics of the\navailable storage tubes. The lack of illumination\nuniformity over the 6x6 inch tube area, for electron beam intensities below saturation illumination, and the slight dynamic range of the tubes\nhave contributed to a very high contrast display\nimage.\n3.
