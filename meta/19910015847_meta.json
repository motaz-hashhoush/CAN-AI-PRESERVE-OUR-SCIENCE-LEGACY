The Phase A preliminary design of the Thermal Control Subsystem (TCS) for the spacecraft exterior and interior surfaces and components of the bus subsystems is described. The TCS was composed of passive elements which were augmented with heaters. Trade studies to minimize the parasitic heat leakage into the cryogen storage tanks are described. Selection procedure for the thermally optimum on-orbit spacecraft attitude was defined. TRASYS-2 and SINDA'85 verification analysis was performed on the design and the results are presented.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 19910015847, "endDate": "1991-06-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "AIAA"}}, "meetingId": "7197ed44835b417ebdfb62e4994fd20e", "id": "678a56ca01904d63a3933d004918cca3"}], "name": "Thermophysics Conference", "location": "Honolulu, HI", "id": "7197ed44835b417ebdfb62e4994fd20e", "startDate": "1991-06-24T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19910015847, "id": "ed776e284cad45d89aae817b58eae5d3", "publicationDate": "1991-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19910015847.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19910015847/downloads/19910015847.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19910015847/downloads/19910015847.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19910015847/downloads/19910015847.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
