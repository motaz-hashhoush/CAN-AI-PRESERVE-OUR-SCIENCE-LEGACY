b'COMMERCIAL BENEFITS\xe2\x80\x94SPINOFFS\n\nHollow Retroreflectors Offer Solid Benefits\n\nA\n\ntechnician who lead a successful team of scientists,\nengineers, and other technicians in the design,\nfabrication, and characterization of cryogenic\nretroreflectors for the NASA Cassini/Composite Infrared\nSpectrometer (CIRS) mission to Saturn, developed a hollow\nretroreflector technology while working at NASA Goddard\nSpace Flight Center. With 16 years of NASA experience,\nJames Lyons teamed up with Patricia Losch, also from NASA,\nand started a company, PROSystems, Inc., of Sharpsburg,\nMaryland, to provide the optics community with an\nalternative source for precision hollow retroreflectors.\nRetroreflectors are comprised of three flat mirrors bonded\ntogether at right angles to form a corner of a cube. These\nassemblies are used as tilt-insensitive mirrors in situations\nwhere it becomes necessary to maintain tilt down to the arc\nsecond level, a very difficult task in an unstable environment.\nUntil the Cassini mission, there was no industry standard for\nmaintaining alignment in a thermally unstable environment.\nAlthough hollow retroreflectors are much more difficult to\nmanufacture than the predecessor solid retroreflectors,\nadvantages gained make up for the extra effort. Solid\nretroreflectors are much heavier and cause dispersion. Hollow\nretroreflectors are much lighter and eliminate dispersion.\nThe hollow retroreflectors from PROSystems are front\nsurface glass substrates assembled to provide many advantages\n\nNASA SPINOFF \xe2\x9e\xa4 2001\n\nThree different sizes of retroreflectors are shown on\nstands with three unmounted retroreflectors (assembled\nmirrors) shown in the foreground.\n\n118\n\nINDUSTRIAL PRODUCTIVITY/MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY\n\nover existing hollow retroreflectors and solid glass\nretroreflectors. PROSystems offers hollow retroreflectors in\nsizes ranging from .3 to 4 inches in diameter. Previous to this\nnew technology, some companies chose not to use hollow\nretroreflectors due to large seam widths and loss of signal.\nThe \xe2\x80\x9ctongue and groove\xe2\x80\x9d facet design of PROSystems\xe2\x80\x99s\nretroreflector allows for an extremely small seam width of\n.001 inches. Feedback from users is very positive regarding\nthis characteristic.\nThe manufacturing methods of PROSystems generate\nsmall-diameter hollow retroreflectors with small beam\ndeviation. Beam deviation is the angle of the incoming beam\nversus the angle of the outgoing, returned beam. Ideally, the\nbeam deviation is zero. The small beam deviation from\nPROSystems is notable, because as the aperture diameter\nshrinks, it is much more difficult to obtain small beam\ndeviations.\nThe design for joining facets allows a stable bond\nconfiguration over broad changes in temperature. This creates\na stable alignment within the system where the retroreflector\nis being used, thus ensuring the successful performance of the\ninstrument in its specified operating environment.\nAdditionally, PROSystems uses the glass mount design to\nfabricate cryogenic hollow retroreflectors in applications that\nrequire a large temperature range. This glass mount design\npermits the metal-to-glass interface to be remounted from the\nretroreflectors glass substrates, thereby eliminating distortion\ncaused by the interface of differing materials. The retroreflectors\xe2\x80\x99 used in the Cassini/CIRS instrument remained\nstable at an operating temperature of 170 degrees Kelvin.\nPROSystems offers its hollow retroreflectors with a variety\nof coatings, including protected gold, bare gold, protected\nsilver, protected aluminum, and bare aluminum to fit\ncustomers\xe2\x80\x99 needs. Most of PROSystems\xe2\x80\x99s primary customers\nmount the hollow retroreflectors in chrome steel balls for laser\ntracker targets in applications such as automobile\nmanufacturing and spacecraft assembly. Recently,\nPROSystems also made sales of this technology to the\ntelecommunications industry for use in fiber optic networks.\nThe company anticipates future applications of the hollow\nretroreflector technology in the commercial spectrometer\nmarket, incorporating them into standard products.\nPROSystems plans to continue developing its retroreflector\ntechnology to provide the optics industry with the highest\nquality precision product available. \xe2\x9d\x96\n\n'
