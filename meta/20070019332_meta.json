The program s primary research was conducted in field settings, as well as in a variety of aviation, controlled laboratory, and full-mission flight-simulation environments, to study fatigue factors and circadian disruption in short-haul, long-haul, military, cargo, and helicopter operations. In 1990, NASA changed the program s name to the Fatigue Countermeasures Group, to provide a greater emphasis on the development and evaluation of countermeasures that would mitigate the adverse effects of fatigue and maximize flight crew performance and alertness. The research conducted by this group at Ames included field studies of cockpit rest, quantity and quality of onboard sleep, and performance changes associated with long-haul flights.", "title": "Feeling Well Rested and Wide Awake When it Counts", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-23T23:01:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2012-04-24T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20070019332, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20070019332, "id": "02671ee6d87a4a8cbc4129f283c701c4", "publicationName": "Spinoff 2006", "publicationDate": "2006-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20070019332.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20070019332/downloads/20070019332.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20070019332/downloads/20070019332.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20070019332/downloads/20070019332.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
