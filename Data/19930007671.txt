Goldman\n\nLaw is not immutable;\n\nit responds\n\nto the needs of society.\nSince\nWorld War 11,humanity has moved\nincreasingly\ninto outer space,\nencountering\nnew conditions and\nnew needs along the way. The\nlaw of outer space has addressed\nthe new political, economic,\nand\ntechnical\nneeds that accompany\nthis transit of human society\ninto space.\nSpace law has\nbeen expressed\nin broad, vague\nprinciples that have permitted\nthe maximum flexibility necessary\nfor exploratory\nspace activities.\nBut, as exploration\ngives way to\nsettlement,\nthis predominantly\ninternational\nlaw lacks the\nspecificity\nnecessary\n\nSpace industrialization\nis\nconfronting\nspace law with\nproblems that a_echanging\nold\nand shaping new legal principles.\nManufacturing\nin space and\nexploiting\nnonterrestrial\nresources\npose economic\nand political issues\nthat the nations must address.\nSpace exploration\nhas been\nconducted\nin the names of peace\nand humanity;\nyet, the increasing\nawareness\nof the value of space\nexploration and space applications\ndictates a new consideration\nof the\nmerits of international competition\nand international\ncooperation\nin\nspace.\n\nand legal certainty\nfor mature commercial\n\nactivity.\n\nSpace Manufacturing\na.

This\nlack of policy sophistication\nresulted in part from arrogance\nover the American\nlead in space\nand in part from ignorance of the\nimportance\nof space in the future\nbalance of power. Today, with\nour dwindling lead and with the\ngrowing importance\nof space, the\nUnited States must negotiate its\ninternational\nspace agreements\nwith\nthe same concern for national\npriorities that it has in any other\ninternational\narena. Of course,\n\nin any given situation, either\ncooperation\nor competition\nmay\nbetter serve the national interest.\n\nThe Treaties\n\ni\ni\n\nThe U.N. Committee\non the\nPeaceful-O-s-esof\nOuter Space\n(UNCOPUOS)\nis responsible\nfor\nthe major portion of international\nspace law. It has negotiated\nfive\ntreaties.\nThe first four, from 1967\nto 1976, have been ratified by the\nUnited States, the Soviet Union,\nand many other nations, active and\ninactive in space.\nThe fifth treaty,\nthe Moon Treaty, was ratified by\n\n!\n144\n\nthe U N. in 1979 but has been\nratified by only seven nations,\nof whom has an active space\n\nnone\n\nprogram\nThe first treaty, called the Outer\nSpace Treaty or Principles Treaty,\nhas been ratified or acceded to\nby almost 100 nations\nIts broad\nprinciples provide the foundation\nand the philosophy\nfor activities in\nouter space--that\nis, a commitment\n\nto explore space in peace and\nfor the benefit of all humanity.\nThe second, 1968 treaty-the Agreement\non the Rescue\nof Astronauts,\nthe Return of\nAstronauts,\nand the Return of\nObjects Launched Into Outer\nSpace-expands\non the 1967\nprinciple that astronauts\nare the\n"envoys"\nof humanity who should\nbe honored and assisted in every\nrespect\n\n(US\'\n\nSenate\n\n1978).\n\nSpace Station Emergency Rescue\nVehicle\nThisdesign is one of several being\nconsidered to provide a safe and reliable\nemergency return from the space station.\nThe Assured Crew Return Vehicle (ACRV)\nwould be based at the space stationand\nuse de-orbit engines to return to Earth.\nRescue capabi/ily would be offered to\nastronauts of any nation, as in September\nof 1988 the United States offered tracking\nand recovery help to the Soviets when\ntheir cosmonauts, Russian pilot Lyakhov\nand Afghani copilot Mohmand, had\ndifficu/_l returning from the Mir space\nstation in a Soyuz spacecraft.\nArtist: David Russell\n\n145\n\nRatified in 1973, the Convention on\nInternational Liability for Damage\nCaused by Space Objects spells\nout many of the liabilities and duties\nof spacefarers and describes a\nprocedure to enforce these\nobligations.

Nevertheless,\nthe treaty does represent the most\ncomplete international\neffort to\ndate to deal with the legal and\npublic questions of colonizing\nand exploiting space.\nThis thumbnail sketch of space law\nhas been neither comprehensive\nnor detailed, but it provides a\nbackground\nsuggesting\nserious\nlegal-political\nproblems that will\nconfront the first efforts to mine\nand use the resources of the\nMoon and other celestial bodies\n(Goldman\n\nTreaty\n\n1988).\n\nIssues\n\ndiplomats and international\nlawyers need to consider.\nThis\nsection identifies only four of\nthese issues:\n(1)international\ncompetition\nand cooperation,\n(2) property rights and\nnonterrestrial\nmining, (3) legal\nliability and responsibility,\nand\n(4) environmental\nimpact.\nInternational\n\nCooperation\n\nInternational\ncooperation\nis a\ntheme that pervades the legal\nregime of space.\nAccording\nto the\n1967 Outer Space Treaty, space\nis to be used for "the benefit of\nmankind"\n(Article I). Nations\ncannot annex or appropriate\nouter\nspace or the celestial bodies\n(Article II). The United States has\nalways balanced these more\naltruistic principles against a\nsecond theme:\nnations are\npermitted by the treaty to "use"\nand exploit space.\nAs participant\nin the negotiations\nand ever since,\nthe United States has always\nargued that nations can mine and\nclaim resources\n"in place" even\nunder the 1979 Moon Treaty\n(Christol 1982, pp. 293-296).\n\nThe utilization of space resources\nwill raise many issues that\n\n147\n\nPhoto (just after the start of the run into the Cherokee\nL.

Although a nation\ncannot appropriate a celestial body,\nit can use the resources. If space\nmining basically consumes an\nentire, small near-Earth asteroid,\nhas the "use," become an\n"appropriation" of the celestial\nbody? This situation appears to\nbe another example in which the\ntechnologies have rendered\nthe treaties obsolete. Perhaps\nthe diplomats need to amend\nthe treaties to redefine these\nsmaller asteroids as a different\nclass of celestial bodies.\n\n151\n\nLiability and Responsibility\nAccording to the 1967 Treaty,\nnations are responsible for the\nspace activities of their nationals\n(Article IV). The Liability\nConvention in 1973, moreover,\nestablished an absolute liability\nfor damages on Earth caused by\nspace activities. Liability based on\nfault is authorized for damage in\nspace (Article II). Therefore, if the\nUnited States decides to take in\nprivate industry as a partner in\ntransporting or mining, the U.So\nGovernment would have to\nmonitor these partners closely.\nThe Liability Convention also\nprovides that nations are jointly\nand severally liable for damages\ncaused by their cooperative\nspace effort (Articles IV and V).\nAlthough the memorandums of\nunderstanding or treaties among\nthese national partners will\n\napportion liability and provide a\nmechanism for settling disputes,\nthe bottom line remains that one\nnation may be held liable for the\nentire accident.\nEnvironmental\n\nImpact\n\nTwo broad concerns for space\nresources and environmental\nimpact raise treaty issues:\n(1) back-contamination of Earth\nand (2) environmental protection\nof the celestial bodies, The Outer\nSpace Treaty requires consultation\nabout the environmental issues\n(Article IX). The Moon was seen\nas sterile, and the rules for backcontamination were not as strict as\nmany scientists wanted. Mars and\nother celestial bodies may require\na different set of regulations, The\nunratified Moon Treaty suggests\nthat nonterrestrial sites of scientific\ninterest should remain pristine.\n\nShould the Moon Remain Pristine?\n"That\'sone small tepfor a man,\ns\none giantleap formankind,"said\nNellArmstrong he set footon the\nas\nsurfaceof theMoonJuly20, t969.\nHis footprints,\nthoseof fellowexplorer\nBuzzAldrin, nd thefootprints the\na\nof\n10 other Apollo astronautsto walkon\nthe Moonremainclear and sharp on this\nwindless satellite,despite the passage\nof 20 years.
