Several lineaments observed in ERTS-1 MSS imagery over the southern Sierra Nevada of California have been studied in the field in an attempt to explain their geologic origins and significance. The lineaments are expressed topographically as alignments of linear valleys, elongate ridges, breaks in slope or combinations of these. Natural outcrop exposures along them are characteristically poor. Two lineaments were found to align with foliated metamorphic roof pendants and screens within granitic country rocks. Along other lineaments, the most consistant correlations were found to be alignments of diabase dikes of Cretaceous age, and younger cataclastic shear zones and minor faults. The location of several Pliocene and Pleistocene volcanic centers at or near lineament intersections suggests that the lineaments may represent zones of crustal weakness which have provided conduits for rising magma.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19740007914, "id": "3bdb65b1821b4fd3872b5177ca534aaf", "publicationDate": "1974-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19740007914.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19740007914/downloads/19740007914.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19740007914/downloads/19740007914.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19740007914/downloads/19740007914.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
