Based on the results of a 10-year study of knowledge diffusion in U.S. aerospace industry, the authors take the position that U.S. competitiveness will be enhanced if knowledge management strategies, employed within a capability-enhancing U.S. technology policy framework, are applied to diffusing the results of federally-funded R&D. In making their case, the authors stress the importance of knowledge as the source of competitive advantage in today's global economy. Next, they offer a practice-based definition of knowledge management and discuss three current approaches to knowledge management implementation-mechanistic, \"the learning organization,\" and systemic. The authors then examine three weaknesses in existing U.S. public policy and policy implementation-the dominance of knowledge creation, the need for diffusion-oriented technology policy, and the prevalence of a dissemination model- that affect diffusion of the results of federally-funded R&D. To address these shortcomings, they propose the development of a knowledge management framework for diffusing the results of federally-funded R&D. The article closes with a discussion of some issues and challenges associated with implementing a knowledge management framework for diffusing the results of federally-funded R&D.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"volume": "15", "submissionId": 19980137388, "issue": "2", "issn": "0740-624X", "id": "8820b0dcbab34a069b3288a369b38346", "publicationName": "Government Information Quarterly", "publicationDate": "1998-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19980137388.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19980137388/downloads/19980137388.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19980137388/downloads/19980137388.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19980137388/downloads/19980137388.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
