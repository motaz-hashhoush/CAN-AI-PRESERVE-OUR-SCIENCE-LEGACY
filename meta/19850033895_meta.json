Analytical estimates were made of the material properties that can be obtained for various ratios of graphite epoxy and aluminum cladding. Three graphite fiber systems were evaluated. Two manufacturing processes are described. One method is a procedure for manufacturing long tubes by wrapping aluminum foil over dry graphite fiber. Resin was applied by spreading before applying the aluminum wrap. A second approach, offering the opportunity for precise tuning of the coefficient of expansion, is by die flattening metal tubing through which a measured amount of fiber has been drawn. Prior to flattening, resin is injected, and after flattening or shaping the part is cured. This latter procedure offers the opportunity to fine tune the structure to achieve a CTE with a precision equal to that of the measuring systems-by modifying the number of fiber tows prior to manufacturing or by etching the metal after manufacturing. Experimental verification and demonstration data are presented for Gr/E bars with aluminum and steel skins.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19850033895, "endDate": "1984-04-05T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "Technology vectors", "location": "Reno, NV", "id": "63561d242c814a5aa41477977d49a7ba", "startDate": "1984-04-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19850033895, "id": "f602bde6949041819b2f9fc608e91d96", "publicationDate": "1984-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
