The initial award was\nfor a 90-day period.\n\nA subsequent extension of 45 days carried the contract period\n\nthrough 28 June 1974.\nEffort conducted during the time period of this contract included studies,\nanalyses, planning, and preliminary design activities.\n\nTechnical requirements\n\nidentified in the SRM Project Request for Proposal No. 8-1-4-94-98401 (Volumes I\nand II) and Thiokol\'s proposed SRM design (designated Configuration 0) established\nthe basis for this effort.\n\nThe requirements were evaluated jointly with MSFC and\n\naltered where necessary to incorporate new information that evolved after issuance\nof the RFP and during the course of this interim contract.\n\nRevised water impact\n\nloads and load distributions were provided based on additional model test data\nand analytical effort conducted by NASA subsequent to the RFP release.\n\nLaunch\n\npad peaking loads into the SRM aft skirt were provided which also represented a\nchange from RFP requirements.\n\nA modified SRM/External Tank (ET) attachment\n\nconfiguration with new structural load data was supplied by NASA, and direction was\nreceived to include a 2 percent inert weight contingency.\nImpact of these changes on the SRM design were evaluated by developing\npreliminary SRM designs optimized for low cost. Adjustments were made in some\nof the RFP performance partials in order to more closely approximate the flight\nperformance desired from the SRM.\n\nEffort was -also initiated to utilize SRM residual\n\nthrust versus time as performance criteria for sizing the SRM.\n1\n\nThese criteria are\n\nprovided from simulated computer flight trajectories.\n\nThese changes in performance\n\ncriteria were brought about primarily by significant changes in water impact loads,\nConsiderable\n\nlaunch pad loads, and the inclusion of an inert weight contingency.\n\neffort was expended evaluating the SRM case and nozzle structure in relation to the\nrevised water impact and launch pad loads.\n\nCalculations using BOSOR, NASTRAN,\n\nand STAGS (in conjunction with MSFC personnel) were conducted to determine\noptimum combinations of material thickness and stiffener requirements to react\nthe imposed loads.\n\nModifications to Thiokol\'s SRM automated design program (ADP)\n\nwere made to account for increased structure to react the greater loads and the\ninclusion of an inert weight contingency.\nMotor parameters such as maximum expected operating pressure (MEOP),\nnozzle expansion ratio, and nozzle length-to-throat radius ratio (L/Rt) were varied\nto assess the impact such changes had on motor sizing and cost.\n\nCost optimization\n\nstudies were conducted in which many motor parameters were allowed to vary\nsimultaneously in order to determine the minimum SRM project cost.\nTwo 146-in. diameter SRM configurations evolved which provide capability\nto withstand the latest water impact and launch pad loads while providing approximately\n660 pounds payload margin (Configuration 1) and 1, 900 pounds payload margin\n(Configuration 1-1).\n\nTable I summarizes dimensional, weight, and performance\n\ndata for these two configurations.\nDuring the design study a third SRM design was generated which maximized\nthe payload margin within the dimensional constraints established for Configuration 1-1.\n\nThe approach used to generate this design was to use residual force\n\nversus time data developed from flight performance data rather than the RFP\nperformance requirements.\n\nAfter reviewing several candidate designs, a config-\n\nuration that minimized the total SRM weight while maximizing the potential payload\nmargin was selected as a new SRM baseline.\n\nThis design, Configuration 1-1A,\n\nprovides a payload margin ranging from 3, 000 to 4, 000 pounds depending upon the\nshape of the thrust-time trace.\n\nThe principal dimensional, weight and performance\n\nparameters for this configuration are also summarized on.

resulting in higher case stress levels than\nwould exist under the assumptions of normal load distributions.\n\nThis new con-\n\ndition created the necessity for design changes in the membrane thickness of the\naft skirt and aft cylindrical segment thickness of Configuration 0.\nA sinilar load peaking effect was defined for the forward sections of the\ncase near the thrust takeout point.\n\nInvestigation revealed, however, that these\n\nforward peaking loads were not sufficiently high to have an appreciable effect on\nthe case design.\nUnder the terms of the RFP the aft attach loads between the SRM and the\nET were to be induced into the SRM through a load ring at three load points.\n\nThese\n\nload points consisted of a shear pin and two struts with all induced loads tangential\n8\n\nto the ring.\n\nSubsequent loading concepts received during the interim contract\n\nreflected a two strut-sway brace configuration which induced both radial and\ntangential load components into the ring.\n\nA "T" section load ring which was in-\n\ncorporated in Configuration0 was found to be inadequate under the effects of the\nnew attach concept.\nSRM geometry changes also occurred from the RFP to those currently used.\nFigure 2-2 defines the RFP values and the dimensions identified by NASA during\nthe 90-day effort.\nFigure 2-3 presents ballistic performance values defined in the RFP and\nmodified values which evolved during the interim contract effort.\n\nThese changes\n\nwere made to update the SRM performance requirements to account for increases\nin weight caused by other requirement changes.\n\n(MOTOR DIMENSIONS IN.INCHES)\n\nRFP\n992.5\n\n426 +10\n\n-\n\n21 MAX\n\n21 MAX\n\nSTA 1515\n\n(i\n---- - *----\n\n160 MAX\nDIAMETER OPEN\nREFERENCE INERT WEIGHT 115,430 LB\nCURRENT\n,U E\n\n988.5\n\n478.6\n\n160 MAX\nSTA 1511\n\n1,496\n\nDIAMETER 146 IN.\nREFERENCE INERT WEIGHT 135, 136 LB\n\nFigure 2-2.\n\nSRM Requirements - Geometry\n9\n\nINTERIM\n\nRFP\nSL THRUST (0<tF<t\n1\nFSL= 2.508 11 + AW/Wpl + 2%MLBF\nIMPULSE, LBF-SEC\n\n2.5\n\nIMPULSE, LBF-SEC\n\n3G LIM\n3G LIMIT\n\nREFERENCE\nS\n\nFSL = 2.626 11 + A Wp/W ] + 2%MLBF\n\n2.O -\n\nt\n\n1\n\n0.275 (I\nt\n\nt 2t=0.460\n\nx\nU-\n\n2\n\n21.0\n\n0\n\n20\n\na\n\nTIME (ta)\n\n0.\n1 m 4 60 t a) + 112%\na\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\ntI = 28\n\nt =28\n\nt2 50\n\nt2\n40\n\n(1 +12%\na\n\nIt = 0.275 (1 )+ 1/2%\nt\na\n1\n\n2\n\n1-\n\n11\n\n+ 1/2%\n\na\n\nt2 o50\n\nta MAX\n\n= 24 6\n\n1 .\n\nta MAX =124.6\n\nTIME (SEC)\nWINER T REF = 115,430\n\nFigure 2-3.\n\nSRM Requirements - Performance\n\nWINERT REF\n\n= 135,136\n\nDuring most of the interim contract period, SRM designs were sized using\nvalues specified for initial thrust and delivered impulse at three points in time\nduring motor operation as shown in figure 2-3.\n\nConfigurations 1 and 1-1 were de-\n\nsigned using requirements stated in this form.\n\nSubsequent evaluation of the flight\n\nperformance of these two configurations by RI revealed that the payload margin was\nlower than anticipated.\n\nThis prompted action to use a different method for specifying\n\nSRM performance requirements.\n\nThe method proposed was to establish a force-\n\ntime requirement that must be supplied to the Shuttle vehicle by the SRM in order\nto provide a specified payload margin.\n\nThis force, referred to as the "force-to-\n\nthe bolts, " is that required to produce a desired vehicle acceleration-time profile.\nBy using this force data it is possible to shape the thrust time trace of an SRM\nto precisely match the required flight performance and thus provide the desired\npayload margin.\n\nThis method was evaluated by Thiokol and proved to be an\n\neffective approach for generating SRM designs that deliver the required flight\nperformance without the need for specifying specific motor parameters.\n\nAs a\n\nresult the method was incorporated in Thiokol\' s Automated Design Program (ADP)\nand used to establish design parameters for a new SRM Baseline referred to as\nConfiguration 1-1A.\n\nFigure 2-4 presents the residual force and trajectory goals\n\nprovided.\nThe design calculations intorduced into the motor sizing subroutine of the\nADP to determine the required SRM thrust-time trace necessitates input of residual\nforce, vehicle acceleration, SRB inert weight, and ambinet pressure all as a function\nof time. Using the above data the routine solves for thrust by summing the residual\nforce and the force required to accelerate the SRB.\nused to size an SRM design.\n\nThe thrust-time data are then\n\nIncluded in the sizing calculations are burning surface\n\narea versus thickness burned data for the propellant grain required to.generate the\nspecified residual force and acceleration traces.\n\nSince the SRM weight is required\n\nto determine thrust from the input data, the final design solution is arrived at by\niterating several times through the

provided by RI\nAlong with the residual force data, RI sent SRM\n\nfor SRM sizing using the ADP.\n\ndesigns calculated by their SHAPE program to generate the specified performance.\nEach design was configured to provide a total payload margin of 7, 000 pounds,\n3,000 pounds from the ET and 4,000 pounds from the SRM assuming an ET dry and\nresidual weight of 75, 000 pounds.\n\nThe residual force data and typical SRM thrust\n\nshape data for the four cases (RI case numbers 370 through 373) are presented on\nfigures 2-5, 2-6, 2-7, and 2-8.\n\nThe thrust-time trace for Case 370 was shaped\n\nto approximate the trace of Thiokol\'s proposal design (Configuration 0).\n\nThe other\n\nthree traces were modified to reduce trajectory losses and thus illustrate (along with\nTable II) the effect of thrust or flight profile shaping on SRM size.\n\nSummarized on\n\nTable II are the propellant, inert and total weights for the four RI-generated designs.\nNotice that the weights for the SRM designs decrease from Case 370 to 373 as changes\nwere made in the thrust-time trace.\n\nThus, by this comparison the SRM weight can\n\nbe reduced 42, 900 pounds by shaping the thrust-time to meet the requirements of\nCase 373 rather than Case 370.\nAlso shown on Table II are the weights for two Thiokol ADP generated designs\n(case numbers 371 and 373).\n\nSince the ADP designs incorporated a higher perform-\n\nance nozzle and also were constrained to dimensional limits specified for Configuration 1-1A, the weights for the Thiokol designs vary somewhat from the RI weights.\nHowever, the same trend exists in that the total weight for Case 373 is significantly\nless than that for Case 371.\n\nThe ADP could not generate a reasonable design for\n\nCase 370 within the dimensional constraints specified for Configuration 1-1A due\nto the relatively high total impulse requirement.\n\nThus the thrust-time traces for\n\nCases 371 and 373 represent performance limits for an SRM that

PRELIMINARY DESIGNS\n\n3.1\n\nMOTOR PERFORMANCE\nPreliminary design data for three SRM designs referred to as Configura-\n\ntions 1, 1-1, and 1-1A are presented in this section.\n\nThe flight performance of\n\nthe configurations has been evaluated by Rockwell International (RI) using their\nShuttle Performance and Cost Evaluation (SPACE) Program.\n\nConfiguration 1 was\n\ndetermined to provide a payload margin of 660 pounds and Configuration 1-1 a margin\nof 1, 890 pounds.\n\nThe payload margin for Configuration 1-1A was determined to\n\nrange from 3, 000 to 4, 000 pounds depending upon the shape of the thrust-time trace\nand the loaded propellant weight.\nThe SRM performance requirements specified in the RFP were used in the\ninitial sizing of an earlier version of Configuration 1; however, a flight performance\nevaluation of this design by RI concluded that the specified minimum delivered\nimpulse was not adequate to provide a positive payload margin.\n\nThe reasons for\n\nthis deficiency were: 1) the reference SRM inert weight specified in the RFP was\nsignificantly less than that of the revised SRM design; and, 2) the delivered specific\nimpulse was somewhat less than initially predicted due to an increase in the estimated nozzle losses.\n\nAs a result, the RFP performance requirements for the base-\n\nline design were changed to the following:\n= 2. 626 x 106 (1 + AW /W ) lbf\np\np\nSL\nIa\n= 267.6 x 106 (1 + AWp/Wp) lbf-sec\nF\n\nReference Propellant Weight = 1,072,300 lbm\nReference Inert Weight = 135,136 Ibm\nConfiguration 1 is a cost-optimized design capable of meeting the revised\nwater entry loads, launch pad loads, and ET interface requirements while providing\na small positive payload margin.\n\nAn earlier version of this configuration presented\n\nat the SRM Design Review on 9 April 1974 (reference: TWR-10046) was determined\nby RI to have a negative payload margin.\n\nThe delivered specific impulse of this\n\nearlier design was increased about 0. 9 percent by modifying the nozzle.\n\nThe\n\nnozzle changes included increasing the initial nozzle expansion ratio from 5.5 to 6\n19\n\nand increasing the initial throat-to-exit length/throat radius (L/Rt) from 4.45 to 5.\nWith this new nozzle and the propellant weight of the earlier design the current\nConfiguration 1 provides a 660 pound margin.\nConfiguration 1-1 was designed to maximize performance within a maximum\nlength of 1, 495.6 inches using RFP requirements.\n\nThe design reflects the revised\n\nwater entry loads, launch pad loads, and ET interface requirements and provides\nthe maximum payload margin at a nominal increase in cost. The tangent-to-tangent\ncase length is about the maximum possible for an eleven-piece (nine cylindrical\nsegments and two closures) case design considering the revised loads and ET attach\nrequirements.\n\nThe cylindrical segments are divided as follows:\n1.\n\nSix 156-inch long common segments\n\n2.\n\nOne 86-inch segment with double flanges for an\nattachment ring\n\n3.\n\nTwo common 127-inch long segments each with two\nflanges for stiffening rings\n\nA length of 156 inches is the maximum for a 146-inch diameter segment with\nno upsets for flanges.\n\nAny case segment requiring provisions for local upsets for\n\nflanges must be shorter in length.\n\nA sketch illustrating the case fabrication con-\n\nstraints for 146-inch diameter segments is shown in figure 3-1.\n\nPresent estimates\n\nare that the maximum length of a segment requiring a double flange positioned as\nspecified for the attach segment is about 92 inches.\n\nThe maximum length of the\n\ntwo aft segments requiring two flanges is estimated to be about 130 inches.\n\nSince\n\nall the cylindrical segments are at or near the maximum length, the only way the\noverall case length for Configuration 1-1 can be increased is to add an additional\nsegment.\nConfiguration 1-1 is 26 inches longer than Configuration 1 and contains\n18, 000 pounds more propellant. The expansion ratio and L/Rt for the Configuration 1-1\nnozzle is the same as that for Configuration 1, and, thus, the motor delivers the same\nspecific impulse.\n\nDue to the increased propellant weight, Configuration 1-1 delivers\n\n4.4 x 106 lbf-sec or 1.6 percent more total impulse than Configuration 1.\n20\n\n156 IN.\n\n0.581 IN.

Diameter\n\nConfiguration 1-1A was generated to provide the maximum payload margin\nwithin the geometry of Configuration 1-1.\n\nThe principal differences between\n\nConfiguration 1-1 and 1.IlA are that Configuration 1-1A contains 11, 600 pounds\nmore propellant, incorporates a higher performance nozzle, and has a thicker\ncase wall required to survive the latest water impact and on-pad bending loads.\nThe Configuration 1-1A nozzle has an initial expansion ratio of 7.16 and an L/Rt\nof 5.28 and delivers an average vacuum specific impulse of 262.2 lbf-sec/lbm\nwhich is about 1. 5 percent higher than that for Configuration 1-1.\nThe evolution of Configurations 1, 1-1, and 1-1A can be traced back through\nseveral stages during the interim contract period.\n\nThe structural analysis of the case\n\nrelative to the revised structural loads requirements set the pace during the entire study.\nThe initial step was to evaluate the effect that the new water impact loads would have\non the Configuration 0 (Thiokol proposal design) case design.\n\nThe results of this\n\nearly appraisal, using the BOSOR computer code, indicated that the new slapdown\nloads would require the wall thickness of the forward case segments to be increased\nto 0.576 inch.\n\nThis thickness was greater than that dictated by internal pressure\n\nfor ballistic performance, and, thus, established the minimum case wall for the\nfirst design iteration.\n\nThis first design was referred to as a trend design and was\n\nreported to NASA on 20 February 1974 (reference TWR-10011).\n\nThe weights for\n\nthis trend design were as follows:\nWeight (ib)\n1,083,000\n\nPropellant\nCase\n\n116,120\n\nInert Weight\n\n154,200\n\nA more detailed analysis of the slapdown loads using the STAGS computer\ncode later proved that the wall thickness considered necessary to survive slapdown\nas defined by BOSOR was quite conservative.\n\nThis analysis showed that a minimum\n\nnominal wall thickness of 0. 46 inch would be adequate for slapdown.\nThe next area of structural analysis activity was to determine the effect of\ncavity collapse on the aft portion of the case.\n22\n\nAs attention was directed toward this\n\nregion of the case, it was determined, through communications with the case fabricator,\nthat length restrictions would have to be placed on the attach segment.\n\nThis length\n\nrestriction was the result of the requirement that the ET attach provision consist\nof a double flange, spaced about 12 inches apart.\n\nIn order to manufacture this\n\ndouble flange on the attach segment, the segment length would have to be significantly\nshorter than\'the 142 inches incorporated in Configuration 0.\n\nThe new length of the\n\nattach segment would now vary from 100 to 135 inches depending upon the location\nof the double flange relative to the distance from the joint as shown in figure 3-2.\nThe impact of this reduction in the length of the attach segment was that another\ncylindrical segment had to be added to the case in order to load the required\npropellant weight.\n\nThe approach taken was to incorporate the additional segment\n\nin the aft casting segment.\n\nAs a result, the aft casting segment in all subsequent\n\ndesigns would consist of an attach segment, two short segments (ranging in length\nfrom 100 to 130 inches, depending upon propellant loading requirements), and an\naft dome.\n\nThis approach was taken to preserve the commonality of the 156-inch\n\ncase segment length in the other three casting segments and also to retain the\ninterchangeability of the two center casting segments.\n\nIn addition, the use of\n\ntwo shorter case segments and an extra joint in the aft portion of the case provided\nadditional stiffness in a region subjected to high cavity collapse loads.\nDuring the remainder of the study effort, several design iterations were made\nto identify the optimum combinations of case wall thickness and local stiffening required to withstand the latest cavity collapse loads as a function of segment length.\nOne of the design iterations was reported to MSFC at the SRM Design Review on\n9 April 1974 (reference TWR-10046).\n\nAt this review Configuration 1 had two\n\n107-inch aft case segments with wall thicknesses of 0.51 inch and no stiffeners.\nFollowing this review an update by MSFC of the cavity collapse loads indicated that\nthis design would not be structurally adequate.\n\nAs a result, the design was modified\n\nto incorporate two stiffeners on each of the two aft segments, and an additional\nstiffener was added to the attach segment.\n\nThe attach segment length had to be\n\nreduced to 86 inches to accommodate the additional stiffener.\n\nThis 14-inch reduction\n\nin length was distributed between the two aft segments, increasing the length of these\n23\n\nATTACH SEGMENT\nC\n\n-FMD\nA\n(IN.)\n\nB\n(IN.)\n\nC\n(IN.)\n\nD\n(IN.)\n\n613\n36\n\n12\n12\n12\n\n135\n112\n100\n\n0.581 (MAX)\n0.581 (MAX)\n0.581

both Configuration 1 and 1-1\ndesigns presented at the MSFC SRB baseline reviews on 18 April 1974 (reference\nTWR-10059).\nA more recent analysis of the shortened attach segment design indicates\nthat the additional stiffener will not be required for cavity collapse.\n\nThus, the case\n\ndesigns presented in this final report for Configurations 1 and 1-1 incorporate the\nshortened attach segment without the additional stiffener.\nIn addition to the requirement changes that directly affected the case\nstructural design, the following items were introduced as design requirements:\n1.\n\nTwo percent inert weight allowance\n\n2.\n\nG* constraint\n\n3.\n\nNozzle exit cone cutoff device\n\n4.\n\nMSFC nozzle safety factor interpretation\n\n5.\n\nUse of conventional plastic materials in nozzle\n\nThe two percent inert weight allowance requested by MSFC was considered\nin this study as an increasein the total.inert weight of the SRM.\n\nThe two percent\n\npenalty applied to the total calculated inert weight, in turn, required the addition of\nmore propellant based on the specified SRB inert weight partials.\nadded in this manner was assumed to have no unit cost.\n\nThe inert weight\n\nHowever, since the motor\n\nwas increased in size to accommodate the burden of two percent additional inert\nweight, all the component costs are correspondingly higher.\nAn upper limit was established for the flow parameter\n\nG* (mass flow per\n\nunit area) in order to prevent erosive burning from affecting the ballistics of motor\ndesigns generated during the interim contract period.\n\nIn a meeting on 6 March 1974\n\nwith MSFC representatives, a maximum value of 3.1 lbm/sec-in.2 at 90 0 F was the\nset for G*.\n\nThis is the maximum value developed in a Titan III booster without the\n\nmotor experiencing an abnormal pressure rise at ignition.\n\nThe effect of this limit\n\nwas to restrain the cross sectional loading of propellant in a 146-inch diameter\n\n25\n\ncase.\n\nAs a result, when this limit was reached during a design iteration if more\n\npropellant had to be added, the port area and the motor length had to be increased.\nAnalysis of the water impact loads concluded that the loads can be significantly reduced if the nozzle exit cone is cut off. As a result, it was recommended\nthat the nozzle exit cone be cut off just aft of the compliance ring and jettisoned\nbefore water impact.\n\nThe current estimate is that this cutoff device will weigh\n\napproximately 50 lbm.\nDesigns generated during this study incorporated the use of MSFC interpretation of safety factors for determining the required thickness of nozzle plastic\nparts.\n\nBy using the MSFC interpretation for determining nozzle safetyfactors, the\n\nweight of the nozzle for Configuration 1 increased about 5 percent.\nAnother change in the nozzle was the use of conventional plastic materials in\nplace of the low-cost materials selected for the baseline design.\n\nDue to the difference\n\nin thickness and density of these materials the nozzle weight increased about 6. 4 percent.\nThe design philosophy was to configure a nozzle based on low-cost plastic materials\nbut include the cost of conventional materials as an increment to the SRM program\ncost.\n\nThis approach was selected to provide an SRM with performance capable of\n\nperforming the intended mission even if the higher weight, high-cost nozzle materials\nare used.\n\nIf the low-cost nozzle ablative materials are used (as intended), some\n\nperformance margin will exist.\n\nThe nozzle metal parts will be designed to\n\naccommodate either the high-cost or low-cost materials.\nThe basic design and performance data for the three configurations are\npresented in the following preliminary design documents.\nPreliminary Design Data for Space Shuttle SRM Configuration 1\nModel TU772/40A\n\n3.1.1\n\n3.1.1.1\n\nBasic Motor Description\n\nThe Solid Rocket Motor (SRM) presented in this document has a steel case of\nD6AC material with a wall thickness of 0. 488 inch iri the cylindrical segments.\n\nThe\n\nmotor is nominally 146 inches in diameter with a slightly larger dimension over the\n\n26\n\nexternal joint structure.

subsequent to the RFP and during the interim contract.\n\nIn\n\ngeneral these changes, due to water impact, ET attach, and pad loads, required\nan increase in the structural capability of the case which increased the inert weight\nNASA Report S & E-ASTN-ADL (73-68), "Updated Water Impact\n\nof the SRM.\n\nLoads for the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster (SRB), 4-11-73 Configuration,"\nwas provided to Thiokol at the initiation of the interim contract.\nThe following sections present a summary of the impact of the revised\nloading conditions on the design of the basic case and nozzle.\n\nThe effort described\n\nis the work accomplished during the interim contract which was primarily in\nsupport of performance studies.\n\nThe analyses which were involved were general\n\nin nature and were intended to assess the general impact of such design considerations\nas water impact, ET attach, pad loads, and basic design philosophy.\n\nAnalyses\n\nsuch as detailed discontinuity and refined stress analyses were not performed due\nto the transient nature of the designs involved.\n3.2.1\n\nCase\nOne of the principal areas of concern is the basic cylindrical wall of the\n\ncase and in particular the case wall thickness required to fulfill all design requirements.\n\nA technique is developed which establishes the minimum wall thickness\n\nrequirement of the case with consideration given to fracture toughness, crack\ngrowth rates, proof test, flight test pressures cyclic life requirements, and\ngrit blast removal.\n\nThe development of this procedure is outlined in the case\n\nwall thickness section.\n\nIt was determined under the terms of the RFP that fracture\n\nmechanics (cyclic life) requirements are dominant over factor of safety requirements.\nIt should be pointed out that about a 3 percent overdesign is\nrequired in the case wall due to the dominance of cyclic life requirements.\n\nIf\n\ncertain RFP requirements are relaxed slightly, basic strength considerations will\ndominate.\n\nMost notable of the rather severe RFP requirements is the requirement\n\nfor a subsequent proof test before each use at a pressure level 1.2 times the case MEOP.\n48\n\nConfiguration 1-1A does provide a cylindrical case thickness based on a safety\nfactor of 1.4 as agreed on with MSFC.\n\nDiscussions are continuing to modify\n\nstructural design requirements so that cyclic life requirements do not dominate.\nTypical designs of clevis joints for both forward and aft SRB skirt attachments\nare presented.\n\nThese designs are adequate to accommodate the current forward and\n\naft peaking loads.\n\nFabrication considerations affecting the attachment design need\n\nfurther investigation.\n\nAn additional area of interest was the ET attach ring where a\n\nchange from the RFP attach concept resulted in the need for a redesign of the ring\ncross section.\n\nA new design was developed and analyzed which bolts to the case on\n\ntwo stub flanges which are 12 in. apart and are provided in a special attach segment\nof the case.\n\nThe most severe loading condition was found to occur during liftoff, and\n\nthe results of an analysis of this condition are presented.\nA major area of concern is the effect of the water impact loads on the design.\nThe cavity collapse requirement is of particular importance, in that it creates a need\nfor two additional circumferential ring stiffeners in each of the two aft segments\n(Configuration 1-1).\n\nNo additional wall thickness (over the 0. 51 in. required for the\n\naft peaking loads)will be required according to preliminary indications from BOSOR\nand subsequent supporting analysis on STAGS.\nsupport analysis on STAGS.\n\nA recommendation is made for further\n\nThe slapdown loads under the terms of the present\n\nrequirements (see figure 2-1) do not affect the case design as long as nominal case\nwall thickness is above 0. 461 in. This value is based on one STAGS point extrapolated\nby BOSOR results.\n\nWe understand that NASA results based on several STAGS points\n\nindicate that this value.can go as low as 0.41 in.\nThe requirements of cavity collapse are more severe than the requirements\nof penetration, and, therefore, penetration does not affect the design.\nThe aft dome thickness requirement for external pressure is based on the\nrequirements of NASA TND-1510 per agreement between NASA and Thiokol.\n\nThe\n\nthickness requirement for the aft dome under the effects of internal pressure was\ndetermined using the same technique as developed for the case wall, considering\nthe stress reduction for a hemisphere. In Configurations 0, 1, 1-1, and 1-1A, the internal\n49\n\npressure requirements were dominant over the external pressure requirements\nwhich occur at maximum axial deceleration.\n\nConfiguration 1-1 was then subjected\n\nto a BOSOR analysis with all aft skirt cavity pressures acting and the resulting\nfactor of safety was 1. 25 (using a KDF of 0. 75).\n\nThe only configuration verified\n\non BOSOR was Configuration 1-1; however, Configuration 1-1A will provide an even\ngreater safety factor due to its 8. 7 percent greater membrane thickness.\nThe nozzle was also evaluated under the effects of maximum axial acceleration (2 max), and maximum pitch (U"max).\n\nThe 2 maximum condition had very\n\nlittle significance to the nozzle, and Configuration 1-1 was found to be adequate for\nmaximum pitch when the uncharred ablative material was included in the analysis.\nThe stress analysis of the nozzle shell for the 0 maximum condition shows factors\nof safety less than 1. 25 but does not include the ablative material.\n\nIt remains for\n\nfuture effort to evaluate the effect of ablatives on the nozzle stress levels during\nthe 8 maximum sequence.\nThe aft cylindrical segment of the case must be increased in thickness to\naccommodate the aft peaking loads.\n\nIt is ultimately shown by NASTRAN computer\n\nanalysis that a final nominal thickness of 0. 51 in. is adequate to sustain these\nloads and exhibit a factor of safety over the required value of 1. 4.\n\nThe results of\n\nthe analysis are presented.\nThe forward peaking loads are not critical, and it is shown from simplified\nconservative analysis techniques that they are not deleterious to the design.\n3.2. 1. 1\n\nCase Wall Thickness Calculation\n\nThe basic case wall thickness requirement is determined from the complex\ninteraction of internal pressure, fracture mechanics, and grit blast considerations.\nDuring the interim contract period, a procedure was developed to determine the\ncase wall thickness requirements on the basis of stress-time history as related\nto flaw growth and the successive removal of material due to grit blasting during\nthe refurbishment process.\n\nIn conjunction with this effort, a further review of\n\nMinuteman grit blast experience was conducted and applied to all designs included\nin this effort. A summary of the results of each phase of the effort follows.\n50\n\n3.2.1.2\n\nGrit Blast\nIn 1971 a detailed study of three reclaimed Minuteman, Stage I, motor cases\n\nwas conducted.\n\nThe material was D6AC steel.\n\nOne-two mils of epoxy-polyamid\n\navcoat primer was removed from the outside surface and a grip clad vinyl primer\nfrom the inside with 100-200 grit zircronium silicate abrasive.\n\nSix hundred and\n\nseventy-six individual points were measured on each of the three cases before\nand after grit blast with the following results:\nCase\n\nDecrease in Total Wall\nThickness (Average 676 Points)\n\n1\n\n0. 00055 in.\n\n2\n\n0.00028 in.\n\n3\n\n0. 00061 in.\n\nAverage Removal 0. 00048 in.

It was apparent\nthat the primary reason for the large added weight requirement was the conservative\nnature of the BOSOR program with the agreed on KDF.\n\nThe most expeditious\n\nsolution to the problem appeared to be to analyze the SRM with a nonlinear analysis\ntechnique such as STAGS.\nA second reason for the weight increase was a rather significant change in\nwater impact loads from the time of the RFP.\n\nThese loads were reviewed by NASA\n\nand some changes were made; principally in the area of the entry angle of the slapdown condition which was changed from -100 to -5\'\n\n.\n\nThe results of the STAGS analysis did substantiate the conservative nature\nof the BOSOR-KDF approach.\n\nThe minimum KDF for the slapdown condition was\n\ndetermined to be 0. 717 instead of 0.5 as assumed.\n\nThe net effect of this analysis\n\nwas to determine the minimum wall thickness required for slapdown to be at least\n0.461.\n\nAdditional STAGS work by NASA indicates that it may be as low as 0.41.\n\nSince 0. 461 is under the wall required for internal pressure no additional weight\nwas required for slapdown.\nCavity collapse loads for Configuration 0 could be accommodated by the\naddition of a stiffener ring at the midjoint of the aft segment.\n\nThe addition of this\n\nstiffener ring also made the case adequate for penetration.\nWhen new cavity collapse loads were developed, the design was no longer\nsuitable.\n\nAdditional performance requirements along with the new cavity collapse\n\nloads and fabrication limitations created a need for two aft segments with two\nstiffening rings in each segment at the 1/3 points.\n\nIt was estimated a 0. 51 inch (final\n\nnominal) thickness would be required in the aft segments to accommodate cavity\ncollapse and aft peaking loads.\n\nFurther analysis indicated that 0.51 inch was adequate\n\nfor the aft peaking loads and the cavity collapse condition.\n\n68\n\nThe BOSOR results for the slapdown loads were confirmed by two STAGS runs.\nThe STAGS results gave a KDF of 0.717 for a thickness of 0.496 inch .\nincreases for lower thicknesses (highter R/t ratios).\nthe KDF is 0.767.\n\nThe KDF\n\nFor a thickness. of 0.466 inch\n\nHowever, all final designs will require verification with a STAGS\n\nnonlinear analysis.\nThe revised cavity collapse loads are much more severe than the old loads.\n\nThe\n\nslapdown loads at 0 = 100 were more severe than the old slapdown loads, and the\n0 = 50 loads are very close to the old loads.\n\nThe penetration loads are slightly more\n\ncritical than the old loads.\nAll nozzle loads are much higher than the RFP loads (by a factor of about 10)\nand, in general, the water impact design loads for the nozzle are more severe than the\ninternal pressure and actuator loads.\n\n69\n\n3.2.1.7\n\nSlapdown\n\nSlapdown conditions were originally modeled on BOSOR 4.\nof Configuration 0 at\nKDF = 0. 717).\n\nThis analysis\n\n8 = -100 revealed an unsatisfactory safety factor (0. 95 for\n\nSubsequent stiffening of the segments of the SRM indicated than an\n\nadequate factor of safety could be attained with a small sacrifice in weight.\nTo obtain a factor of safety of 1.25 with a KDF of 0. 717 either the wall thickness must increase or the spacing between stiffeners must decrease.\nwall thickness required for a spacing of 156 inches is 0. 501 inch.\nThis is a weight increase of 709 pounds per segment.\n\nThe minimum\n\n(See figure 3-17.)\n\nThe moment of inertia of the\n\njoint required for a wall thickness of 0.466 inch and a spacing of 156 inches is\napproximately 3. 8 in.4 as shown in figure 3-18.\n\nThis increases the weight per joint\n\n273 pounds.\nAdditional analysis was carried out on the model for a 0 of -5o as updated by\nThis condition reduced the severity of the slapdown loads considerably and,\n\nNASA.\n\nas may be noted in figure 3-19, Configuration 0 had a conservative factor of safety of\n1.31.\n\nConfiguration 1-1 has a factor of safety of 1.\'50 by extrapolating the STAGS\n\nanalysis in relation to the BOSOR analysis.\nanalysis results.\n\nFigure 3-20 displays the complete STAGS\n\nTable XIII is a summary of the BOSOR results for various\n\nconfigurations investigated.\n3.2.1.8\n\nCavity Collapse\nA summary of the case configurations with the factors of safety for the cavity\n\ncollapse loads is shown in figure 3-21.\n\nFigure 3-22 shows the effect of varying the\n\nmoment of inertia of the stiffeners in the aft segment with the original cavity col4\nlapse loads. This curve shows an optimum stiffener inertia of 0. 58 to 0. 60 in..\nThe eigenvalue drops off very rapidly for a smaller inertia and remains constant\nfor a larger inertia.\n\nThe optimum stiffener inertia must be sufficient to force the\n\nbuckling mode in the shell between stiffeners.\n\nOnce this is accomplished, increasing\n\nthe stiffener size has no effect.\nThe revised cavity collapse loads have a higher peak pressure, are higher\non the case, and are generally spread over a longer length of the case.\n\nEither double\n\nstiffeners, a thicker wall, or a combination of the two is required to withstand the\n70\n\nKDF = 0.717\n5.0\n\n2.87\n\n4.0\nL = 117\n\nIjT = f (t)\n\n1.\n\n2.0\n\n43\n\n31.08\n1.25\n\n1.108\n0.45\n\n0.55\n\n0.50\nt (IN.)\n\nFigure 3-17.\n\nSlapdown Results, t = 0.486\n71\n\n0.60\n\n0.63\n\n4.5\n\nt\n\no.\n0 576\n\n3.5\n\n3.0\n\nW 2.5\n\nL = 156\nt = 0.466\n2.0\n\n13.5\n\n10I\n\n= 3. 8 IN.\n\n1.0\n0\n\n5\n\n15\n\n10\n\n20\n\n25\n\nJOINT\n\nFigure 3-18.\n\nSRM Case Buckling Parameters (Slapdown 0 = -100)\n72\n\n30\n\ne = -5\'; T = 1.5 AND 2.5\nVV = 100 FT/SEC\n2..6:\n\nVH =45 FTISEC\n\n1.9\n\n2.5,\n2.4 _\n\n1.8\n\n2.3\n\n1\n\nZ 2.2.\n\n>\n\nS2.1\n1.9\n\nCONFIGURATION RUN ON STAGS\n\n1.6\nO0\n\n1.5\n-< 1.4\n\nBASED CN\n\nSEGMENT LENGTH = 156 IN.\nMINIMUM KDF = 0.717\n\n1..3\n1.8\n1.7\n\n1.3\n21.2\n\n.47\n\n.9\n\nTHICKNESS (IN.)\n(MIN THICKNESS REQUIRED = 0.461)\nFigure 3-19.\n\nBOSOR Slapdown Results\n\n0.50\n\n1\n0.51\n\nt = 0.496\nL = 156 (SEGMENT LENGTH)\nPMAx = 26 PSI AND 24.8 PSI\nT 2.5 and 1.5\nE=-5"\n\n180\n\n179%\n\n-\n\n160\n\n167%\n\n120\n\nr\n\n100\n\nT 1.5\n\n24.8 P I\n0\n\nT = 2.5\n\n26 PS\nLOAD\n\nCG |\n\n40\n\nBOSOR KNOCKDOWN FACTORS INDICATED\n20\n\n(T = 2.5) BOSOR KDF = 2.38\nT = 1.5 BOSOR KDF\n\n=i1.674\n\nI\n\n0\n1.0\n\n2.0\n\n2.334\nI\n3.0\n\n0.752\n= 0.717\n-2.4\n\nI\n\nI\n4.0\n\nDISPLACEMENT (IN.)\n\nFigure 3-20.\n\nSRB Slapdown - STAG Analysis Results\n74\n\n5.0\n\nTABLE XIII\nSLAPDOWN BOSOR SUMMARY SHEET\n\nRun\n\nt\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n\n0.466\n0.466\n0.466\n0.466\n0.466\n0.466\n0.466\n0.576\n0.530\n0.576\n0.466\n0.616\n0.576\n0.466\n0.576\n0.576\n0.616\n0.616\n0.576\n0.576\n0.526\n0.466\n0.496\n0.472\n0.488\n0.504\n0.576\n0.576\n0.466\n\n_L\n\n156 2.155\n156 4.310\n156 6.470\n156 10.0\n156 2.155\n156 2.155\n156 2.155\n156 2.155\n117 2.155\n156 3.50\n156 25.0\n117 6.6\n117 5.0\n50 2.155\n90 5.00\n156 5.00\n156 6.6\n200 6.6\n117 2.155\n117 25.0\n156 3.50\n117 2.155\n156 2.762\n156 2.267\n156 2.566\n156 2.948\n117 3.50\n156 3.50\n156 2.155\n\nIst\n\nt\n\n----2.155\n2.155\n23.5\n-----------------------\n\nType**\nN\n\nE\n\nFS*\n\n3\n3\n7\n7\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\n7\n3\n3\n3\n3\n7\n6\n6\n3\n7\n3\n7\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\n\n1.321\n2.034\n2.016\n2.225\n1.473\n1.473\n5.3\n1.918\n1.450\n2.402\n2.325\n4.293\n3.200\n1.764\n3.812\n3.126\n3.781\n2.934\n1.937\n4.43\n2.170\n2.037\n2.334\n1.912\n2.161\n2.491\n2.588\n2.396\n1.972\n\n0.95\n1.46\n1.45\n1.60\n1.06\n1.06\n3.80\n1.38\n1.04\n1.72\n1.67\n3.08\n2.29\n1.26\n2.73\n2.24\n2.71\n2.10\n1.39\n3.18\n1.55\n1.46\n1.67\n1.37\n1.55\n1.79\n1.86\n1.72\n1.41\n\nLoad***\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n.1\n1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n1\n1\n2\n\nComments\n\nProblem\n\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4\n\nDid Not Reach Minimum Eigenvalue\n\nMaximum Load Over Stiffener\nMaximum Load Between Stiffener and Joint\nMaximum Load Over Stiffener\n\n0 =-5\xc2\xb0\n0 =-5\n= -5\n\'\n0\n0 =-5o\nThe Load is 20 In.

Therefore, the results are conservative for this type of loading.\nAn increase of 22 percent was shown on run 23 (type 4 problem) overrun 34 (type 1\nproblem).\n\nApplying the 22 percent for this run

analysis was performed for a Type 1 (axisymmetric) loading. The loads are taken from S & E-ASTN-ADL\n(73-68) Figures 111-19 and 111-201. The factor of safety is calculated assuming. a knockdown factor of 0. 75.\n\nin figure 3-23.\n\nThe NASA SP-8032 equation is based on all data available with no\n\nconsideration as far as boundary conditions, R/t,\nsidered much too conservative.\n\nratios, flaws, etc., and is con-\n\nThe David Taylor Model Basin results from refer-\n\nence NASA TND-1510 are based on thick walled shells with R/t ratios similar to\nthose of the SRM aft closure.\n\nIt is felt that the NASA TND-1510 results are more\n\ncorrect for our application being based on correct R/t test results.\nA composite model of the nozzle, closure, and into the cylindrical shell was\nalso run with the maximum axial acceleration loads for 0 = 50 . The eigenvalue for\nBOSOR for a thickness of 0.279 inch is 1.67 and for a KDF of 0.75 the FS = 1.25.\nThe KDF of 0.75 correlates with the results of the David Taylor Model Basin work.\n3.2.1.11\n\nNozzle\n\nThe nozzle analysis was also performed on BOSOR.\n\nIt should be pointed out\n\nthat the actuators were not used to transfer any loads because BOSOR is not capable\nof handling a problem containing loads applied at one point in these two directions. All\nanalyses were performed without the nozzle extension.\nThe static analysis results are shown in figures 3-24 and 3-25.\n\nThe maxi-\n\nmum stress is 185, 000 for the maximum pitch condition giving a minimum FS of\n1.05.\n\nThis is primarily a bending stress at the juncture in the nozzle throat area.\n\nNo ablatives were included in this analysis, and, therefore, the results are conservative.\n\nA slight increase in the local thickness (0.544 inch thick in the throat\n\narea) will increase this FS to 1.25.\nThe maximum pitch acceleration buckling analysis included the ablative\nmaterials as well as the structural materials of the nozzle.\nablative material included is shown in figure 3-26.\n\nThe char line for the\n\nThe maximum axial acceleration\n\nbuckling analysis showed the aft dome to be much more critical than the nozzle with\nthe ablatives included.\n3.2.1.12\n\nThe results are shown in Table XVI.\n\nAft Peaking Loads\n\nThe aft peaking load analysis was performed on NASTRAN.\n\nThe loading\n\ncondition is for on-pad mode with orbiter engines ignited and a 34.4 knot wind, as\n81\n\nRESULTS\n\nEQUATION\n\nREFERENCE\nTIMOSHENKO, THEORY OF ELASTIC\n\n1.154 E\n\nPC\n\nPer\n\nt\n\n.\n\nPcr\n\nKn2 E\n\n0.259\nREQ = 1.25\nF.S. 1.25\n(MUST USE 0.274)\nt\n\n2\n\nB (1-v\n\n(SPHER ICAL SEGMENT)\n\nREQ\'D\n\nd2\n\n=\n\n0.334\n\n0\n\n+393\n\nD(d)\nF.S. = 1.25\n\nK = f (Zd )\n\nd\n\n=\n\nt\n\nP =0.80 E\n=\n-v\ncr\n\nBASIN RESULTS)\n\nNACA TN-3783\n\n0\n\nF.S. = 1.25\n(MUST USE 0.274)\n\nSTABILITY (THEORETICAL)\n\nNASA TND-1510\n(DAVID TAYLOR MODEL\n\ntRE\'D = 0.216\n\nAWT\n(NORMALIZED)\n\n1-v\n\n2\n\nRt\n\nBOSOR-COMPUTER\n\n(BOSOR)\n\nt =0.274 (BASELINE)\n\nPROGRAM\n\nKDF = 0.75\nKDF = 0.5\n\n0\n\nF.S. = 1.39\nF.S. = 0.93\n\n(0.274 IS MIN REQ\'D\nFOR PRESSURE)\nNASA SP-8032\n\nP\n\ncr\n\nA=\n\ncI\n\n3.2=0.56\n0.14 + 3.2\n+\n3.2]\n\nt=0.56\n\n0.14\n\n[12 (1- v2)1\n\n114 ()1/\n\n2\n\n2 SIN\n\nCONCLUS ION: NASA-TC AGREEMENT 22 MAR 1974 TO USE A CONSERVATIVE THICKNESS VALUE OF 0.41 (0.40 PLUS\nCONDITION: 0.010 FOR GRIT BLAST ALLOWANCE)\n2 = MAX\n0 = 50\nP - 253 PS I\n\nFigure 3-23.\n\n+1,875\n\nF.S. =1.25\n\nAft Dome Buckling Calculations Summary\n\n+885\n\n120.00\n\nI LI\noa\nTAN LINE\n6\n\n100.00\n\n= 3, 430\n\na LO = 17, 000\naHI = -3,850\n\na HO= 190\n\nF\n\nDOME\n\nEX-\n\nFLEX\n\n80.00\n\na LI = -115, 000\n\nBRG\n\naLO= 185,000\na HI = 33,700\naHO = 124,000\n\nLI = 21,700\nLO= 3,280\n\n--\n\n60.00\n\naHI = -11, 200\n\naLI =\naLO=\naHI =\naHO\n\nZ\n\n40.00\n\n-19,400\n79,400\n21,400\n50, 000\n\naHO= -16,800\n\naLI = -28, 600\n\naLI =\nrLO =\nr HI=\ncrHO =\n\n\\\n\naLO= 65, 000\n0aHI = 15,000\nOHO = 43, 000\n_\n\n20.00\n\n\'\n\n-129,000\n106, 000\n-76, 400\n\n-1, 830\n\ncLI = 1, 030\nLO = -3,070\naHI = -11,700\naHO= -11,700\naLI = -22, 000\n\noLO= 22,700\nc1 = -34, 000\nHI\no\'HO=\n\n0.0\n\nCOMPLIANCE RING\n\n-20.00\n\n-40, 00\n\n-20.00\n\n0.0\n\n20.00\n\n40.00\n\n60.00\n\nR\n\nFigure 3-24.\n\nNozzle Analysis (Max.

A development plan to fully qualify the low-cost\nmaterials prior to the fabrication of the second demonstration motor (DM-2) is\npresented in the data that follows.\n\nThe use of low-cost materials in DM-2 and\n\nstandard (high-cost materials) in DM-1 provides the advantages that the first motor\ncan be fired using materials that are presently fully qualified, and a longer time\ncan be allocated to the development of the low-cost materials.\n\nThe material\n\nproperties of the high- and low-cost carbon materials are sufficiently similar that\ndesigning metal structures for either low- or high-cost materials is feasible.\n\nThe\n\nmetal structure of all the configurations is designed so that either low- or high-cost\nablative materials can be incorporated into the same nozzle structure.\nFigure 3-30 shows the Configuration 0 nozzle.\ncarbon fabric phenolic is used in the throat.\nis used as insulation for the fixed housing.\n\nA -carbon fiber filled silicone elastomer\nThe remaining ablative materials are\n\nvarious forms of pitch carbon fiber phenolic.\nfabricated of pitch carbon mat tape.\n\nA standard rayon precursor\n\nThe nose and lower exit cone are\n\nThe inlet rings are fabricated from pitch carbon\n\nfiber molding compound, and the upper exit cone is fabricated from a hybrid consisting\nof alternate layers of pitch carbon fiber mat phenolic and standard rayon carbon\nfabric phenolic.\n\nThe insulation material in the nozzle is canvas cloth phenolic.\n\nEach\n\nof these materials is discussed in more detail in subsequent paragraphs.\nThe pitch base materials used in Configuration 0 are manufactured by the\nUnion Carbide Company; the Kureha Company in Japan also manufacturers like products.\nThe pitch used by the Union Carbide Company is a by-product of their polyethylene\nplant and is available in large quantities.\n\nThe low cost of the pitch carbon material\n\nis due to the fact that it is manufactured from essentially a waste material, and in\nthe manufacturing process it is not necessary to use an intermediate precursor.\nThe pitch is converted directly to carbon filament with a yield of 90-95 percent.\nThe erosion resistance of a carbon material is directly related to the specific\ngravity of the material.\n\nThe pitch carbon has a specific gravity of approximately 2. 0\n\n100\n\nas compared to 1. 6 for rayon carbon, thus this material has potentially better erosive\ncharacteristics than does the standard rayon material.\nThe pitch based carbon is being developed by the Union Carbide Company for\ncommercial applications.\n\nThere is wide use for the material irrespective of whether\n\nit is used on the Space Shuttle nozzle or not.\n\nThis large commercial application will\n\nassure that the material is available at a low cost.\nPitch carbon fiber in a mat form is currently available from Union Carbide.\nThere has been approximately 10, 000 pounds of the mat manufactured.\n\nThe mat\n\nmanufacturing line has been shut down to permit some equipment used in the mat line\nto be used in the development of a continuous pitch fiber filament and to permit the\nmat line to be moved from the laboratory environment to a manufacturing environment.\nThe mat line was restarted in May 1974.\nThe resin impregnated mat material is presently available from several prepreg suppliers in at least three forms: 1) A mat tape either with or without a thin\ncotton scrim (the cotton scrim neither enhances nor detracts from the use of the\nmat tape in nozzle manufacturing); 2) A mat tape or mat broadgoods with a standard\nrayon carbon cloth as a scrim; and 3) A molding compound made from either a\nmacerated mat or from 1/2 inch X 1/2 inch chopped mat.\nPitch based carbon materials in these three forms have been used to\nmanufacture a large nozzle at Thiokol which was successfully test fired.\nare presently viable materials for nozzle manufacturing.\n\nThey\n\nDiscussions on these\n\nmaterials are presented below.\n3.3.\n3.1. 1\n\nMat Tape\n\nThiokol has used mat tape on a cotton scrim from the Fiberite Corporation\nto make small test nozzles (for 5-pound propellant motors) and to manufacture a nose\nring for a Poseidon C3 size nozzle.\n\nThiokol has also wrapped small test rings from\n\nmat tape without a cotton scrim which was supplied by U. S. Polymeric and Hexcel.\nAny of the above materials are satisfactory for use in the SRM nozzle, and these\ntapes will be used in the nose ring and for the lower exit cone.\n101\n\nThiokol fabrication experience in using this material is that the material\nwraps well, and no fabrication difficulty was experienced.\n\nThe material wrapped\n\nparticularly well on angle wraps and in areas where a bias cut would have been\nnecessary had woven material been used. The material does need further development to determine the optimum resin content.\n3.3.1.2 Hybrid Tape\nAt the time the first hybrid tape was supplied to Thiokol by Fiberite, it was\nncessary that a scrim be used by the prepreg manufacturers to handle the mat tape.\nThe carbon scrim was used on this material to support the tape and to supply an\nadditional erosion resistant fabric.\n\nThe Fiberite hybrid tape was used to manufac-\n\nture small evaluation nozzles and was used on a C3 size subscale nozzle for the\nthroat entry ring and in the upper exit cone,\n\nU. S. Polymeric has also manufactured\n\nand supplied this material to Thiokol.\nThis material performed well in the upper exit cone.\ninlet area was satisfactory but somewhat questionable.\n\nThe performance in the\n\nThis material is used in the\n\nupper exit cone of the Configuration 0 nozzle.\nTC experience in the fabrication of parts using the hybrid tape is that\nthis material is more difficult to wrap than the all mat tape and somewhat more\ndifficult than standard carbon cloth.\n\nThe.main difficulties are that the material is\n\nfairly thick, and it is difficult to uniformally heat the material before it goes under\nthe wrapping roll and to cool it afterwards.\n\nBecuase of the carbon scrim cloth, the\n\nhybrid material must be bias cut if the part requires angle wraps.\n\nThis material\n\nneeds further development to determine the optimum resin content and the relative\nthicknesses between the scrim and the mat material.\n3.3.1.3\n\nMolding Compound\n\nPitch carbon mat molding compound has been supplied to Thiokol by Fiberite\nCorporation and U. S. Polymeric.\n\nThe Fiberite material is manufactured from a\n\nmacerated mat; U. S. Polymeric chops the mat in 1/2 inch X 1/2 inch squares.\nThe Fiberite material has been evaluated in small test nozzles, has been used in an\nentrance ring in a C3 size subscale nozzle, and has also just been fired in the\n102\n\nentrance ring in a C4 nozzle.\n\nPerformance in both of these nozzles was very good.\n\nThis molding compound was used in the three nozzle entrance rings on the Configuration 0 nozzle.\nIt has been Thiokol\'s experience that this material molds well and is easily\nmachined in the approximately 21 inch diameter ring used on the C3 size subscale\nas well as on the smaller C4 entrance ring.\nDevelopment work is required to insure that there are no problems in scaling\nup to rings of the size required for the SRM nozzle.\nA disadvantage of the material has been the large bulk factor of this material.\nSome work has been done by U. S. Polymeric to provide the material in preformed\ndisks about 3 inches in diameter and 1/2 inch thick.\n\nUsing the preformed material,\n\nthe bulk factor is significantly reduced.\nUnion Carbide has been working to develop a continuous filament from the\npitch base material.\n\nThey have succeeded in developing these techniques\n\nsmall quantities have been supplied to the industry.\n\nand\n\nPresent plans are to manufacture\n\nseveral thousand pounds of continuous filament in 1974.\nWith the development of the continuous pitch filament, it is planned to weave a\nbroadgoods cloth from the pitch fiber.\n\nThere has been some concern as to whether\n\nthe continuous filament with its high modulus could be woven into cloth without\nbreaking.\n\nTo demonstrate this technique, continuous PAN carbon filaments with\n\nabout the same diameters and modulus were satisfactorily woven into broadgoods\nmaterial.\n\nSmall amounts of the continuous pitch have also been woven into cloth,\n\nimpregnated with resin, and manufactured into flat laminates.\nIf the continuous filament and resulting broadgoods are developed as expected\nand costs are as projected, this material could be used for all tape wrapped parts\nof the nozzle.\n\nIt is also possible that it could be used for the inlet rings to replace the\n\nmolded parts.\n\nHowever, studies have indicated that molding parts would be less\n\nexpensive than using tape wrapped manufacturing techniques.\nThe continuous pitch filament cloth is expected to be available in quantities\nsuitable for development work in 1974.\n\nBy 1980 it is expected that the woven fabric\n103\n\nwill sell at $2-$4 per pound.\n\nIf this pitch carbon cloth is as completely successful\n\nand inexpensive as projected, it will undoubtedly be the standard material by 1978,\nand possibly the only carbon cloth available.\nCanvas cloth phenolic is a standard well characterized material that has been\nused as insulator and ablator in several Thiokol nozzles.\n\nIt is used in the Configura-\n\ntion 0 nozzle as the insulator under the carbon ablative materials.\na low cost and a low density which makes it very attractive.\nhas been that this material is easy to handle\nit.\n\nThis material has\n\nThiokol\'s experience\n\nand parts are readily fabricated from\n\nThe material is compatible with the carbon materials proposed.\n\nAs a result,\n\ncanvas cloth can be overwrapped over the staged and machined carbon materials\nand cured simultaneously with the carbon materials.\nEarly in the development of canvas cloth material some difficulty was\nexperienced with parts that had been wrapped of canvas cloth, machined and exposed\nto a high humidity atmosphere.\n\nApparently, the cotton fibers on the machined edge\n\nabsorbed moisture and caused warpage.\n\nThis can be easily prevented by sealing the\n\nmachined surfaces as would be normally done during the fabrication of the nozzle.\nThere has also been some concern that inflation in the cotton market will raise the\nprice of this material so that it is no longer cost effective.\n\nIf this is true, other\n\nmaterials such as glass can be substituted for the canvas cloth.\n\nSubstitutions of\n\nglass, however, would result in a higher weight part.\nCarbon filled silicone rubber is used as the fixed housing insulator on both\nthe low-cost and standard materials nozzle.\n\nThis material has been demonstrated\n\non several Thiokol nozzles and performs very well.\n\nThe material is vacuum mixed\n\nand vacuum cast directly onto the primed metal housing.\n\nThe material cures at room\n\ntemperature.\nThis material is the only plastic material on the nozzle that can be refurbished.\nThis will be done by placing the fixed housing in a vertical boring mill and machining\naway the heat affected material.\n\nThe carbon filler in the material gives it enough\n\nrigidity that machining is a practical operation.\n\n104\n\nAfter the heat affected material\n\nhas been machined away, the fixed housing is placed in the same mold that was\nused for the original casting and new material is vacuum cast to replace that which\nhad been machined away.\n\nThe new material will self-vulcanize to the machined\n\nsurface on the old material.\nThere are three other candidate materials for use as low-cost nozzle ablative\nmaterials.\n\nThese are KYNOL carbon, filled carbon cloth, and silica cloth phenolic.\n\nThe KYNOL material has been developed for flame resistant materials.\nbasic fiber is manufactured from a phenolic.\n\nThe\n\nThis phenolic fiber is woven into cloth\n\nand then carbonized and impregnated with the same phenolic from which the basic\nfiber was made.\n\nThis material has been demonstrated in small motors and is now\n\nbeing tested on the Trident C4 program.\nat the present time.\n\nThere are two disadvantages in the material\n\nOne of them is that the C4 program has had difficulty in\n\nobtaining the carbonized KYNOL material to conduct their tests.\n\nThe other is that\n\nthe cost of the KYNOL material is significantly higher than the pitch based material.\nThe price of standard carbon cloth phenolic can be reduced about one-half\nby the addition of a higher than normal amount of resins and fillers such as chopped\ncarbon and/or ceramic.\n\nThiokol tested this material in the throat of the C3 size\n\nsubscale nozzle which was tested in July 1973.\nin the severe throat environment.\nperformance would be adequate.\n\nThe material did not perform well\n\nIt may be that in the nose or the exit cone that\nAgain, this material is significantly more costly\n\nthan the proposed pitch based material.\nSilica cloth phenolic has been used for years in areas of the nozzle where the\nenvironment will permit, particularly on the back side of submerged nozzles and\nin the outer exit cone.\n\nThis material is very satisfactory for these areas, however,\n\nit has about a 20 percent higher density than carbon cloth and subsequently adds\nweight to the nozzle.\nThere are three other candidate materials that could be used as insulators in\nthe low-cost nozzle.\n\nThey are silica cloth phenolic, paper phenolic, and glass cloth\n\nphenolic.\n105\n\nThe silica cloth phenolic is an excellent material but is higher in cost and has\na higher density than the canvas cloth used on the Configuration 0 nozzle.\nPaper phenolic materials show potential but have not been well characterized\nat the present time and would require more development work than the other two\nalternatives.\nPrior to selecting the low-cost materials which Thiokol used for the Configuration 0, SRM nozzle, a three-part testing program was conducted.\n\nTwenty-three\n\ndifferent low-cost materials were evaluated in this testing program.\n\nThe three parts\n\nof the program were:\n1.\n\nNozzles for small subscale test motors were made\nfrom each of the candidate materials.\n\nThese\n\nTU-379 motors each contained 5 pounds of SRM\npropellant and burned for approximately 10 seconds\nat a chamber pressure similar to that of the SRM.\nFigure 3-34 is a series of photographs which show\ncross sections of four nozzle billets fired on Thiokol\nTU-379 motors during the material selection\nprocess.\n\nThe photographs show a standard carbon\n\ncloth nozzle, a nozzle made from pitch carbon\nmolding compound, a nozzle made from pitch mat\ntape, and a nozzle from a filled carbon cloth\nmaterial.\n\nAs measured from these

Development Schedule\n\ni\n\nSTATIC TEST\n\nThiokol is pleased with the progress made thus far on the continuous filament\npitch material, and the prospects of woven pitch carbon cloth continue to be favorable.\nIf this development continues on the schedule and at the cost projected by Union Carbide,\nthe woven material will certainly revolutionize the carbon cloth industry and may\nreplace what is now the conventional materials.\n\nIt would seem essential to actively\n\npursue the development of this material.\nThe pitch molding compound also seems to be a very viable material for use\nin the entrance sections of the nozzle because of the potential cost savings of making\nmolded parts as opposed to tape wrapped parts.\nThe tape mat and the hybrid pitch materials certainly show promise, but\ncould be replaced by the continuous filament pitch cloth.\n\nThe continued development\n\nof these materials should be tempered by the progress on the continuous filament\ncloth.\nThe schedule shows that there is time to develop the low-cost materials and\nto delay the decision on their use until these data are available from the development program.\n\nThiokol strongly recommends that the low-cost materials be\n\ndeveloped and used in the SRM nozzle.\n\nIn summary, Thiokol feels that the\n\nparallel approach to low-cost and high-cost materials is a sound and viable way to\ndevelop a low-cost nozzle while simultaneously protecting the SRM schedule.\n\nThere\n\nis a significant cost saving which can be implemented by using a low-cost material\nand the development work done to date indicates that the material development is\nrelatively low risk.\n\n116\n\n3.3.2\n\nPlastic Material Safety Factor Interpretation\nThe safety factor Thiokol used in the design of the nozzle plastic parts on\n\nthe baseline (Configuration 0) nozzle was different than the approach that NASA\nused in evaluating the nozzle.\ndelineated on figure 3-39.\n\nThe differences as Thiokol understands them are\n\nIf the NASA approach is applied to the Thiokol nozzle,\n\nthe effect is to increase the thickness of the ablative material and decrease the\nthickness of the insulation material.\n\nBecause the ablative material is a higher density\n\nand higher cost than the insulative material, the result is a weight and cost increase.\nIf normal nozzle erosion occurs (and we have every confidence that after\ndefinition in the DDT&E program that the erosion rate will be well defined), then\na nozzle designed by either criterion will perform satisfactorily.\n\nThis means that\n\nat motor burnout there will be no temperature rise in the nozzle structure and that\nat water impact the nozzle structural parts will not have increased in temperature\nto the point that any damage has occurred.\nUsing the NASA approach to the safety factor, the above statements hold\neven if double erosion occurs.\n\nIf double erosion occurs on the Thiokol design, there\n\nis still no temperature rise in the structural parts at motor burnout.\ninsulating liner under the ablative material would be charred.\n\nHowever, the\n\nThiokol feels that\n\nthese conditions do not constitute any reliability degradation for the performance of\nthe motor and the safety of the mission.\nIf double erosion did occur on a nozzle designed to the Thiokol criteria, at\nthe time of water impact the structural temperature would be too high to assure that\nthe metal parts could be refurbished and reused.\nFigure 3-40 shows the Thiokol Configuration 0 nozzle which uses the safety\nfactors as Thiokol interpreted the requirement.\nmaterial at the throat was 1. 8inches.\n\nThe thickness of the carbon cloth\n\nAt an expansion ratio of approximately 3:1,\n\nthe thickness of the ablator was 0. 5 inch with a thickness of canvas cloth phenolic\ninsulation of 0. 5 inch.\n\nThe effect of changing the safety factors on this nozzle is\n\nshown on figure 3-41 where the thickness of ablative

insulative\nmaterial.\n\nConsequently, the canvas cloth insulator has been, eliminated in the exit\n\ncone and the glass cloth thickness has been increased so that it can serve both as\ninsulator and as the structure for the exit cone.\n\nChanging to this safety factor\n\napproach has increased the weight of the nozzle by 812 pounds.\n\nThe estimated cost\n\nincrease is $7, 000 per nozzle.\nFigure 3-42 shows the nozzle configuration using the NASA safety factor\napplication and with high-cost materials in the nozzle.\n1, 783 pounds occurs.\n\nA weight increase of\n\nThis weight increase includes the 812 pounds due to safety\n\nfactor changes and 971 pounds due to changes in materials.\nincrease is $74, 000 per nozzle.\n\nThe estimated cost\n\nThe majority of the 971-pound weight change is\n\ndue to the use of silica cloth phenolic in the exit cone rather than using pitch mat\nphenolic as shown on the two previous configurations.\nThiokol has been asked to compare its approach to the safety factor on the\nSRM nozzle with the approach used on other solid rocket motor nozzle designs.\nThe reason that Thiokol used the approach that it did was that it was philosophically\nthe same as that used for Minuteman nozzle design and for the design of development\nand prototype nozzle concepts at Thiokol.\n\nThe safety factors applied to the SRM,\n\nhowever, were higher than those traditionally used.\n\nFor example, the traditional\n\napproach to ablative liner thickness at Thiokol has been to apply a 1.5 safety factor\nto the maximum predicted erosion depth.\n\nOn the SRM design we used a 2. 0 safety\n\nfactor on the maximum predicted erosion depth.\n\nThe traditional approach to insulator\n\nthickness is to design insulator thickness with a safety factor of 1. 0 times the maximum predicted char thickness plus sufficient additional material to reduce the\ntemperature to ambient at the structural interface.\n\nOn the SRM nozzle the same\n\napproach was used except that a 1. 25 factor of safety was applied to the predicted\nchar thickness.\n\n121\n\nCARBON CLOTH PHENOLIC\n\nCARBON CLOTH PHENOLIC\n\n1.1\n\nGLASS CLOTH\nPHENOLIC\n\nSILICA

PHENOLIC\n\nBecause of the manrating on the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Motors, Thiokol\nfeels it is realistic to increase the ablative liner safety factor to 2. 0 and the insulator\nthickness safety factor to 1. 25.\nNozzles designed by the Thiokol approach or the NASA approach are not as\nconservative as the actual nozzles now being used on the Titan and Poseidon programs.\n\nThe Titan and Poseidon nozzles were both designed several years ago and\n\nwere the first nozzles designed using an ablative throat material.\n\nBoth designs\n\nwere done independently, i.e., the Poseidon nozzles were designed without benefit\nof the Titan test data and vice versa.\n\nTest data on these nozzles prove that they are\n\nboth extremely conservative.\nIn the past few years the analytical erosion and heat transfer prediction\ntechniques at Thiokol and throughout the industry have significantly improved, and\nmuch better predictions are now possible.\n\nTo a real extent, this improvement has\n\nbeen because of the experience on the Titan and Poseidon nozzles.\n\nThiokol recommends\n\nthat the capability of the current analytical techniques should be evaluated using\nthe existing Titan and Poseidon data.\n\nIn this manner the accuracy of the current\n\nprediction techniques will be established and the SRM nozzles can be designed\nwithout the large allowance for design uncertainty that was necessary in the Titan\nand Poseidon nozzles.\nThiokol feels that these studies on the Titan and Poseidon nozzles will show\nthat the Thiokol approach is valid and cost effective.\n3.3.3\n\nAft Skirt and Actuation System Interface\nA significant consideration in the design of the nozzle is the interface between\n\nthe nozzle, the actuation system, and the aft skirt.

the aft skirt may make it necessary to\n\ninclude a field joint in the SRM nozzle.\n\nEarly in this contract, data were received\n\n(NASA Drawing 10A00306) which showed that the clear opening in the aft skirt was\napproximately 124 inches in diameter.\n\nIn mid-June, Thiokol received data on a\n\nrevised aft skirt which has a clear diameter of 132. 8 inches.\n\nThe field joint location\n\nis shown on figures 3-31 and 3-32 with the details more clearly shown on figure 3-44.\nAs shown, the upper half of the field joint is an integral part of the exit cone housing.\nThe lower half of the field joint consists of a steel piece secured to the fiberglass\nstructure of the exit cone.\n\nIncorporating the field joint into the exit cone housing is\n\nan efficient lightweight approach because the joint is at a small diameter.\n\nAddition of\n\nthe field splice as shown adds approximately 300 pounds to the SRM nozzle.\nUnder consideration at the present time is the possibility of moving the field\njoint just aft of the compliance ring and incorporating the field joint with the nozzle\ncutoff device.\n\nThis concept has not been definitized to the point that weight data are\n\navailable.\nThe joint as shown is a technically feasible approach that has the advantage\nof being incorporated in the exit cone/main structure.\n\nIf other considerations make\n\nit desirable to move the field joint to incorporate it with the compliance ring, it is\nfelt that a feasible concept can be identified.\n\nIt is expected, however, that because\n\nof the larger diameter, the field joint weight penalty would increase.\n\nEvaluated from\n\na nozzle manufacturing point of view, the addition of a field joint presents no significant\nproblems.\n\n134\n\nDESIGN
