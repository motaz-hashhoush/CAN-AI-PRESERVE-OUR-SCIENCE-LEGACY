Routine\nand dependable access to Earth orbit\nprovided by the Shuttle makes a permanently\nmanned Space Station the next logical step\nin space.\n\nclock is ticking. The President set the deadline:\nDo it within a decade.\nThe assignment: Develop a permanently manned\nSpace Station.\nThe goal: Some 3,600 days from now\xe2\x80\x94give or take\na few dozen days\xe2\x80\x94the United States will possess a permanent human-built island in orbit on which men and\nwomen can live and work.\nThis Space Station is to be equipped to accommodate six to eight engineers, scientists, technicians or\nother specialists. Before they return to Earth after a\nfew months in orbit, their places will be taken and their\nwork continued by new crews\xe2\x80\x94men and women who\nhave gone into space to work.\nOnce the Station goes into operation early in the\n1990s, the Earth\'s space environment will never be\nwithout the presence of Americans.\nPresident Reagan stated the purpose: for peaceful\neconomic and scientific gain and for quantum leaps in\nresearch and technology.\nWhat will this Space Station be like? Why do we\nneed it? How will it be built? Why must we start work\non it now? What are the advantages and risks, the costs\nand side effects? What are the human, social and international implications? What does it mean to us? This\nbrochure provides some of the answers.\nThe Space Station is a vital part of our nation\'s\ninvestment in science and technology. The pace and\nquality of our progress in science and technology will\naffect the competitive strength of our industries and\nhave a strong impact on jobs and pay scales. These, in\nturn, will influence how well we live as individual\ncitizens and as a nation.\nAs we plan and build the U.S. permanently manned\nSpace Station, we are simultaneously helping to shape\npart of our nation\'s future.\n\nThe Concept\n\nA Permanent\nResearch and Work\nCenter in Orbit\n\nF\n\nrom short-duration missions as occasional visitors and\ncommuters we are about to start the transition to becoming year-round workers in space. Within a few years the\nUnited States will operate a permanent facility for human\nactivities of unlimited duration in orbit.\nAfter having launched astronauts on dozens of missions\nsince the beginning of U.S. manned space flight in 1961, our\nnation is about to develop a new capability in space.\nThis new system-a Space Station\xe2\x80\x94will be designed and\nbuilt in the next eight to ten years from sections, or modules,\nprefabricated on the Earth. These will then be transported to\norbit in the Shuttle\'s bus-size cargo bay. There, they will be\nunloaded and assembled by astronauts wearing space suits\nand propelling themselves with jet-powered backpacks.\nWhile orbiting at an altitude of about 250 miles, these\ncrews will use cranes and other tools designed especially for\nwork in space.\nModular Design Featured\n\n"To maximize the unique advantages provided by the environment of space, we need to\nestablish a permanent presence\nthat enables us to work in\nspace full time ... A Space\nStation is, I believe, the next\nlogical step in space."\nJames M. Beggs, NASA Administrator, at a hearing before\nthe Subcommittee on Space\nScience and Applications, U.S.\nHouse of Representatives,\nFebruary 1,\n\nOne module will be furnished as living quarters for from six\nto eight persons; another module\xe2\x80\x94or modules\xe2\x80\x94will be outfitted as a combination workshop and laboratory. Environmental conditions inside the modules, resembling the interior\nof a passenger airplane cabin, will enable crews to work in\nEarth-like shirt-sleeve surroundings.\nOther attached modules will carry utilities such as\npower generating machinery and still others will provide\nstorage space for supplies and equipment. The Station will\nbe self-sustaining for several weeks or even months. It will be\npartly independent from ground control. Crew members will\nhave considerable discretion in their use of the facilities and\nin scheduling and carrying out their work.\nSpace Station: Both Manned and Unmanned\nAttached outside the modules will be platforms called pallets\nfor automated and remote-controlled experiments and observation instruments. Other instruments will be carried on\nunattached free-flying platforms in separate orbits nearby.\nThese unmanned portions of the Space Station complex\nwill be important for experiments and observations requiring\nprotection from the contamination and vibrations which are\ninevitably present in an inhabited spacecraft. These platforms are also necessary for scientific instruments requiring\nextremely precise pointing. Though these unmanned instruments may not require continuous human supervision or\nintervention, the Space Station crew can get to them when\nnecessary for maintenance, adjustments, repairs and retrieval.\nAt intervals of several weeks, the Space Shuttle will\narrive at the Station to deliver a replacement crew and new\nsupplies. Some or all of the old crew members will then\nreturn to Earth in the Shuttle.\nVariety of Science Activities Planned\nAmong their numerous activities aboard the Station, crews\nwill carry out basic research in medicine, astronomy, space\nphysics and solar studies. They will conduct experiments in\n\nNASA Adntitii.itmtor.lames M.Beggs\niliscnssi\'s l/ic S/xict- Station itiitintirc ut ti\nWhite Home press conference shortly after\nIhc I\'n\'x\'uli\'iitiitl ilt\'risiun In t\xc2\xbb\'itci\'<\'il irith\n\nORIGINAL PAGE\nCOLOR PHOTOGRAPH\n\nORIGINAL PAGE\nCOLOR PHOTOGRAPH\n\nAstronaut Bruce McCandless perches on the\nelbow of the Space Shuttle\'s arm-like crane\ndevelopedfor the U.S. by Canada and known\nas the Remote Manipulator System (RMS).\nAstronaut McCandless demonstrated the\npracticality of crews working in space outside of the Shuttle. In the 1990\'s astronauts\nnut finely mil work outside the Space\nStation to maintain and repair satellites\nand assemble large space structures.\n\nEarth sciences and in many other scientific disciplines. The\ncrews will also work on technology experiments aimed at\ndeveloping products and services useful for industrial customers and consumers.\nSpecially trained crew members will make Earth resources observations. Others will check out and launch\nautomated spacecraft to higher orbits. Some crew members\nwill provide in-orbit maintenance, repair and retrofit services\nfor scientific and applications satellites.\nAn Evolutionary System\nFrom the beginning the Station will be designed for evolutionary growth. Additional modules could later be connected\nto the Station if larger crews and more equipment were\nneeded. Additional unmanned scientific platforms also could\nbe added. The modular building block design will give flexibility and allow expansion, change and versatility.\nModules, instruments and other components which\nhave become worn beyond cost-effective repairs or have\nbecome obsolete can be replaced.\nWith appropriate maintenance and replacements the\nStation can be kept inhabited and functioning well into the\nnext century.\nThe Space Station will be built using the most advanced\ntechnologies available. Once in operation, the Space Station\nwill become a spawning ground for innovation\xe2\x80\x94a nurturing\nplace for new technologies.\nA New National Laboratory\nOne of the Space Station\'s most crucial assignments will be to\nserve as a national laboratory. It is to be a center for the\ninception and development of the advanced technologies\nupon which our nation\'s economic and social well-being\ndepends in an increasingly competitive and sophisticated\nworld.\nThe intermittent visits of astronauts to Earth orbit will\nno longer suffice in the final years of this century, if our\nnation is to retain its hard-won preeminence in space.\nSustaining America\'s competitive technological edge, from\nwhich we derive our standard of living, requires continuing\nrenewal and advancement. The Space Station will help us do\nthis. It will become a key element in our nation\'s technological\ninvestment strategy as we approach the 21st century.\n\nThe Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsmile, Alabama, developed this Space Station\nconfiguration as part of the preliminary\nanalysis conducted by NASA in 1982-83. The\nconfiguration illustrates three of the key\nfunctions to be carried out by the Space\nStation: Scientific research\xe2\x80\x94the U-shaped\npallet, near the base of the vertical radiator\nsupports several scientific instruments\nincluding a large telescope.

Will it resemble the out-of-this-world science-fiction depictions of movies, newspapers and books?\nIt is like asking about next week\'s newspaper headlines.\nThe events they will describe have not yet happened. So too\nwith the Space Station. Detailed designs have not yet been\ncompleted. They will have to await the outcome of an\nextensive three-year NASA-industry study that is now\nunderway.\nNASA intends the Space Station to be customer-friendly.\nThis means it will be built to be as suitable and as adaptable\nas possible for the wide spectrum of tasks its many users\nwant to accomplish.\nIn April 1983 eight U.S. companies under contract with\nNASA completed investigations on the kinds of experiments and\nwork assignments the Space Station will need to accommodate.\nNASA is continuing these studies. NASA specialists are\npresently talking with representatives of aerospace and\nnon-aerospace industries, universities, private research centers and other government departments and agencies to learn\nmore about the work they want to do in space.\nUser Needs Shape Space Station Design\nThe results of these discussions and the outcome of the\nstudies will guide the Space Station\'s designers. Only after\nthe needs of the varied users have been clearly defined,\ncarefully analyzed and integrated into the Space Station\'s\ndesign will NASA give the go-ahead to industry to begin\nbuilding the components.\nThe preliminary studies offer pertinent clues about the\nStation\'s eventual configuration.\nThe Space Station must provide a suitable work environment for six to eight men and women. The Station will need\nample power supplies for research and operating equipment\nand for the life support systems. It will need modern data\nprocessing and communications systems. It will need at least\none docking port to which the Shuttle Orbiter can attach\nitself to deliver supplies and rotate crews.\n\nTliis Space Sttilion reference confiyumtioii\nkiinim us Ilif \xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2I\'nirer Tuirer"is be/Hi/ studied\ne.rtci/xireli/ by NASA an/1 its industrial and\niiileniiiliinial /mrtners.

Other modules of the same or\ndifferent size and shape will house power-generating equipment, supplies and reserve machines.\nProtruding like paddles from the sides of the modules,\nor from beams attached to the modules, will be rectangular\npanels covered with solar cells for power production. Other\npanels will contain radiators to dissipate excess heat, generated from Station operations, into the vacuum of space.\nAntennas of various sizes and shapes will extend from\nthe modules or the attached beams. Also extending from\nthese beams will be pallets on which will be mounted\nscientific instruments. The pallets and the free-flying platforms comprise the unmanned sections of the Space Station.\nA crew-controlled crane will unload the Orbiter\'s cargo\nbay. The crane will also assist astronauts to move equipment\nduring in-orbit construction work and in other exterior\noperations. The crane resembles a mechanical arm and hand\nand will likely be an advanced version of the Remote\nManipulator System (RMS) developed for use on the Shuttle\nby Canada.\nUnits to Form Unsymmetrical Cluster\nMost drawings and models of the Space Station depict an\nunsymmetrical cluster of modules, beams, panels, tunnels and\nantennas along with the associated unmanned scientific\nplatforms.

Culbertson, NASA\nA ssociate A dministratorfor\nSpace Station, August 1,198*t\n\nf it ever could be said that one plus one equals more than\ntwo, it would be true of the Space Shuttle plus the Space\nStation. Meant to complement each other, they will form a\nnatural partnership with exceptional combined abilities.\nThe Shuttle will provide reliable, economic, routine\nroundtrip transportation for crews and supplies between the\nEarth and orbit.\nThe Space Station will provide a suitable place where\ncrews can work in orbit for as long as needed.\nTogether, the Shuttle and the Space Station will\ncomprise a valuable national resource. They will contribute\nto virtually all major U.S. space projects\xe2\x80\x94manned and\nunmanned\xe2\x80\x94well into the next century. All manned U.S.\nspace operations\xe2\x80\x94explorations, research and services\xe2\x80\x94will\ntake place in or from the Shuttle or the Space Station. They\nwill be carrier and repair shop for numerous unmanned\nautomated experiments and observations.\nIn the beginning, the Shuttle will be the transportation\nfor the construction effort rather than a Space Station\npartner. The Shuttle\'s Orbiter will carry the Space Station\nmodules and other components into space and park them in\norbit. There, the Orbiter\'s crew will assemble the Space\nStation. A maneuvering arm or crane in the Orbiter\'s cargo\nbay will move floating modules and other components into\ndesired positions. The modules and components will be\njoined together by astronauts steering themselves like small\nhuman spacecraft with gas-powered backpacks called Manned\nManeuvering Units (MMUs). Assembling the station will require new tools and new techniques, and will add much to\nthe knowledge of space operations. The crane and MMUs\nhave already been tested during Shuttle flights in 1983 and\n1984.\nThe same or a similar crane and MMUs will be used by\nlater crews for maintenance work and repairs on the Space\nStation\xe2\x80\x94both its modules and science platforms\xe2\x80\x94and to add\nor exchange additional components.\nShuttle to Link Space Station and Earth\nVoice and data communications between the Space Station\nand the Earth will flow over conventional electronic channels,\ndirectly or via satellites. But the Space Station\'s only physical\nlink with the Earth will be the Shuttle\'s Orbiters. Serving and\ntending the Space Station will be among the Shuttle\'s prime\ntasks.\nAn Orbiter will perform as both a taxicab and a truck.\nFrom its launch site at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida\nthe Orbiter will ferry supplies and replacement crews to the\nSpace Station.\nThe Orbiter\'s flight crew\xe2\x80\x94a commander and pilot who\nare both career astronauts\xe2\x80\x94will guide the Space Shuttle to a\nrendezvous with the Space Station.\nAfter unloading the cargo and exchanging all or part of\nthe Space Station crew, the Orbiter will take on completed experiments and products manufactured aboard the Space Station. Then the Orbiter will leave the Station, reenter the atmosphere and glide to a landing on the Kennedy Center runway.\nBy the late 1990\'s Orbiter trips to and from the Space\nStation will have become commonplace\xe2\x80\x94no more noteworthy\n\n15\n\nORIGINAL PAGE\nCOLOR PHOTOGRAPH\nthan the departure and arrival today of ships and trains.\nThe headlines will be made, not by routine launches and\nlandings, but by research and other pioneer activities aboard\nthe Space Station.

Tasks that require\ninitiative and judgment are\nmore suitable for man. The\nSpace Station will have plenty\nof both kinds."\nJohn D. Hodge, Director,\nNASA Space Station Task Force\n\nT\n\nhe Space Station promises to become one of the most\npowerful investigative tools ever to come into use by\nscientists. Like the microscope and the computer and other\nmilestone research instruments, the Space Station will open\nnew windows in science.\nSpacecraft have already vastly expanded scientific frontiers in the last 25 years. They have revolutionized the\nancient discipline of astronomy. The ability to make observations from above the obscuring atmosphere and to use\nautomated and remote-controlled probes for close-up inspections of the planets and their moons has opened a new era of\nsolar system and cosmological exploration.\nPlanets which were pinpoints of light to the unaided eye\nand whose features were only dimly discernible with the best\ntelescopes have, in recent years, been seen and measured\nthrough space probes. To the spacecraft lens they appear as\ngiant worlds with characteristics peculiarly their own.\nAstronaut exposures to low gravity and other unique\nstresses in space have made possible fascinating studies in\nthe life sciences. The findings are providing valuable information in the fields of medicine and health sciences. Experiments\nin prolonged low gravity with many different materials are\ncontributing to a better understanding of metals processing,\nchemistry and the handling of fluids. The Earth sciences\nhave benefited from visual and electronic examinations of\nlands and oceans from the panoramic perspective available\nonly from space.\nA Permanent Presence In Space\n\nAstronauts at Work: George Nelson and\nJames van Ho/ten repair the Solar Mar\nsatellite in the cargo bay of the arbiter\nChallenger. The satellite was later redeployed\nand placed back in operation. Maintenance\nand repair like this can keep valuable\nscientific satellitesfunctioning for long\nperiods of time and will be an important\ntask for the Space Station.\n\nAll of this and more has been accomplished despite the\nlimitations past space exploration systems have imposed on\nresearchers. Experiments which may have taken years to\nprepare had to be compressed into a few days or hours if they\nrequired human participation in space. If they were unmanned automated experiments, they had to be failureproof, for once launched they were no longer accessible for\nmaintenance and repair.\nThe continuous presence of six to eight specialists in\n\nthe Span- Station will profoundly change the research\nenvironment.\nExperiments requiring on-site monitoring and adjustment over very long periods\xe2\x80\x94weeks or months or even\nyears\xe2\x80\x94can be operated without interruption in the Space\nStation. No longer do experiments need to be returned to\nEarth at the end of a mission and then prepared for re flights.\nIf an instrument generates doubtful or spurious data it can\nbe tested on-site by crew members who can then take\nimmediate corrective action based on their judgment and\nexperience. Because of the Space Station\'s size large quantities of support equipment and other resources can be kept\nt h e r e readily available to the crew.\nIf desired, the crew can consult with colleagues on the\nground using radio and television. Such exchanges, called\ninteract in- research, between scientists on the Earth and\nspecialists in space frequently took place during the first\nflight of Spacelab, the European-built orbital laboratory\nwhich operated aboard the Shuttle in 1983. Similarly, scientists on the Earth closely followed the excursions on the\nMoon by astronauts during Apollo missions in the late 1960s\nand early 1970s.\nAll experiments on board the Space Station can expect\nto benefit from the availability of crew members for maintenance, adjustment and repairs. Even the instruments on\nthe unmanned pallets and free Hying platforms can be\nreached when necessary, either by crew members wearing\nspace suits and MMl\'s. or in the case of the associated\nunmanned platforms by propelling the satellite back to the\nstation.\nManned and Automated Functions Planned\nThe advantages of having both manned and unmanned\nfacilities aboard a spacecraft have become obvious over the\nyears. Automated instruments can save substantial time and\nenergy for the crew. The specialists can then direct their\nattention to tasks which machines cannot perform. The value\nof a crew has been illustrated dramatically when unexpected\nevents have occurred.\nFor example, in the early 1970s a crew of three\nastronauts patched and mended some of the damaged portions of Skylab. The damage occurred after a mishap, during\nSkylab\'s unmanned launch. Skylab achieved orbit\xe2\x80\x94overheated, underpowered and uninhabitable. Subsequently, after extensive repairs, this crew and two other crews lived\nand worked successively in Skylab for periods of several\nweeks to nearly three months. They brought back a rich\nharvest of research results.\n:\n\nThis Voyager 2 picture of Saturn\'s rings\nshows color variations which may be due to\ndifferences in chemical composition.

The Space Telescope is designed for\non-orbit maintenance and repair. Such\nsatellite servicing will be a primary function\nof the Space Station.\n\nIn April 1984 a Shuttle crew retrieved and repaired the\nSolar Maximum Mission satellite, which was no longer able to\npoint its instruments precisely at the desired regions of the\nSun. The satellite got its name from its assignment to observe\nthe Sun during its most active period\xe2\x80\x94the solar maximum\xe2\x80\x94of\nSun spots and flares in the 11-year solar cycle. Shuttle\nastronauts replaced and repaired the craft\'s attitude control\nsystem and one of its scientific instruments while in orbit.\nSuch repairs in space cost far less than the replacement of\nthe entire satellite.\nSpace Telescope to Need Tending\nPeriodic maintenance will be essential for the orbiting Space\nTelescope to be launched by the Shuttle in 1986. That\ninstrument will be kept in operation for many years and will\nrequire occasional servicing by visiting astronauts.\nThe telescope will look back in time, viewing light\nradiations from the edge of the universe that have been\ntraveling at the speed of light for billions of years. Its optics\nwill see objects 50 times fainter than today\'s best astronomical instruments.\nWith its combination of manned and unmanned facilities,\nthe Space Station will unveil new opportunities for\nscientific experiments and explorations. To foster these\nopportunities is part of NASA\'s continuing commitment to\nthe advancement of science.\n\nThis view of the Sun\'s outer envelope, the\nsolar corona, was prepared from observations provided by the Solar Max satellite.\nThis satellite later malfunctioned and wo;\nrepaired by astronauts aboard the Space\nShuttle, confirming again the value of a\nhuman presence in space.\n\nCommerce\nin\nSpace\nORIGINAL PAGE\nCOLOR PHOTOGRAPH\n\nIndustry Setting Up\nShop in Space\n\ncommercial enterprise has\nin the\nAsizeable of space.

Many Americans are employed\ndesigning, building and operating communication satellites.\nThe number of these satellites is expected to increase more\nthan threefold from the present 80, to perhaps 300 in the\nnext 15 years.\nThe satellites are satisfying burgeoning global needs.\nThey are introducing instantaneous modern communications\nin remote areas of developing nations, where installing conventional services might have required decades. They are\naugmenting overloaded or outdated circuits in technologically\nadvanced nations, where new channels for modern data\ntransmissions are being provided.\nSatellite technology has come a long way since SCORE,\nthe world\'s first communications satellite, was launched by\nthe United States and began transmitting taped messages in\nDecember 1958. Today\'s satellites simultaneously carry thousands of two-way voice transmissions plus data and television channels. The ease and quality of transcontinental and\ntransoceanic telephone calls has improved. Costs to consumers have gone down or held firm even in inflationary times.\nThe communications satellite industry has dramatically demonstrated that private enterprise can work well in space.\n\n"With firm resolve and the\ncommitment of reasonable\nresources over a number of\nyears, Government and private\nenterprise working together\ncan turn space into an arena\nof immense benefit for our\nnation."\nL. J. Evans, Jr., Director,\nNASA Space Commercialization Task Force\n\nCompanies Seek Ventures in Space\n\nRepeated experiments in Apollo, Skylab and Shuttle flights\nhave shown that, amid prolonged minimal gravity, materials\ncan be imbued with unique and valuable properties unobtainable on the Earth. These made-in-space materials could make\npossible new kinds of medicines for fighting diseases, components for vastly improved electronic equipment and other\nproducts for profitable sale to industries and consumers.\nMarkets for such products could be immense both at home\nand abroad. New industries and service businesses may\ndevelop. New jobs and a strengthened posture for our nation\nin international commerce could follow.\nSpace is seen by many knowledgeable observers as the\nnext big industrial frontier. Potential foreign competitors are\nexperimenting in all areas of space commercialization.\nDespite this outlook private entrepreneurs have, until\nrecently, been reluctant to make large investments in space\nresearch. With the exception of the communication satellite\nbusiness and some other isolated projects, there have been\nfew large investments in the commercial use of space. Though\neventual payoffs seemed possible, the risks were considered\n\n"The infrastructure we will\nbuild will be no different than\nthose we established to meet\nthe great goals of earlier\nyears. We established publiclyfunded programs to support development of our highways,\nairports and railroads. The\nproposal to do the same for\nspace will enable the commercial sector to work in partnership with government to open\nthe realm of space to any number of promising enterprises."\nJames M.

Today,\nthere are signs that the situation is changing. Several companies have come to NASA to discuss possibilities for new\ncommerical ventures in space.\nDependable Space Access is Prime Need\nThe commercial utilization of space will depend upon the\navailability of regular, reliable, cost-effective access to orbit\nand a suitable place to work once there. It will depend also\nupon research and repair facilities being available to the\nprivate sector.\nDependable and relatively inexpensive roundtrip transportation to orbit is now becoming available with the Shuttle\nsystem approaching maturity. The Shuttle fleet of four Orbiters offers improved access to orbit for cargoes and crews.\nSome important commercial space manufacturing projects\nare expected to develop perhaps as early as the last half of\nthe 1980s.\nAvailability of a continuing work place in orbit, as well\nas availability of permanent maintenance and repair equipment there, must await the completion of the Space Station.\nThus, in the view of many, the Space Station holds the key\nto eventual large-scale commercial space operations.\n\nLarge structures in space become feasible\nwith a Space Station for the station enables\nsuch structures to be assembled and checked\nout in space. Shown here is an artist\'s\nconception of a solar power satellite.\n\nNASA Offers Joint Endeavor Agreements\nIn the meantime, to encourage and ease the entrance of\nprivate enterprise into commercial space activities, NASA\nhas offered to participate in Joint Endeavor Agreements\n(JEAs) with companies willing to invest in space research.\nUnder JEAs, NASA helps reduce the risks of investing in\nspace. Flight opportunities on the Shuttle can be provided\nat reduced rates. In addition, JEAs also allow these firms\naccess to relevant NASA research information and research\nfacilities and a limited exclusive private ownership of technologies developed by these firms through their own research.\nCurrent research under JEAs centers on the separation\nof biological substances in low gravity for the production of\nORIGINAL PAGE\nCOLOR PHOTOGRAPH\n\nLini/lsiit Imagery\xe2\x80\x94The diffirent I\'lu-n/n\nli\'ir/s I\'lttitti\'tl front thi\' rnriniis surfaces of\nthe Earth are measured intil then "i/irlured"\nby NOAA-operated L/nnlsai xntclliti\'x.\nCommercial operations of Kin-It .w/c////rs- is\nnun- iniilcr rrrii\'ir.

Among several dozen marketable\nitems that may emerge in the next several years are insulin\nand interferon with unprecedentedly high qualities. These\nand other medical products made in space may lend themselves to new approaches for fighting diabetes, cancer,\nemphysema, hemophilia and other diseases.\nResearch in low gravity with promising commercial\npossibilities has focused on the growth of crystals and\nelectronic- components with greater uniformity and purity\nthan can be produced on Earth. They may lend themselves to\nthe design of faster and more intelligent computers. These\nmay also lead to new kinds of communications systems for\nglobal dissemination of information and for enhancing educational systems.\nImproved Metal Alloys Sought\n\n77m- Space Station concept features twin\nsets of solar panelsfor the gem-ration of\npower iii/tl of radiators (the rectani/u/ar\nshapes perpendicular to tin- plane of the\nlarger solar panels)for the dissipation of\nwaste heat.

Still other experiments in the materials sciences\nexamine the possibilities of contamination-free containerless\nprocessing by allowing molten materials to float in a vacuum\nin zero-gravity without touching any container walls until\nthey are cooled and hardened.\nThe entrance of free enterprise into space follows our\nnational traditions. It also conforms to national policy.\nPresident Reagan, in restating the goals and objectives of the\nU.S. space program, has promised that the Federal Government will provide a climate conducive to expanded private\nsector investment and involvement in civil space activities.\nPrivate initiative has been the foundation of our nation\'s\ndevelopment and progress from its beginning. During the\nearliest explorations of the North American continent explorers and pioneers were followed by traders and craftsmen who\ncame to serve the new settlements. In the closing years of the\n20th century, industrial entrepreneurs will follow our astronauts into the newly accessible realm of space.\n\nORIGINAL PAGE\nCOLOR PHOTf\n\nIn this configuration the solar arrays that\nproride power to the Space Station unplaced atop a rigid T-shaped structure.\n< \'out nicrcial operations at the Station will\nrequire significant i/uan Hies of power.\n\nThis sequence of photographs shoics the\nSpace Sh little s \\orember 1982 deployment\nof Satellite Business System\'s communications satellite SHS-.i.

It was the natural outgrowth\nof the steady evolution of science and technology. Since then\nexploration of space and the development of space technology have continued with that same evolutionary advancement.\nEach generation of U.S. spacecraft has been technologically\nsuperior to earlier ones. Each expanded our abilities. Each\nadded to our proficiency for drawing dividends from the space\nenvironment. The Space Station continues that trend.\nIn the chain of development of the U.S. manned space\nprogram, the permanent Space Station will become the\nseventh type of space vehicle. It represents the next rung\non the ladder the United States must ascend if it is to retain\nits leadership among spacefaring nations.\nThe notion of a Space Station is not new or revolutionary.\nNor does it represent any sudden breakthrough. In the early\n1970s the United States achieved valuable experience with a\ntemporary space station called Skylab. The Soviet Union has\nfor several years operated several versions of a temporary,\nrelatively small space station called Salyut. Cosmonauts,\nliving and working in Salyut continuously for periods of up to\nseven months, have conducted scientific experiments and\nrepaired equipment.\nSpace Station\xe2\x80\x94A Step in Orderly Development\nThe concept for the permanent Space Station emerged from\nthe systematic progression of manned orbital activities\nstretching over a period of more than 23 years.\nU.S. manned space flights began in 1961 with the\none-man Mercury spacecraft. Next came the two-man Gemini\nspacecraft. It completed 10 flights within 20 months in 1965\nand 1966. Each crew\'s living space was only equal to the area\noccupied by a driver and a passenger in the front seat of a\ncompact car. Mercury astronauts had even less space. Still,\none Gemini crew managed to extend stay-time in orbit to\nwithin a few hours of two weeks, a world\'s record that stood\nfor 512 years.\nProject Gemini taught astronauts to steer their craft\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\ninto different orbits during flight so that they could rendezvous and dock with other spacecraft.\nThe third generation of U.S. manned space vehicles,\nApollo, was a three-man spacecraft primarily designed to\ntransport men to the Moon and back. It has about as much\nroom inside as a large station wagon or a small van.\nAstronauts could take off their space suits during flight and\nstand up and move around.\nFrom 1968 through 1972 the Apollo spacecraft coin\npleted two Earth-orbital flights (to test the system), three\naround-the-Moon flights and six highly successful manned\nMoon landing missions.\nAs part of the Apollo project engineers built a fourth kind\nof manned spacecraft, a space ferry called the Lunar Module,\nor LM (pronounced LEM). Its purpose was to transport two\nastronauts from the Apollo spacecraft in lunar orbit down to\nthe surface and then back. The odd shaped LM performed\nflawlessly in all of the manned Moon landings.\nThe Apollo system was also used in July 1975 for the\nApollo Soyuz program. The Apollo spacecraft linked in orbit\nwith a Soviet two-man Soyuz spacecraft. Using both craft, the\nfive men in the two crews carried out several joint scientific\nexperiments. They also visited each other by crawling through\na tunnel connecting the two spacecraft in history\'s first\ninternational manned space flight.\nSkylab: Our First Space Station\nApollo also became the transportation link with Skylab,\nAmerica\'s first space station, in 1973 and 1974. The 100-ton\nSkylab, as big as a small three-bedroom house, was by far the\nlargest U.S. spacecraft, though not designed to return to\nEarth intact.\nSkylab was a bonanza for scientists. The crews brought\nback with them nearly 300,000 photographs of the Sun as it\nhad never before been seen from above the atmosphere,\n40,000 pictures of the Earth and 230,000 feet of magnetictape containing Earth observation data from orbit.\nThe crews also brought back hundreds of blood samples\n\n"Exploration really is the essence of the human spirit, and\nto pause, to falter, to turn back\non the quest for knowledge is\nto perish."\nAstronaut Frank Borman,\nCommander of Apollo 8, the\nfirst flight by humans around\nthe Moon, in address to the\nU.S. Congress, January 9,\n1969,13 days after returning\nto Earth.\n\nThe Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas,\ndeveloped this Space Station configuration\nas part of the preliminary analysis that led\nto the President\'s decision to have NASA\nproceed with the development of a permanently manned Space Station.\n\nThe First Step: Project Mercury.

Engineers and\nother specialists learned what kinds of furnishings and\nfoods are most suitable for space stations; how humans can\nkeep fit by counteracting the adverse effects of the nearabsence of gravity; and how to best carry out scientific\nresearch and other work in this unaccustomed environment.\nAll of this experience will prove valuable for the design of\nthe Space Station.\nSupplying Skylab was difficult and expensive. Crews and\nmaterials had to be carried up to it and returned from it in\nthe relatively small Apollo spacecraft limited to one-time use.\nLike all spacecraft before the introduction of the Space\nShuttle in 1981, Apollo had to reenter the lower atmosphere\nsupported by parachutes, which further limited its weightcarrying abilities. These limitations were overcome with the\narrival of the Shuttle.\nThe Space Shuttle truly will become the space exploration equivalent of the covered wagons that helped pioneers\n\n6\n\nORIGINAL PAGE\nCOLOR PHOTOGRAPH\n\nSpldstitioirn.

The Shuttle\'s reusability, cargo\ncapacity, low-stress launches, highly sophisticated in-flight\nfacilities and smooth runway landings moved NASA space\noperations to their present maturity.\nIts present maximum stay-time in orbit of up to about\nnine days may well increase perhaps to two weeks. Even then\nthe Shuttle will still be in somewhat the same situation as\nthe office worker compelled to carry a desk and chair home\neach afternoon and then to return them to the office the\nnext morning. At present everything needed in orbit (except\nsatellites launched from the Shuttle or intercepted in orbit\nfor repair)\xe2\x80\x94must be carried into orbit on every flight and\nbrought back again, only to be launched all over again if\nneeded on another flight.\nA Permanent Presence in Space\nThe practicality and economics of having equipment in orbit\nfor as long as needed become obvious. With the outlook for\nlarger and heavier machines entering space for research and\ncommercial activities, the advantages of a Space Station\nbecome apparent. The period during which equipment will\n\nbe used in space will be determined by the needs of the\nexperiment rather than by the time available on a short\nmission.\nAdvantages also accrue to the unmanned space program.\nOn-orbit checkout of science or applications satellites before\ntheir release into orbit and the availability of in-space\nmaintenance and repair can substantially prolong their lives.\nIn solar system explorations, U.S. deep-space probes\nhave already made flyby and closeup inspections of each of\nthe five planets nearest the Earth. Spacecraft already en\nroute are expected to add two more plants (Uranus and\nNeptune) to that list in the next five years. If these\nspacecraft succeed, every planet, except Pluto, the smallest,\nwill have been visited by a U.S. flyby, orbiter or lander before\nthe end of the 1980s. Future planetary explorations will have\nthe advantage of prelaunch servicing at the Space Station.\nThe Space Station is the natural follow-on project in the\nmethodical and orderly progress of the United States space\nprogram. By pursuing the development of the Space Station\nnow our nation can help assure for itself a position of\nstrength in the international competition for the commercial,\ntechnological and scientific gains that space brings.\n\nAn International\nMagnet\n\nNations Working\nTogether\n\n"The Congress hereby declares\nthat it is the policy of the\nUnited States that activities in\nspace should be devoted to\npeaceful purposes for the\nbenefit of all mankind ...\n"The aeronautical and space\nactivities of the United States\nshall be conducted so as to\ncontribute materially t o . . .\ncooperation by the United\nStates with other nations and\ngroups of nations ..."\nFrom the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Act which\ncreated NASA in 1958 and\ncontinues to guide its policies\n\nT\n\nhe adage that many heads are better than one applies\nwell to international cooperation in space. Drawing on\nthe expertise and talents of many nations has often yielded\nbigger and better dividends for each participant\xe2\x80\x94greater\nrewards than if each nation had undertaken the same project\nindividually.\nThere are also more subtle advantages. Cooperation and\ncoordination prevents diversion of valuable resources in\nneedless duplication of efforts. Nations who might otherwise\nhave found themselves fierce competitors have worked\ntogether instead, toward common objectives. Individual nations have even been able to retain possession of jealously\nguarded inventions and technological know-how while cooperating with each other.\nSharing work, facilities, costs and research results with\nother nations has been a guiding principle of NASA\'s space\nprogram from its beginning. When the Congress established\nNASA in 1958 by enacting the National Aeronautics and\nSpace Act, it provided that space activities shall be conducted so as to contribute to cooperation by the United States\nwith other nations.\nSince then the United States has signed more than 1,000\nagreements with more than 100 nations for cooperative space\nactivities. NASA launch vehicles have carried satellites owned\nby other nations into orbit. Several nations have provided\nsites for NASA stations in the global network for satellite\ntracking and communications. Experiments built and owned\nby other nations or jointly owned with the United States\nhave been flown on NASA spacecraft. There have been extensive exchanges of space research information. And U.S.\nscientists have flown experiments on foreign spacecraft.\nInternational Cooperation In Space to Continue\nThis tradition of U.S. cooperation with other nations will\ncontinue with the Space Station. When President Reagan\ndirected NASA to build the Space Station in January 1984 he\nemphasized foreign contributions. We want our friends to\nhelp us meet these challenges and share in their benefits, said\n\n38\n\nilir I \'.S. flag and NASA insignia nntin I\'/i/hl/\'iiis of Hit 1 Kni\'iiiii\'ini S/ini-i\'Ai/i-i/i-i/\nih\'SA/ in this photograph <;/\'///(\xe2\x80\xa2. s/\xc2\xab/n\nSlnitlli\' < \'nliiniliiii s riifi/n /mi/ (liirint/ ///<\n//////// Sliiiltlcjliuht in \\nmtilin- /.\'AS\'./ Tins. irliiiii ini\'liiili\' tl/rJJni/si\niitilliiiix. iiri\' nlliirhi\'i! tn S\n/In- Kiirnjiniii Iniill scii\'Htr (mil tirhi/oloi///\n\nThis ciitairay illustration picturesSpacelab,\na multipurpose science and teclinuloi/i/\nliihoru/ort/.

Canada, France, Italy, Japan and West Germanyand separately the European Space Agency\xe2\x80\x94have each focused studies on what components they might want to\ndevelop for the U.S. Space Station and in what ways they may\nwant to use the Station\'s facilities once these become\navailable.\nCooperation In Space\n\nORIGINAL PAGE\nCOLOR PHOTOGRAPH\n\n10\n\nIn history\'s largest international space project, 10 European\nnations* working through the European Space Agency (ESA)\n\nMessage to NASA From the\nEuropean Space Agency\n"Your nation\'s historic decision to build a permanent\nSpace Station has created\ngreat interest on all sides.

We hope\nthat the Space Station will\nenhance the extensive transatlantic cooperation which has\nserved our peoples on both\ncontinents so well in the past."\nE. Quistgaard\nDirector General\nEuropean Space Agency\ndesigned, built and paid for Spacelab, the billion-dollar\nscience and technology laboratory which fits into the\nShuttle\'s cargo bay.\nFor the United States Spacelab became a valuable addilion for extending the Shuttle\'s research capabilities. For\nthe Europeans Spacelab provided an entry into manned\nspace flight without having to start a manned space\nprogram of their own.\nA West German physicist, Dr. Ulf Merbold, was a\nmember of the six-man crew during Spacelab\'s first flight\naboard the Shuttle in November 1983, and he became the\nfirst non-American to be launched into space aboard a U.S.\nspacecraft.\nAlso extending the Space Shuttle\'s capabilities was\nCanada which built the Remote Manipulator System. It has\n\nORIGINAL PAGE\nCOLOR PHOTOGRAPH\n\n"Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands,\nSpain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.\n\n;i\n\nperformed well in space, deploying payloads and capturing\nan orbiting satellite.\nThe same pattern of international cooperation is inherent in Italy\'s project to develop a satellite that is to be\nsuspended on a long tether from the Shuttle. The satellite\nand Space Shuttle will be tied to each other by a tether\nextending over distances up to 60 miles-for research in the\nupper atmosphere and the near-space environment.\nIn another international project, a satellite named IRAS\n(Infrared Astronomy Satellite) made a breakthrough discovery.\nIn August 1983, IRAS found the first evidence that there\nmay by another solar system in the universe. The satellite\'s\nelectronic eyes found that the star Vega, the fifth brightest in\nthe sky, is surrounded by solid objects of substantial size,\nperhaps planets. Until that discovery there was no clear\nevidence that any star except the Sun had solid satellites. If\nthe finding is confirmed by additional studies, it would\nstrengthen speculation that life may have evolved elsewhere\nin the universe.\nEven amid substantial cooperation between nations,\nvigorous, competition also exists in space. The European\nSpace Agency in addition to Spacelab also built Ariane, an\nunmanned launch vehicle. Ariane is now competing with the\nSpace Shuttle for the lucrative business of providing launch\nservices for communications satellites owned by other countries or by private firms. As modern space technology turns\nthe once hostile space environment into friendlier, more\nhospitable surroundings, both international cooperation and\ninternational competition in space appear to grow more\nintense.\nNASA Administrator James M. Beggs traveled to Europe\nand Japan in March 1984 to assess international interest in\nthe U.S. Space Station program. Early responses indicate the\nSpace Station will attract substantial international participation. Nations are likely to be drawn into the project because\nof the new possibilities for research, exploration and commercial applications.\n\nEngineers prepare the Infrared Astronomy Satellite (IRAS) for flight IRAS, a\ncooperative endeavor of the Netherlands,\nthe United Kingdom and the L\'.S.. icax\nlaunched on January 25,198-1 It mapped\n98 percent of the ski/ during its planned tenmonth mission, measuring the infrared\nemission and location of more than 250,000\nstars, galaxies and other celestial objects.\n\nAt the London Economic Sum mil in June\n1984 the President explained the Space\nStation initiative to leaders of other nations.\nMr. Reagan isshoim here discussing Hitinitiative with Prime Minister Thatcher of\nthe United Kingdom and Prime Minister\nNakasone of Japan.\n\nORIGINAL PAGE\nPHOTOGRAPH\n\nA widely-used, foreign-built piece of\nequipment used on the Space Shuttle is a\nU-shaped pallet like the one shown here\nbeing loaded with scientific instruments.\nSuch pallets, which fit into the Shuttle\'s\ncargo bay, were designed and manufactured\nin Europe.

Such cooperation is likely\nto continue in the Space Station era.\n\n\\:\\\n\nGateway to\nthe Future\n\nWhat the Space\nStation Means to\nAll of Us\n\nT\n\n"A bird is an instrument working according to mathematical\nlaw, which ... it is within the\ncapacity of man to reproduce."\nLeonardo da Vinci (1^521519), Italian artist, engineer,\nmathematician, and scientist\nand one of thefirst known\ntheoreticians on aeronautics.\n\n! \'\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nhe 20th century, which began with history\'s first flight of\na power-driven aircraft at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina,\nwill very likely end with the first truly permanent orbital\nhuman habitat firmly established in space.\nThe U.S. Space Station scheduled to begin operations in\nthe early 1990s can be expected to have profound economic,\nsocial and psychological ramifications. In the long run these\nmay become as pervasive in our lives as the explosive growth\nof aeronautics which began with that first flight more than\n80 years ago.\nThe Space Station project may appear less spectacular\nthan the flight at Kitty Hawk, Lindbergh\'s flight to Paris or\nthe landings on the Moon. But it represents an equally great\nsurge forward in the continuing quest to understand the laws\nand phenomena of nature and to put that knowledge to use\nfor common benefit.\nFor early crews their stay in the Space Station may\nresemble life on an offshore oil drilling platform or at an\nAntarctic research station. In their remote outpost in the\nsky, they will experience isolation and distance from conventional communities. In time, as Space Station activities continue year after year, work in space will become as familiar\nas work in our factories, shops, offices and homes on Earth.\nWith its unlimited life span and its continuous occupancy\nby successive crews, the Space Station will turn humankind\nfrom transients to residents of space.\nSpace Station: Living and Working in Space\nIn all U.S. manned space flights until now every moment of\nonboard activity from launch through landing was preprogrammed in a minute-by-minute timeline for each crew\nmember. No such precise preplanning of work and living\nactivities will be necessary for a small permanent space\ncommunity. Crews will have to use their own judgment in\nsetting priorities and arranging time schedules. Unexpected\nresearch results or repairs to a malfunctioning satellite and\nother unpredictable events will require crews to rely on their\nown initiatives and decision making.\nMost previous space flights have been dominated by\nonly one or a few major objectives\xe2\x80\x94landing on the Moon,\ntesting a new system, launching one or more satellites or\ncarrying out certain experiments. No single goal is likely to\ndominate the Space Station for long. Its crew members will\nbe specialists with widely different backgrounds, interests\nand assignments. The Station\'s versatility will make it\navailable for multiple functions.\nLike fishing trawlers and ocean oil rigs which gather\nfood and fuel from far-away places, the Space Station will\n\n.#*:\n\nORIGINAL PAGE\nCOLOR PHOTOGRAPH\n\nAs the Space Shuttle Columbia returns on\nitsfourth flight\xe2\x80\x94on July 4,1982\xe2\x80\x94President\nand Mrtf.

This would be true also for future industries whose\nproducts will depend upon alloys or electronic components\nobtainable only in prolonged minimal gravity.\nSpace Station: Looking to the Future\nIn time, the Space Station may cause us to adjust our point of\nview so that we will look on these Earth-orbiting regions as\nintegral parts of the Earth, like newly-found continents or\noceans.\nBy then\xe2\x80\x94perhaps in the late 1990s\xe2\x80\x94commercial manufacturing activities in orbit may have outgrown the original\nSpace Station. Modules especially designed to meet the\nprecise needs of these commercial enterprises will have been\nadded. Similarly, scientific research and applications needs\nwill have expanded so that dedicated modules will have been\nadded to satisfy these requirements.\nBy that time the Space Station could be in the process of\nbecoming a staging and launch base for manned voyages to\nthe Moon, Mars and asteroids. Expeditions to these remote\ndestinations can best be started from the Space Station\nrather than from Earth. By assembling the spacecraft in orbit\nand launching it there, it will not need to be equipped for a\nstrenuous passage through the Earth\'s atmosphere. Instead,\nit can be constructed entirely for use in the vacuum of space\nwith resulting economies and design advantages.\nThe Space Station with its added specialized modules\nfor new functions and activities can become an important\nlegacy of this generation to the 21st century.\n\n;:\n\nThese two sets of illustrations highlight a\nprincipalfeature of the Space Station: that\nit can trolri1 in size ami capability nrer\ntime. The Space Station to be operational in\nthe early 1990s will be limited in scope\nbut, regardless qf the configuration finally\nselected, will be able to be increased in size\nand capability. "Scaling-Up\'the initial\nStation, that is building in the ability to\ngrow, is a difficult but essential engineering\ntask.\n\nSpace Station: A Symbol For America\n\nORIGINAL PAGE\nCOLOR PHOTOGRAPH\n\n48\n\nLike earlier NASA space projects, the permanent Space\nStation will be a source of national pride. It will be a peaceful\nsymbol of America\'s strength and resolve. It will kindle\ntechnological innovation, imagination and creativity. It will\ninspire our young men and women toward greater achievements, encouraging many of them to seek careers in science\nand technology.\nIf the U.S. Space Station is ready to begin work in the\nearly 1990s as is now expected, the beginning of a permanent\nhuman presence in space would come about 30 years after\nAlan B. Shepard, Jr., became the first American in space w i t h\na 15-minute suborbital flight (on May 5, 1961); some 65 years\nafter propulsion pioneer Dr. Robert H. Goddard launched the\nworld\'s first liquid-fuel rocket (on March 16,1926); and about 90\nyears after Orville and Wilbur Wright achieved sustained\nflight with a power-driven aircraft (December 17,1903).\nAmerica\'s permanently manned Space Station will become operational at about the time of the 500th anniversary\nof the discover}\' of the .New World. That discovery by\nChristopher Columbus and his crew in 1492 led to colossal\nchanges for humankind. In the long sweep of history, the\nSpace Station may do as much.\n\nORIGINAL PAGE\nCOLOR PHOTOGRAPh\n\n49\n\nORIGINAL PAGE\nCCILOR PHOTOGRAPI"The success of the Space\nShuttle and the advent of the\nSpace Station focus our attention upon a basic question:\nWhy do we have a civil space\nprogram? Why do we concern\nourselves with rockets and\nsatellites? My own view is that\nwe have a space program not\nbecause of the excitement the\nprogram engenders and certainly not because the Russians\nhave one. You have a space\nprogram because there are\nthings you can do in space that\nyou can\'t do on the ground.\nWhat things?
